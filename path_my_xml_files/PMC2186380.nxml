<italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria remains a major global killer, especially of infants and children, and a serious threat to travelers. A safe and effective malaria vaccine used in conjunction with other control measures would be a huge boon to the health and economies of malaria-endemic countries. In recent clinical trials, RTS,S/AS02, a recombinant subunit protein malaria vaccine designed to block infection, demonstrated 35&#x00025; efficacy against uncomplicated malaria and 49&#x00025; efficacy against severe malaria for at least 18 months in young children and 66&#x00025; efficacy against <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection in infants <xref rid="pone.0001465-Alonso1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001465-Aponte1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Approaches to improve on this efficacy include building multi-stage, multi-antigen vaccines <xref rid="pone.0001465-Heppner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, combination with a viral vector <xref rid="pone.0001465-Stewart1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> and developing more-effective single antigen or live attenuated vaccines <xref rid="pone.0001465-Ripley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Luke1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>.</p><p>Apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) is a 83-kilodalton surface protein that is expressed by mature intra-erythrocytic malaria parasites and processed to a 66-kilodalton protein before being exported to the merozoite surface around the time of rupture of the infected erythrocyte <xref rid="pone.0001465-Narum1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

A vaccine that boosts levels of anti-AMA-1 antibodies might therefore reduce the risk that malaria infection will cause clinical disease.</p><p>AMA-1 is highly polymorphic <xref rid="pone.0001465-Escalante1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Cortes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Polymorphisms in AMA-1 allow the parasite to evade antibody-mediated inhibition of invasion in vitro <xref rid="pone.0001465-Healer1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and sera from rabbits immunized with different forms of AMA-1 showed limited cross-protection, with the level of inhibition inversely related to the number of amino acid differences between parasite strains <xref rid="pone.0001465-Hodder1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Kennedy1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Kocken2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. The relevance, if any, of these in vitro and animal studies for allele-specific efficacy of AMA-1 vaccines in humans is unknown. Presently three AMA-1-based adjuvanted protein vaccines are being evaluated in clinical trials in Mali, including two different monovalent vaccines based on AMA-1 derived from the 3D7 and FVO clones of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, respectively, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Kocken2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>and a bivalent vaccine that includes both of these versions of AMA-1 <xref rid="pone.0001465-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Falciparum Malaria Protein 2.1 (FMP2.1) is a recombinant AMA-1 from the 3D7 clone of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> that is produced in and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0001465-Dutta2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Together with the AS02A adjuvant system, an oil-in-water emulsion with the immunostimulants monophosphoryl lipid A and QS 21, it constitutes the FMP2.1/AS02A malaria vaccine. This vaccine has been evaluated in a Phase 1 dose escalation clinical trial in malaria-naive North American adults <xref rid="pone.0001465-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The vaccine was well tolerated and strongly immunogenic, inducing both humoral and cellular immune responses. Vaccine-induced antibodies also inhibited parasite growth and interfered with antigen processing in vitro. Because previous exposure to malaria may affect the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of malaria vaccines, we conducted a Phase 1 dose escalation trial of this vaccine in malaria-experienced adults in Mali. A cell-culture rabies virus vaccine was used as a comparator to help distinguish vaccine-induced immune responses from natural background immunity. This study was the first evaluation of FMP2.1/AS02A in a malaria-experienced population and the antecedent to Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials of this vaccine in children that are now in progress at this site.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001465.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001465.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Setting</title><p>The study was conducted at the Bandiagara Malaria Project research clinic adjacent to the district hospital in Bandiagara, a rural town of 13,634 inhabitants in the Dogon Country in northeast Mali.

Older children and adults are relatively protected against malaria disease but remain susceptible to malaria infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>After obtaining community permission as described by Diallo et al. <xref rid="pone.0001465-Diallo1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, the trial was publicized by local radio broadcast. Men and women aged 18 to 55 years were invited to the research clinic to be screened for eligibility. Participants were included if they had resided in Bandiagara for at least 12 months, gave written informed consent, and, if female, declared their intent not to become pregnant during the first 3 months of the study (up to one month following the third immunization). Exclusion criteria included: current illness as indicated by history, examination and/or laboratory testing, previous immunization with a rabies vaccine or any experimental vaccine, recent use of immunosuppressants, receipt of blood products during the previous 6 months, pregnancy or breast-feeding, alcohol or drug abuse, and allergy to substances present in the vaccines.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>Ethical compliance</title><p>The trial was conducted in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices, the Declaration of Helsinki and regulatory requirements of Mali. The protocol was approved by institutional review boards of the University of Bamako Faculty of Medicine, University of Maryland Baltimore, and the U.S. Army Surgeon General. Separate written informed consent was obtained for screening and for enrollment. Consent of illiterate participants was documented by their thumbprints and by signatures of independent witnesses. Permission to import and administer the investigational products in Mali was granted by the Republic of Mali Ministry of Health. The trial was monitored by the United States Army Medical Materiel Development Activity and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases/Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><p>The FMP2.1 antigen (Lot 0971) is comprised of amino acids #83-531 corresponding to the ectodomain of AMA-1 derived from the 3D7 clone of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

<xref rid="pone.0001465-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Soltysik1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. AS02A was manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals (Rixensart, Belgium) according to current Good Manufacturing Practices P and provided in pre-filled syringes. The whole content of each FMP2.1 vial was dissolved in the whole content of a separate 0.62 mL vial of AS02A immediately before injection. The RabAvert rabies vaccine (Chiron Corporation, Emeryville, California, United States) is a sterile freeze-dried vaccine obtained by growing the fixed-virus strain Flury LEP in primary cultures of chicken fibroblasts. It is supplied in pre-filled syringes containing lyophilized antigen to which 1 mL of sterile water was added as a diluent before injection. All vaccines were administered by intramuscular injection in the left deltoid muscle.</p><p>Sixty adults were sequentially assigned to 2 cohorts of 30. Within each cohort, participants were randomized in a 2&#x02236;1 fashion to receive FMP2.1/AS02A or rabies vaccine. After reconstitution, the dose of FMP2.1/AS02A was approximately 25 &#x000b5;g of FMP2.1 in a final volume of 0.25 mL AS02A in Cohort 1 (half dose), and approximately 50 &#x000b5;g FMP2.1 in a final volume of 0.5 mL in Cohort 2 (full dose). Vaccines were given on a 0-, 1- and 2-mo schedule. The first vaccination was given in early December 2004 at the end of the malaria transmission season; the second and the third doses were given in January and February 2005, when virtually no malaria transmission occurs at this site. Study day 90 was in March 2005, at the nadir of malaria transmission, study day 180 was at the beginning of the malaria season, and study day 272 was in September, at the peak of malaria transmission intensity. The final study follow-up on day 364 coincided with the end of the 2005 malaria season. The cohorts were immunized in a staggered fashion to permit interim safety analyses; each successive immunization of Cohort 1 was followed in approximately 3 wk by the corresponding immunization of Cohort 2. Three interim safety analyses were reviewed by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee, which provided written recommendations to proceed before each of the three immunizations of Cohort 2 with the full dose of FMP2.1/AS02A.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 3 injections of 2 different dose levels of the malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A in malaria-experienced Malian adults. Secondary objectives were to measure the magnitude and duration of antibody responses to FMP2.1, and exploratory objectives included measuring vaccine-induced cellular immune responses at baseline and after immunization (results to be presented elsewhere); and measuring the inhibition of parasite growth by in vitro growth inhibition assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome was safety, measured as 1) occurrence of solicited symptoms during an 8-day follow-up period after immunization (day of immunization and days 1, 2, 3 and 7 after immunization); 2) occurrence of unsolicited symptoms during a 31-day follow-up period after immunization (day of immunization and 30 subsequent days); 3) occurrence of laboratory toxicities during the study period; and 4) occurrence of serious adverse events during the study period. Secondary outcomes were anti-AMA-1 antibody titers measured against recombinant 3D7 AMA-1 and at baseline and at specified times during and after immunization. Serum inhibition of parasite growth in vitro was an exploratory outcome.</p><sec id="s2e1"><title>Assessment of safety and tolerability</title><p>Following each immunization, participants were directly observed for 30 minutes, then evaluated at the study clinic 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 days after each immunization and on study days 90, 180, 272 and 364. Starting on day 120, monthly home visits were made to check the health status of participants and to encourage them to come to the research clinic if they felt ill. Study physicians were available at the research clinic at all times throughout the 12-month study to assess and treat adverse events.</p><p>Clinical evaluations consisted of measurement of vital signs and assessment for local injection site and general solicited signs or symptoms. Local signs and solicited symptoms included pain, swelling, erythema at the injection site and limitation of arm abduction at the shoulder. General signs and solicited symptoms included fever (oral temperature&#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C), chills, nausea, headache, malaise, myalgia and joint pain. Any other signs or symptoms were considered to be unsolicited, as were all signs or symptoms that occurred more than 7 days after immunization. Solicited symptoms were considered to be related to the study vaccines. Unsolicited signs and symptoms were recorded during the 30 days after each immunization, whereas serious adverse events and pregnancies were monitored throughout the 12-month study.</p><p>Blood was collected at screening, on immunization days, 7 and 14 days after each immunization and on study days 90, 180, 272 and 364 to determine complete blood count, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and serum creatinine.</p><p>Adverse events were graded by severity and judged for relatedness to study vaccines. Grade 1 adverse events were easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with daily activities. Grade 2 adverse events were sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal activities. Grade 3 adverse events prevented normal daily activities. Swelling, erythema, fever and limitation of arm motion had specific definitions not based on interference with daily activities. Injection site swelling and erythema were graded based on their widest dimension: Grade 1, &#x0003e;0 to 20 mm; Grade 2, &#x0003e;20 to 50 mm; and Grade 3, &#x0003e;50 mm. Fever was classified as Grade 3 if the oral temperature was &#x02265;39&#x000b0;C whereas Grade 3 limitation of arm motion was classified as abduction limited to 30&#x000b0;. For laboratory tests, toxicity grading was adapted to normal reference ranges determined for the local adult population.</p></sec><sec id="s2e2"><title>Antibody responses to AMA-1</title><p>Antibody responses to AMA-1 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) <xref rid="pone.0001465-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[21,21]</xref>.

This Phase 1 trial was thus not powered to detect differences between groups and where comparative statistics for the safety variables were computed, the study had power to detect only large differences in the incidence of local and general side effects between the vaccination groups. Incorporation of a comparator vaccine group of 20 permitted broad initial estimates of the incidence of local and general side effects and of immune responses among vaccine recipients.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Randomization&#x02014;Sequence generation</title><p>Within the two cohorts, individual participants were randomized in a 2&#x02236;1 ratio to receive either FMP2.1/AS02A (half dose in Cohort 1 and full dose in Cohort 2) or rabies vaccine. The randomization sequence was generated by a computer program using blocks of three to ensure a 2&#x02236;1 ratio of vaccine allocation. Randomly generated sequential codes linked each study number to a vaccine assignment (FMP2.1/AS02A or rabies vaccine).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Randomization&#x02014;Allocation concealment</title><p>The randomization sequence was provided by the study statistician consultant in an opaque sealed envelope to the study pharmacists. In addition the local safety monitor was provided with a sealed envelope to be opened if it was deemed necessary to determine urgently the intervention a participant had received; no such emergency unblinding occurred. The only people at the study site with access to the randomization codes during the study were 2 study pharmacists, who had no contact with study participants and did not reveal vaccine assignments to anyone else. Study participants and investigators who assessed outcomes were blinded to vaccine assignment.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Randomization&#x02014;Implementation</title><p>Clinical investigators assigned study numbers to participants of each group in the order in which they arrived at the clinic on the first day of immunization. At the time of the first immunization, study pharmacists opened the sealed envelopes containing the vaccine assignment and prepared the vaccine to be administered to the respective study participant. The vaccine and dose assigned during the first immunization were maintained for second and third immunizations. The study pharmacists prepared the vaccines in a special room with access strictly limited to them and to study monitors. Syringes containing the prepared vaccines were passed through small sliding doors from the vaccine preparation room to separate vaccine administration rooms, where the immunizations were administered.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Blinding</title><p>The reconstituted rabies vaccine was a clear to slightly opaque, colorless suspension of 1 mL volume, while FMP2.1/AS02A was off-white and either 0.25 or 0.5 mL in volume. Syringes containing vaccines were covered with opaque tape to conceal their content from participants and immunizers. The study pharmacists, who were unblinded, had no study-related contact with participants and were not involved in outcome assessment. Because of the difference in volumes, the immunizers could potentially have deduced which vaccine was given to a specific participant, and therefore they did not participate in other study procedures. The presence of both study pharmacists and immunizers at the site was limited to the periods during which immunizations were given, and these individuals were instructed not to discuss vaccine allocation with other study staff.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Adverse event rates were analyzed using SPSS version 11.1 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, United States). Fisher's exact test was used to compare rates between vaccine groups. Confidence intervals for geometric mean AMA-1 antibody titers were estimated by using log<sub>10</sub>-transformed values, calculating the 95&#x00025; confidence interval based on the normal distribution, and then converting the limits to the original scale for presentation. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test was used to evaluate vaccine effects on parasite growth inhibition on paired samples from study days 0 and 74, for each study group. The differences in mean parasite growth inhibition for the three study groups on study day 74 was evaluated by using a One Way ANOVA and adjusted for multiple comparisons using Tukey's post test on pairwise comparisons using Jandel SigmaStat version 2.0 (Corte Madera, CA, United States). For longitudinal analysis of antibody responses, log-transformed antibody titers were modeled using mixed spline models to determine the effect of vaccine dose on mean antibody levels over time using SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC, United States). The spline models consisted of a linear function joined to a quadratic function at study day 74. A spatial exponential covariance structure was used to model the correlation between measurements from the same individual taking into account the number of study days between each measurement. Point estimates and confidence intervals for each time point were generated based on the fitted longitudinal model, using the ESTIMATE statement in the MIXED procedure in SAS. All tests were 2-sided, and no correction of <italic>p</italic>-values was made for additional analyses. Given the large number of statistical tests performed and the small sample size, the <italic>p</italic>-values have limited probabilistic interpretation. Safety and immunogenicity analyses were based on intention-to-treat, such that all available data were included in analyses including partial data from 2 participants who were subsequently lost to follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Participant flow</title><p>One hundred and seventy five persons were screened, and 60 who fulfilled the criteria for inclusion were enrolled in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001465-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

After enrollment, one participant traveled outside the study area two days after his second immunization and missed all subsequent visits, and one participant missed the final study visit on day 364 due to travel. Three participants temporarily left the study area to attend a professional meeting, and missed only their study day 63 clinic visits. All of these participants received all 3 doses of vaccine.

Both the full dose and a half dose of the malaria vaccine had acceptable tolerability. Local reactions were more frequent in both malaria vaccine groups than in the comparator group. Pain and/or swelling at the injection site were experienced by most recipients of the malaria vaccine. Although swelling was often classified as Grade 3 based on the size of the reaction (&#x0003e;50 mm), these episodes of swelling were short-lived and were usually unnoticed by participants. No participants were withdrawn from the study because of adverse events with the exception of one individual who had a transient high elevation of ALT temporally related to immunization but thought likely to be due to ingestion of a drug with known liver toxicity. No serious adverse events were observed. Three pregnancies occurred, one resulting in a healthy male child who died at the age of one year of an undiagnosed illness thought to be consistent with tetanus, and two in one participant that were terminated by elective abortion.</p><p>The malaria vaccine elicited high levels of antibodies recognizing the vaccine antigen. Differences in antibody levels between the two malaria vaccine groups, and between malaria vaccine and rabies vaccine comparator groups at time points 4 mo or longer after the last immunization, were not statistically significant when analyzed using point-wise comparisons. However, longitudinal analyses demonstrated that the malaria vaccine full-dose group had significantly higher antibody responses than the rabies vaccine comparator group from 1 mo after the first immunization through the end of the 1 y study period, and the malaria vaccine half-dose group had higher antibody responses than the comparator group from 2 wk after the second immunization through 7 mo after the third immunization. Longitudinal analyses also suggested a dose-related antibody response with a trend toward higher responses in the full-dose group compared to the half-dose malaria vaccine group. Moreover, post-immunization sera from the full-dose group, but not the half-dose group, had significantly greater growth inhibition activity than sera from the comparator group against both homologous and heterologous parasites. Based on these data, the more immunogenic full dose of the vaccine (FMP2.1 50 &#x000b5;g in 0.5 mL AS02A) was selected for further clinical development. This vaccine is presently undergoing evaluation in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials in children at this site.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The safety and tolerability profile of the FMP2.1/AS02A vaccine was similar to that seen in a previous trial of this vaccine in North American malaria-na&#x000ef;ve volunteers <xref rid="pone.0001465-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and in trials of a similar recombinant protein blood-stage malaria vaccine with the same adjuvant in this and other African populations <xref rid="pone.0001465-Thera1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Withers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>While baseline antibody titers of AMA-1 antibodies were higher in this malaria-experienced population than in malaria-na&#x000ef;ve North American volunteers <xref rid="pone.0001465-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, post-immunization titers were of a similar magnitude. Although antibody responses in a recent Phase 1 trial of another AMA-1 vaccine using Alhydrogel as an adjuvant <xref rid="pone.0001465-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> were measured using different methods than those used to measure responses to FMP2.1/AS02A, the FMP2.1/AS02A vaccine induced more uniformly robust responses (with 100&#x00025; of malaria-na&#x000ef;ve and malaria-experienced vaccine recipients showing an increase in antibody titer), possibly due to use of the more potent adjuvant system. In addition to inducing high ELISA activity, the antibodies to FMP2.1/AS02A vaccine induced a moderate level of growth inhibitory activity against parasites expressing both homologous and heterologous AMA-1 <xref rid="pone.0001465-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although a higher degree of background growth inhibition was observed using sera from malaria-experienced adults, immunization with 50 &#x000b5;g of FMP2.1/AS02A induced measurably higher inhibitory antibodies against both homologous and heterologous parasite strains than did the 25 &#x000b5;g FMP2.1/AS02A dose. Interestingly, responses measured against the FVO parasites were significantly higher than baseline at the post third immunization sampling for the rabies controls, suggesting a possible exposure during the study period to parasites similar to FVO with respect to AMA-1 and/or other antigens capable of stimulating allele-specific growth inhibition.</p><p>Although these results are promising, until a blood-stage malaria vaccine demonstrates clinical efficacy, immune correlates of vaccine-induced protection and the choice of immunogenicity endpoints for clinical development decisions will remain a matter of reasoned conjecture.</p><p>
<italic>P. falciparum</italic> AMA-1 is extremely polymorphic, with more than 100 polymorphic amino acid sites, and in vitro experiments and studies in both animals and humans have indicated some degree of allele-specificity in the antibody responses to genetically different forms of AMA-1 <xref rid="pone.0001465-Hodder1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0001465-Cortes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0001465-Polhemus1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. The FMP2.1/AS02A vaccine is based on AMA-1 sequence from the 3D7 clone of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. Other AMA-1-based vaccines are being developed based on AMA-1 sequence from the FVO clone <xref rid="pone.0001465-Kocken2" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and from both 3D7 and FVO <xref rid="pone.0001465-Malkin1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. If immunity elicited by an AMA-1 vaccine is allele-specific, then initial vaccine efficacy may depend on the degree of homology at key amino acid residues between the vaccine antigen and AMA-1 in parasites circulating at vaccine trial sites. Moreover, vaccination may result in directional selection favoring AMA-1 alleles that are different from those targeted by the vaccine, resulting in reduced efficacy over time. As this and other AMA-1-based vaccines progress to trials measuring clinical efficacy, it will be important to measure allele-specific efficacy and to identify which specific polymorphisms or sets of polymorphisms are under selection by vaccine-induced immune responses. In the likely event that the genetic diversity of AMA-1 in natural populations of malaria parasites restricts the efficacy of AMA-1 vaccines, it may be necessary to construct a polyvalent and/or chimeric vaccine <xref rid="pone.0001465-Dutta3" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> based on detailed molecular epidemiological and molecular evolutionary analyses of vaccine efficacy and selection in early efficacy trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall evidence</title><p>Based on its good safety profile, acceptable tolerability, and robust antibody responses, the AMA-1-based malaria vaccine FMP2.1/AS02A is being evaluated in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials in children aged 1&#x02013;6 years at the Bandiagara Malaria Project in Mali. If the results of these trials are promising, the development pathway for this vaccine could include incorporating the FMP2.1 antigen as one component of a multi-stage, multi-antigen malaria vaccine in combination with RTS,S <xref rid="pone.0001465-Heppner1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, improved adjuvant formulations <xref rid="pone.0001465-Stewart2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and/or separate development as a disease-blocking vaccine for use in targeted populations in high malaria transmission areas. As AMA-1 malaria vaccines move into efficacy trials, the impact of genetic diversity on malaria vaccine efficacy is likely to emerge as a critical problem requiring integration of methods and concepts drawn from molecular epidemiology, molecular evolution, immunology and structural vaccinology.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001465.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT checklist</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001465.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001465.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial protocol</p><p>(0.62 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001465.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Abdi Naficy and Lee Hall of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for support and advice; Hamar A.
