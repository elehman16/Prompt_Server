Calves are more sensitive to
fluid loss than adult cattle because they have higher total body water content and higher extracellular fluid volume than adults. Regardless of pathogen or mechanism involved, diarrhea increases the loss of electrolytes and water in
feces and decreases milk intake [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, diarrhea leads to overall loss of not only electrolytes and water, but also decreases absorption of carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids in
calves [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As a result, calves experience acute symptoms of dehydration and metabolic acidosis, which gradually leads to chronic exhaustion and negative energy balance. Negative energy balance
continues during the diarrhea period [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to correct dehydration and metabolic acidosis, in order to prevent exhaustion long-term.</p><p>Diarrhea is the most common indication for fluid therapy in neonatal calves. Oral electrolyte solutions (OES) have classically been used to replace fluid losses, correct acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities, and provide
nutritional support because OES are inexpensive and easy to administer on the farm [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. OES can be categorized by high or low sodium and glucose concentration, by an agent (glucose, acetate,
citrate, or glycine) that facilitates absorption of sodium and water from the intestine, or by an alkalinizing agent (acetate, citrate, or bicarbonate) to correct metabolic acidosis and osmolarity [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Because sodium is the principal determinant of the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, it must be present in an OES to correct dehydration. Glucose is necessary to facilitate sodium absorption and provide an energy source
for the diarrheic calves. The ideal ratio of glucose (along with glycine, if present) to sodium in OES is between 1:1 and 3:1 [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Commercially available OES with low (1:1) and high (3:1) glucose
plus glycine ratios in the Japanese market are Calf-Lyte S (CF; Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Fukushima, Japan) and Salaron (SL; Fujita Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), respectively. However, the effect of different
compositions of commercially available OES in Japan for diarrheic calves is poorly understood. Therefore, the present study was designed to test how differences in the composition of commercially available OES affect dehydration and
prevent catabolism. In addition, we prepared two prototype OES to further evaluate differences in OES composition. Prototype OES based on CF were prepared by doubling the glucose amount (CFG) or by doubling both glucose and glycine
(CFGG). The goals of oral fluid therapy are to replace fluid and acid-base deficits and to provide nutritional support [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this study, dehydration correction, the alkalizing effect, and
prevention of catabolism were measured.</p><p>All procedures were in accordance with the National Research Council Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Academy Press, 1996). Two commercially available OES, CF and SL, and two prototype OES were used. In
one prototype OES (CFG), glucose was added to CF. In the other prototype OES (CFGG) glycine was added to CFG. Because of these adjustments, CFG contained glucose, but not glycine, equal to that of SL. CFGG contained glucose and
glycine equal to that of SL. The ratio of glucose plus glycine to sodium in CF, CFG, CFGG and SL was 1.1:1, 1.7:1, 2.3:1 and 3.1:1, respectively. <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Composition of the CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL used in this study</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" align="left" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Na<sup>+</sup></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glucose</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glycine</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Acetate</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Citrate<sup>3&#x02013;</sup></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Osmolality</th><th rowspan="2" align="center" colspan="1">The ratio of glucose plus glycine to sodium</th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(mM)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(mM)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(mM)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(mM)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(mM)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(mOsmol/<italic>l</italic>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CF</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">359.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.1 : 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CFG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">116.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">396.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7 : 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CFGG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">116.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">110.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">454.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.3 : 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SL</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">116.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">110.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>-</bold></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">441.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.1 : 1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>CF: Calf-Lyte, CFG: Calf-Lyte + Glucose, CFGG: Calf-Lyte + Glucose + Glycine, SL: Salaron.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap> shows the compositions of the four OES used.</p><p>Twenty-nine Holstein and three filial first-generation Japanese Black, 10.4 &#x000b1; 3.7 days old were enrolled. In these calves, veterinary practitioners detected mild dehydration such that parenteral fluid therapy was not necessary, but
moderate diarrhea was present based on physical examination. Blood gas analysis (i-STAT 1, Abbott Lab., Princeton, IL, U.S.A.) was performed on each calf. In 17 of the 32 calves (53.1%), <italic>Cryptosporidium parvum</italic>
(<italic>C. parvum</italic>) was detected using a <italic>C. parvum</italic> rapid test kit (BOX-BIOK-155-10TEST, COSMO BIO Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Calves were randomly assigned to the CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL groups with 8 calves
per group. Before OES administration, powder OES was dissolved in 2 <italic>l</italic> of warm water. The veterinary practitioner administered OES to calves using a feeding bottle with nipple, but did not administer other medication,
such as antibiotics. All calves were offered two feedings of milk at the rate of 5% of body weight per feeding in the morning and afternoon, and had <italic>ad libitum</italic> access to concentrated feed (for growing calves at the
nursing stage), hay, and water throughout treatment. Clinical findings and blood sampling were performed before (pre), and 1, 2, 4 and 24 hr after OES administration. Fecal status was assessed using a scoring system (0: firm, 1:
pasty, 2: loose, and 3: watery) as described elsewhere [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Venous blood samples were anaerobically collected in a heparinized 1-m<italic>l</italic> syringe from the left jugular vein. Whole blood
samples were analyzed for Ht, Hb, and base excess (BE) using an automatic gas analyzer (i-STAT 1, Abbott Lab.) and for beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) concentrations by an automatic analyzer (Precision Xceed, Abbott Lab.). Changes in
relative plasma volume (rPV) and relative BE (rBE) were calculated from Hb and Ht [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and from actual BE concentration [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] using accepted formulas.
Relative changes in BHBA (rBHBA) were derived from the following equation: rBHBA=BHBA<sub>after</sub> &#x02212;BHBA<sub>before</sub>, where BHBA<sub>before</sub> and BHBA<sub>after</sub> are the BHBA concentrations immediately before and
after administration, respectively.</p><p>The data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. In diarrheic calves within group, mean values for each dependent variable were compared with the base value, using one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnet&#x02019;s test. Dependent variables were
compared among groups for each sample collection period using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#x02019;s HSD test. A statistical analysis was conducted using Excel Toukei 2010 (SSRI, Osaka, Japan). The significance level was
<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05.</p><p>All calves had moderate diarrhea, accompanied with mild dehydration (Ht: 28.0 &#x000b1; 5.7%, Hb: 9.3 &#x000b1; 1.9 g/d<italic>l</italic>), but no metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.37 &#x000b1; 0.05, BE: 6.3 &#x000b1; 4.5 mM). Clinical signs of eyeball recession into orbit
and skin tent duration in the neck region were observed, but impaired central nervous system function including ataxia and coma were not observed. After administration of the OES, clinical signs, such as moist cough, jugular vein
congestion, exophthalmos, salivation, and arrhythmia, were not observed throughout the experimental period for all groups. <italic>C. parvum</italic> was detected in 5/8 CF groups, 5/8 CFG groups, 4/8 CFGG groups, and 3/8 SL groups.
The pre-OES administration fecal scores for CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL groups (2.1 &#x000b1; 0.4, 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.2, 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.3 and 2.0 &#x000b1; 0.4, respectively) were not significantly different to those after 4 hr OES administration (2.2 &#x000b1; 0.3, 2.3 &#x000b1; 0.3, 2.4

The rPV of the CF group was significantly higher 2 hr after administration than the pre value, and this change remain high until the next day (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). In addition,
the rPV of the CFGG group was significantly higher 4 hr after administration than the pre value (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). On the other hand, the rPV of the CFG and SL groups slightly and transiently increased, but these variances
were not significant within the groups. CF and SL contained 100.1 and 73.9 mM of sodium, respectively. Research suggests that the ideal sodium concentration in OES to correct dehydration in calves is between 90 and 130
mmol/<italic>l</italic> [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, Michell <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] demonstrated that a commercial OES containing 73 mmol/<italic>l</italic> was
not able to correct dehydration. Therefore, our results support research suggesting that higher sodium is needed to correct dehydration. However, when glucose was added to CF in the CFG prototype OES, the beneficial effects of sodium
disappeared. The rPV of the CFG group was constant during the experimental period. When glycine was added to CFG in the CFGG prototype OES, the beneficial effect of increasing plasma volume was partly restored. Our results demonstrate
that not only the sodium concentration in the OES, but also the glucose and glycine to sodium ratio are important for increasing plasma volume. The ratio of glucose to glycine to sodium present in CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL were
0.6:0.6:1.0, 1.2:0.6:1.0, 1.2:1.1:1.0 and 1.6:1.5:1.0, respectively. Even if the OES contained equal sodium amounts, differences in glucose or glycine concentration affected rehydration. The ratio of glucose to glycine to sodium
present in CF have maximized sodium absorption, and additional glucose and glycine may affect sodium absorption or lead to osmotic diarrhea.</p><p>The pre-administration venous pH values of the CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL groups (7.36 &#x000b1; 0.05, 7.37 &#x000b1; 0.03, 7.37 &#x000b1; 0.06 and 7.38 &#x000b1; 0.05, respectively) were not significantly different to those after 2 hr OES administration (7.40 &#x000b1; 0.05,
7.38 &#x000b1; 0.03, 7.39 &#x000b1; 0.03 and 7.40 &#x000b1; 0.05, respectively). The pre-administration HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> concentrations of the CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL groups (32.9 &#x000b1; 5.9, 31.6 &#x000b1; 3.8, 32.8 &#x000b1; 3.6 and 32.4 &#x000b1; 5.2, respectively) were not
significantly different to those after 2 hr OES administration (34.6 &#x000b1; 6.3, 32.9 &#x000b1; 3.2, 34.9 &#x000b1; 4.1 and 34.5 &#x000b1; 4.8, respectively). The pre-administration PCO<sub>2</sub> concentrations of the CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL groups (57.2 &#x000b1; 5.2,

significantly different among those groups. Acetate is alkalinizing agent and has alkalinizing effects similar to bicarbonate [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Citrate is alkalinizing agent too, but Naylor <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] demonstrated that citrate was unsuitable for use in intravenous fluid. There were no differences in rBE between the CFGG and SL groups. Although both acetate and citrate are
effective alkalinizing agents in OES, only CF administration markedly corrected acid-base status. The cause of this was unclear, but CF may improve plasma volume and decrease concentrations of PCO<sub>2</sub> by the potential
alkalinizing effect attributed to aerobic metabolism. Aerobic metabolism accelerates clearance of lactate [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition, CF have twice the amount of acetate compared to the amount of citrate in

small amount of glycine, was not effective in preventing catabolism. This suggests that the concentration of glucose in the OES is not the only factor for preventing catabolism. The ratio of glucose to glycine in CF, CFG, CFGG, and SL
was 1.0:1.0, 2.0:1.0, 1.1:1.0 and 1.1:1.0, respectively, which suggests that a ratio around 1.0:1.0 is optimal for preventing catabolism. Therefore, it may be not only the amount of glucose, but also the ratio of glucose to glycine
that is important for providing energy.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that not only the amount of sodium, glucose, and glycine, but also ratio of these factors is important for correcting dehydration and preventing catabolism. From commercially available OES in Japan,
administration of CF increased plasma volume and corrected BE, but did not prevent catabolism. Administration of SL did not improve plasma volume or correct BE. However the catabolic preventive effect was excellent, since SL have more
rapid prevention of catabolism and maintain low value in rBHBA compared with CF. This suggests that it is necessary to use CF and SL properly. CF should be used in the early stages of diarrhea for calves with dehydration and metabolic
acidosis, but not in the later stages of exhaustion. On the other hand, SL may beneficial for wasting diarrheic calves with dehydration.</p></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Chiang</surname><given-names>B.
