Informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to study initiation. Consecutive patients undergoing cataract surgery were alternately assigned to treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% or moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% used prophylactically to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis.

No sutures were necessary in any cases included in this study. The following parameters indicative of safety and tolerability were measured on the day of surgery (day 0) and on days 7 (&#x000b1;1 day) and 28 (&#x000b1;2 days) following surgery: corneal thickness measured using the DGH-55 Pachmate (DGH Technologies, Exton, PA) or Pachette 3 pachymeters (DGH Technologies, Exton, PA); endothelial cell count, using a Konan NonCon Specular microscope; overall and central corneal staining, using the 0&#x02013;3 National Eye Institute scale; best-corrected visual acuity; and intraocular pressure measured using Goldmann applanation tonometry. Best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressure were also measured on day 1 after the surgery.

The groups were similar in distribution of the operated eye (OD/OS) and distribution of preoperative visual acuity. The majority of patients had medical and ocular histories consistent with those of the seventh decade of life. Two thirds of the patients in each group had a history of cardiovascular disorders, and approximately one third of eyes in each group had a history of glaucoma. Eight of the 11 diabetic patients were assigned to besifloxacin treatment. One patient in the besifloxacin treatment group withdrew consent prior to the final exit visit, and one patient in the moxifloxacin treatment group had a nonevaluable endothelial cell image at screening. Therefore, 58 patients (29 per treatment group) were included in the per protocol analysis. The mean baseline values for endothelial cell count, overall and central corneal staining, and intraocular pressure were similar between the treatment groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x02265; 0.1323).

An animal study showed that the DuraSite vehicle may block the trabecular meshwork and damage the corneal endothelium when introduced directly into the anterior chamber.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-opth-6-855">31</xref> Briefly, a 0.1 mL dose of various formulations, or the equivalent of three drops from a standard eye drop bottle, was injected into the anterior chamber of New Zealand rabbits through the anterior sclera and conjunctiva. After 48 hours, the rabbits were euthanized and their eyes were examined. Glaucomatous damage, presumably from the DuraSite vehicle blocking the trabecular meshwork, and corneal edema from endothelial cell morphological changes were observed in eyes injected with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% and those injected with azithromycin ophthalmic solution 0.1% (AzaSite <sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Inspire Pharmaceuticals Inc, NC), also formulated with DuraSite. The study was characterized by the authors as simulating an extremely leaky wound, which would presumably allow topically used DuraSite-containing antibiotics to enter the anterior chamber. The researchers concluded that DuraSite was responsible for the results observed. As a safety precaution, they also recommended suturing of the incision following cataract surgery if DuraSite-based drug formulations were used for postoperative endophthalmitis prophylaxis. However, the clinical relevance of these rabbit studies is not known. In a follow-up study, Goecks et al injected smaller volumes (12.5 &#x003bc;L, 25 &#x003bc;L, and 50 &#x003bc;L) of azithromycin with or without DuraSite directly into the anterior chamber of rabbit eyes or applied several drops of these formulations directly to a 2.8 mm limbal incision followed by repeated opening of the wound with forceps.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-opth-6-855">39</xref> Slit lamp examination and histopathology showed toxicity with the DuraSite-containing formulation relative to the exposure volume. We propose that it is unlikely that a topically administered drug would penetrate into aqueous humor at volumes approaching even the smallest volume tested in these studies through the leakiest of clear corneal incisions. Furthermore, the mucoadhesive polycarbophil used in DuraSite has a very high molecular weight (in billions). Therefore, there is little possibility of the polymer gaining entry into the anterior chamber in the presence of a clear corneal incision created for cataract surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-opth-6-855">40</xref> Furthermore, a surgical wound that is severely compromised is more likely to be associated with vision-threatening complications (eg, infection, endophthalmitis, hypotony, choroidal effusion) than any possible toxicity from the drug vehicle.</p><p>In our study, the safety of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6%, and by extension, the safety of the DuraSite vehicle, in uncomplicated post-cataract surgery was demonstrated by the fact that no adverse events were reported, and there was no evidence of compromised corneal endothelium (by cell counts and pachymetry) or unusual elevations in intraocular pressure, despite the use of sutureless clear corneal incisions. Outcomes were remarkably similar to those observed with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%, a non-DuraSite formulation. These results are also consistent with a previous preclinical study by Krenzer et al who examined the effects of topical administration of the DuraSite vehicle using two dosing schedules on surgically compromised rabbit eyes, including those with laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) flaps or a 3 mm clear corneal incision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-opth-6-855">40</xref> In the first dosing schedule, one drop of DuraSite (50 &#x003bc;L) was instilled immediately after surgery, with the second dose instilled later in the day, followed by four times daily for 14 days. The second schedule involved instilling one drop of DuraSite four times daily on the day prior to surgery and 0.25 hours prior to surgery, and at hours 0.125, 4, and 8 postoperatively, followed by four times daily for 9 days. No adverse effects were observed in both the LASIK flap and corneal incision models with either dosing schedule. The wound and anterior chamber of the eye in the corneal incision model did not show the presence of the polymer at any time, and the corneal endothelium appeared normal as in the controls. The LASIK flap also did not show any presence of the DuraSite at the interface. Histopathology examination did not indicate any unique safety concerns associated with the use of the DuraSite vehicle in these settings. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-opth-6-855">40</xref> Taken together, these studies suggest that in routine, uncomplicated postoperative conditions, the use of Besivance for postoperative antibacterial prophylaxis does not appear to present safety concerns.</p><p>A slight increase from baseline in overall and central corneal staining was observed at day 7 and day 28 in both treatment groups in this study, but the change from baseline in overall and central corneal staining was similar between treatments. Increases in corneal staining are not unexpected following cataract surgery and may result from a combination of factors including the trauma of the surgical procedure itself, mechanical effects of the use of irrigating solutions, desiccation of the cornea, or any of the topical medications used perioperatively (steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or antibiotics). Regardless of the cause, the lack of a difference in the change from baseline in corneal staining between treatments suggests that neither the DuraSite vehicle nor the benzalkonium chloride preservative used in besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% had an adverse effect on the corneal epithelium. These results are consistent with those of a pooled safety analysis of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis that reported punctate keratitis at an incidence of 0.3%, which was considered insignificant as compared with an incidence of 0.5% for the preservative-free moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-opth-6-855">21</xref></p><p>A limitation of our study was the single-masked design. While investigators were masked to treatment, patients were not. The lack of subjective adverse event reports in either of the treatment groups suggests that patients were not biased. The relatively small number of patients enrolled and the lack of a priori power calculations to define an appropriate sample size for rejection of a prestated null hypothesis for the primary and secondary outcomes was also a limitation. While large differences between treatments at follow-up visits would likely have been detected, small differences between treatments may not have been detectable. Despite these limitations, the results of our study suggest that besifloxacin 0.6% is safe when used as a prophylactic antibiotic to minimize the possibility of postoperative infections in patients undergoing uncomplicated sutureless cataract extraction surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was safe and well tolerated when used as a prophylactic antibiotic during routine, uncomplicated, sutureless cataract surgery. The safety and tolerability profile of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% was similar to that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%, although larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-opth-6-855"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study was supported by a grant from Bausch and Lomb Inc.
