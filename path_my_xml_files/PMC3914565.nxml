Publications using the term CQI, however, are methodologically heterogeneous, and labels other than CQI are used to signify relevant approaches.

Internal medicine core competencies, for example, indicate that &#x02018;the sponsoring institution and participating sites must demonstrate that there is a culture of patient safety and continuous quality improvement &#x02026;&#x02019;[<xref rid="MZT085C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. CQI approaches are also often referenced in work focused on developing countries, where scarce medical resources may make innovative adaptation to local circumstances particularly critical [<xref rid="MZT085C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. As reflected in the published literature, however, the scientific use and reporting of CQI methods are heterogeneous. Lack of consistency in identifying whether and when improvement initiatives have used CQI has meant that relevant evidence reviews are difficult to interpret, results of individual initiatives that reference use of CQI are difficult to apply, and CQI authors and educators struggle with how to report and reference their methods.</p><p>The term CQI does not refer to all QI methods, but rather to those derived from the total quality management (TQM) approach developed by Deming, Juran and others for industrial settings [<xref rid="MZT085C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Healthcare experts such as Berwick, Kaluzny and McLaughlin [<xref rid="MZT085C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MZT085C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] re-envisioned TQM as CQI, reflecting adaptations for better application within healthcare organizations. These methods span a wide variety of possible CQI elements including, for example, plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles or diagnostic methods, such as those used for root cause analyses of adverse clinical events [<xref rid="MZT085C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The work presented here aims to anchor use of the term CQI to a clear and parsimonious set of essential features. Additional CQI-related features can then vary to reflect an initiative's purpose, while still enabling recognition of CQI methods.</p><p>General CQI and TQM principles and philosophies have infused a wide variety of specific approaches to facilitate their practical application, including, for example, Lean [<xref rid="MZT085C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], Six Sigma [<xref rid="MZT085C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series [<xref rid="MZT085C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and 10 0000 Lives and 5 Million Lives campaigns [<xref rid="MZT085C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and System Redesign [<xref rid="MZT085C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. While the availability of such approaches likely strengthens the field by offering practical alternatives that may fit particular needs and preferences, this broad evolution has created a confusing blend of terminologies.</p><p>Moreover, current published definitions of CQI are not adequate for distinguishing CQI efforts from other QI and patient safety intervention approaches [<xref rid="MZT085C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Short definitions aimed at orienting readers to the field in general are broad and vague [<xref rid="MZT085C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Long definitions aimed at helping people carry out CQI successfully cover pages of text and include a wide variety of elements from philosophies to tools, to data sources [<xref rid="MZT085C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]; no one initiative is likely to use all of these. Therefore, as is the case for other complex interventions [<xref rid="MZT085C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], defining key theoretical and operational features is critical for building a cumulative science of improvement [<xref rid="MZT085C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MZT085C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The set of such features should be broad enough that QI efforts not meeting the definition can be excluded as not CQI, narrow enough that efforts using the features can be included as applications of CQI and specific enough for reliable abstraction from the literature.</p><p>In this study, recognized QI experts identified essential <italic>features that define CQI as a method</italic>, cutting across specific named approaches. Some potential CQI features may be attractive philosophically, but less useful for recognizing work as CQI. Previously, for example, we found that &#x02018;continuous&#x02019; improvement was not endorsed as essential by in-person panelists, who thought that a time-limited effort should potentially qualify as CQI [<xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>To identify the parsimonious set of essential CQI elements reported in this study, we used rigorous, innovative online expert panel [<xref rid="MZT085C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and literature review methods. We further contextualized our results based on qualitative analysis of online discussion. Our findings reflect broad consensus among experts on essential CQI features that can be abstracted reliably from the literature when reported by authors. We consider features that cannot be reliably abstracted when reported to be either too complex or too fluid to be useful for recognizing CQI. Panel results can enable more rapid learning from and across CQI initiatives through improved methodological consistency, reporting and comparative analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overview and prior studies</title><p>This study, which was determined to be exempt from the IRB review by RAND and the Veterans Affairs (VA), builds on prior work carried out as the Evidence Review for Quality Improvement Project, funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research (AHRQ), the VA and RAND over a series of projects on identifying and assessing QI intervention literature [<xref rid="MZT085C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MZT085C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>Assessment of panel consensus on the essential definitional features of CQI based on a priori consensus standards and an online modified-Delphi process [<xref rid="MZT085C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Rating process and participants</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Development of potential features for consensus ratings</title><p>We previously engaged a panel of 12 national and international QI experts in rating and refining an initial list of 48 potentially definitional CQI features [<xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Over a 1 year period, the experts completed two online surveys, three telephone discussions and a final in-person meeting during which the panel reached consensus on six top-rated CQI features. Two study team raters tested the reliability of the six items when applied to 106 representative, methodologically diverse QI intervention articles. The article set resulted from an electronic search for QI interventions of any kind [<xref rid="MZT085C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], random sampling of searched articles and hand screening focused on QI rather than specifically on CQI [<xref rid="MZT085C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Two reviewers then abstracted the 106 articles for the six top-rated CQI features. Percent agreement ranged from 55.7 to 75.5% for the six items, and reviewer-adjusted intra-class correlation ranged from 0.43 to 0.62. Although two-thirds of articles documented at least two features, only 14% included some evidence of all six features. The study team concluded that the sensitivity of a definition based on six features was too low; there was no unbiased way to eliminate features; and additional consensus work was required for a useable definition [<xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, we used the six features from the prior in-person panel meeting, added five that had been rated highly but had not reached the final top six and conducted the online consensus process using 11 CQI features reported here.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Panelist identification</title><p>LR and SSS used their professional networks to invite Institute for Healthcare Improvement faculty, members of the editorial boards from leading QI research journals, evaluators of RWJF QI programs, and RAND patient safety and QI experts to participate in this study.

Participants noted that the importance of some features depends on the scope and complexity of an intervention. For example, if an intervention is limited in scope, successful QI may not require multidisciplinary teams (a feature not achieving consensus as definitional, though still considered important for project success in quantitative analyses).

Yet the core meaning of the term remains imprecise. Scientific advancement depends critically on clear specification of methods; when a methodological term has a different meaning from user to user, scientific communication, including comparison with alternative methods, is inefficient. In previous work, we identified 48 different features used to describe CQI in grant proposals and texts; clearly, few CQI efforts will include all 48 [<xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this study, a large panel of experts from both research and QI practitioner communities agreed that &#x02018;systematic data guided activities,&#x02019; &#x02018;designing with local conditions in mind&#x02019; and &#x02018;iterative development and testing&#x02019; are <italic>essential features of CQI methods</italic>.</p><p>The features rated by the experts were phrased to enable abstraction by avoiding use of restrictive terms and promoting the recognition of a wide variety of synonyms that might capture the basic feature. As shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="MZT085TB1">1</xref>, for example, satisfying the criterion &#x02018;systematic data guided activities&#x02019; indicated use of something like aims and related measures as the drivers or guides for an initiative's activities. Phrased in these ways, the criteria can identify a core concept that may not have used narrower terms or synonyms. As we previously determined, the presence or absence of features reported on here can be reliably abstracted from QI intervention literature [<xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Based on the work presented here, CQI practitioners, authors, article reviewers and evidence reviews of the literature can be encouraged to reference and report on all three essential CQI features. Panelists also identified seven additional features&#x02014;&#x02018;aiming to change routine work,&#x02019; providing &#x02018;data feedback to implementers,&#x02019; &#x02018;using evidence relevant to the problem&#x02019;, having &#x02018;specific predefined aims&#x02019; and engaging &#x02018;multidisciplinary teams from target organizations&#x02019;&#x02014;as important for CQI success or reporting. Use and reporting of these additional features should also be encouraged when relevant.</p><p>Many articles reference specific named methods with CQI and/or industrial TQM roots, such as Lean or Six Sigma [<xref rid="MZT085C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], often with few additional details about what was done. Based on our quantitative results, use of these terms is of limited usefulness for recognizing CQI. Based on discussion, the terms also have limited methodological meaning to QI experts.</p><p>Panelists rated new features from among those panel members proposed during initial discussions. Of these, two were rated as important for reporting on a CQI initiative. These were &#x02018;provides data on what was done to produce change&#x02019; and &#x02018;describes the context within which the initiative took place.&#x02019; These features focus more on quality of reporting than on recognizing CQI, and have not been tested for reliability. SQUIRE guidelines represent a comprehensive approach to making reporting on QI efforts more systematic [<xref rid="MZT085C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], and cover substantial material relevant to our panelist-proposed criteria. Our panelists thus indirectly supported two major SQUIRE goals.</p><p>A focus of the work reported here is on enabling learning across CQI projects. Given that a single CQI effort for a complex intervention may cost $100 000 per site if carefully audited [<xref rid="MZT085C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and that billions of dollars are spent on these efforts nationally, investment in how to harness learning from them would seem to be well spent. Literature review, synthesis and meta-analysis have been a bulwark for learning across healthcare studies. These methodologies require unbiased methods for finding relevant articles. Often, and justifiably, for example, reviews of QI intervention effectiveness, such as those for depression care improvement [<xref rid="MZT085C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], exclude CQI approaches as being too different from classical intervention literature. Yet studies of CQI, in turn, may not find or include all of the relevant initiatives, given uncertainty about how to recognize them. The three essential CQI features reported here can be used to recognize or screen for use of CQI methods in the literature for evidence syntheses, thus facilitating valid and comprehensive across-study CQI comparisons.</p><p>The 11 features rated by our panelists in this study were derived from a previous in-person international expert panel and the literature abstraction process that accompanied it [<xref rid="MZT085C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We showed that, while these features can be reliably abstracted from the literature, there are few articles that include all of them [<xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We also found that articles are so diverse in terms of where they report the features (e.g. abstract, introduction, methods, results or discussion) that full article review was required.</p><p>Our previous research shows that retrieving relevant CQI articles from among electronically searched QI intervention articles requires extensive screening [<xref rid="MZT085C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and is hampered by the often seemingly random reporting of the CQI activities carried out. These factors limit the completeness, objectivity and coherence with which CQI article sets can be assembled. Stronger consensus among experts and more research on application of QI-related terms may promote better electronic search methods.</p><p>This study has limitations. First, an online expert panel approach cannot be assumed to be identical to an in-person panel. The online panel, however, enabled broader validation of the work of our previous in-person international panel; therefore, our study included both panel methods. Moreover, online panelists were generally satisfied with the panel process, found it interesting, easy to use and helpful [<xref rid="MZT085C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Second, while we had some international participants in the ExpertLens process, our sampling aimed at North America. While further work involving the many active CQI researchers and practitioners in other countries is needed, our electronic search strategy yielded many international CQI studies, and the terminology use in these studies is reflected in the panel and reliability work leading up to the online panel. Third, our results may depend in part on how we phrased CQI features, rather than on the features themselves; panelists disagreed with some of our wording. The wording used, however, represents both in-person panel input and several years of work developing a reliable literature abstraction tool [<xref rid="MZT085C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Finally, our participants raised the issue that the terms CQI and QI may be used interchangeably. Our prior work shows the diversity of QI interventions, however, and suggests that distinguishing CQI from the broader term QI will be useful [<xref rid="MZT085C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="MZT085C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we found consensus among a broad group of CQI researchers and practitioners on three features, and three features only, as essential features of CQI methods. Based on these results, we conclude that all three features should be present as a minimum standard for identifying use of CQI methods. The features are (i) using &#x02018;systematic data guided activities&#x02019; (e.g. aims and measures) to achieve improvement, (ii) &#x02018;designing with local conditions in mind&#x02019; (i.e. to fit the special characteristics of targeted local environment(s)) and (iii) using an &#x02018;iterative development and testing process,&#x02019; such as PDSA. These three essential features are validated for use in identifying, designing and reporting on CQI projects.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supplementary material</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intqhc.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/intqhc/mzt085/-/DC1">Supplementary material is available at <italic>INTQHC Journal</italic> online</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation</funding-source> (Grant ID <award-id>65113</award-id>: Advancing the science of continuous quality improvement: a framework for identifying, classifying and evaluating continuous quality improvement studies and Grant ID <award-id>67890</award-id>: Providing a framework for the identification, classification and evaluation of quality improvement initiatives) and the <funding-source>RAND Corporation</funding-source>, with additional funding provided by the <funding-source>VA Health Services Research and Development Center</funding-source> for Implementation Practice and Research Support.
