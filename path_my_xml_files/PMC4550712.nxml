However, few studies have investigated the longer term effects of running in minimalist shoes. The purpose of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate the effects of a 26&#x02005;week transition to minimalist shoes on running performance and injury risk in trained runners unaccustomed to minimalist footwear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A randomised parallel intervention design will be used. Seventy-six trained male runners will be recruited. To be eligible, runners must be aged 18&#x02013;40&#x02005;years, run with a habitual rearfoot footfall pattern, train with conventional shoes and have no prior experience with minimalist shoes. Runners will complete a standardised transition to either minimalist or control shoes and undergo assessments at baseline, 6 and 26&#x02005;weeks. 5&#x02005;km time-trial performance (5TT), running economy, running biomechanics, triceps surae muscle strength and lower limb bone mineral density will be assessed at each time point. Pain and injury will be recorded weekly. Training will be standardised during the first 6 weeks. Primary statistical analysis will compare 5TT between shoe groups at the 6-week time point and injury incidence across the entire 26-week study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This RCT has been approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of South Australia. Participants will be required to provide their written informed consent prior to participation in the study. Study findings will be disseminated in the form of journal publications and conference presentations after completion of planned data analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>This RCT has been registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12613000642785).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>SPORTS MEDICINE</kwd><kwd>STATISTICS &#x00026; RESEARCH METHODS</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first study to investigate the effects of minimalist footwear over longer than a 3-month period and the first to include a measure of running performance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The standardised gradual transition to minimalist shoes from 0% to 100% of weekly running will inform runners, coaches and clinicians of the effect of these shoes across the entire transitional period.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Limitations of the study are the inclusion of only male runners aged 18&#x02013;40&#x02005;years and the inclusion of only one minimalist shoe group.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The effects of running in minimalist shoes is a topic of interest for runners and for scientists.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;7</xref> Running in minimalist shoes can cause runners to run with a more plantar-flexed ankle at initial contact and adopt a forefoot footfall (FF) pattern,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Indeed, the only study to investigate the effect of transitioning to minimalist shoes on injury risk reported greater calf pain and a higher incidence of injury for two different minimalist shoes (20% and 38%) compared to conventional shoes (13%).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Choice of running shoe is an important issue for distance runners who view minimalist shoes as a means for enhancing running performance but have concerns about the potential for minimalist shoes to cause injury.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Avoiding injuries resulting from minimalist shoes is important for runners to minimise the economic burden associated with medical treatment and absenteeism from work, as well as to maximise the positive health effects of maintaining an active lifestyle.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This issue is particularly relevant given the popularity of running, which is performed by 10% of the Australian population.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In order to provide runners with sufficient instructions on how to implement minimalist shoes, further longitudinal studies investigating methods for transitioning to minimalist shoes over longer periods are needed.

Consistency of running speed will be monitored using photoelectric sensors (SpeedLight V2, Swift Performance Equipment, Queensland, Australia). Marker trajectories will be measured using a 12 camera VICON MX F20 system (Vicon, Oxford, UK) sampling at 300&#x02005;Hz. Ground reaction force will be measured using four force platforms aligned in series and sampling at 1200&#x02005;Hz. Each participant will be required to complete five successful trials. A trial will be considered successful if the full plantar surface of the foot contacts the force platform in between the pylons of the force platform at the prescribed running speed without obvious modification of gait. Participants will not be provided with any instructions in regard to contacting the force platform. Instead, the runway starting point will be adjusted as needed to facilitate a successful trial.</p><p>A full body marker set-up will be used and will include the feet, shanks, thighs, pelvis, trunk (including head), upper arms and lower arms (including hands). Spherical retroreflective calibration markers will be used to define the position and orientation in space (POSE) of each segment, and will be placed over the first and fifth metatarsal head, lateral and medial malleolus, lateral and medial femoral epicondyle, greater trochanter, anterior superior iliac spine, posterior superior iliac spine C7 spinous process, acromioclavicular joint, lateral and medial humeral epicondyle, and radial and ulnar styloid process. Tracking markers will be used to track the POSE of each segment. A minimum of three non-collinear markers will be used to track each segment in six degrees of freedom.

Although short-term studies are informative for describing any immediate effects of minimalist shoes on running parameters, they are not useful for informing evidence-based prescription for longer term use.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> We propose to use an RCT to provide high-quality evidence regarding the efficacy of transitioning from conventional shoes to minimalist shoes.</p><p>There is still no consensus definition for minimalist shoes.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Instead, footwear is considered to be minimalist if shoe mass, heel drop and cushioning are reduced compared with conventional running shoes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Choice of minimalist shoe is an important consideration for studies investigating the effects of these shoes. In this RCT, a racing flat will be used as the minimalist shoe condition. Racing flats differ from conventional running shoes by having reduced shoe mass, heel drop and cushioning, and, as such, can be categorised as a form of minimalist shoe.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Additionally, racing flats have been used by runners and coaches in competition for many years,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and can be considered representative of the footwear condition that runners used prior to the introduction of the modern conventional running shoe, which has increased shoe mass, heel drop and cushioning.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It has been suggested that the introduction of the modern conventional running shoe may have caused changes to the natural human running gait and resulted in an increased injury rate.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> To adequately test this hypothesis, conventional running shoes should be compared with racing flats, which were the predominant running shoe available to runners prior to the introduction of shoe cushioning and heel raise.</p><p>It has been proposed that carefully transitioning from conventional to minimalist running shoes can avoid injuries attributed to sudden changes in footwear.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

They will then continue to run 100% in minimalist shoes during the final 6 weeks of the study. Onset of injury and weekly pain scores will be used to determine if there is a threshold amount of running in minimalist shoes that is associated with an increased risk of injury in runners transitioning from conventional shoes.

Additionally, examining the effects of minimalist shoes on running biomechanics, muscle strength, BMD and running economy in the present study will allow for investigation of the factors underlying any effects on performance and/or injury to be explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this RCT will provide high-quality evidence regarding the effect on running performance of transitioning from conventional to minimalist shoes, which is currently lacking in the field of running footwear research. Additionally, observation of injury rates during this transition will be used to inform the design of larger studies investigating the effect of minimalist shoes on injury risk. The 26-week longitudinal follow-up period used in this study will be the longest prospective follow-up of runners changing to minimalist shoes that has been reported in the literature to date. Assessments of running biomechanics, muscle strength and BMD will allow this RCT to explore the mechanisms underlying any effects of minimalist shoes on running performance and/or injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank ASICS Oceania (ASICS Oceania Pty Ltd, Eastern Creek, NSW, Australia) for donating 20 pairs of Asics Gel Cumulus-16 running shoes to support this research.
