We aimed to determine the proportion of pregnant women with genital herpes who develop rupture of membranes before labour onset and the women who deliver prematurely when acyclovir is given to them from the 28&#x000a0;week to the 36&#x000a0;week.</p><p>Two hundred pregnant women with genital herpes at 28&#x000a0;weeks at Mulago Hospital, Uganda were allocated randomly in equal groups. One hundred women were given acyclovir 400&#x000a0;mg and 100 women were given a placebo tablet similar to acyclovir but without active ingredient for swallowing twice a day for 8&#x000a0;weeks. We monitored women for rupture of membranes before labour onset and for premature delivery.</p><p>Four of the 100 women on acyclovir compared to 10 of 100 women on the placebo tablet had rupture of membranes before labour onset although this was not substantial. Eleven of the 100 women on acyclovir compared to 24 of 100 women who on the placebo tablet had premature delivery which was substantial.</p><p>In conclusion, when acyclovir is given to pregnant women who have genital herpes from the 28&#x000a0;week to the 36&#x000a0;week of pregnancy, fewer women deliver prematurely although there is no substantial effect on the number of women developing rupture of membranes before labour onset.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p>Pregnant women who are <italic>Herpes simplex</italic> virus type 2 (HSV-2) seropositive are at risk of inflammation of both the genital tract and the trophoblastic tissue causing undesirable obstetric outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Experimental studies have demonstrated that inflammatory mediators including cytokines are released when HSV-2 and other herpetic viruses invaded the cervical cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These inflammatory mediators among HSV-2 positive pregnancy women are known to cause premature rupture of membranes (PROM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Premature rupture of membranes is defined as rupture of membranes preceding commencement of regular uterine contractions signifying labour onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Rupture of membranes occurring at 37&#x000a0;weeks or more is term PROM and that before 37&#x000a0;weeks of gestation is referred to as pre- PROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Globally, PROM complicates 3&#x02013;10% of pregnancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In a Nigerian Referral and Teaching Hospital in Enugu, 4.3% of pregnancies were complicated by PROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In Mulago Hospital, PROM complicates about 12% of women admitted in the labour ward in Mulago Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>PROM is an undesired obstetric outcome which is often complicated by other adverse outcomes such as puerperal sepsis, fetal infection, fetal death and low Apgar score. Furthermore, pre-PROM is complicated by preterm delivery and low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. PROM contributes to over a third of premature deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The common occurrence of PROM in Mulago Hospital labour ward implies that the adverse outcomes among women with PROM may also be common.</p><p>HSV-2 infections have been associated with preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. HSV-2 positive pregnant women had a twofold risk of preterm delivery compared to women who were HSV-2 negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Indeed, genital herpes DNA was demonstrated in both amniotic fluid and placental tissue of preterm deliveries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Similarly, women who recently seroconverted for HSV-2 had an increased risk of preterm delivery and babies with low birth weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Women who shed HSV-2 at delivery were more likely to have poor obstetric outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Between 30 to 50% of HSV-2 positive women shed HSV in their genital tract during delivery period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In Soweto, South Africa, 17% of HSV-2 positive women shed HSV-2 at the time of delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Herpetic Shedding is indicative of recent infection or reactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and has been associated with poor obstetric outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Women who shed HSV-2 are more likely to transmit HSV-2 to their offsprings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Given after 36&#x000a0;weeks, oral acyclovir suppresses HSV-2 genital shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Acyclovir, a nucleoside analogue selectively inhibits herpetic DNA replication, leaving the uninfected cells unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Randomised placebo controlled trials among HSV-2 positive Women as diagnosed by culture and PCR demonstrated 90% reduction in genital herpetic shedding Moreover, acyclovir was found safe for use during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The previous studies used acyclovir after 36&#x000a0;weeks until delivery to reduce genital shedding among populations with low HSV-2 prevalence. However, it was not clear to what extent acyclovir use from 28 to 36&#x000a0;weeks would reduce on the risk of PROM and other adverse obstetric outcomes in a setting with high HSV-2 prevalence. Uganda has a sero-prevalence of HSV-2 of 49.0% among women of reproductive age and over 60.0% among pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Because ACV reduces HSV-2 in the genital secretions, we postulated that administration of acyclovir would reduce inflammatory mediators and undesirable outcomes such as PROM and preterm delivery. This study also aimed to validate the previous studies that showed a significant effect of acyclovir given from 36&#x000a0;weeks but never documented whether there was an added effect if the drug was given earlier in pregnancy. The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of oral acyclovir administered from 28 to 36&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy on the risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes. We also determined the effect of acyclovir administered from 28 to 36&#x000a0;weeks of gestation on the risk of other adverse obstetric outcomes comes (maternal puerperal sepsis, HSV-2 genital shedding at term, fetal demise, preterm delivery, low birth weight, low Apgar score and admission to neonatal intensive care unit) in Mulago Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study was a double blind (balanced randomized, one: one) placebo controlled trial among HSV-2 positive pregnant mothers attending antenatal clinic in Mulago Hospital, Uganda from January 2014 to February 2015.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study setting</title><p>The trial was conducted in the antenatal clinic for high-risk women, antenatal ward and the labour ward in the Mulago Hospital department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Uganda. Mulago Hospital serves as the Makerere University Medical School teaching hospital as well as a Ugandan National Referral Hospital. The hospital sees about 4000 women antenatally and delivers about 2000 women per month. More than 90% of pregnant women in Uganda book antenatal yet only 50% of them attend all the four required visits. The median gestational age of booking for antenatal care is 20&#x000a0;weeks of gestation.</p><p>Management of PROM at any gestational age in Mulago Hospital starts with making a diagnosis. The women usually complain of drainage or gush of fluid from the vagina before onset of labour. The diagnosis of PROM is made at speculum examination if there is observation of fluid pooling in posterior vaginal fornix or free flow of fluid from the cervix. All women with PROM are admitted. Antibiotics are given (Erythromycin 500&#x000a0;mg 6 hourly orally or Ampicillin 1&#x000a0;g 12 hourly intravenously or a cephalosporin intravenously&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;if foul discharge- metronidazole 500&#x000a0;mg 8 hourly intravenously). The mother and fetus are assessed for infection: temperature, pulse, tenderness over uterus, altered color of liquor, full blood count, and obtain samples for cultures if indicated (fever, leukocytosis, foul smell or altered color discharge). Digital vaginal examinations are avoided until induction is indicated or as part of monitoring during active phase of labour. If the fetus is dead at any gestational age and there is no contraindications to vaginal delivery, induction of labour is performed immediately. If there is a contraindication to vaginal delivery (two or more P/S or ant uterine surgery, mal-presentation, mal-position, placenta praevia), then a caesarean-section is performed. If the baby is alive for a mother with PROM at term with no contraindication to vaginal delivery, induction of labour is performed. If the woman has contraindication to vaginal delivery then a caesarean section is performed.</p><p>Women with PROM at gestations above 28&#x000a0;weeks up to 36&#x000a0;weeks with a live foetus are given steroids to promote maturation of the fetal lungs (Intra muscular dexamethasone 12&#x000a0;mg 12 hourly for 24&#x000a0;h). Delivery is then indicated for the women with PROM at gestations above 34&#x000a0;weeks up to 36&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>For the women with PROM between 28 and 34&#x000a0;weeks, expectant management coupled with monitoring maternal and fetal wellbeing on the ward is then done until 34&#x000a0;weeks provided there is no suspicion of intrauterine infection. An ultrasound is done for assessment of fetal position, cervical status and fluid volume once weekly. Antibiotics are continued for 5&#x000a0;days. Surveillance for infection continues and if infection occurs, intravenous antibiotics are given and delivery is indicated. Induction or caesarean section is done as per assessment by obstetrician on duty.</p><p>After delivery, antibiotics are given for 24&#x000a0;h in patients who have no evidence of infection. In the women who have evidence of infection, antibiotics are continued for 5&#x000a0;days. The babies are monitored for infection and are taken to the neonatal care unit if there is evidence of infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study participants</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Screening for HSV-2 serostatus</title><p>We screened consented women between 20 and 26&#x000a0;weeks of gestation for HSV-2 serostatus as determined by HerpeSelect HSV-2 ELISA (Focus Diagnostics, CA, USA). Two milliliters (ml) of blood was drawn from each study participant into plain vacutainers (BD, Biosciences) and transported to the testing laboratory i.e. Immunology Laboratory at the Makerere University College of Health Sciences. At the laboratory, one ml of serum was recovered same day, and stored at 2&#x02013;8&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C when the ELISA tests were to be done within 48&#x000a0;h or at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for samples that were to be tested thereafter At the time of performing the test, the stored serum samples were placed on the work table for about 1&#x000a0;h to bring them to room temperature. One tenth of the sera was mixed with 100 microliters of sample diluent prior to being tested for HSV-2 IgG following the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The HerpeSelect HSV-2 ELISA has a sensitivity of 96&#x02013;97% and a specificity of 98% as per the manufacturer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We considered the cut off optical density of 3.5 and above as positive and below that as negative as has been the practice in recent studies in our setting following sensitivity and specificity studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria into the trial</title><p>We included consented HSV-2 sero-positive pregnant women aged 18&#x02013;43&#x000a0;years at 28&#x000a0;weeks of gestation, at any parity and attending Mulago Hospital antenatal care clinic. Twenty-eight weeks is the lowest age of fetal viability according to Uganda Ministry of Health guidelines (Essential Maternal and Neonatal Care Clinical Care Guidelines for Uganda, July 2009). At least one in two babies born at or after 28&#x000a0;weeks survive without long time complications in Uganda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. We excluded one woman who had active genital herpetic lesions (needed higher dose of ACV) and one other woman who had high medication burden (had both HIV and Diabetic treatment). We also did not include those who returned after 28&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Interventions</title><p>Enrolled participants were randomly assigned in a one to one ratio to take 400&#x000a0;mg of oral acyclovir twice a day or matching placebo from 28&#x000a0;weeks until 36 completed weeks using random computer generated numbers.

Acyclovir was already approved by the National drug authority (NDA) and could be used if indicated among pregnant women after the first trimester. The placebo was a plain tablet containing sodium starch glycolate, magnesium stearate and maize starch with white coating formulated to have an external appearance similar to the acyclovir tablets. Both drugs were packaged by the Kampala Pharmaceuticals Industry (KPI) Limited into similar containers indistinguishable except by random numbers&#x02019; label.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Randomisation</title><p>A pharmacist at KPI allocated the acyclovir or placebo using the random computer generated list. The randomisation sequence was produced using an online research randomiser in the 1:1 ratio by a statistician who did not take part in the study. The allocation was such that, each participant was enrolled and received a study number from research assistants. The participants were then escorted to the designated study pharmacy section where a corresponding envelope was opened. That envelope had a random code that corresponded with the code on a corresponding drug container which was then given to the client to take daily.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size for this study was determined for the primary outcome of preterm premature rupture of membranes (Pre-PROM) using Open Epi online sample size calculator.

The proportion of PROM without intervention was 12% which was the proportion of patients with PROM daily in the labour ward as per departmental records 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The expected proportion of the outcome in the intervention group was taken as 1.2% (acyclovir use reduced genital shedding from 34-37% to 2-4% which was over 90% reduction) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The study used 95% confidence interval and power of 80%. The sample size calculated was 83 in each of the arms.

The secondary outcomes were preterm delivery, maternal, puerperal sepsis, HSV-2 genital shedding at term, fetal demise, low birth weight, low Apgar score (below 7 at 5&#x000a0;min), admission into neonatal special care unit and drug side effects. PROM was diagnosed from history of passage of clear fluid per vagina and confirmed by sterile speculum examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Preterm delivery is the birth of a baby before 37 completed weeks of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Maternal puerperal sepsis is infection of the genital organs and birth canal from the time of rupture of membranes or onset of labour up to the end 6&#x000a0;weeks after delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The clinical features of puerperal sepsis include foul per vaginal discharge, abdominal pain and fever with temperature of 38.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In our study we took puerperal sepsis as history of abnormal per vaginal discharge and fever which we noted after 24 and 72&#x000a0;h of delivery. Low birth weight was taken as weight of babies below 2500 grams.</p><p>HSV-2 genital shedding at term was taken to be evidence of HSV-2 DNA from cervical swab using PCR taken at 38&#x000a0;weeks whether in labour or not or earlier in case of preterm delivery. The PCR procedure was similar as was done in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Specifically, DNA was extracted from the cotton swabs using phenol chloroform/Iso-amyl alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. HSV-2 was then identified using primers and probes that use FluoroType HSV-2 software, version 1.0 (Hain LifeScience GmbH, Nehren, Germany). In this method, 6 microlitres of extracted DNA was added to 10 microliters of amplifier mixes (A and B) and a single stranded probe that emitted colour when HSV DNA was in the vicinity (Hain LifeScience GmbH, Nehren, Germany).

Four millilitres of blood was drawn for renal function, liver functions and full haemogram.</p><p>Study visits were conducted at 32, 36, 38&#x000a0;weeks and delivery. The 32-week visit was 4&#x000a0;weeks after enrollment and served as routine antenatal care as per the guidelines for the Ministry of Health and for refill of study drug with similar random code. At the 36-week visit the following were done: antenatal care, review on completion of the randomised intervention study period and giving of routine suppressive acyclovir. During the visits at 32 and 36&#x000a0;weeks, compliance with drugs and complaints were assessed. Compliance was measured by self-report of the duration the study medication was taken. In addition, any concomitant medications were noted and documented. Furthermore, relevant investigations were done. All patients were given iron and folic acid for oral intake. In addition, Sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar<sup>TM</sup>) for prevention of malaria was given as per the Uganda Ministry of Health guidelines (Essential Maternal and Neonatal Care Clinical Care Guidelines for Uganda, July 2009).

Complaints of fever and abnormal vaginal discharge were assessed at 24 and 72&#x000a0;h after delivery. In addition, fetal demise, low birth weight, Apgar score and admission into neonatal special care unit were also recorded onto the relevant forms. We took cervical swabs for HSV-2 DNA PCR at 38&#x000a0;weeks/or before that if the participant got preterm delivery or rupture of membranes. For the women who missed the 38-week visit we did the cervical swab at any time they came in labour. The full haemogram, renal and liver function tests were repeated at closing visit. Any complaints were recorded on an adverse event form. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were predetermined as: admission of baby in neonatal unit for more than 24&#x000a0;h, fetal death, plus readmission of the mother during puerperium or maternal death. The SAEs were to be recorded onto a serious adverse form but we got none. Any drugs that were prescribed and dispensed to the participants were recorded onto the concomitant drug log.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Data management, quality control and statistical analysis</title><p>All the research assistants had training in ethical conduct of research, the consent process and data collection a week preceding to the study.

The standard care among HSV-2 positive pregnant women includes use of oral acyclovir from 36&#x000a0;weeks up to delivery. We assessed whether there was reduction of incidence of preterm premature rupture of membranes (pre-PROM) primarily. We also assessed for reduction of maternal puerperal sepsis, HSV-2 genital shedding at term, fetal demise, preterm delivery, low Apgar score, low birth weight and drug side effects. Suppressive acyclovir from 28 to 36&#x000a0;weeks had no effect on the incidence of preterm PROM, puerperal sepsis, HSV-2 genital shedding, fetal demise, birth weight, Apgar score and drug side effects but significantly reduced preterm delivery and neonatal admissions into the new-born special care unit.</p><p>Oral suppressive acyclovir did not significantly reduce the incidence of preterm premature rupture of membranes by 36&#x000a0;weeks. This is in contrast to what is expected given that inflammation of the cervix occurs among patients with herpes infection with release of cytokines that are implicated in membrane rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. We had theorized that that because acyclovir reduces genital shedding (both HSV-2 symptomatic reactivation and asymptomatic shedding) then it would also reduce incidence of premature rupture of membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Our study showed no difference in HSV-2 shedding due to acyclovir administration from 28 to36&#x000a0;weeks compared to placebo administered for the same duration. However, the incidence of HSV-2 shedding in both arms was less than that seen in other studies at term without acyclovir (17% in Soweto (South Africa), 22% in Uganda and 34% in Washington and Vancouver) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Our results further imply that, acyclovir given from 28&#x000a0;weeks up to delivery reduced HSV-2 shedding to a similar level as that when given from the standard 36&#x000a0;weeks onwards. We monitored compliance to drug therapy using self-report. Given that, full compliance to the study drug by the participants was only by 50% of the participants in each study arm, more studies with better compliance follow up may need to be done to explore the relationship between HSV-2 and PROM further.</p><p>Suppressive acyclovir significantly reduced incidence of preterm delivery (from 23.5 to 11.1%) and neonatal admissions into the special care unit (from 17.3 to 9.0%). Studies done over the years have associated HSV-2 positivity with preterm labour due to genital shedding of HSV-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Acyclovir is known to reduce genital shedding, thus we had postulated that acyclovir administered from the week 28 to 36&#x000a0;weeks would reduce the incidence of preterm delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Given that, the reduction of HSV-2 shedding was similar in the intervention and placebo arms, our results imply that the effect of acyclovir reduction on incidence of preterm delivery may also have another mechanism independent of herpetic shedding. In fact, herpetic viruses have been associated with placental pathology leading to pregnancy induced hypertension in epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Pregnancy induced hypertension is a common cause of preterm births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The effect of acyclovir on low birth weight was marginal (from 15.0 to 8.0%) and was probably also related to the preterm delivery. There is thus a need to look at markers of preterm delivery among HSV-2 positive women in order to document reduction of the levels of these markers when acyclovir is used for different durations.</p><p>From our study, some of the adverse outcomes associated with rupture of membranes such as puerperal sepsis did not occur probably due to vigilance by the study team to follow the protocol for use of antibiotics with patients with PROM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, both study arms did not report fetal death by 72&#x000a0;h and Apgar sores less than 7 by 5&#x000a0;min because of the many patients delivering with skilled attendance. In Uganda 58% of patients deliver under skilled attendance but in our study close to 80% of the patients delivered in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, care in public facilities has greatly improved in Uganda which also may have contributed to good Apgar scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Limitations</title><p>We did not have evidence of HSV-2 PCR at enrollment into the study before starting suppressive antiviral therapy however; we used a cut off of 3.5 optical densities which has high specificity for HSV-2 antibody detection even for African populations. Our rationale is that during scaling up use of acyclovir suppressive therapy in low to middle income countries, the national ministries of health would find it cheaper to use HSV-2 serological tests rather that HSV-2 DNA PCR. The study was conducted in a national referral hospital setting which may not be generalizable to lower level health care settings. However, we generated useful information on the effect of acyclovir from 28&#x000a0;weeks compared to routine suppressive acyclovir at or after 36&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Full compliance to study drug was less than optimal but is comparable to the current national compliance to antenatal package by pregnant women. The results would thus still apply in the prevailing situations unless better compliance methods are explored and utilised. Good enough, there was no bias due to the less than optical compliance level to the study medication, given that baseline characteristics were comparable among the women who took the medication as prescribed compared to those who missed some medications. Using the cut off above 3.5 may have brought prevention to a population with higher risk of disease and could have skewed the results. However, the cut off of 3.5 gives sensitivity and specificity of over 95% which is comparable to western blot which is a Gold standard non-commercial test. We did not take into account the frequency of genital conditions such as bacterial vaginosis (BV); however, there was no association between BV and HSV-2 in one study by the same authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. BV testing may have affected the results, we will thus consider interaction of other genital infections in other studies in this area of HSV-2 and obstetric outcomes.</p><p>We excluded women with active HSV-2 and those with high medication burden. Although it is true that women with active HSV-2 and those taking many medications may have benefitted from the study, someone with active HSV-2 would need a higher dose for acyclovir than that that used prophylaxis. The woman with active HSV-2 was thus excluded and given the appropriate acyclovir dosage. For ethical reasons when an eligible participant clearly indicated that she had too many drugs to take (ARVs and Insulin) and declined more drugs, we had to honour her desire. However, only two women were excluded for either having active HSV-2 or due to high medication burden. Exclusion of those two women likely did not affect the outcome of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Oral suppressive acyclovir given to HSV-2 positive pregnant women from 28 to 36&#x000a0;weeks did not reduce incidence of preterm premature rupture of membranes but reduced incidence of preterm delivery.</p><sec id="Sec30"><title>Recommendations</title><p>We recommend use of suppressive acyclovir from 28&#x000a0;weeks by obstetricians on case to case basis in pregnant women with genital herpes to prevent premature delivery.
