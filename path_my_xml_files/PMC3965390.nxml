This constitutes an estimated 75% of all adult cases with community acquired ABM in Sweden, according to data from The National Board of Health and Welfare, during the study period. Of 651 patients 149 (23%) fulfilled the above inclusion criteria. Of these, 57 were included in the intervention group and the remaining 92 cases were eligible as controls. To avoid a possible selection bias the following controls were excluded by independent observers; 1) patients not treated according to national guidelines including initial corticosteroids (dexamethasone or betamethasone) and adequate antibiotics (cefotaxime or ceftriaxone +/&#x02212; ampicillin, or meropenem) in meningitis dosage (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;4), and 2) patients not treated at an intensive care unit (ICU) with assisted ventilation and sedation (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3; one of these was judged desolate on admission).

Thirty-five patients were transported directly to the NICU whereas 17 cases, primarily admitted to one of six other hospitals in the Stockholm region, were treated at local ICUs during 1&#x02013;36 hours, before being referred to the NICU. Following CT-scanning of the brain, an EVD-catheter for ICP-monitoring was established in 50 patients. In two of these the EVD did not function due to slit ventricles. In these two and in another two cases, where an EVD could not be applied (technical problems: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1, moderate coagulopathy: n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;1) a parenchymal ICP-monitor (Codman, Johnson and Johnson Nordic AB, Stockholm) was used. Patients were treated in a 30&#x000b0; sitting position. The temple was used as zero-point for mean arterial blood pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure. ICP was continuously registered in a computerized patient monitoring system, ICU-pilot (&#x003bc;-dialysis AB, Solna, Sweden), and the treatment goals were ICP &#x0003c;20 mmHg and cerebral perfusion pressure &#x0003e;50 mmHg. Significant intracranial hypertension was defined as one or more episodes of ICP, continuously exceeding 20 mmHg for more than 5 minutes.</p><p>As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0091976-g002">figure 2</xref>, CSF-drainage through the EVD was the main treatment of increased ICP. The upper ICP limit triggering drainage was set at 20 mmHg. Additional ICP treatment was applied at the discretion of the treating physicians, guided by clinical, radiological and physiological findings. If signs of interstitial brain edema were observed on the CT-scan, bolus doses of hypertonic saline were given as osmotherapy, allowing S-Na levels of not higher than 160 mmol/L. Intracranial hypertension due to hyperaemia, detected and guided by trans-cranial doppler and/or jugular bulb monitoring, was treated with moderate hyperventilation aiming at a pCO<sub>2</sub> of 4.0&#x02013;4.5 kPa. In cases with paracetamol resistant hyperthermia, an external cooling blanket (Thermo-wrap) was used, aiming at normothermia. If intracranial hypertension and brain edema persisted, despite previous corticosteroid treatment and above-mentioned ICP-decreasing interventions, 1 g of i.v. methylprednisolone was given. Last resort ICP treatment was a pentothal infusion, inducing a barbituate coma to lower cerebral metabolism, monitored with microdialysis and/or jugular bulb analyses.</p><fig id="pone-0091976-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0091976.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The algorithm for treatment of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) in the neuro-intensive care unit (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;52).</title><p>An external ventricular drainage (EVD) was established at operation in 50 patients with initial cerebrospinal fluid (Csf) drainage in 48 of these.

The release of bacterial components in the subarachnoid space leads to an inflammatory response that contributes to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier causing cerebral extracellular edema, impaired Csf-absorption with increased Csf-volume, a cytotoxic intracellular brain edema, and increased cerebral blood flow (hyperaemia); all adding to elevated ICP <xref rid="pone.0091976-Leib1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Scheld1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.</p><p>Our study suggests that increased ICP is a major contributor to mortality and morbidity in ABM, and that Csf-drainage significantly affects recovery. Both the initial Csf-drainage during EVD insertion and further drainage in the NICU have likely contributed to favorable outcome by decreasing ICP, consistent with earlier studies <xref rid="pone.0091976-Edberg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Grnde1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Additional ways of achieving ICP control may also be effective. Osmotic therapy has been suggested in earlier studies of TBI <xref rid="pone.0091976-Wijdicks1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> and ABM <xref rid="pone.0091976-Lindvall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and hypertonic saline was administered to 40% of the patients in the present study. The use of Mannitol for osmotic treatment of elevated ICP is controversial because of a potential risk of rebound increase in ICP <xref rid="pone.0091976-Grande1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Hyperventilation was performed in 13 cases in our study indicating that this strategy may be valuable, especially during hyperaemia, as suggested earlier <xref rid="pone.0091976-Edberg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>All these treatments require some modality of ICP measurement. This was achieved by an EVD in the vast majority of patients in our study. However, an EVD could not be applied in three cases due to severe coagulopathy showing the limited utility of neuro-intervention in cases with severely disturbed hemostasis, which may occur especially in meningococcal disease. In cases with moderate coagulopathy a parenchymal ICP-monitor may be an alternative option <xref rid="pone.0091976-Lindvall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Favorable outcome has recently been reported in 11 adults with severe ABM by means of lumbar Csf-drainage, a method associated with decreased risk of complications but less appropriate ICP-monitoring compared with an EVD or a parenchymal ICP-monitor <xref rid="pone.0091976-Abulhasan1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Early and adequate management of ABM is vital. Correct treatment is, in clinical practice, often delayed until LP has been performed <xref rid="pone.0091976-vandeBeek2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Gopal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0091976-Proulx1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In this study, rapid diagnosis was achieved in the vast majority of patients by comparably early LP. This contributed to early antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment in both study groups. Importantly, significant LP associated complications were not noticed in the present study. Additionally in our study, the preliminary inclusion criteria we applied have likely contributed to early neuro-intervention (median 8.5h from admission), compared to NICU-treated patients outside the Stockholm region (according to SQRM) with a mortality of 25% in this study, and those NICU treated cases in the earlier studies with mortality rates of about 30% <xref rid="pone.0091976-Edberg1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Lindvall1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. A high diagnostic accuracy (97%) was seen with our preliminary criteria of clinical signs with or without Csf-analysis. Furthermore, measurement of lumbar pressure was instrumental to inclusion of two cases. Although not observed in our study, EVD-insertion may cause side effects <xref rid="pone.0091976-Gardner1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Scheithauer1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref> which further emphasizes the significance of rapid and reliable ABM-diagnosis. In aggregate, the timing of neuro-intervention and the inclusion criteria, enabling early identification of patients at risk, may be important to achieve favorable outcome.</p><p>Some limitations were identified of the present study: The main limitation is the lack of randomization. Controls were identified retrospectively, but they had been prospectively included in the SQRM database comprising inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as outcome information. The majority of controls were included according to RLS, whereas all patients in the intervention group were included according to GCS. This discrepancy could cause a bias, but the GCS is reliably converted to RLS <xref rid="pone.0091976-Starmark2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. A study protocol was lacking for controls and care differs at various centers, as it relates to institutional protocols as well as the availability of subspecialists. Therefore, extrapolating outcomes in different settings may be questionable. However, the control group received standard intensive care according to current guidelines, and specialists in infectious diseases were involved in all cases, and other specialists were consulted when appropriate. Furthermore, outcome among controls was favourable in comparison with recent studies of ABM with severely impaired consciousness <xref rid="pone.0091976-Dzupova1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Weisfelt1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Great attention was paid to include all consecutive patients nationwide outside Stockholm as controls to avoid selection bias. The initial intention was to match the controls for age, etiology and mental status, but all eligible patients that fulfilled the inclusion criteria had to be included due to limited number of cases. Twelve Stockholm-cases were missed for neuro-intervention, and 20 patients were excluded from the final control group because of NICU-treatment outside Stockholm. Thus, a possible selection bias cannot be ruled out. However, ICP-targeted treatment was not withheld due to poor prognosis in any of these controls. Moreover, if the Stockholm-cases missed for intervention, and/or if the NICU-treated patients outside Stockholm were included in the control group, the significant difference in outcome between the treatment group and controls did not change.</p><p>Finally, 23% of the patients, registered in SQRM, were eligible for the present study, i.e. presented with severely impaired mental status on admission, and about half of the patients, included in the study, were comatose (GCS &#x02264;7 and/or RLS &#x02265;5). These proportions of cases with severely impaired mental status and coma, respectively, are consistent with earlier findings on admission of large materials with adult ABM <xref rid="pone.0091976-vandeBeek2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Dzupova1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Proulx1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0091976-Lepur1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, indicating that the study population was representative. Non-meningococcal etiology is shown to be a risk factor for unfavorable outcome <xref rid="pone.0091976-vandeBeek2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the present study, equal proportions (15%) of meningococcal etiologies were found in the two groups, but the percentage of pneumococcal ABM was higher in the intervention group (79% versus 68%). In contrast, more cases with other bacteria were found in the control group. However, it is unlikely that this difference in etiology was a confounder, and if so would favor the control group, as mortality is higher among pneumococcal ABM.</p><p>In conclusion, although the limitations should be considered, the two study groups were clinically comparable, and all the controls were treated adequately with antibiotics, corticosteroids and standard intensive care according to current guidelines. The large decrease in mortality and increase of favorable outcome, support the benefit of neuro-intervention in selected ABM cases. Despite lacking a randomized clinical trial, we suggest that early ICP-specific treatment in NICU with Csf-drainage should be considered on admission in patients with ABM and severely impaired mental status. A randomized study on ICP-targeted treatment versus traditional standard of care in ABM would be desirable. However, the unequivocal results of this study make Csf-drainage as a basic treatment modality difficult to exclude. Therefore, a study comparing Csf-drainage by EVD with lumbar drainage would be more appropriate.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0091976-deGans1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
