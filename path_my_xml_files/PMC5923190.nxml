The adoption of regular physical activity (PA) and a healthy diet are essential lifestyle behaviours to reduce this risk. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) involves the development, implementation and evaluation of a PA and nutrition programme for community-dwelling Singaporean women who currently attend recreational centres (RCs are public facilities supporting social leisure activities) in their local area. The intervention will be developed after conducting formative evaluation with RC attendees and managers through focus group discussions and pilot testing of resources (i.e. surveys, accelerometers, and&#x000a0;health booklets). Programme ambassadors (trained, certified fitness instructors and nutritionists) will deliver all sessions in English and Mandarin; implement classes to meet participants&#x02019; varying needs; and conduct sessions at different times at convenient venues. Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) has been selected as the theoretical framework to inform intervention strategies as it explores the interactions of human behaviour with the environment and has been found to be valuable when developing behavioural change interventions particularly in older adults (J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci 67B(1):18&#x02013;26, 2012; Obesity Reviews 15(12):983&#x02013;95, 2014). Its major construct, self-efficacy, is invaluable in achieving successful behaviour change, such as increasing levels of PA or improving dietary intake (Trials. 2017; 10.1186/s13063-016-1771-9; Psychol Health Med 18(6):714&#x02013;24, 2013).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">The development and implementation of the PA and nutrition intervention strategies will be guided by SCT and Motivational interviewing (MI) and implemented by trained programme ambassadors at the RCs. Sixty RCs located in Singapore will be selected from five major geographical districts and randomly allocated to the intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 30) or control (<italic>n</italic> = 30) cluster. A sample of 600 (intervention <italic>n</italic> = 300; control <italic>n</italic> = 300) women aged 50 years and above will then be recruited from these 60 centres and only the intervention group will be enrolled into the PA and nutrition intervention. It is hypothesised that by the end of the intervention, the intervention group participants compared to the control group will show significantly greater improvements in the following outcome variables: PA and dietary behaviours, health-related quality of life, objective measures of PA, anthropometric, lipid and glucose profiles. Data will be collected at baseline and 6 months and analysed using mixed regression models.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">It is anticipated that recruitment, retention and compliance of participants will be challenging due to the target group being unfamiliar with such community-based research programmes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12617001022358.

Compared to men, Singaporean women have a longer life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. They also have an increased risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), especially for those women aged 45 years and above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Older women have been identified as a priority group to target in reducing the risk factors for all NCDs as the prevalence of high blood pressure (BP), cholesterol and diabetes (type 2) rise sharply for women from their 30s into their 60s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, compared to men, women living in Singapore aged 50 to 69 years have higher levels of abdominal fat (54% versus 9% in men), obesity (11% versus 8% in men), and lower levels of desirable highdensity lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), which is protective against atherosclerosis (5% versus 10% in men) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Unhealthy lifestyle practices among these women, such as the high consumption of readily available low-nutrient, energy dense meals and physical inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], contribute to their high rates of NCDs.</p><p id="Par27">Adequate levels of physical activity&#x000a0;(PA) and a nutritious diet have been recognised as crucial lifestyle factors for the prevention of NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, based on the National Health Survey, Singaporean women aged over 50 years reported: (1) high levels of leisure time physical inactivity (72%), (2) low levels of regular exercise (16%) and (3) do not meet the recommended levels of PA for health benefit (39%) [6]. Reasons for low levels of participation include: a lack of time due to work and child commitments (47%); perception of doing adequate PA from undertaking housework (23%); and a lack of interest (16%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Results from the 2010 Singaporean National Nutrition Survey also revealed that a high proportion of Singaporean women aged 50&#x02013;69 years have macronutrients intake exceeding the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for energy (58%), total fat (57%), saturated fat (67%), carbohydrate (54%) and protein (71%); but only 62% of them met the RDA for dietary fibre intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, a lower percentage of these women met the recommended serving guidelines for vegetables (26%), fruits (34%), wholegrains (43%) and fare only slightly better for rice and alternatives (50%) as well as the meat and alternatives food groups (51%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Most Singaporeans (&#x0003e;&#x02009;80%), including older adults, reside with their families in dense, affordable public housing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recreational centers (RCs) are built within this public housing to provide a venue for residents to come together with the intention of fostering community cohesiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. These RCs are in close proximity and easily accessed, providing an ideal setting to reach the target group and implement and evaluate a community-based PA and nutrition intervention for older women.</p><p id="Par29">Despite the evidence that healthy lifestyle behaviours are linked to a reduction in NCDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], limited community-based intervention research has been undertaken in the over-50s target group in Asian communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The findings reported in the academic literature on the effectiveness of the PA and nutrition strategies in community-based interventions typically originate from Canada, US, Europe and Australia. For example, a systematic review of 17 community-based interventions indicated that PA and nutrition interventions incorporating face-to-face counselling and group session modes of delivery were most effective in a community-based setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Another review of nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) reported that nutrition counselling involving active participation in health planning, goal setting, self-efficacy and collaboration were effective in influencing positive nutrition outcomes for older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], while face-to-face meetings were found to be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] due to the relationships that form during the exchange of information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Significant improvement in dietary behaviour and PA levels has been observed in recent health interventions targeting older healthy adults in Asia using Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, a systematic review of SCT in interventions confirmed that it provided a practical and adequate theoretical framework for guiding early phases of intervention development for chronic health conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, the proposed cluster RCT of SCT-based PA and nutrition intervention aims to develop and implement a culturally appropriate intervention to reduce the risk factors associated with NCDs for women aged 50 years and above who utilise RCs. It is hypothesised that levels of PA and dietary behaviours, lipid profiles and fasting blood glucose (BG) levels, as well as anthropometric measures, will demonstrate statistically significant improvements in the intervention group, when compared with the control group after the 6-month intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par30">A 6-month, community-based PA and nutrition cluster RCT suited to the Singaporean context will be implemented and evaluated over two time points (baseline and 6 months); see Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

To enhance the chance of recruiting participants into the intervention programme, three out of the five districts were randomly allocated to the intervention cluster (by drawing names from a bag) and the remaining two districts to the control cluster. The process resulted in the intervention sites (districts: 2-North West, 3-Central, and 5-South East) and control sites (districts: 1-South West, and&#x000a0;4-North East). Sixty RCs (intervention <italic>n</italic> = 30, control <italic>n</italic> = 30) will be randomly selected from these geographical districts. Due to the differences in the number of RCs within the districts, approximately 9&#x02013;12% of the listed RCs in each district will be chosen using computer-generated random numbers. These RCs will have a minimum separation distance of 4 km to avoid risk of contamination between intervention and control groups.
