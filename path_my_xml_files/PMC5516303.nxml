However, due to the failure of insulin dose titration and fear of hypoglycemia, insulin treatment is perceived as a complex and reluctant therapy by both patients and doctors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To overcome these barriers, frequent and intensive self-monitoring of glucose and detailed feedback on insulin dosage are critical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, there is a strong clinical need for a technological approach to enhance the timely communication between patients and their healthcare providers about insulin therapy. Several studies have reported the efficacy of telephone counseling or text messaging based on paper-based collection of self-monitored glucose data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], rather than automatic transmission of glucose data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In contrast, there have been several randomized controlled trials of bolus-calculator applications in patients with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, most of these studies used applications without automatic data uploading functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and there have been continuous concerns regarding the safety of bolus calculator applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Until the safety of automated insulin dose calculator applications is sufficiently documented, there is a clinical need for mobile applications to enhance patient education around insulin dose adjustment.</p><p id="Par18">A personal health record (PHR) is an online application that allows patients to access, manage, and share their own health data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Unlike in self-care medical applications, focusing on incomplete self-care data, providing little useful information to clinicians, PHR not only enhances shared decision making with healthcare providers in actual clinical practice, but also enables remote monitoring and at-home-collection of detailed data in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. These benefits of PHRs in both clinical practice and trials can be maximized in the education of insulin dose adjustment for patients with DM who are starting or intensifying their insulin regimen, as frequent self-monitoring of glucose level, self-adjustment of insulin dose, and at-home data collection with minimized visits to the hospital are important for description of details on glycemic control, including hypoglycemia, diet, and activity. However, the role of PHR in patients starting or intensifying insulin therapy has received less attention than in patients with early-stage T2DM, despite the strong clinical need for PHR in patients with T1DM or insulin-treated T2DM.</p><p id="Par19">The aim of this study is to examine the efficacy and safety of insulin dose adjustment education based on a smartphone PHR in patients with DM who initiate or intensify their basal insulin regimen and to confirm the validity and stability of the information and communication technology (ICT)-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system by analyzes using PHR- and questionnaire-based evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="Par20">Our primary hypothesis is that the ICT-based intervention group will produce a greater proportion of patients who reach optimal insulin dose within 12&#x000a0;weeks compared with the conventional intervention group.

There are three follow-up measures: baseline, post-intervention at week 12, and at week 24. Subjects diagnosed as T1DM, T2DM, and/or post-transplant DM who are initiating basal insulin or intensifying their insulin regimen to a basal-bolus regimen will be given education on insulin injection, dose adjustment, and prevention of hypoglycemia and will be provided a Bluetooth-enabled glucometer at visit 1 for screening. Subjects will receive instructions to measure daily glucose level using a home glucometer, to record insulin regimen and dose, complete the hypoglycemia diary in the application if blood glucose &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mg/dL or a hypoglycemic event occurs, and to synchronize data so it automatically transfers to the system. Subjects who synchronized their information daily during a 1-week run-in period will be accepted into the clinical trial and randomly assigned to either the ICT-based intervention group or the conventional intervention group at a ratio of 1:1. After randomization during week 1, telephone counselling will be provided for re-instructing insulin dose adjustment and re-confirming participants&#x02019; use of the at-home measurement device and PHR applications (visit 2; televisit). Subjects in the ICT-based intervention group will receive algorithm-based feedback messages when their glucose levels are out of the target range, in addition to recording, saving, and sending their data to the server via PHR applications. Subjects in the conventional intervention group will only record, save, and send their data to the server via PHR applications, without feedback messages. Investigators will examine the saved health information, including level of blood glucose, insulin dose, details on hypoglycemia recorded in the hypoglycemia diary, food diary, and number of steps, transferred through the PHR applications. At each clinical visit, anthropometric parameters, current medication use including insulin dose and other glucose-lowering agents, vital signs, body composition, and a questionnaire assessing satisfaction with the investigation will be examined, and blood tests will be performed.

The CRC registers the subject in the integrated management system, registers personalized conditions such as target blood glucose, and logs in the personal health record app through the newly created user ID and password. The PHR app sends login information to the home monitoring system and returns the survey ID. The home monitoring system receives user information (personal information, screening number, etc.) from the integrated management system. The PHR app sends login information and survey ID to the hospital monitoring system and automatically registers the patient. The CRC registers personalized conditions, such as target blood glucose and subject classification, in the hospital monitoring system. Blood glucose values by glucometer, step count by Samsung Health app, insulin regimen, hypoglycemia diary, and food diary inputted by the patient are transmitted to the home and hospital monitoring systems through the HL7 v2 message. Based on the received blood glucose values, the hospital monitoring system sends an algorithm-based feedback message, and the PHR app shows the feedback message. The PHR app that receives the feedback message transmits the HL7 v2 message to the home monitoring system.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system</title><p id="Par22">A centralized clinical trial monitoring system based on ICT allows the investigators to store and retrieve personal medical information transmitted from a medical device at an out-of-hospital location (e.g., at home) and to obtain reliable clinical data. This system is expected to be useful for clinical decision making (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The ICT-based centralized clinical trial monitoring system for clinical trials used in this trial consists of 1) a PHR application that acts as a gateway to identify the subjects of the clinical trial and transmit biometric information to the server; 2) at-home measurement device (Bluetooth-enabled blood glucometer); 3) a home monitoring system server where transmitted data is stored, monitored, and transferred; 4) an electronic case report form (eCRF) system (EDC) that extracts and implements the data necessary for clinical trials from the home monitoring system data; and 5) an integrated management server, in which all the above data are collected and managed. The at-home measurement device required for this clinical trial is a blood glucometer linked with Bluetooth, which measures and transmits blood glucose levels to the PHR application with every measurement. Therefore, syncing to the PHR application with Bluetooth is required to save and transmit data to the server automatically. The step count taken per day acquired by the Samsung Health application (Samsung Electronics, Korea) is automatically linked to the PHR application. The Android-based &#x02018;PHR app,&#x02019; having recently developed new functions making it capable of interoperability with a wide range of devices, transmission of PHR data to a clinical trial server, and a graphic interface for providing information to medical staff, will be applied for this clinical trial. In addition, subjects can record their insulin protocol, food diary, and &#x02018;hypoglycemia diary&#x02019; in the PHR app. The home monitoring system accumulates transferred biometric data, including blood glucose levels measured from the at-home measurement device, step count, and recorded data, including insulin regimen, food diary, and hypoglycemia diary for each registered subject through an integrated management system and transmits the data to the eCRF system via HL7 v2 message, a standardized protocol. For the ICT-based intervention group, PHR app information is sent to the investigator web page in the home monitoring system, and the investigator can view the subject&#x02019;s data. In addition, algorithm-based feedback messages are transmitted to investigators, as well as subjects in the ICT-based intervention group when blood glucose level is not within the target range. Push feedback messages generated by the home monitoring system server will be displayed on the screen of the subject&#x02019;s PHR app. eCRF is necessary for inputting and storing clinical trial data for each visit per subject through the integrated management system. Only the investigator or designated person can access the eCRF system to input, store, and examine a subject&#x02019;s data. The Clinical trial management system (CTMS) is a superordinate system for managing all data, from subject registration and randomization, for transmitting data to the home monitoring system and eCRF and for integrating and managing all data for each measurement per subject. In addition, the CTMS is responsible for the management of participating institutions and investigators, monitoring, and adverse reaction monitoring and reporting. For system data security, the PHR app, the investigator web page, the home monitoring system, the eCRF system, and the integrated CTMS all protect personal medical information and maintain high standards of confidentiality by system log recording methods through automatic logoff, control and authentication on access, data encryption, and data audits.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Study flow chart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12911_2017_507_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

The initial daily basal insulin dose will be 10&#x000a0;units per day or 0.1&#x02013;0.2&#x000a0;units per kg of body weight. The initial daily basal insulin dose can be increased when the fasting blood glucose level is 250&#x000a0;mg/dL or more at initiation, but it should not exceed 0.3&#x000a0;units per kg per day. The initial pre-prandial rapid-acting insulin dose will be 4&#x000a0;units or 0.1 unit per kg or 10% of the basal insulin dose. For patients who have already used insulin before enrollment, they will start on their previous insulin dose and adjust from there. Subjects in the study are instructed to titrate their insulin dose based on the glycemic target of fasting glucose 80&#x02013;130&#x000a0;mg/dL in the morning, for those who are under 65&#x000a0;years of age and do not have a history of severe hypoglycemia that cannot be recovered without help.

For those who are suitable for the clinical trial based on daily synchronization, block randomization will be performed. The subjects will be randomly allocated to an intervention with ICT-based centralized monitoring or not, at a ratio of 1:1, per the Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). The randomization is stratified according to the research institute (Samsung Changwon Hospital: Samsung Medical Center&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20:76) and the use of pre-prandial insulin two or more times per day.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Telephone counseling and re-introduction of intervention</title><p id="Par36">At week 1, educators provide telephone counseling to all subjects to assess concomitant medication use or any adverse events and to re-instruct insulin dose adjustment and PHR apps. Subjects who are screening failures must return the at-home measurement device to the clinic. All participants are instructed to call the diabetes educator if the measured blood glucose level is &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mg/dL more than once, or if the blood glucose level is not in the range of the glycemic target more than twice. Also, unscheduled visits to the clinic are available if a subject has one or more severe incidents of hypoglycemia (requiring other help for recovery) during the study period, hypoglycemia (&#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mg/dL) two or more times per week, or experiences fasting blood glucose &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mg/dL three or more times in the morning and wants to see a doctor during weeks 1&#x02013;12. Unscheduled visits to the clinic are also allowed for subjects who have difficulty in insulin dose adjustment, despite two or more unscheduled tele-visits. All subjects will record a 3-day food diary regarding the exchange unit for each nutrient group (e.g., grain, fish, vegetable, fat, milk, and fruit groups) in the breakfast, lunch, and dinner prior to visits 3 and 4.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>ICT-based intervention group</title><p id="Par37">Subjects allocated to the ICT-based intervention group will be informed about algorithm-based feedback messages, and that a diabetes educator can call the subject if the feedback message is not checked more than once. The detailed algorithms of the feedback messages are available in the supplementary information [Additional file <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>]. Push messages generated by the home monitoring system server will be displayed on the screen of the subject&#x02019;s PHR apps. If the synchronized blood glucose level is &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mg/dL, the hypoglycemia diary is activated automatically and can also be activated by a participant if he or she experiences symptoms of hypoglycemia. Whether hypoglycemic symptoms (e.g., cold sweating, severe hunger, shivering, and panic) have occurred, whether they occur during the night or sleep, and whether subjects need help to recover from hypoglycemia can be recorded in the hypoglycemia diary from PHR apps. Moreover, additional telephone consultation after the feedback message &#x02018;Unscheduled tele-visit&#x02019; will be performed and recorded on the &#x02018;Unscheduled tele-visit&#x02019; page of eCRF when diabetes educators check the transferred data on the administrator webpage daily and find the data meet the following criteria: 1) there is no record of blood glucose and insulin dose within 2&#x000a0;days after the feedback message; 2) the blood glucose and insulin doses recorded for 2&#x000a0;days after the feedback message do not follow the pre-informed instructions; and 3) hypoglycemia occurs, but the hypoglycemia diary is not recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Data acquisition and evaluation</title><p id="Par38">For all subjects, at each clinical visit, anthropometric parameters, current medication use (including types of insulin and insulin dose), hypoglycemic events, vital signs, body composition, questionnaire for satisfaction with the investigation, and any adverse events are examined, and blood tests are performed. The mean duration of medical consultations by a doctor at an outpatient clinic and the number and mean duration of telephone counselling calls by diabetes educators are also evaluated. Prior to the post-interventional clinical visit at weeks 12 and 24, a clinical research coordinator (CRC) will check whether subjects continuously run and synchronize their PHR apps, the number of synchronizations, transmitted data of insulin dose, parameters regarding hypoglycemia and the 3-day food diary, and the measured number of steps taken during weeks 1&#x02013;12 and weeks 13&#x02013;24 in both intervention groups. For the ICT-based intervention group, the CRC will identify the types of algorithm-based feedback messages, whether subjects act on the feedback, and the recorded data from the hypoglycemia diary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Evaluation of hypoglycemia</title><p id="Par39">Hypoglycemia is defined using the following criteria: 1) asymptomatic hypoglycemia (if blood glucose is measured as &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mg/dL without clinical symptoms); 2) symptomatic hypoglycemia (the symptoms of hypoglycemia (e.g., sweating, severe hunger, shivering, and panic) including blood glucose level&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;70&#x000a0;mg/dL or not confirmed); 3) daytime hypoglycemia (7&#x000a0;am-11&#x000a0;pm; hypoglycemia before sleep after the wake-up); 4) nocturnal hypoglycemia (11&#x000a0;pm-7&#x000a0;am; hypoglycemia from sleep to wake-up); 5) severe hypoglycemia (help is needed to restore glucose level). If subjects have hypoglycemia meeting the above criteria, they use the hypoglycemia diary in the PHR app to record the details of the hypoglycemic event.

In addition, PHR not only allows for shared decision making on insulin dose adjustment, but also allows for detailed remote data collection, including blood glucose level, daily insulin dose, and life logs with minimized human effort to collect data via face-to-face interviews and/or paper-based records [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, PHR will also be used in a conventional intervention group for data collection, with the automated feedback feature disabled. This study thus will provide a valuable opportunity to evaluate the stability of PHR-based collection of life log variables and to establish the role of PHR in ICT-based centralized clinical trials based on remote patient monitoring.</p><p id="Par49">With a large database of PHR from patients, effective access, handling, and storage of the data by an ICT-based centralized monitoring system are needed to approve its efficacy and safety. In the previous study regarding PHR among subjects starting basal insulin, patients used dedicated tablet computers for viewing their glucose patterns; however, the tablets were inconvenient to carry and often experienced difficulties connecting with the server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In the previous study, the control group was not allocated to use PHR, so a direct comparison of the PHR-based intervention with the conventional intervention was not possible, as the method of data collection was not identical between the groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. HbA1c and DTSQ evaluation were the outcome variables of the study, similar to our trial, but the PHR-based collection of hypoglycemia data, which is important for insulin users, was not attempted in the previous study. Therefore, the results of the current ICT-based centralized clinical trial can provide new perspectives in PHR-based clinical trials for patients requiring self-adjustment of insulin dose.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec34"><p>
