Models were fitted to the physicians' global assessment score and triglycerides over time. Five hundred trials were simulated to evaluate the relevance of findings. Analyses clarified that the optimal dose of alitretinoin was 30 mg once daily, where response rates were &#x0223c;10% over placebo at 12 weeks and increased by 5&#x02013;7% over placebo for every 4 weeks thereafter, for up to 24 weeks. Elderly subjects had higher magnitudes of efficacy and an increased probability of high triglycerides. Results from analyses sufficiently addressed the development issues, thereby adding to the weight of evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of alitretinoin in the treatment of severe, refractory chronic hand eczema.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Alitretinoin (BAL4079, 9-<italic>cis</italic> retinoic acid, Toctin), a physiological metabolite of vitamin A, is an investigational product in the US for the treatment of severe chronic hand eczema (CHE) refractory to treatment with potent topical corticosteroids. The product is already approved in 31 countries based on a phase II study (BAP00003<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and a phase III study (BAP00089<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). GlaxoSmithKline (GSK, Research Triangle Park, NC) acquired alitretinoin after a second phase III study (BAP01346<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) was conducted to provide additional independent substantiation of the phase III study results for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

The triglycerides LDR model was developed and validated using MD and MV datasets, respectively, using NONMEM with postprocessing within <italic>R</italic>. The time-to-event model was developed with the entire dataset (MD+MV datasets) using SAS (Cary, NC).</p><p>The triglycerides LDR model was fit to all triglycerides during treatment using the following equation:

The data supported IIV parameters on BAS and AL1, using proportional error models and residual error using a proportional error model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Figure S6</xref></bold>).</p><p>Covariate analyses were conducted using forward addition and backward elimination as described for efficacy, assuming that the selected covariates could have a potential impact on the BAS and/or AL1. Because food is an important covariate known to affect the baseline triglycerides; fasted/fed status was not collected in BAP00003, and triglycerides from the 40 mg dose in this study could help with dose selection, a mixture model was used to describe the fed status for subjects in this study (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Figure S6</xref></bold>). The mixture model was possible because other studies included many more subjects than the phase II study and included a reasonable distribution of fasted triglycerides (2/3<sup>rd</sup>) and unfasted triglycerides (1/3<sup>rd</sup>).</p><p>Model performance was evaluated using similar internal and external approaches. In addition, using the final model developed by using the MD dataset, individual empirical Bayes estimates of triglycerides for the MV dataset were estimated; the distribution of the difference was estimated and compared to zero using a <italic>t</italic> statistic.</p><p>For the time-to-event model, the triglycerides for each individual at each measured time were classified as 0 (&#x02264;200 mg/dL) or 1 (&#x0003e;200 mg/dL), with those who did not experience the event during the study duration classified as censored. Data were analyzed using a Kaplan&#x02013;Meier approach to identify the shape of the survival function and whether or not the survivals in the subpopulations are proportional.</p><p>The formal time-to-event analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazards model using SAS where the model was semiparametric (baseline hazard can take any form, but covariates enter the model linearly). Covariates were added using a stepwise process using the same criteria as for the LDR model. Fed/fasted status was assigned based on either the known status or the assigned status from the mixture model within the LDR model for those with unknown fed/fasted status.</p><p>The GoF for the time-to-event model was performed using the analysis of the Martingale residuals distribution,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which should be linear against the individual estimate of predictors (covariates) if the model is appropriate.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical trial simulations (CTS)</title><p>CTS were conducted, assuming 100 subjects per arm (placebo and alitretinoin 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, and 40 mg once daily for 24 weeks) to address the clinical relevance of each statistically significant finding for PGA and triglycerides.

These analysis supplement phase III study results and provide insight to address development issues raised upon acquiring alitretinoin regarding dose selection, duration of treatment, design features (e.g., run-in period, baseline pruritus/pain), and subgroups. Phase II/III studies of alitretinoin showed dose-related clinically meaningful benefits at EOT and safety/tolerability consistent with oral retinoids.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The dose&#x02013;response analyses corroborated the findings from BAP00089 and showed that the optimal dose of alitretinoin for treatment of severe, refractory CHE was 30 mg once daily. The LDR model also showed that there was no relationship between the duration of treatment and relapse status at 24 weeks in responders at EOT. Thus, there was no added benefit to continuing treatment once patients had responded and the optimal duration of treatment is 12 to 24 weeks, with discontinuation upon &#x0201c;clear&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;almost clear&#x0201d; hands.</p><p>The triglycerides analyses showed a dose-related increase in triglycerides and the time to triglycerides &#x0003e;200 mg/dL, supporting the 30 mg dose as the optimal dose.

Thus, the analysis supports that this run-in period was not responsible for differences in efficacy seen between two phase III studies<sup>2,3</sup> (where subjects in BAP00089 had a history of being refractory to potent topical corticosteroids, while those in BAP01346 had refractory status confirmed as part of the clinical study).
</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x025cb; Subjects with more severe disease or those with a longer duration of present condition were less likely to respond and had slower onsets of effect. Importantly, each subgroup still experienced clinically meaningful benefit.
</p></list-item></list></p><p>Age was the most clinically relevant covariate, where elderly subjects responded to treatment faster, with a higher response rate at EOT, and less relapsers 24 weeks posttreatment. As expected, baseline triglycerides were higher in elderly patients. Alitretinoin-induced increases in triglycerides were also higher in elderly subjects (62&#x02013;80 mg/dL&#x02191; in a 75-year-old subject relative to placebo), which was reduced to 36&#x02013;45 mg/dL with 20 mg. The time to reach triglycerides &#x0003e;200 mg/dL was faster in elderly subjects and more commonly occurred between 12&#x02013;24 weeks. The efficacy and tolerability differences observed in the elderly population did not appear to be related to pharmacokinetic differences. Thus, since elderly patients responded earlier and had more pronounced efficacy, they may require shorter treatment durations, thus avoiding reaching the triglycerides &#x0003e;200 mg/dL, even if receiving alitretinoin 30 mg. Triglycerides can be monitored with a dose reduction if required.</p><p>There were higher median triglycerides observed during alitretinoin treatment in obese subjects which were driven by higher baseline triglycerides, and not a clinically significant increase (&#x0003c;10 mg/dL) in the alitretinoin-induced increase in triglycerides, except in elderly obese subjects.</p><p>Mild to moderate renal impairment did not affect efficacy or triglycerides during alitretinoin treatment. Because a pharmacokinetic study was not conducted on renal impairment, insight into the effect of mild or moderate renal impairment was gained from the analyses. These analyses included data from a substantial number of subjects in both categories: &#x02265;523 and &#x02265;81 subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment, respectively, and can be used to support the recommendation that no initial dosage adjustments are needed in subjects with mild to moderate renal impairment.</p><p>Protocol design posttreatment (e.g., collection of PGA in responders only, potential use of topical corticosteroids) and the fact that there were fewer responders receiving placebo than active treatment limited conclusions from the analysis. The VPCs posttreatment showed good agreement between observed and predicted data for alitretinoin, where there were more data. Therefore, data posttreatment were only used descriptively to estimate how many subjects receiving alitretinoin 30 mg who were responders at the EOT would be expected to develop severe disease 24 weeks posttreatment and potentially be eligible for retreatment, if refractory.</p><p>The triglycerides analysis was limited by the unknown fed/fasting in the phase II study, where higher doses were studied. While the unavailability of fed/fasted status is not ideal, a mixture model was able to match subjects' data to the most likely situation, as indicated by the precision of the estimates and the reasonable GoF of the model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd1">Table S3</xref></bold>). Therefore, the lack of information on fed/fasted state in the phase II study did not bias the conclusions around the optimal dose or the effects of various covariates on triglycerides.</p><p>In summary, this LDR analyses provided insight about the optimal dose and duration of treatment, addressed questions around study design features and subpopulations, and added to the weight of evidence for efficacy and safety/tolerability of alitretinoin in severe, refractory CHE.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><sec><title>WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02713;Phase II/III studies of alitretinoin demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit at end of treatment in severe chronic hand eczema refractory to potent topical corticosteroids.
