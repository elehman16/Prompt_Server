The cause of this increase is not known. An in vivo drug efficacy trial was conducted to determine whether increased treatment failure rates may have contributed to the apparent increase in malaria diagnoses.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In an open-randomized non-inferiority trial, the efficacy of artesunate&#x02013;amodiaquine (ASAQ) was compared to artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (AL) for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in 288 children aged 6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months. Included children had directly supervised treatment and were then followed for 42&#x000a0;days with weekly clinical and parasitological evaluations. The blood samples of children found to have recurring parasitaemia within 42&#x000a0;days were checked by PCR to confirm whether or not this was due to reinfection or recrudescence (i.e. treatment failure).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Out of 873 children screened, 585 (67&#x000a0;%) were excluded and 288 children were randomized to either ASAQ or AL. At day 42 of follow up, the treatment efficacy of ASAQ was 78&#x000a0;% before and 95&#x000a0;% after PCR correction for re-infections. In the AL-arm, treatment efficacy was 84&#x000a0;% before and 99.0&#x000a0;% after PCR correction. Treatment efficacy after PCR correction was within the margin of non-inferiority as set for this study. Fewer children in the AL arm reported adverse reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>ASAQ is still effective as a treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Baraka, South Kivu, DRC. In this region, AL may have higher efficacy but additional trials are required to draw this conclusion with confidence.

The eastern part of DRC is suffering from armed conflict and internal political instability. The conflict has caused massive suffering for civilians, with estimates of millions of deaths, directly or indirectly, as a result of the fighting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this humanitarian crisis there are acute health needs, with limited access to humanitarian assistance and violations of basic rights and freedoms. A survey conducted in 2014 in South Kivu indicated a crude mortality rate (CMR) of 2.80 per 10,000 per day [95&#x000a0;% CI (2.40&#x02013;3.28)] and an under-five mortality rate (&#x0003c;5MR) of 5.58 per 10,000 per day [95&#x000a0;% CI (4.60&#x02013;6.76)]. Both of these mortality rates are more than two times above the emergency threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>M&#x000e9;decins sans Fronti&#x000e8;res&#x02013;Operational Centre Amsterdam (MSF-OCA or MSF) has been working in the provinces of North Kivu and South Kivu since the early 1990s and in Katanga since 2003 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In South Kivu, MSF supports primary and secondary health care in the Baraka and Kimbi hospitals and in six health centres, and provides response to outbreaks and emergencies.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Map of the Democratic Republic of Congo</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2016_1444_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Malaria is holo-endemic in most of DRC, with seasonal fluctuations in transmission intensity in the east and south of the country. <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is the predominant species causing malaria in DRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Since 2003, MSF has introduced artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) in all programmes worldwide. Artesunate&#x02013;amodiaquine (ASAQ) has been the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in DRC since 2005. Artemether&#x02013;lumefantrine (AL) is the second line treatment for uncomplicated malaria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Targeted distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets (LLIN) to pregnant women and children hospitalized for severe malaria has been ongoing since 2003 in the MSF Baraka programme. The last mass LLIN distribution in this health zone was carried out in 2012.</p><p>Since 2009, MSF has seen an apparent rise in malaria incidence in most programmes in DRC. The National Malaria Control Programme (Programme National de Lutte contre le Paludisme, PNLP) has also observed an increase in malaria cases. In the Baraka programme, without any significant changes to the programme activities, the number of parasitologically confirmed uncomplicated malaria cases has risen from 7457 in 2009 to 44,317 cases in 2012 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In order to investigate whether the observed increase in malaria over the years was associated with increased treatment failure rates, the efficacy of the first-line treatment, ASAQ was evaluated, and compared to that of AL in children aged 6&#x02013;59&#x000a0;months with confirmed uncomplicated falciparum malaria.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Confirmed malaria cases in Baraka project 2009&#x02013;2012, DRC</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2016_1444_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and site</title><p>An open-randomized non-inferiority trial comparing the efficacy of ASAQ to that of AL for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, in children aged between six and 59&#x000a0;months, was conducted following the World Health Organization (WHO) protocols for surveillance of anti-malarial drug efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

A thick and a thin blood smear were performed and capillary blood was collected on a fast technology for analysis (FTA) card (Whatmann, UK). If the patient was eligible, informed consent was requested from the parent/caretaker after the explanation of the study by one of the study team members. Once the informed consent was obtained, patients were randomized to one of two treatment regimens according to which treatment had been randomly pre-allocated to that unique patient number. Treatment regimens consisted of: (1) ASAQ fixed dose (Winthrop Sanofi Aventis), given as 1 tab/day over three days (&#x02265;5&#x02013;&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;9&#x000a0;kg, 1 tab of 25&#x000a0;mg artesunate/67.5&#x000a0;mg amodiaquine base;&#x000a0;&#x02265;9&#x02013;&#x0003c;18&#x000a0;kg, 50&#x000a0;mg artesunate/135&#x000a0;mg amodiaquine base), or (2) AL fixed combination (Coartem<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 20&#x000a0;mg artemether/120&#x000a0;mg lumefantrine, Novartis) given with milk twice daily over three days (&#x02265;5&#x02013;&#x000a0;&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;kg, 1 tab of 20&#x000a0;mg artemether/120&#x000a0;mg lumefantrine BD,&#x000a0;&#x02265;15&#x02013;&#x0003c;25&#x000a0;kg, 2 tabs of 20&#x000a0;mg artemether/120&#x000a0;mg lumefantrine BD with fatty food) over 3&#x000a0;days. Drugs were given according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions and dosage. Study medication was imported and stored under strict regulations, ensuring control within the provided storage temperature and humidity ranges. The first dose of the study drug at day 0 (D0) was dispensed at the health clinic, and was taken by the child while under supervision of a study team member. For children who could not swallow tablets, AL tablets were dissolved, and ASAQ tablets were crushed in minimal amounts of water and dispensed with a spoon. After intake, the child was observed for 30&#x000a0;min. If the child vomited or spat out the medication within the monitoring period, a resting period of 15&#x000a0;min was observed before re-administering a repeat dose. If the repeat dose was also vomited within 30 min, the child was administered a rescue treatment (which was defined as the alternative treatment that the child was not randomized to) and was excluded from the study. Patients returned to the clinic on days 1 and 2 for observed administration of the study drug and a clinical assessment. In order to observe the intake of the evening doses of AL, patients randomized to receive AL were visited at home at around 8&#x000a0;h, 32&#x000a0;h and 56&#x000a0;h after the first dose.

Of the children who received their full course of supervised treatment (257), 19 children (7.0&#x000a0;%) did not reach an analysable end result (censored), either due to being lost to follow up (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8), having had an anti-malarial administered by a 3<sup>rd</sup> party (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9), or having been re-infected with a malaria species other than <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Trial profile efficacy study ASAQ&#x02013;AL, Baraka, DRC</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12936_2016_1444_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p>The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled in the study are presented in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

Although this study confirms that both artemisinin-based combinations retain good efficacy in this part of DRC, it does, however, demonstrate high re-infection levels. After PCR correction, this study showed that, over 6&#x000a0;weeks, 21/119 children (17.6&#x000a0;%) of those who were on ASAQ and 15/119 (12.6&#x000a0;%) of the children in the AL treatment group (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.29) were re-infected within 42&#x000a0;days.</p><p>Whilst re-infections do not indicate failing anti-malarial drugs, they are of public health relevance and pose a considerable burden to the population and health systems. The results of this study seem to support recent findings that the period over which lumefantrine and amodiaquine provide post-treatment protection is 10&#x02013;14&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, considering the public health impact of frequent malaria infections in infants, it would be useful to do further analysis into the specific protective period for each of ASAQ and AL in this setting. It is also worth considering if the use of an ACT with a longer protective half-life, such as dihydroartemisinin&#x02013;piperaquine, may be beneficial to prevent malaria episodes in the study population, exposed to intense malaria transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>In this study&#x02019;s setting children will normally receive ASAQ each time they have a malaria infection. Reassuringly, Yeka et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] showed that repeated treatment using both ASAQ and AL is effective, safe and well-tolerated in children under 5&#x000a0;years of age and in a similar context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>With regards to tolerability, there were no serious adverse events registered during the trial. Asthenia and anorexia were the most commonly recorded minor adverse events with a marked difference between the two drugs. It was shown by the results of this study that AL was better tolerated. During the study it was observed that the parents/caretakers would prefer that their child be randomized to AL rather than ASAQ as the former was perceived as more tolerable by the children. In fact, the chance to be randomized to receive AL seemed to be a major driving force to participate in the study. Although asthenia and anorexia may be classified as minor adverse effects, it can have a negative effect on adherence, and thus prevent a complete cure.</p><p>There was a relatively high proportion (67&#x000a0;%) of children excluded from the study at the time of screening. There were two major reasons for exclusion: the high number of children with co-morbidities, and the high number of children who had taken ACT in the previous 28&#x000a0;days (either from a clinic or from a private vendor). In the children with co-morbidities, it is not clear what relation malaria had to their clinical illness; the children could be presenting with clinical illness due to malaria, or have symptoms primarily from their co-morbidity but happen to have malaria parasites. This is a dilemma that is faced often in the field, and may lead to an overestimation of the burden of malaria. Furthermore, an RDT for malaria is often performed as a first means of triage for fever, and when the test is positive, there is the risk that the child may not be adequately examined for other illnesses. In this study, 49 of the 873 (5.6&#x000a0;%) children with a positive RDT (based on HRP2 detection) had a negative thick smear. This could be the result of circulating HRP2 from a previous, well treated malaria infection. This is expected considering that Grandesso et al. (internal communication, Clinical Trial.gov Identifier NCT01325974) have shown that over 50&#x000a0;% of HRP2 RDTs remain positive more than 6&#x000a0;weeks after adequate treatment of a malaria infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p>ASAQ is still effective as a treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Baraka, South Kivu, DRC, 9&#x000a0;years after its introduction as a first-line treatment.

AL may have higher efficacy but additional trials are required to draw this conclusion with confidence. There is a high rate of re-infection in South-Kivu within six weeks of adequate treatment of either ASAQ or AL, indicating intense malaria transmission. AL was better tolerated by patients than ASAQ. Although earlier estimates of anti-malarial drug efficacy are unavailable for the current population, the high efficacy of ASAQ makes it unlikely that declining drug efficacy is a reason for the apparent increase in malaria cases observed in the region.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12936_2016_1444_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>

If the parent/caretaker was illiterate, a literate witness was asked to sign next to the parent/caretaker&#x02019;s fingerprint. Free health care for malaria and other illnesses is provided by MSF to the general population and was therefore also provided throughout the study follow-up period to all patients included in the study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>Funding</title><p>The study was funded by MSF-OCA.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><source>World malaria report 2013</source><year>2013</year><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Heath Organization</publisher-name><fpage>256</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coghlan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Brennan</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Ngoy</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Dofara</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Otto</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Clements</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Mortality in the Democratic Republic of Congo: a nationwide survey</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2006</year><volume>367</volume><fpage>44</fpage><lpage>51</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(06)67923-3</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16399152</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR3"><label>3.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coghlan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Ngoy</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mulumba</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Hardy</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Bemo</surname><given-names>VN</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Update on mortality in the Democratic Republic of Congo: results from a third nationwide survey</article-title><source>Disaster Med Public Health Prep.</source><year>2009</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>88</fpage><lpage>96</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/DMP.0b013e3181a6e952</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19491603</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR4"><label>4.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lenglet</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><source>Retrospective Mortality Survey in the MSF Catchment Area in Fizi Health Zone, South Kivu</source><year>2014</year><publisher-loc>Amsterdam</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Democratic Republic of Congo</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR5"><label>5.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><source>Malaria Country Profile DRC</source><year>2014</year><publisher-loc>Geneva</publisher-loc><publisher-name>World Heath Organization</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR6"><label>6.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">PNLP DRC.
