Introduction</title><p>There is now substantial support for pain management programs for chronic pain.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> There is also a growing recognition that many people are unable to access these programs when they are administered in their traditional face-to-face format.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Barriers to accessing face-to-face programs are numerous and include costs, mobility limitations, stigma, availability, and long waiting lists. Consequently, many people fail to receive or experience considerable delays in accessing evidence-based care.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>One innovative approach with the potential to increase access to pain management programs is delivery through the internet.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> Internet-delivered programs use the same principles, content, and components as face-to-face programs but can be provided with varying levels of clinician support ranging from regular clinician contact through e-mail or telephone to no clinician support at all.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> To date, the majority of internet-delivered programs for chronic pain have been based on cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) (eg, 7,8,10,12,15,41,56) but some are emerging based on mindfulness and acceptance therapies (eg, 9,18,23). Systematic reviews and a meta-analysis have found evidence of small but clinically significant improvements in the primary domains targeted in pain management programs (eg, disability, anxiety, depression).<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> However, as with face-to-face programs,<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> clinical improvements have not been consistently observed in all studies and the magnitude of improvements has varied considerably across studies.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup></p><p>One explanation for the inconsistent outcomes of internet-delivered programs for chronic pain has been the absence of regular clinician support in most studies.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Highlighting this, one of the only studies (n = 62) to examine a CBT program involving regular clinical support (ie, average 81 minutes per participant), the <italic>Pain Course</italic>, found very high completion and satisfaction rates as well as moderate-to-large improvements across the primary domains of anxiety, depression, and disability.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, challenging the importance of clinical support, several studies in the broader mental health literature have started to report good clinical outcomes without clinician support (eg,4,5,50,51). This has led a recent review to suggest that clinician support may be less important where internet-delivered programs are sufficiently credible, engaging, of a high quality and involve some level of screening for suitability.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Unfortunately, no studies have directly examined these issues or the importance of clinician support in the context of internet-delivered pain management programs.</p><p>The present study sought to replicate the results of the initial trial of the <italic>Pain Course</italic> and examine its efficacy when provided with different levels of clinical support. After a brief screening interview, participants were randomised to 1 of 4 groups: (1) Regular Contact Group, (2) Optional Contact Group, (3) No Contact Group, and (4) a treatment-as-usual Waitlist Control Group. It was hypothesised that participants in the 3 Treatment Groups would report significant improvements on clinical measures of disability, anxiety, depression, and pain relative to the Control Group, and that the Regular Contact Group would report greater improvements compared with the Optional Contact and No Contact Groups. It was hypothesised that outcomes would be maintained at 3-month follow-up and that the intervention would be found to be acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Participants read about the study and applied to participate through the website of the eCentreClinic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ecentreclinic.org/">www.ecentreclinic.org</ext-link>). The eCentreClinic is a specialist research unit that provides information about common mental and chronic health conditions and offers the opportunity for free psychological treatment through participation in clinical trials. Because of the information offered and the potential to receive free treatment, the eCentreClinic can be located through online searches and is promoted by various health professionals and through numerous websites within Australia. The present trial was also promoted using paid advertisements placed in state newspapers and using unpaid general advertisements by a range of governmental and nongovernmental organisations providing services to adults with chronic pain, including Chronic Pain Australia, the Australian Pain Management Association, the NSW Agency for Clinical Innovation, Pain Network, Pain Australia, and Arthritis Australia. No monetary rewards were provided for participation or for completion of questionnaires.</p><p>Six hundred and fourteen people with a broad range of chronic pain conditions submitted applications to participate in the course, which involved completing several online questionnaires and a brief telephone assessment to ensure participants satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All applications were randomly allocated to 1 of 4 groups using a permuted block randomisation sequence (ie, with 14 randomisations per block) and a 2:2:2:1 allocation ratio with the Waitlist Control Group designed to have half the participants of the Treatment Groups. The randomisation sequence was created by B. F. Dear. using an online randomiser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org">www.random.org</ext-link>), and participant randomisation occurred at the point of application, through the eCentreClinic software system, before participants had any contact with the researchers or the researchers had the opportunity to review the details of participants' applications. Thus, the researchers were blind to group allocation until the participant was deemed to have made a successful or unsuccessful application. The researchers sought to recruit at least 350 participants, which, with alpha set at 0.05 and a power of 0.80, would enable the detection of small effect sizes differences (ie, Cohen's <italic>d</italic>s &#x0003e; 0.35) between the Treatment Groups and moderate-to-large effect size differences (ie, Cohen's <italic>d</italic>s &#x0003e; 0.50) between the Treatment Groups and Control Group. However, more participants were recruited to compensate for both withdrawals and questionnaire nonresponse at posttreatment and follow-up. Of the 614 people who started an application, 490 met the following inclusion criteria: (1) experienced pain for more than 6 months, (2) had their pain assessed by their general practitioner or a specialist within the last 3 months, (3) were at least 18 years of age, (4) were a resident of Australia, (5) had regular access to a computer and the internet, and (6) were not currently experiencing an unmanaged psychotic illness or very severe symptoms of depression (ie, defined as a total score &#x0003e;22 or endorsing a score &#x0003e;2 to item 9 of the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item [PHQ-9]<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup>).

Participants' primary general practitioner or medical specialist was sent a letter notifying them of the patient's participation, describing the nature of the study and program, and inviting direct contact. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia, and the trial was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANCZTR) as ACTRN12613000252718.

Design and measures</title><p>The study used a 4-arm CONSORT-revised compliant randomised controlled trial comparing an internet-delivered treatment for managing chronic pain, the <italic>Pain Course</italic>, provided with 3 different levels of clinical support: (1) Regular Contact Group, (2) Optional Contact Group and (3) No Contact Group with (4) a treatment-as-usual Waitlist Control Group. After treatment of the 3 Treatment Groups, participants in the Waitlist Control Group were provided access to the course; the majority of whom also volunteered to participate in a separate trial involving an enhanced version of the course (ACTRN12612000556842) and the results of which are not reported in this article. All outcome measures were administered online. The primary and secondary measures were administered at initial assessment, pretreatment, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. Pain was considered a secondary outcome because the program focuses on the management of pain-related disability and emotional wellbeing. The tertiary measures were administered at pretreatment, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up and the acceptability and satisfaction questions were administered at posttreatment. The tertiary measures were administered to assess psychological variables, which have been identified in previous literature as important psychological targets of face-to-face pain management programs and as important factors in biopsychosocial models of chronic pain. However, a comprehensive examination of these variables is outside the scope of the current trial and will be reported in subsequent studies.</p><p>All 4 groups completed questionnaires at initial assessment, pretreatment, and posttreatment, but only the 3 Treatment Groups completed questionnaires at 3-month follow-up, as the Waitlist Control Group had entered active treatment. The pretreatment measures were administered immediately before the start of the Course, and the posttreatment measures were completed after the completion of the 8-week Course. As a clinical trial of a psychological treatment with a treatment-as-usual Waitlist Control Group, it was not possible to blind participants or clinicians to group allocation.</p><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>2.2.1.

The <italic>Pain Course</italic> is based on a pragmatic model of treatment that aims to: (1) provide information that helps participants to understand and deconstruct their symptoms and difficulties; (2) teach a range of CBT skills to help participants manage their symptoms and difficulties; and (3) reduce pain-related disability, anxiety, and depression by encouraging the practice and adoption of the skills taught within the program. Importantly, the <italic>Pain Course</italic> was designed based on the principles of transdiagnostic psychological intervention (eg, <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>) and therefore provides therapeutic information and teaches self-management skills that are applicable to and effective for a broad range of pain conditions and psychological difficulties. Consequently, there is no tailoring of content or materials for individual participants; all participants receive the same materials. An overview of the structure, content, and skills taught within the <italic>Pain Course</italic> is provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Timetable and content of the Pain Course.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jop-156-1920-g004"/></table-wrap><p>The <italic>Pain Course</italic> consists of 5 core online lessons and 5 lesson summaries, which provide homework assignments to assist participants to learn and apply the skills described in the lessons. Participants are strongly encouraged to practice the skills taught within the course on a daily basis and to gradually adopt them into their everyday lives. Additional resources are provided to introduce additional topics and skills that are relevant for many participants, but which are not described within the core lessons, including materials on working with health professionals and treatments for chronic pain, managing sleep, problem solving, controlling attention and assertive communication. Comprehensive case stories are provided, which describe how people with chronic pain apply the information and skills covered in the course. All course materials are accessed through a personal password-protected login to the eCentreClinic software system, which is provided to participants once they are accepted into the Course. All materials are released systematically over 8 weeks and participants are unable to access materials in later weeks without first having read previous materials. However, once available, participants could view and review materials as desired and materials could be printed for offline use based on participant preference. The eCentreClinic system tracks participants' logins and general use of the <italic>Pain Course</italic>, including the completion of lessons and the viewing and download of the lesson summaries and other additional resources. Participants were provided with ongoing access to the course for the entire follow-up period and could complete lessons and access materials after the course had finished.</p><p>Each lesson was presented in the form of a slide show, which took approximately 10 to 20 minutes to read, and was designed to be easily read by someone without high school reading proficiency. Each lesson comprised approximately 70 slides and each slide contained approximately 100 to 200 words. The lesson materials were presented in a didactic format and included realistic examples of skills practice and symptom management, which were strategically integrated throughout the lessons to aid learning. Each lesson began with a summary of the content of previous lessons. The lessons also included summaries of key points interspersed throughout and concepts and skills described in previous lessons were often repeated and integrated with novel information introduced in later lessons. Participants had complete control over their progression through the lesson materials and had buttons to navigate forward and backward through the lesson slides at their own pace. Importantly, to minimise technological requirements and maximise accessibility, the <italic>Pain Course</italic> involves no audio or video content or interactive or game-like treatment-related components.</p><p>Based on the findings of previous research,<sup><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> participants were sent regular automated e-mails throughout the course. Some e-mails were triggered based on participant behaviour; specifically, e-mails were triggered when (1) participants completed a lesson during the course and when (2) participants had not completed a lesson within 7 days of it becoming available. E-mails were also triggered according to the course timeline; specifically, e-mails were triggered (1) at the beginning of each week to let participants know about new materials made available that week and to suggest some tasks for participants to focus on for the week and (2) at set times when participants were known to commonly experience increases in symptoms or to have increased difficulties practicing skills (eg, during the early weeks of the course and again towards the end when activity pacing and graded exposure are introduced). Each e-mail was brief and comprised 2 to 3 paragraphs containing 3 or 4 concise sentences. Each e-mail used the participant's first name and was written to convey a warm and supportive tone. Participants were encouraged to complete 1 lesson every 7 to 10 days and to attempt to regularly practice the skills covered within the lesson summaries.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>2.4. Clinical contact</title><p>Two registered psychologists (M.G. and L.J.) with postgraduate qualifications in psychology and several years of clinical experience provided all clinical contact with participants, which occurred through telephone or a secure e-mail system. Neither psychologist had significant previous clinical experience working with patients with chronic pain. B. F. Dear provided scheduled and weekly, 1 hour, supervision sessions to both psychologists during which all participants were reviewed. Supervision was provided at other times as required. B. F. Dear is a registered clinical psychologist with more than 7 years of clinical experience in the area of chronic pain. The details of contact with all participants were recorded.</p><p>Participants in the Regular Contact Group and the Optional Contact Group were assigned to one of the clinicians for the entire course. Clinicians aimed to provide weekly contact to participants in the Regular Contact Group, through telephone or secure e-mail, for a period of between 10 to 15 minutes per contact unless more contact was clinically required. Participants in the Optional Contact Group were also informed that their clinician was available for around 10 to 15 minutes each week and that the participant could contact the clinician on an &#x0201c;as-needed&#x0201d; basis throughout the course. However, they were informed that the clinician would not attempt to contact them without an explicit request for contact. Clinicians provided the same kind of clinical contact to participants in the Regular Contact and the Optional Contact Groups; the only difference was that the clinicians did not attempt to initiate contact with the participants in the Optional Contact Group each week as they did with the participants in the Regular Contact Group. Participants in the No Contact Group were informed that they were in a group who would not receive contact during the course unless they experienced technical difficulties or a mental health emergency. The questionnaire responses of participants in the No Contact Group were monitored twice daily, alongside the other Treatment Groups, throughout the course but contact was only initiated if a deterioration in their mental health (ie, defined as an increase in the PHQ-9 total score of &#x02265;5 with a total score &#x02265;15) was observed. This contact involved the administration of a risk assessment and, if needed, referral to appropriate crisis services.</p><p>The primary purpose of clinician contact was to encourage and support participants to work through the <italic>Pain Course</italic> and to apply the skills in the context of their symptoms and circumstances; rather than providing psychological treatment themselves. Importantly, in accordance with previous research,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> clinicians were instructed to: (1) answer participants' questions; (2) summarise content; (3) encourage skills practice and reinforce progress; (4) enquire about participants' experiences with the course and use of the skills; and (5) normalise challenges in the learning and use of the core skills. Clinicians were instructed not to introduce new therapeutic skills not covered within the course and, unless clinically indicated, to limit the time spent in contact or contacting participants to approximately 10 to 15 minutes per week. Clinicians were instructed not to request participants to submit examples of their use of the skills or completed worksheets for evaluation or checking. However, the clinicians did provide feedback on skills use and worksheet completion where it was requested by participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>2.5. Analytic plan</title><p>All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 21. Group differences in demographic and pain-related variables were analysed using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, nonparametric Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests, and parametric 1-way analyses of variance. The alpha significance level for the preliminary analyses was adjusted from 0.05 to 0.01 as a partial control for the very large number of analyses conducted. Chi-square analyses were not reported where any cell comprised n &#x02264; 5.</p><p>A generalised estimation equation (GEE) modelling technique was used to examine changes in the measures over time. Generalised estimation equation emphasizes the modelling of change in an average group effect over time while accounting for within-subject variance with the specification of a working correlation structure. Rather than creating conditional interpretation with the use of individual intercepts or random slopes, as in traditional mixed linear models, the primary emphasis in GEE is to directly model the average group-related change over time.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> The GEE analyses therefore provide model coefficients that represent multiplicative change in the dependent variable, and these coefficients form a change factor (ie, exp(&#x003b2;)), which can be used to calculate the average percentage change from baseline to any time point for each group. An exchangeable working correlation structure was selected, coupled with a robust error estimation, for all GEE analyses. All GEE models also specified a gamma distribution with a log link response scale to address skewness in the dependent variable distributions. Importantly, initial assessment was used as baseline for the primary and secondary outcomes in all analyses concerning the primary and secondary outcomes. However, because there was a 1- to 8-week period between initial assessment and pretreatment, the pretreatment data are also presented for the primary and secondary outcomes to demonstrate their stability before treatment. For the tertiary outcomes, which were not assessed at initial assessment, pretreatment is used as baseline for all analyses. Separate generalised linear models, utilising time effects and random intercepts, were used to impute missing data in the dependent variables consistent with intention-to-treat principles. Then, to compare the relative outcomes of the 4 groups, GEE analyses were run comparing the primary and secondary outcome variables from initial assessment to pretreatment, posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. SPSS pairwise comparisons were used to explore and understand any significant main and interaction effects observed in the GEE analyses.</p><p>Several different statistics were calculated for comparison and benchmarking purposes. First, the average percentage change across time was calculated from the GEE analyses for each of the outcome variables with 95% confidence intervals. Second, Cohen's <italic>d</italic> effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were also calculated for the between-group effects based on the estimated marginal mean values derived from the GEE models. Third, based on previous recommendations<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> and consistent with the initial trial,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> the percentage of participants in each group reporting improvements in symptoms of &#x02265;10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% and the numbers needed to treat (NNT) to obtain each banding of change are reported. The NNT was calculated using the formula, NNT = 1/ARR, where ARR (Absolute Risk Reduction) = CER (Control Group Event Rate) &#x02212; TER (Treatment Group Event Rate). Chi-square tests were used to examine differences between the Treatment Groups in the number of participants reporting improvements at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up.</p><p>To provide data about negative outcomes<sup><xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> and consistent with the previous trial,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> the number of participants reporting symptom deteriorations &#x02265;30% and symptoms in the clinical ranges at posttreatment (ie, above recognised clinical cutoffs) on the primary outcome measures are also reported. The clinical ranges were defined as total scores &#x02265;8 on the GAD-7,<sup><xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> &#x02265;10 on the PHQ-9,<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> &#x02265;14 on the RMDQ,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and &#x02265;6 on the average pain item of the WBPQ.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> The clinical cutoffs used for the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 have been previously identified as indicating probable diagnoses of an anxiety disorder and depressive disorder.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> However, because of the absence of an established cutoff, the 50th percentile of all scores of patients presenting to a tertiary pain service was used as the cutoff for the RMDQ and WBPQ.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Importantly, these analyses are designed not to capture participants whose scores may have increased by &#x02265;30% but who, despite the increase, still have nonclinical symptoms. Thus, these analyses were designed not to include fluctuations in scores that are unlikely to represent an actual or meaningful deterioration in symptoms (eg, a change in score from 0 to 1).</p><p>The GEE analyses were also used to examine self-reported prescription medication use, health service use and changes in vocational status from pretreatment to posttreatment and 3-month follow-up. These GEE analyses for medication use, which was coded as a binary yes or no, used a suitable negative binomial distribution for the probability of observing medication use over time. The GEE analyses for vocational status also used a binary yes or no response employing a binomial distribution for the probability of observing a change over time. These GEE analyses for medication use, service use and vocational status were conducted only on the observed data; that is, no imputation was used for missing data given the absence of an accepted protocol within the literature. For service use data, significant atypical and outlying responses, that is, those responses more than &#x02265;5 SDs from the group mean or that were well outside the observed distribution of responses, were removed. These cases were removed to provide a more accurate and representative group-based estimate of service use over time. Some medication, health professional and vocational categories were also either not analysed or were combined due to very low use.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>The present study sought to replicate the results of an earlier trial of a new internet-delivered pain management program and to explore its efficacy when provided with different levels of clinical support. It was hypothesised that all Treatment Groups would report improvements on clinical measures of anxiety, depression, and disability relative to a Control Group and that those participants receiving regular clinician contact would exhibit superior outcomes. These hypotheses were partially supported. All 3 Treatment Groups reported significant improvements (between-group Cohen's <italic>d</italic>; avg. reduction) in disability (<italic>d</italic>s &#x02265; 0.50; avg. reduction &#x02265; 18%), anxiety (<italic>d</italic>s &#x02265; 0.44; avg. reduction &#x02265; 32%), depression (<italic>d</italic>s &#x02265; 0.73; avg. reduction &#x02265; 36%) and average pain (<italic>d</italic>s &#x02265; 0.30; avg. reduction &#x02265; 12%) immediately posttreatment, which were sustained or further improved to 3-month follow-up. No marked or consistent differences emerged between the Treatment Groups in clinical outcomes. Treatment completion and satisfaction rates were also high and did not differ across the Treatment Groups.</p><p>These findings replicate those of the initial trial<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and compare favourably with those reported for other internet-delivered<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and face-to-face pain management programs.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> For example, a recent Cochrane review of internet-delivered programs found evidence of moderate effect sizes for disability (<italic>d</italic> = 0.50) and small effects for anxiety (<italic>d</italic> = 0.19) and depression (<italic>d</italic> = 0.19),<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> where the current study found moderate-to-large effect sizes for the primary outcomes of disability, anxiety, and depression (all <italic>d</italic>s &#x02265; 0.44; avg. reductions &#x02265; 18%) immediately posttreatment. The present study also found small-to-moderate effect sizes for the secondary outcome of average pain (all <italic>d</italic>s &#x02265; 0.30; avg. reductions &#x02265; 12%) consistent with the recent review<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and small-to-moderate effect size improvements on the tertiary outcomes of pain self-efficacy (<italic>d</italic> &#x02265; &#x02212;0.29; avg. increases &#x02265; 15%), fear of movement (<italic>d</italic> &#x02265; 0.34; avg. decreases &#x02265; 7%), and pain acceptance (<italic>d</italic> &#x02265; &#x02212;0.22; avg. increases &#x02265; 8%), which have been identified as important targets of CBT-based pain management programs.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The present study also found evidence of significant reductions in medication use and health service use, but these were observed across the Treatment and Control Groups. These clinical outcomes were obtained with a mean clinician time per participant of 67.69 minutes (SD = 33.50), 12.85 minutes (SD = 24.61), and 5.44 minutes (SD = 12.38) for participants receiving regular contact, optional contact, and no clinical contact, respectively. The clinician time required for the Regular Contact Group was less than the previous trial (81.54 minutes; SD = 30.91),<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> which may reflect reduced demands for clinician contact following iterative revisions to the <italic>Pain Course</italic> since the initial trial. Importantly, consistent with findings of trials in other areas (eg, 4,5,50,51), these findings suggest that good clinical outcomes can be obtained by internet-delivered programs involving very little or nonclinical contact. This is consistent with a recent review, which concluded that, following a screening procedure and provided the content is of a high quality and is sufficiently engaging for patients, clinician expertise and time may be less important in internet-delivered than face-to-face interventions.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p>More research is needed to explore the characteristics of people who do and do not benefit from internet-delivered programs. The findings of the current study are encouraging with, for example, the demographic and pain characteristics of participants in this study appearing similar to those of patients attending face-to-face pain management programs (eg, 36,37), except that a larger proportion had higher levels of education. Given the considerable variability in the findings of existing studies,<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> there is also a need for more research to explore the essential components and parameters of effective, safe, and acceptable internet-delivered programs. For example, while the current program obtained high completion rates and levels of satisfaction, many internet-delivered programs have reported significant levels of participant dropout and program noncompletion (eg, &#x0003e;50% in some cases) (eg, 18,47). It is noteworthy that, while often thought to be essential components of internet-delivered interventions, the present study obtained very good outcomes without any audio or video content and without any interactive treatment-related components. Thus, more research is needed to understand the essential components of effective internet-delivered programs and when and for whom these programs are effective. This is essential to guide the integration of internet-delivered pain management programs into existing health care systems.</p><p>There are a number of limitations that need to be considered in the present study. First, the use of a treatment-as-usual Waitlist Control Group design limits our ability to control for nonspecific therapeutic effects and leaves open the possibility that participants in the Control Group may have recovered without treatment. However, it is important to note that participants had marked difficulties with chronic pain that were unlikely to spontaneously remit and, in fact, the Control Group reported a significant number of symptom deteriorations while on the waitlist. It is also important to note that, as there is now evidence for efficacy of the <italic>Pain Course</italic> it is becoming increasingly difficult to obtain ethical approval for research designs (eg, attention control designs, noncrossover longitudinal control designs) that do not involve timely access to either the <italic>Pain Course</italic> or some other equivalent active treatment, thus, limiting the designs the research team could use in the present study. Second, while longer term follow-up is planned and will be reported in the future, it is currently unclear whether the current results will be maintained over the longer term. Third, participants were not restricted in the treatments they could receive during the trial and so participants started, changed, and stopped various treatments during the trial. Unfortunately, this means that it is not possible to completely rule out the positive and negative effects of other treatments in the current trial, although the use of a treatment-as-usual Waitlist Control Group means that these other treatments were at least partially controlled and are unlikely to have affected the major outcomes. Fourth, participants in the present study sought to participate in a pain management program and, consequently, it is unclear how the results would generalise to patients who were not seeking such a program. Fifth, while prescription medications use, health service use and vocational status were examined, the present study relied on self-report data. Sixth, it is unclear from the current study how important the observed changes in the tertiary outcomes, which are believed to be important psychological targets of face-to-face pain management programs, are to the improvements in the primary outcome variables. Further research is needed to explore whether these and other tertiary psychological outcomes are as important to internet-delivered treatments as has been suggested and observed in some face-to-face pain management programs.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Finally, the aim of the present study was to examine the overall efficacy of an internet-delivered pain management program provided with 3 levels of clinical support rather than comprehensively examine the characteristic of people who benefit from these programs. Thus, future research is needed to focus on the characteristics of participants who are suitable for and benefit from internet-delivered and face-to-face pain management programs.</p><p>The present study has a number of notable strengths. First, it is the largest in the literature to explore an internet-delivered pain management program and to directly compare several different models of support. Second, it directly replicates an earlier trial and, consistent with the initial trial,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> obtained high questionnaire response rates, providing confidence in the outcomes observed. Third, it included a heterogeneous group of participants with chronic pain including participants reporting pain as a result of various pain conditions, injuries, medical treatments as well as a broad range of other significant health conditions (eg, cancer, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, diabetes, spinal cord injuries). Fourth, it is the first study of an internet-delivered program for chronic pain to examine medication use, health service use and vocational status over time. Fifth, it is one of a very limited number to report on the acceptability of the program and to report on negative outcomes and symptom deterioration.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Notably, the number of symptom deteriorations was significantly less among the Treatment Groups and no participants identified the program as the cause of their deterioration. Finally, it employed standardized and widely used clinical measures and assessed across the outcome domains targeted by pain management interventions (ie, disability, anxiety, and depression) and provides a broad range of data in several widely used formats and clinical metrics to enable benchmarking and comparison of outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, the present study replicates and extends the findings of an earlier trial. Significant improvements in levels of disability, anxiety, depression, and pain were observed and no consistent or marked differences were found across the levels of clinician support provided. More research is needed to realise the potential of internet-delivered pain management programs and properly understand the participant, treatment and other factors affecting clinical efficacy, safety, and acceptability. However, while caution and further research is needed, the findings of the present study add to the existing literature in highlighting the very significant potential of carefully developed and administered internet-delivered pain management programs as a way of increasing access to evidence-based care.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>B.
