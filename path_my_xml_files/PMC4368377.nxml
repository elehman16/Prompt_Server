It is also a common developmental outcome of preschool language impairment (Catts, Fey, Zhang, &#x00026; Tomblin, <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Snowling, Bishop, &#x00026; Stothard, <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Considerable research has addressed how to improve the literacy skills of children with dyslexic difficulties (National Reading Panel, <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Torgerson, Brooks, &#x00026; Hall, <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). The evidence shows that effective reading interventions incorporate training in letter&#x02013;sound knowledge and phoneme awareness, explicit and systematic phonics instruction, and the application of these skills to the tasks of reading and spelling. This intervention approach is consistent with a theoretical model which views letter&#x02013;sound knowledge and phoneme awareness as two causal influences on learning to read (Hulme, Bowyer-Crane, Carroll, Duff, &#x00026; Snowling, <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Few intervention studies have specifically targeted children who are at family risk (FR) of dyslexia (for summary, see van Otterloo &#x00026; van der Leij, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In the existing studies (conducted in English, Danish and Dutch), the interventions were implemented prior to the onset of formal reading instruction and focused on training the two key foundations for learning to read &#x02013; letter knowledge and phoneme awareness &#x02013; with some programmes including links to basic decoding and encoding processes. Several of the studies suffer methodological or statistical flaws &#x02013; notably lack of random assignment of children to groups, or failure to control baseline skills in longitudinal analyses. Nonetheless, some general conclusions can be drawn.</p><p>Intervention efficacy is typically tested by comparing the progress of FR children who receive intervention with that of FR children who do not (forming either a treated or untreated control group). At immediate posttest, the intervention groups usually show a significant advantage in letter knowledge and phoneme awareness (Elbro &#x00026; Petersen, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Hindson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; van Otterloo &#x00026; van der Leij, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; van Otterloo, van der Leij, &#x00026; Henrichs, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Regtvoort &#x00026; van der Leij, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). In some cases, progress on these measures is enough to bring FR children in line with their classmates who are deemed not to be at risk of reading difficulties (Elbro &#x00026; Petersen, <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Hindson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Regtvoort &#x00026; van der Leij, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). However, such training confers little measurable advantage for literacy development, as shown by the lack of significant differences between trained and untrained FR children on measures of reading and spelling at follow-up (typically 6&#x02013;24&#x000a0;months later). A corollary of this is that the literacy skills of FR children &#x02013; regardless of training &#x02013; tend to fall significantly behind those of their unaffected peers (Hindson et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Regtvoort &#x00026; van der Leij, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>An exception to these findings comes from Elbro and Petersen (<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>), who evaluated the effect of daily training in phoneme awareness linked to letter&#x02013;sound knowledge, delivered for 17&#x000a0;weeks during Kindergarten. In Grades 2 and 3, trained FR children had made more progress than untrained FR children in word and nonword reading accuracy and efficiency (controlling for baseline phoneme awareness and letter knowledge). The advantage on efficiency measures remained in Grade 7. Furthermore, in Grade 2, there were no significant differences in reading skills between trained FR children and their untrained, unaffected peers. Although the gap between those with and without FR widened over time, the two groups remained comparable on measures of word reading efficiency and reading comprehension in Grade 7.</p><p>In summary, interventions for children at family risk of dyslexia that are delivered before the onset of formal reading instruction tend to show short-term effects on phoneme awareness and letter knowledge. Though there are exceptions, these initial benefits seem not to transfer to higher level literacy skills.</p><p>Here, we report a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a combined reading and language intervention, delivered alongside formal literacy instruction to 6-year-old children at risk of developing dyslexia. Consistent with the known risk factors for dyslexia, the research criteria for being at risk were as follows: having a first degree relative with dyslexia, and/or the presence of a preschool language impairment (see Nash, Hulme, Gooch, &#x00026; Snowling, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Children identified by schools as being in need of additional reading support also participated. Little work has been done to systematically examine the profiles of children at risk of reading difficulty for different reasons. However, findings suggest that school-age poor readers show similar patterns of language and literacy impairments regardless of whether they have a family risk for dyslexia (Carroll, Mundy, &#x00026; Cunningham, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Analyses of prereading language profiles suggest that children with a language impairment (regardless of family risk for dyslexia) are more likely to develop a reading difficulty than children with family risk alone (Nash et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Given the nature of our sample, we wished to address children's language and literacy difficulties. We based the intervention on our previous research demonstrating that reading and its foundations can be improved through phonological approaches (e.g. Bowyer-Crane et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hatcher et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), and that interventions incorporating training in vocabulary and oral narrative skills are effective for promoting oral language skills (e.g. Bowyer-Crane et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Fricke, Bowyer-Crane, Haley, Hulme, &#x00026; Snowling, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We employed a waiting list control design and hypothesised that children receiving the intervention (Experimental group) would make significantly greater progress in reading and language skills than children not initially receiving the intervention (Waiting Control group). We expected that once the Waiting Control group received intervention, its progress would be comparable to that seen in the Experimental group &#x02013; acting as a replication. We also expected to observe a dosage effect &#x02013; with greater gains made following 18&#x000a0;weeks versus 9&#x000a0;weeks of intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This study formed part of a longitudinal at-risk project investigating the development of dyslexia and language impairment (Wellcome Language and Reading Project). Children were screened in their first or second year of school to identify those with the weakest reading skills. Selected children took part in this RCT of a reading and language intervention. They were randomly allocated to the Experimental group (18&#x000a0;weeks of intervention) or Waiting Control group (standard classroom education for 9&#x000a0;weeks, followed by 9&#x000a0;weeks of intervention). Children were assessed individually at initial screening (<italic>t0</italic>), pretest (<italic>t1</italic>), midtest (<italic>t2</italic>, after 9&#x000a0;weeks of intervention for the Experimental group and 0&#x000a0;weeks for the Control group) and posttest (<italic>t3</italic>, after 18 or 9&#x000a0;weeks of intervention respectively).</p><p>Ethical permission was granted by the NHS Research Ethics Committee and the Psychology Department, University of York.

Of 209 eligible children, 171 were available for screening (<italic>t0</italic>) in December 2010 to determine suitability for the intervention [mean age&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6.00 (0.06)].

Mean standard scores were 104.08 (14.32) and 97.31 (16.50) respectively. The children were ranked in order of their average standard score, and 61 children with the lowest scores were selected.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">1</xref> These children were randomly allocated, at the level of the child, to the Control (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;30) or Experimental (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;31) groups. The frequency of different types of risk (family risk (FR) vs. language impairment (LI) [or speech sound disorder (SSD)]) was similar across groups&#x000a0;(<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.92, <italic>p&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>.820). Comparing the Control and Experimental groups, respectively, rates of classification were: 13 versus 11 for FR; 7 versus 8 for LI; 5 versus 6 for FR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;LI; 2 versus 4 for SSD.</p><p>The selected children were distributed across 44 schools: 37 schools with one child, six schools with two and one school with seven. For each child that the research team identified for intervention, their school was invited to nominate two additional children. The only inclusion criteria were that these children should be deemed likely to benefit from a reading intervention, and able to work well with the identified child. These additional children were assigned to the same group as that of the child in their school whom the research team had identified. There was variation in uptake, resulting in 51 additional children in the Experimental group and 46 in the Control group.</p><p>Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref> details the flow of participants through the trial, in accordance with CONSORT guidelines (Schulz, Altman, &#x00026; Moher, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Complete data sets were collected for 77 children in the Experimental group (42 boys; 29 children from the original at-risk sample) and 68 in the Control group (45 boys; 27 from the at-risk sample). Of these, 68 and 67, respectively, remained in the intervention for the prescribed length. Reasons for withdrawing from the intervention included children leaving schools, teaching assistants (TAs) leaving schools or taking sick leave, or school personnel deciding to withdraw children. However, all children with complete data sets were included in the analyses regardless of the extent to which they received the intervention.

rid="fn2">2</xref> These analyses test whether the children receiving the intervention (Experimental group) progress more in the first 9-week period than the children not receiving the intervention

The results are summarised in Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>, which plots the difference between the groups' marginal means at <italic>t2</italic> (controlling for <italic>t1</italic> covariates). A score greater than 0 signifies more progress in the Experimental group than the Control group; where the 95% confidence intervals do not cross the <italic>x</italic>-axis, this represents a statistically significant effect (<italic>p&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>.05). Effect sizes (<italic>d</italic>) are shown. Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref> demonstrates that the pattern of effects is similar across the full sample and the subsample. There are statistically significant but small effects<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">3</xref> on letter knowledge and early word reading, and small-to-moderate effects on phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary. After correcting for multiple comparisons (Benjamini &#x00026; Hochberg, <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1995</xref>), all effects in the full sample remain significant, but the effects observed on letter knowledge and phoneme awareness in the subsample are not significant. However, there is no effect of intervention on the majority of language and literacy measures. It should be noted that across the full sample and subsample, we had high power to detect medium effects but low power to detect small effects. Regarding the full sample, with an average pretest/posttest correlation of .75 using ANCOVA, we had 99.5% power to detect a group difference where <italic>d&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.50 and 44.3% power where <italic>d&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.20 (two-tailed).

A significant effect of intervention was only detected on one of these four measures. To provide a robust test of the hypothesis that the intervention improved the primary outcome, we performed a path analysis with structural equation modelling to test the effect of group (proxy for intervention) on a latent &#x02018;reading&#x02019; variable. The latent variable was formed from all four word-level reading measures: Strict factorial invariance was imposed; and to address the effects of nonnormal distribution, a composite was formed from the tests of early word reading and single word reading, and the prose reading accuracy measure was transformed by taking the square root (nonword reading was left unadjusted). The model concerns the full sample so accounted for clustering of children within schools. It provides a good fit to the data (see Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">3</xref>). The standardised coefficients demonstrate high stability in reading from <italic>t1</italic> to <italic>t2</italic>. For the paths from &#x02018;group&#x02019; to &#x02018;reading&#x02019;, the partial regression coefficients (Y-standardised) are reported; these represent the difference in z-score units after controlling for the covariate and are equivalent to effect sizes. This model shows that after 9&#x000a0;weeks, there is no reliable effect of the intervention (&#x02018;group&#x02019;) on word-level reading abilities (<italic>d&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.10).</p><fig id="fig03" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>A path model for the full sample showing the effect of &#x02018;group&#x02019; (proxy for intervention) on the latent variable &#x02018;reading&#x02019; at <italic>t2</italic>, controlling for reading at <italic>t1</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcpp0055-1234-f3"/></fig><p>A second set of analyses was performed by testing for group differences at <italic>t3,</italic> controlling for differences in baseline performance at <italic>t1</italic>.

The models were conducted as before (see Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">4</xref>). There is one statistically significant intervention effect &#x02013; on phoneme awareness in the full sample &#x02013; but this fails to survive the Benjamini&#x02013;Hochberg correction.

The content of the intervention was chosen to reflect our novel approach to conceptualising risk; that is, with respect to family history, but also the presence of preschool language impairment. We found only small-to-moderate effects of the intervention on foundational skills that received explicit training (letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and taught vocabulary), but these effects were fragile and short lived, and there was no transfer to our primary outcome of word-level reading. The nature of dyslexia risk (family history and/or language impairment) did not affect response to intervention. The pattern of short-term effects on letter knowledge and phoneme awareness with no transfer to word-level literacy characterises the majority of family risk intervention studies. However, the effects of the intervention were similarly small and circumscribed across the broader sample that also included children identified by teachers as needing reading intervention (though we acknowledge the limitation of not knowing the criteria used to select these additional children). The intervention presented here was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions (e.g. Bowyer-Crane et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Hatcher et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Thus, we are left with the question of why the intervention did not have reliable and consistent effects on language and literacy skills.</p><p>One possibility is that the 9-week period was simply too short. This seems a valid argument with respect to training broader oral language skills. Significant effects have been observed on a narrative composite and a broader oral language composite (untrained vocabulary, listening comprehension, and content and grammar of spoken language) after a 30-week intervention, but only on grammar and trained vocabulary (not untrained vocabulary, listening comprehension or narrative skill) after a 20-week intervention (Bowyer-Crane et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Fricke et&#x000a0;al., <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Furthermore, with respect to the Language Strand, although narrative work could be differentiated based on individual needs, vocabulary instruction had to be more uniform given the pretest/posttest.</p><p>The relatively short length of the intervention does not seem a sufficient explanation for the limited effects on word-level reading. The Reading Strand was based on the effective programme of Hatcher et&#x000a0;al. (<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), in which the Experimental group gained 4.59 standard score points on a test of word reading in its first 10-week intervention period (0.28 points per hour of intervention) and the Control group 0.86 points (<italic>d&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.69). In the first 9&#x000a0;weeks of the present intervention, the Experimental group gained 4.13 standard score points on the <italic>Single Word Reading Test</italic> (0.23 points per hour). Taken alone, this comparison suggests the Experimental group here made sufficient progress. However, in the same 9&#x000a0;weeks, the Control group gained 3.49 standard score points in the absence of intervention, resulting in a weak intervention effect (<italic>d&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.10).</p><p>This pattern suggests that the Control group might not have provided a pure comparison. Indeed, post hoc analysis of teacher questionnaire data showed that the majority of the full sample (&#x0003e;90%) was receiving systematic phonics instruction as part of their classroom literacy instruction. A weakened intervention effect against this instructional backdrop might therefore be a positive reflection of policy aims to raise the quality of baseline classroom instruction for all (e.g. Rose, <xref rid="b100" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). It is possible that the Reading Strand of the intervention might not have differed sufficiently from the classroom literacy approach to induce larger and more sustained intervention effects. Furthermore, the at-risk subsample in this study had been part of a longitudinal project since the age of 3, and therefore comprised children with engaged and informed parents, many of whom provided literacy support at home. In addition, across the full sample, teacher questionnaire data revealed that 51% of the Experimental group and 54% of the Control group were already receiving some form of additional literacy support when the current intervention began (with modal responses characterising this as entailing approximately 20&#x000a0;min of TA-delivered literacy instruction one or five times a week). Finally, while a phonics-based reading intervention at the age of 6 is a defensible strategy for young struggling readers, our heterogeneous sample included some children whose initial reading abilities were already beyond the level that would be targeted in the intervention &#x02013; possibly constraining the growth they could demonstrate on the outcome measures. Given the methodological difficulties of carrying out this trial with sufficient power, these sample characteristics were regrettable but unavoidable.</p><p>While we can offer various conjectures, our only definitive conclusion is that the intervention, as delivered under the circumstances reported here, did not produce reliable improvements in children's language and literacy skills. However, this does not render reporting of the trial unimportant. Our findings highlight the importance of subjecting well-intended educational practices to rigorous evaluation; and emphasise the need for practitioners to understand and implement evidence-based approaches (Duff &#x00026; Clarke, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Such objectives accord with the drive to bring standards for reporting nonpharmacological trials in line with pharmacological trials (Science &#x00026; Technology Committee, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have reported an RCT of an intervention for 6-year-old children identified by research criteria as being at risk of dyslexia, and their school-identified peers. The intervention was theoretically motivated and based on previous successful interventions. We found evidence for small-to-moderate effects after 9&#x000a0;weeks of intervention for the Experimental group on letter knowledge, phoneme awareness and vocabulary. However, these effects dissipated once the Control group had also received intervention. Critically, there was no significant effect on a robust latent measure of word-level reading. We have offered tentative explanations for this null result: The intervention may have been too short to expect significant improvements in language skills; and the nature and frequency of literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened the effects on reading. Following previous at-risk intervention studies, small improvements were seen in letter knowledge and phoneme awareness, but with no transfer to literacy. Although disappointing, we believe reporting a null result is important with respect to raising standards in reporting of trials and in educational practice.</p><boxed-text position="float"><sec><title>Key Points</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Previous interventions for children at family risk of dyslexia typically show short-term effects on letter knowledge and phoneme awareness but little transfer to literacy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>That pattern was replicated following a critical 9-week period of a new reading and language intervention, but was not particular to children identified by research criteria as being at-risk of dyslexia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention was not effective as delivered under the conditions reported here: It may have been too short to yield improvements in oral language; and literacy instruction in and beyond the classroom may have weakened training effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reporting of null results in non-pharmacological trials is important with respect to raising standards in trial reporting and educational practice.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was funded by the Wellcome Trust Grant R10611.
