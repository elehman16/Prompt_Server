symptoms and improve function for patients. It has been demonstrated that poor posture
negatively impacts pain, range of motion, strength, proprioception, balance, and
respiration: abnormal postures in the cervical, shoulder, and thoracic regions are
associated with pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>; a slouched posture
can decrease shoulder range of motion and strength<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>; a slouched posture can also alter proprioceptive control, increase
reposition error, and contribute to low back pain and injury<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>; and a forward head posture decreases balance control in
standing<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and reduces vital
capacity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. It should be noted that a
recent systematic review concluded that thoracic spine posture may not be associated with
shoulder pain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nevertheless, the focus of
physical therapists on posture is often on the alignment of bony structures and/or balance
between muscle groups.</p><p>High-power posing, an open, expansive, and dominant posture expressing high power, has
gained attention around the world with over thirty-six million views of the renowned
Technology, Entertainment and Design (TED) Talk &#x0201c;<italic>Your body language shapes who you
are&#x0201d;</italic> by social psychologist Amy Cuddy<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The number of views keeps growing every day. One minute of
high-power posing has been found to increase testosterone level, decrease cortisol level,
and increase feelings of power and tolerance for risk compared to low-power posing.
(Low-power posing is a closed, contractive, and submissive posture expressing low power<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>). Adopting a high-power pose for 5&#x02013;6 minutes
prior to a stressful job interview enhances nonverbal presence performance during the
interview<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. High-power posing affects
confirmatory information processing and increases confidence regarding the validity of
decisions<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Interestingly, it was
found that high-power posing could make people more attractive and increase the chances of
initial romantic success when seeking romantic relationship partners<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lastly, it should be noted that the impact of high-power
posing depends on the individual&#x02019;s cultural orientation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Since the introduction of gate control theory by Melzack and Wall in 1965<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, the assessment and management of pain has
evolved significantly, and it is now commonly recognized that psychological factors can
profoundly alter the perception of pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been demonstrated that psychological factors play an
important role in the development of persistent pain and disability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research literature has demonstrated the association
between psychological factors and increased pain intensity in patients with a variety of
conditions such as acute orthopaedic injury<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, lower extremity trauma<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, total knee arthroplasty<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, shoulder pain<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, and chronic low back pain<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. To optimize patient outcomes, physical
therapists should integrate psychological principles into physical therapy sessions<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Power posing is a psychological approach
that may have tremendous potential in physical therapy care.</p><p>The nature of the clinician-patient relationship can often influence patients in a way that
naturally causes the patient to assume a low-power pose during a stressful physical therapy
session. Because adopting such a low-power pose may negatively impact patients,
incorporating high-power posing for patients into their physical therapy intervention could
potentially be useful in reversing those negative effects and improving patient outcomes. It
was found that adopting a high-power pose can increase pain tolerance as measured by the
tourniquet technique, which involves using a blood pressure cuff to reduce blood flow to the
participant&#x02019;s arm and inducing pain<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The same study also showed that interacting with individuals adopting a high-power pose can
decrease pain thresholds and grip strength<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the postural interventions used in the study include
standing and sitting which may alter the blood flow to the arm and confound the pain
threshold tolerance measurements using the tourniquet technique. In addition, recent
experiments based on a larger sample size failed to confirm the effects of high-power poses
on hormonal level and risk tolerance<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.
To our knowledge, there is a lack of rigorous research regarding the implications of
high-power posing on patient outcomes in physical therapy.</p><p>We were interested in integrating high-power posing in physical therapy sessions to improve
outcomes. Muscle strength and pain threshold are representative outcome measurements
routinely used in physical therapy sessions and therefore chosen as outcome measurements.
The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of high-power posing on muscle
strength and pain threshold. The significance of this research project is that it may
provide insight regarding physical therapy interventions for posture and enhance patient
outcomes in physical therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-one subjects, 16 females and 15 males, mean age 28.9 (SD 10.8) years old, were
recruited through a convenience sampling on a university campus by email and word of mouth.
The inclusion criteria included male or female, age 18 to 65, with all four extremities
intact without amputation, and the ability to stand still for 3 minutes. The exclusion
criteria included inability to stand with their feet together or one foot apart for at least
3 minutes, inability to wrap their arms around their torso or keep their hands on their hips
for 3 minutes, inability to squeeze their dominant hand into a fist, lack of sensation in
the region surrounding the upper trapezius muscle, and cognitive impairments that interfere
with the experimental procedures. Ethics approval for this study was sought and obtained
from the Institutional Review Board at Youngstown State University (Protocol number 145-16).
Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. Body weight and height for each
subject were not collected.</p><p>The research design was a randomized controlled trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to
the experimental group or the control group using a shuffled deck of cards. Subjects were
instructed to randomly pick a card. The color (red or black) of the card represented the
group allocation (experimental or control). The outcome measurements were conducted before
and after the postural intervention.</p><p>In the experimental group, the subjects were instructed to stand in a high-power posture
with hands on their hips, elbows pointing out and feet approximately one foot apart for 3
minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>The
high-power pose adopted by subjects in the experimental group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-697-g001"/></fig>). In the control group, the subjects were
instructed to stand in a low-power posture with hands and arms wrapping around the torso and
feet together for 3 minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig.
2.</label><caption><p>The low-power pose adopted by subjects in the control
group</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-697-g002"/></fig>).</p><p>Outcome measurements included grip strength in the dominant hand and pain threshold in the
upper trapezius muscle on the non-dominant hand side. Grip strength was measured using an
electronic hand dynamometer (model EH 101, Camry Scale, City Industry, CA, USA). The maximal
contraction measurements of grip strength have excellent test-retest reliability and
validity<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and hence were used in the study. Pain threshold was measured using
a digital manual muscle dynamometer (model Micro FET 2, Hoggan Scientific, LLC, Salt Lake
City, UT, USA). The subjects were instructed to report to the investigator when they began
to feel pain or discomfort while the investigator gradually increased the force pushing on
the center of upper trapezius muscle through the dynamometer. A familiarization trial was
conducted for the pain threshold for each subject. The outcome measurements were conducted 3
times prior to the postural intervention to establish a baseline and 3 times immediately
after the postural intervention to detect any changes.</p><p>Changes in grip strength and pain threshold are reported as means and 95% confidence
intervals (lower, upper 95% confidence interval). For grip strength, the highest of the
three trials was used for pre- and post-postural intervention grip strength. The change in
grip strength was normalized by the pre-postural intervention strength. For pain threshold,
the lowest of the three trials was used for pre- and post-postural intervention pain
threshold. The change of the pain threshold was normalized by the pre-postural intervention
pain threshold. Student t-tests were used to determine whether there were statistically
significant differences between the changes of the outcome measurements in the experimental
and control groups. An alpha value of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
Microsoft Excel for Mac version 15.25 was used for the data analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Thirty-one subjects, 16 females and 15 males, mean age 28.9 (SD 10.8) years old, were

and pain threshold compared to low-power posing. We were not able to repeat the experiment
results by Bohns on the benefits of high-power posing on pain threshold<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is possible that this is because there are differences
in the postural intervention and pain threshold measurement between the research projects.
In the experiments by Bohns, three yoga poses were adapted as high-power, low-power, and
control groups, respectively. The duration of the postural intervention was 20 seconds. To
measure pain threshold, they used the tourniquet technique which induces pain by blocking
blood flow to the arm with a blood pressure cuff. Part of the rationale for conducting the
current research differently was that the postural interventions used in this study by Bohns
included standing and sitting, which can create differences in blood pooling and alter blood
flow to the arms, thus potentially confounding the pain threshold tolerance measurements
using the tourniquet technique. In addition, different arm levels (one group had arms raised
to shoulder level while the other two groups had arms kept at the body side) may also alter
the blood flow to the arms. Further, the tourniquet technique in the experiments by Bohns
may have been primarily stimulating the nociceptors found in arterial walls, which are
different from the nociceptors found in the muscles and skin stimulated in our experiments.
This may indicate that power posing affects sensory neurons in the autonomic system, which
are located in arterial walls, differently than those in the somatosensory system, which are
located in muscles and skin. Lastly, we adopted a 3-minute duration for postural
interventions, which might be too long and cause discomfort to the subjects who may also
feel awkward towards to the end of the 3 minutes, as Carney et al. speculated<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Different durations have been used in the research conducted by other researchers, ranging
from as short as 20 seconds<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> to one
minute<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> to 5&#x02013;6 minutes<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is possible that &#x0201c;less is more&#x0201d; for the
duration of postural interventions, but there is no data on the optimal duration available.
Future rigorous research with a larger sample size from physical therapy clients on the
optimal duration of power posing for maximal effects is necessary.</p><p>The limitations of the research project include convenience sampling and the small sample
size limited by our available resources. Convenience sampling significantly impacts the
generalizability of the results. The subjects were all young, healthy volunteers, and the
sample lacks diversity. In addition, it was not possible to blind the participants to
minimize subject and investigator bias.</p><p>Physical therapists routinely address posture issues in patients. While the results of this
study were negative, we advocate that high-power posing be integrated in physical therapy.
It is non-invasive and does not require additional equipment and space. It can be easily
integrated into current therapeutic exercise programs and home exercise programs. It is
beneficial to apply knowledge from psychology into physical therapy intervention to improve
patient confidence at the very least. In addition, the optimal posture a physical therapist
should adopt during clinician-patient interaction to improve the outcomes of patients with
diversified cultural background should also be studied.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>RFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Griegel-Morris</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Larson</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Mueller-Klaus</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et
