<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> However, in most cases, RTIs do not present a serious threat to the patient's health and with access to the right information many illnesses could be self-managed at home. This is particularly important as, unfortunately, when a doctor is consulted, antibiotics are normally given.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Provision of such information prior to consultations could potentially result in patients having improved symptom control, lower attendance at general practitioner (GP) surgeries and reduced antibiotic prescriptions&#x02014;which could be one important tool in the fight against antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> A systematic review has documented several trials that have used information to modify consultations for RTIs among children.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, there were only three older trials (the last published in 1991) that addressed the issue of providing specific information prior to consultation for RTIs.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Studies in adults also demonstrate that providing information booklets may help modify consultation behaviour,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> but a wide range of symptoms and conditions were assessed in the latter studies, so the precise role in interventions for modifying consultations for RTIs is less clear.</p><p>Booklets are no longer likely to be distributed as a source of advice regarding the self-management of respiratory infection given the widespread and growing access to the internet as a source of information prior to consulting&#x02014;with more than 80% of families currently having access to the internet (rising by 5% each year). Web-based interventions can enable patients to access reliable self-care information from their home, make an informed decision on how best to manage their symptoms and decide whether they need to visit their doctor. Recently, a trial has reported that advice to use ibuprofen resulted in both poor symptom control (more prolonged illness) and increased complication&#x02014;presumably by interfering with the inflammatory and immune response.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A potential problem about providing self-management advice is that patients might be encouraged to self-manage serious infections inappropriately (ie, when they really need to see the doctor), and so develop complications unnecessarily. This is a major concern for doctors and patients<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref>&#x02014;highlighting the importance of good safety-netting advice (ie, advice about when to consult further) and the need to document the impact of interventions on hospital admissions. However, it is also plausible that good self-management advice about appropriate early assessment of more severe illness could reduce hospital admissions.</p><p>We have developed a theoretically informed internet-delivered intervention to manage RTIs among adults (&#x02018;The Internet Doctor&#x02019;) that we have shown in a small exploratory trial results in higher levels of satisfaction, enablement and understanding of illness.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> We report a larger trial of this website to address whether consultation behaviour can be modified, and to document potential harms (including hospital admissions) over a 1-year period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>We used procedures very similar to our previous leaflet trial.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A random selection of adults in the computerised practice registers from 35 practices in southern England were identified by the practice staff and letters sent to patients inviting them to participate. Patients willing to participate were asked to log on to the website to confirm consent. Patients were also given contact details to enable them to email or talk to the research team before agreeing to participate, or if they had problems logging in. Only one participant per household could participate.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Changes to the protocol</title><p>We originally specified a 12-month period for measuring the primary outcome, but in developing the intervention, we needed to incorporate not just advice to see the GP but also advice to use National Health Service (NHS) Direct, and therefore, to document NHS Direct contacts. We had not anticipated this and so required self-report of the monthly data as our primary outcome. To provide monthly follow-ups for a year would then have had two effects&#x02014;engagement of participants would have been much more difficult and much more resource intensive than originally anticipated. The most meaningful and feasible assessment of the primary outcome was, therefore, the monthly reports of consulting their GP for those individuals who reported a respiratory infection (the intervention was not designed to help those who did not suffer an infection).</p><p><italic>Inclusion criteria</italic>.

On logging onto the website, users could select tailored advice on (1) whether and why they need/do not need to consult the GP and (2) how to self-care for RTIs. Patients selecting consultation advice completed questions about their symptoms and medical history, and were then presented with tailored advice recommending either self-management (for mild symptoms), for more severe symptoms (eg, haemoptysis, prolonged fever) phoning the &#x02018;NHS Direct&#x02019; helpline, which provided nurse-led advice about the need to seek further medical help, or alternatively, seeking medical attention immediately (for symptoms potentially posing serious risks, eg, reduced consciousness level, chest pain). Patients were given the opportunity to challenge this advice by selecting further in-depth information about the symptoms of common complications or serious illness compatible with their symptoms, and by clicking on frequently asked questions (eg, regarding the need for antibiotics and typical time-course of symptoms). The self-care section provided options to select advice on self-management without medication (including rest, fluid intake) or with medication. For those who wanted to take medication, over-the-counter remedies were recommended as an effective and preferable alternative to seeking antibiotics from the GP, and in particular, optimising the use of paracetamol and encouraging the use of ibuprofen. The website was theory-based, addressing all components of the common-sense model of self-regulation of illness<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> (ie, perceived symptoms, cause, timeline, physical and emotional consequences and the possibility for control/cure), and used the principles of social cognitive theory<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> to address expected outcomes of consultation and self-care, and build self-confidence for self-care. Extensive qualitative piloting<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> established that the website was accessible to people with very limited education and no previous computer experience, and quantitative piloting in several hundred people indicated that it increased confidence when self-managing a RTI, and had the potential to reduce consultations.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Control group (normal care)</title><p>As in the intervention group, the control group had access to the GP/practice in the normal way for respiratory illnesses and influenza-like-illness (ILI).

Although relatively limited follow-up was possible (20&#x02005;weeks) there was reduced contact with GPs, and possibly a longer term reduction in hospital admissions. There was a slight increase in contact with NHS Direct, consistent with the advice given by the intervention for management of more severe symptoms that did not warrant immediate medical attention.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>A total of 70% follow-up was achieved, which is high for a free-standing internet intervention, and there was little evidence of attrition bias. There was no differential attrition bias which suggested that resentful demoralisation was minimised by offering the delayed intervention<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The primary outcome was initially anticipated to be at 12&#x02005;months, but a shorter time period was necessary due to the need to engage participants and achieve good follow-up rates with the monthly questionnaires. Monthly questionnaires were also needed, since the intervention during development had to take account of the context of the provision of NHS Direct, and the monthly self-report data was the only source of data about NHS Direct contacts (in addition to documenting episodes that clinicians did not include in the records). The monthly data has the limitations of self-report, and could be biased if GP consultations were discouraged by the Internet Dr, but in fact, the Internet Dr did not gave advice about when to see the doctor promptly. If self-reports of RTIs were biased, we would also have expected different numbers of RTIs to be reported in the intervention group which did not occur. Bias in self-report would also not explain the opposite directions of consultation with NHS Direct and with GPs, and which also makes type I errors unlikely. The estimate derived from primary care notes review for consultations (risk ratio 0.87, lower bound of the 95% CI 0.51) was also consistent with the estimate from the monthly data (risk ratio 0.71). The rate of uptake following invitation was low, but is what would be expected for a free-standing internet-delivered intervention, particularly as this is mostly for minor and common conditions that most will feel, rightly or wrongly, reasonably confident to manage. However, the patients who did participate were those that the intervention is likely to help, that is, participants who are sufficiently concerned about their symptoms to be motivated to use a self-management website. There is also a circularity in engaging participants&#x02014;physicians are much more likely to refer to a free-standing intervention once it has been shown to be effective, so the first priority is to demonstrate effectiveness. Participants were less deprived than non-participants, but controlling for deprivation made little difference to the estimates, and there was no significant interaction of the intervention with deprivation. The number of participants who experienced one or more RTIs was lower than expected, which will have reduced the power to detect differences. Patients' self-reported contacts with the NHS, but recall of contacts made during an infection experienced in the previous month are likely to suffer minimal recall bias. Self-report is the only method of capturing contacts with NHS Direct and, furthermore, the estimates of consultations and admissions purely based on primary care notes suggested changes in the same direction and of a magnitude similar to the monthly self-reports.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Main findings</title><p>The estimated reduction in consultations with GPs with the website was similar to the effectiveness of the pamphlet we developed for predominantly respiratory illness.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> This suggests the internet-delivered intervention is potentially more effective than a pamphlet, given the current widespread availability of NHS Direct online resources and other internet-delivered advice regarding infections. The estimated 25% reduction in GP consultations, even if only over a period of a few months, would provide very considerable relief in terms of pressure on services during the winter months. Perhaps more surprising is that there was a reduction in hospital admissions, albeit non-significant, suggesting the intervention is unlikely to results in delayed presentation of serious illness&#x02014;and if anything could help in relieving pressure on hospital services. One explanation for reduced admission might be that those with severe symptoms were discouraged from seeing the doctor, but since Internet Dr encouraged individuals to seek medical help promptly with severe symptoms this seems unlikely. Although the study was not powered to assess a reduction in antibiotic use, nevertheless the estimates of a 6&#x02013;12% reduction in antibiotic prescriptions over 6&#x02013;12&#x02005;months is consistent with the observation that most individuals who attend the GP get antibiotics,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> so reducing attendance would be expected to potentially provide an important component in the population-level fight against antibiotic resistance, given the evidence that primary-care prescriptions are a key component in driving antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5a"><title>Harms</title><p>In terms of major harms, the upper bound of the CI suggests we can be reasonably sure that no increase in hospital admissions occurred. The most surprising finding was that in the intervention group both symptom duration and the duration of more severe symptoms was increased&#x02014;the latter significantly. This could be either a chance finding or possibly that we made participants more aware of symptoms. However, another possibility is that by strongly encouraging the use of not only paracetamol but also ibuprofen, the intervention may have significantly increased ibuprofen use, and recent trial evidence suggests that advising the use of ibuprofen is unlikely to help overall symptoms, and is associated with the progression of symptoms (ie, prolonging illness)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02014;presumably due to inhibiting the inflammatory element of an effective immune response. When the analysis in the current study controlled for the use of pages that advocated ibuprofen, the finding of increased symptom duration in the intervention group was markedly attenuated. A possible explanation for this attenuation could be that use of ibuprofen pages is a marker of an individual having more severe or florid symptoms, and hence, the symptoms might last longer (ie, reverse causality: the use of ibuprofen pages was because of severe illness, not causing it). However, this explanation is rather unlikely as more florid upper respiratory symptoms and signs are associated with shorter illness duration,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and reverse causality cannot explain why more severe prolonged symptoms were reported in the intervention group since the number of infections reported were almost identical in both groups. Thus, the most reasonable inference is that advice on the use of ibuprofen was probably harmful, and revised versions of the website should therefore not encourage ibuprofen use. Whatever the reasons for the finding of more severe symptoms, the presence of more severe symptoms would be expected to lead to increased consultations, which makes the reduction in the need for GP contacts more striking&#x02014;supporting the earlier findings in the development of the intervention, that the website increases enablement and confidence in managing symptoms.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
