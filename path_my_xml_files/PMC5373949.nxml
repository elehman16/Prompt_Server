Depression results were mixed; one trial showed significantly greater improvements in depression among participants who received weight loss PLUS depression treatment, whereas the other trial showed no effect of adding depression treatment to weight loss treatment. All of these studies have involved in-person lifestyle interventions for obesity treatment. To our knowledge, no previous study has examined whether <italic>Internet-based</italic> lifestyle interventions for obesity improves depression. Given that Internet interventions often yield less weight loss (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) it is possible that these interventions have limited effect on depression.</p><p id="P7">This study is the first to examine whether <underline>Internet-delivered</underline> weight loss treatment impacts depressive symptoms in individuals with overweight or obesity and how those with elevated risk for depression at baseline fare during treatment. Data are from a randomized trial that tested whether adding an Internet behavioral weight loss program to a community campaign improves weight loss outcomes in individuals with overweight or obesity. Results showed that the Internet behavioral weight loss program plus community campaign significantly enhanced weight loss outcomes compared to the community campaign alone.(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) Using data from the trial, we examined the impact of the Internet behavioral weight loss treatment on symptoms of and risk for depression. In addition to examining overall symptoms of depression, we also examined specific symptom clusters including somatic symptoms (e.g., lack of energy), interpersonal symptoms (e.g., isolation), and affective symptoms (e.g., sadness). The analysis of depression subcomponents was included to provide clues for future studies as to potential mechanisms by which weight loss impacts mood. Our hypothesis was that baseline depressive symptoms would be associated with higher attrition during treatment.(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) We also explored whether the Internet behavioral weight loss program yields greater improvements in depressive symptoms and symptom clusters (somatic, interpersonal, affective) compared to the community campaign alone, and examined how those with elevated risk for clinical depression at baseline fared during treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Methods</title><sec id="S7"><title>Design</title><p id="P8">Data reported herein were collected during a randomized trial that examined whether the addition of an Internet behavioral weight loss program to Shape Up Rhode Island, an annual statewide wellness campaign, improves weight loss outcomes in individuals with overweight or obesity.(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) Study exclusion criteria were age &#x0003c; 18 or &#x0003e;70, BMI &#x0003c; 25kg/m<sup>2</sup>, current participation in another weight loss program, a health condition that would make changes to diet or exercise unsafe (e.g., pregnancy, uncontrolled heart condition), unreliable Internet access, or planned relocation during the study period. For detailed exclusion criteria, please see the primary outcome paper.(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) All participants in this secondary data analysis were randomized to either the Internet behavioral weight loss program plus the community initiative (IBWL) or the community initiative alone (Control) using a 2:1 randomization scheme. Both programs were 3 months in length. Assessments were conducted at baseline and post-treatment. As part of the community program, all participants received a pedometer, access to an online platform to report physical activity, free attendance at community workshops focused on healthy eating and physical activity, and prizes for meeting weight and activity goals. Participants in IBWL also received access to an Internet behavioral weight loss program based on the Diabetes Prevention Program.(<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) The IBWL program included an online platform where participants received weight loss, calorie, and physical activity goals; 12 weekly multimedia lessons focused on behavioral weight loss strategies (strategies to reduce calories and increase physical activity including goal setting, problem solving, cognitive restructuring, and relapse prevention); and a self-monitoring platform where participants reported their weight, calorie, and activity information and received automated, tailored feedback each week. IBWL did not include any social support components; there was no platform for participant-participant or participant-staff communication. Instead, all Internet intervention aspects were completely automated.

Scores range from 0 to 60 with higher scores indicative of greater risk for depression. A score of 16 or greater on the CES-D is indicative of elevated risk for clinical depression; this cut-off has demonstrated excellent sensitivity and specificity.(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) In addition to the overall score, the CES-D yields four subscales: depressed affect (e.g., &#x0201c;I felt sad&#x0201d;), positive affect (e.g., &#x0201c;I enjoyed life&#x0201d;) somatic (e.g., &#x0201c;I felt that everything I did was an effort&#x0201d;), and interpersonal (e.g., &#x0201c;People disliked me&#x0201d;).(<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) The CES-D has been used extensively in a variety of studies and has demonstrated high levels of reliability and validity in community samples.(<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</p></sec></sec><sec id="S12"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="P13">Baseline group differences were examined using t-tests or chi-square tests for continuous or categorical variables, respectively.

Relationships between baseline BMI and symptoms of depression were examined using a simple correlation. To determine whether IBWL and Control differed on weight change and change in symptoms of depression from pre- to post-treatment, ANCOVAs were conducted. Education differed between the two arms; thus, in all between group comparisons, it was included as a covariate. Percentage of participants in IBWL vs. Control who met the clinical cut-off for elevated risk for depression (CES-D score&#x02265;16) at post-treatment was compared using logistic regression.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S13"><title>Results</title><sec id="S14"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p id="P14">A total of N=136 were randomized to IBWL or Control. Out of the entire sample, 24% met the clinical cut-off for elevated risk for clinical depression (CESD&#x02265;16) at baseline. Ninety-two percent (N=125) of participants completed all measures at baseline and post-treatment. Attrition rates did not differ between those who met the cut-off for depression risk at baseline (3% attrition) and those who did not (10% attrition, p=.22). Overall baseline symptoms of depression and depression subscales were not associated with baseline BMI (Overall score: r=.04, p=.62; Depressed affect: r=-.02, p=.86; Positive affect: r=.11, p=.24; Somatic: r=.08, p=.35; Interpersonal: r=-.07, p=.44). IBWL and Control participants who completed treatment did not differ on overall baseline symptoms of depression (10.9&#x000b1;7.4 vs. 10.3&#x000b1;7.2, p=.64), depression subscales (p&#x02019;s&#x0003e;.15, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), percentage of participants meeting the clinical cut-off for depression risk (26.5% vs. 23.8%), or any other baseline characteristics with the exception of education; 74.7% of IBWL participants were college graduates compared to 42.9% of Control participants (p=.001).

IBWL participants also experienced significantly greater improvements in overall symptoms of depression (p=.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

Results showed that an Internet behavioral weight loss treatment yielded clinically meaningful weight losses, produced significant improvements in symptoms of depression, and reduced risk for clinical depression. Moreover, the Internet program produced significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms compared to a control condition focused on healthy eating and physical activity. Subgroup analyses showed that, among participants who met the cut-off for risk for clinical depression at baseline, those assigned to Internet weight loss treatment had significantly greater improvements in symptoms of depression and better weight loss outcomes. Consequently, at post-treatment, a smaller percentage of Internet behavioral weight loss participants were at elevated risk for clinical depression.</p><p id="P17">This is the first study to examine whether Internet-based weight loss treatment improves depressed mood in individuals with overweight or obesity. Results are consistent with those from in-person studies.(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) The Internet behavioral weight loss treatment yielded significant improvements in symptoms of depression, both in the entire sample and in the subsample of individuals who met the clinical cut-off for elevated depression risk at baseline. Specifically, 67% of participants in IBWL who met the cut-off at baseline no longer met the cut-off at post-treatment. This result is consistent with previous studies showing that among those with depression at baseline, 40-60% had non-clinical or full remission of depression at post-treatment.(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) However, it&#x02019;s important to note that these studies differed in how they measured depression (e.g., CESD, BDI-II, SCL-20), thus, these comparisons must be interpreted with caution.</p><p id="P18">Whereas in-person interventions involve larger magnitudes of weight loss (e.g., 7-10% of initial body weight),(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) this Internet-delivered treatment produced modest weight loss outcomes (4%) yet still yielded significantly greater improvements in depressive symptoms relative to the control group. These results suggest that modest weight losses alone are sufficient to yield meaningful improvements in symptoms of depression. Subscale analyses from the depression measure elucidate some potential mechanisms by which Internet treatment improves mood in individuals with overweight or obesity; results showed that the Internet program produced significant improvements in both depressed mood and somatic symptoms. Given that items on these subscales reflect feeling sad and lack of energy, respectively, it is possible that weight loss and associated improvements in health,(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) body image,(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and perhaps physical activity (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) may mediate the effects of weight loss on reduction in depressive symptoms. Participants may have also applied some of the cognitive-behavioral strategies presented in the multimedia lessons (problem solving, cognitive restructuring) to their symptoms of depression. Additional research is needed to further understand the mechanisms by which Internet weight loss programs improve symptoms of and risk for depression in individuals with overweight or obesity.</p><p id="P19">Some of these results are inconsistent with previous findings. Unlike earlier studies,(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>-<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) we found no link between depressive symptoms and attrition. Trial retention efforts (e.g., assessment appointment scheduling and reminders from well-trained, interpersonally skilled staff (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)) may explain the discrepancy. These results also suggest that perhaps depressive symptoms should not be a focus of participant selection for obesity treatment trials. In addition, we found no correlation between baseline BMI and symptoms of depression. This lack of significant association may be due to restriction of range; all participants in this trial had a baseline BMI &#x02265; 25kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which may have statistically attenuated our ability to detect an effect.</p><p id="P20">This study has some limitations and several strengths. The sample was predominately female and non-Hispanic white. Thus, additional research is needed to determine how Internet weight loss treatment impacts depression in men and racially and ethnically diverse populations with overweight or obesity. Also, the two interventions differed on several dimensions making it unclear as to which components of the weight loss intervention yielded the significantly greater improvements in symptoms of depression. Finally, the mechanisms (e.g., improvements in health, body image, and physical activity) by which weight loss impacts mood were not assessed in this trial and should be explored in future studies. This study has several strengths. The methodology was rigorous and included a randomized design, a reliable and valid measure of depressive symptoms was used, weight was objectively assessed, and retention was excellent. Moreover, this is the first study to show that Internet behavioral weight loss treatment significantly improves symptoms of depression and risk for depression in individuals with overweight or obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S17"><p><bold>Funding</bold>: This study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (R18 DK083248).</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN1"><p id="P21"><bold>Disclosure</bold>: Dr. Leahey was a paid consultant at WayBetter, Inc. and is currently Chief Scientist at WayBetter, Inc.
