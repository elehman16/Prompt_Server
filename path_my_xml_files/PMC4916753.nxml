Patients were also excluded if they had evidence of intraperitoneal sepsis or peritoneal contamination and if they had received antibiotics whitin 2 weeks prior to surgery. During hospitalization, patients were not given antispastic drugs, steroids, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The patients were classified according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grading system[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as grade I, II, or III [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Laparoscopic surgery was performed using a 4-trocar technique with 1 trocar (10 mm) inserted through a paraumbilical incision (camera port). Two additional (5- or 10 mm) trocars were inserted in the right and left of lower abdomen, and one trocar (12 mm) was inserted in the midline just above the mons pubis (the site of the minilaparotomy). After removal of the resected specimen and preparation of the stapler anastomosis, we closed the minilaparotomy and reintroduced the pneumoperitoneum.</p><p>Conventional colorectal surgery was performed through a vertical midline incision ranging from 5 to 10 cm above the umbilicus to the mons pubis.

It has been accepted as a reliable method for assessing small intestinal permeability. A pretest sample of urine was collected after 6 h of fasting to measured the baseline sugar in the urinary tract. After the pretest sample was obtained, patients were given 10 g of lactulose and 5 g of mannitol dissolved in 100 ml of water orally or via nasogastric tube. Urine was collected for 6 h, divided, and stored at -20&#x000b0; C until assayed. Urinary lactulose and mannitol concentrations were determined by an enzymatic technique.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Mannitol excretion was corrected by subtraction of baseline values determined in the pre-test samples, and the lactulose/mannitol excretion ratios (L/M ratio) were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Entotoxin Measurement</title><p>Endotoxin was quantified in duplicates using a modified chromogenic Limus amoebocyte lysate assay (Quadratech, Epsom, UK.).

The concentration of endotoxin in the sample was taken as the average of the duplicates calculated from standard curve. The assay has a sensitive of 8 pg/ml and is linear in the range 8-100 pg/ml.

More recently, Law <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported in a comparative monocenter series with a median follow-up of 34 months in patients with stage II and III rectal cancer, a 5-year actuarial survival of 71% in the laparoscopic group compared to 59% survival rate in the open-group, also identifying laparoscopy as one of the independent significant factors associated with better survival at the multivariate analysis.</p><p>The positive impact of the laparoscopic approach on survival is still unclear. Supporting evidence of the beneficial oncological role of laparoscopy includes its impact on surgical stress response, cellular immunity, cytokine relase, intraoperative tumor manipulation, and blood transfusion. Moreover, during the early postoperative period, laparoscopic patients seem to display decreased levels of pro-inflammatory and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared to open.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>However, in additional to ongoing discussion about the oncologic safety of laparoscopic approach it is still not completely clear whether this approach offers significant immunological advantages over the conventional open approach.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Han <italic>et al</italic>. reported[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in a prospective comparative study that in patients with stage III colorectal cancer, the cellular immune factors were significantly decreased; however there was no significant difference between the laparoscopic and open groups except for the mHLA-DR: monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR that was affected less by the laparoscopic group compared to the open group.</p><p>The intestinal epithelium is a self-renewing arising from stem cell located at or near the base of the crypts.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Anup <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] using a rat model, showed that laparotomy with mild intestinal handling can result in permeability alterations and oxidative stress in the enterocytes, mainly as a results of activation of xanthine oxidase, and the damage is reversible with time. We have proved the[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] change of intestinal permeability only in patients undergoing open cholecystectomy, with no change occurring in the laparoscopic group. In the open technique, the peritoneum is manipulated, the small intestine handled, and the mesentery placed under traction, while in the laparoscopic cholecystectomy, these are absent or minimized.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Intestinal permeability</title><p>In this study (gut barrier function, and systemic endotoxemia after laparotomic or laparoscopic resection for colon cancer), a change of intestinal permeability was demonstrated both in patients undergoing open colorectal surgery and in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery. The L:M ratio was significantly increased in the both groups at day 1 compared with the preoperative level, but no difference were found between laparoscopic and open surgery group. Since the since groups were similar, the greatest factor in difference between the groups of patients may be effect of surgical approach on intestinal manipulation. These factors (manipulation of peritoneum, etc.), which are integral parts of the open approach, evidently are also involved in laparoscopic colo-rectal approach. Laparoscopic-assisted colorectal resections, on the other hand, require an incision substantially larger than that typically required for other advanced laparoscopic procedures, such as gastric bypass or antireflux procedures. In our opinion, no difference, in intestinal permeability, noted after laparoscopic operations, as regards to the open group, is related to the extent of abdominal wall trauma. Furthermore, in regards to colectomy, there is a wide variation in the size of the incision, needed to extract the specimen and facilitate the anastomosis, dependent on body habitus, the size of the specimen and the surgeon. In our study, the size of the minilaparotomy changed from 5 to 8 cm (mean 5.8 cm). Unfortunately, a substantial proportion of colectomy studies do not provide detailed information regarding incision length. In addition, there is no consensus amongst surgeons as to what constitutes a laparoscopic-assisted procedure or conversion. Other variables that may impact the results of intestinal permeability studies include blood transfusion and the extent and location (right versus left) of the bowel resection performed.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Therefore, when evaluating the intestinal permeability, the colectomy population is much more heterogenous in regards to procedure performed and abdominal wall trauma induced than other advanced procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Systemic endotoxemia</title><p>The surgical approach on intestinal manipulation may lead to the production of vasoactive agents that can cause both local and systemic hemodynamic changes.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] There is evidence to support the role of prostaglandins is causing these hemodynamic responses, even though the exact mechanism leading to their generation is not fully understood.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The mucosa of the intestine and the endothelium of blood vessels contain enzymes capable of synthesizing prostaglandins, production of which may be initiated by neural, ischemic, toxic, or mechanical stimuli.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The generation of these vasoactive prostaglandins can therefore induce splanchnic ischemia with subsequent disruption of mucosal integrity and increased intestinal permeability. Therefore, intestinal manipulation may lead to the endotoxemia detected in the systemic circulation, in patients undergoing colorectal surgery. The results of the present study concur with this suggestion, as endotoxine was found in the systemic circulation in the open and laparoscopic groups of patients. The systemic endotoxin concentration rose significantly, in the both groups, during the course of surgery but returned to near baseline by day 2 and no difference were found between laparoscopic an open surgery group. This implies that mere manipulation of the intestine may have a deleterious effect on intestinal mucosa. Regardless of the etiology of impaired mucosal barrier function, permeation of luminal contents across the bowel wall does occur and results in the endotoxemia.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Endotoxin is a potent stimulator of release of cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor. These inflammatory mediators play an important role in the pathogenesis of systemic inflammatory response syndrome and multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] However, the significance of the correlation between systemic endotoxin concentration and increased intestinal permeability remains unclear. In our study, the endotoxemia was detected mainly during the intraoperative period, but the increased intestinal permeability was observed only 24 h after surgery. Although it would be easy to suggest that endotoxemia was due to an increase in bowel permeability, one may develop independently of the other. Indeed, endotoxemia is known to reduce splanchnic blood flow and cause disruption of mucosal barrier function.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Furthermore, exposing the peritoneal cavity to the atmosphere may in it self lead to endotoxemia.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In some cases, intestinal permeability, and endotoxemia was detected somewhat higher in the laparoscopic than the open surgery, although such data are not statistically significant.
