Intratympanic drug delivery allows for a highly targeted delivery of medication to the cochlea with minimal systemic exposure and is generally considered as safe by otolaryngologists.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> While tympanic membrane perforation, pain, otitis media, vertigo, and hearing loss have been reported as potential complications of intratympanic therapy,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> so far only limited data have been available on actual risk.</p><p>The phase 3 trial TACTT2 (Efficacy and Safety of AM-101 in the Treatment of Acute Peripheral Tinnitus 2) was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of AM-101 (esketamine otic gel; Auris Medical AG, Basel, Switzerland) in acute peripheral tinnitus. AM-101 had previously been tested in 1 phase 1/2<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and 2 phase 2 trials<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> involving &#x0003e;900 injections. Administered in single or triple doses at concentrations of up to 0.81 mg/mL, the study drug had been well tolerated in these previous trials, and only small traces of the active substance and its primary metabolite had been detected in plasma, confirming the minimal systemic exposure afforded by the intratympanic approach.</p><p>The TACTT2 protocol was agreed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under a Special Protocol Assessment procedure. Only minor changes that could affect safety were made compared with the previous AM-101 trials. The esketamine concentration was slightly increased from 0.81 to 0.87 mg/mL to achieve precisely a 1-mg/mL concentration in hydrochloride salt, the study drug was provided in prefilled syringes instead of vials, and the 3 doses could be administered over 3 to 5 days instead of 3 straight days to allow for more scheduling flexibility.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section7-0194599817711378"><title>Methods</title><p>TACTT2 was designed as a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial involving 69 sites in the United States, Canada, Czech Republic, Turkey, Israel, and South Korea (ENT departments and private practices). The trial was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT 01803646) and conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the relevant guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice. The study was approved by the central institutional review board (IRB; Quorum Review IRB, Seattle, Washington) and local IRBs/ethics committees as well as by the FDA and corresponding non-US health authorities.</p><p>Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had persistent tinnitus following a documented incident of traumatic cochlear injury (acute acoustic trauma, blast trauma, middle ear surgery, inner ear barotrauma, tympanic membrane trauma) or acute otitis media with onset up to 3 months prior. Exclusion criteria included fluctuating or intermittent tinnitus, tinnitus resulting from traumatic head or neck injury, M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re&#x02019;s disease or endolymphatic hydrops, history of repeated idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss or acoustic neuroma, fluctuating hearing, hearing threshold &#x02265;75 dB in any audiometric test frequency, ongoing acute or chronic otitis media or externa, any ongoing therapy known to induce tinnitus, concomitant use of any other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist or other tinnitus treatments, or diagnosed psychiatric disorders requiring drug treatment. The use of any antidepressant or antianxiety medication was not allowed, unless it was taken in a low dose, maintained throughout the duration of the study, and not used for the treatment of tinnitus. Breastfeeding and pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who declared being unwilling or unable to practice an effective method of contraception were excluded. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject prior to the performance of any study-specific procedures.</p><sec id="section8-0194599817711378"><title>Randomization and Masking</title><p>Subjects were randomized to receive AM-101 0.87 mg/mL or placebo (vehicle only) at a 3:2 ratio. The likelihood of receiving active treatment was decreased from 2 in 3 in phase 2 to 3 in 5 to counter potential upward drift in the placebo response size that has been observed with psychiatry treatments in phase 3 trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> AM-101 and the placebo had the same appearance and viscosity, and the formulation revealed no differences during or following administration. The study drug was provided to study sites in numbered but otherwise identical kits, each containing one single-dose syringe for the treatment of 1 ear. Subjects were randomized using an interactive web response system and based on a dynamic allocation method<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> with stratification regarding study country, tinnitus etiology (traumatic or otitis media), and treatment laterality (unilateral or bilateral). Patients and investigators remained blinded to the study drug allocation throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="section9-0194599817711378"><title>Procedures</title><p>For each subject, the study consisted of a screening visit, a 2-week screening period, a baseline assessment on the first treatment visit (study day 0), 2 additional treatment visits between day 2 and day 4, and 3 follow-up visits (FUVs), which were scheduled on days 10 (FUV1), 35 (FUV2), and 84 (FUV3). The duration of follow-up was in line with the phase 2 program, where it had sufficiently covered the safety signals and the gradual changes in tinnitus metrics following the (short) treatment phase. Safety-relevant screening assessments included a general physical examination, vital signs, hematology and blood chemistry tests, otoscopy, tympanometry, and pure-tone audiometry (air and bone conducted, using the ascending method of limits). At baseline, vital signs, otoscopy, tympanometry, and pure-tone audiometry were repeated; in addition, a urine drug test was performed, women of childbearing age did a urine pregnancy test, and spontaneous nystagmus was evaluated with Frenzel goggles in the dark, eyes open, and the number of beats, if any, and their direction recorded. If beats were &#x0003e;10/30 seconds, bithermal caloric video- or electronystagmography was performed.</p><p>The study drug was administered by intratympanic injection after the tympanic membrane had been locally anesthetized in accordance with the site&#x02019;s standard practice. The use of phenol was not recommended based on prior study experience.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Prior to study drug administration, any remaining anesthetic had to be suctioned off. The injection was to be performed in the posterior-inferior quadrant or, alternatively, in the anterior-inferior quadrant. After puncturing the tympanic membrane with a needle (tympanopunction) or performing a small incision (tympanotomy), approximately 0.25 mL of the study drug was gently injected into the middle ear. If the subject had a tympanostomy tube placed prior to enrollment, the study medication could be injected through it. The second and third injections were to be performed in the same quadrant and at the same injection site to minimize the risk of damage to the eardrum.</p><p>During the study drug administration, subjects were in a reclined or supine position with their head tilted about 45&#x000b0; toward the untreated ear. Patients remained in this position for approximately 30 minutes to allow for diffusion of the active substance into the cochlea. In case of bilateral tinnitus, the second ear was treated no later than 90 minutes after the first ear.</p><p>Vital signs, otoscopy, nystagmometry, tympanometry, and pure-tone audiometry were performed as safety measures at all follow-up visits. Presence of an opening in the tympanic membrane was considered medically normal for up to 7 days after the administration procedure and hence not considered an adverse event. If the tympanic membrane was still open at study day 10, an additional follow-up visit was scheduled and treatment measures were to be taken as deemed medically indicated.</p></sec><sec id="section10-0194599817711378"><title>Objectives and End Points</title><p>The primary safety end point was the frequency of clinically relevant hearing deterioration in treated ears, defined as hearing deterioration &#x02265;15 dB from baseline to FUV2 at the average of any 2 contiguous test frequencies (based on air conduction thresholds, repeated with bone conduction values).

The causal relationship of the AE to the study drug (&#x0201c;treatment related&#x0201d;) or to an administration procedure, assessment, or blood draw (&#x0201c;procedure related&#x0201d;), if any, was assessed by the investigator, following relevant guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The changes in hematology, blood chemistry, and vital sign values were evaluated as exploratory safety end points.</p></sec><sec id="section11-0194599817711378"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>The sample size of 330 subjects was based on the planned efficacy analysis with the change in the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) and subjective tinnitus loudness as co-primary end points; powering assumptions and test methods for efficacy outcomes will be reported elsewhere. Safety analyses were performed on all subjects who had received study drug at least once (safety analysis set). The percentage of subjects experiencing a clinically relevant hearing deterioration (in at least one of the treated ears in the case of bilateral tinnitus) was compared between treatment groups with Fisher&#x02019;s exact test.

Using untreated contralateral ears as within-subject controls in unilaterally treated subjects confirmed a transient procedure-related effect at FUV1 based on air conduction and only a slight but statistically not significant preponderance of deteriorations in the treated ear based on bone conduction. This suggests that apart from the transient procedure-related effect, observed hearing deterioration represented normal variation.</p><p>The rapid closure of the tympanic membrane in the present study&#x02014;92% closed at FUV1&#x02014;vindicates the recommendation for using other local anesthetics rather than phenol. Whereas in the first phase 2 study with AM-101, a 93% closure rate had been achieved at FUV1 with the use of a 10% lidocaine pump spray,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> the protocol for the second phase 2 study had not specified any particular anesthetic, and the closure rate was only &#x0003c;80%.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Here phenol and, in rare cases, Bonain&#x02019;s solution (a mixture of phenol, cocaine, and menthol) were applied to 43% of subjects, and these 2 products accounted for a disproportionate 87% of cases with open eardrums at FUV1. Apart from phenol&#x02019;s potential retarding effect on tympanic membrane closure, it should also be considered that it is a highly caustic chemical and can cause severe burns.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Although some studies have shown or suggested that intratympanic administration without anesthesia may result in similar pain perception as with anesthesia,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> it appears advisable to use a local anesthetic for patient acceptance and comfort and as the experience of pain is highly individual.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>To our knowledge, TACTT2 was the first study to prospectively collect AE data differentiated by relatedness to the procedure or to the treatment. For the further adoption of intratympanic administration, it will be important to dispose of more detailed, differentiated, and evidence-based information on the nature and rate of potential complications. For example, it appears from a review of some of the largest trials with intratympanic administration of recent years that the rate of persistent tympanic membrane perforation 2 to 4 months following intratympanic corticosteroid administration ranged between 1.6% and 15.5% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6-0194599817711378">

</xref>). Since no such outcome was observed with intratympanic IGF-1<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and only in 1 of more than 2000 cases over the entire AM-101 program so far, this points rather to an effect of the drug, specifically corticosteroids&#x02019; well-known retarding effects on wound healing, than to the procedure itself. Furthermore, when high incidences of AEs for ear pain or injection pain are reported&#x02014;54.3% and 27.1% in 1 well-conducted trial<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>&#x02014;the number of injections (4 in that case) and, more importantly, the tolerability of the drug formulation have to be taken into account (methylprednisolone solution). As pointed out by previous authors,<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> none of the drug compositions that are commonly used for local application to the middle ear have been formulated specifically for good middle ear tolerance and may contain preservatives or have a pH or osmolarity that can cause irritation or pain.</p><table-wrap id="table6-0194599817711378" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 6.</label><caption><p>Reported Rates of Persistent Tympanic Membrane Perforation following Intratympanic Administration.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0194599817711378-table6"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Study</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Indication</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treatment</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anesthetic</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No.</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Follow-up, d</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Persistent TM Perforation, %</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rauch et al, 2011<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ISSNHL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 &#x000d7; methylprednisolone 40 mg/mL of over 2 weeks</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">129</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.9</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lambert et al, 2012<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re&#x02019;s disease</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 &#x000d7; 3 or 12 mg dexamethasone in poloxamer gel</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">84</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.3</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nakagawa et al, 2014<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">SSHL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 &#x000d7; 3.8 mg/mL dexamethasone over 4-7 days</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lidocaine</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">112</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 &#x000d7; IGF-1 10 mg/mL in gelatin hydrogel</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">62</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lambert et al, 2016<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re&#x02019;s disease</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 &#x000d7; 12 mg dexamethasone in poloxamer gel</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Unknown</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">120</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.7</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Topf et al, 2017<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0194599817711378" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">M&#x000e9;ni&#x000e8;re&#x02019;s disease or ISSHNL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02265; 1 &#x000d7; dexamethasone 10 mg/mL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phenol</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">192</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">90</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.6</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn6-0194599817711378"><p>Abbreviations: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; ISSNHL, idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss; SSHL, sudden sensorineural hearing loss; TM, tympanic membrane.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>In conclusion, repeated intratympanic injections of AM-101 over a 3- to 5-day period appear to be safe and well tolerated.

The study outcomes support the use of repeated-dose intratympanic administration over longer time periods, especially when using medication adapted for intratympanic use as well as appropriate local anesthetics.</p></sec><sec id="section20-0194599817711378"><title>Author Contributions</title><p><bold>Hinrich Staecker</bold>, substantial contribution to conception and design, principal investigator in the study, contribution to analysis and interpretation of data, contribution to drafting the work, final approval of work, accountable for all aspects therein; <bold>Michael Morelock</bold>, principal investigator in the study, contribution to critical review, final approval of work, accountable for all aspects therein; <bold>Timothy Kramer</bold>, principal investigator in the study, contribution to critical review, final approval of work, accountable for all aspects therein; <bold>Pavel Chrbolka</bold>, principal investigator in the study, contribution to critical review, final approval of work, accountable for all aspects therein; <bold>Joong Ho Ahn</bold>, principal investigator in the study, contribution to critical review, final approval of work, accountable for all aspects therein; <bold>Thomas Meyer</bold>, substantial contribution to conception and design, directing the sponsor of the study, participating in the analysis and interpretation of data, contribution to drafting the work, final approval of work, accountable for all aspects therein.</p></sec><sec id="section21-0194599817711378"><title>Disclosures</title><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> Hinrich Staecker, recipient of speaker honoraria for participating in symposia organized by sponsor at AAO annual meetings and advisor in FDA meeting with the sponsor.
