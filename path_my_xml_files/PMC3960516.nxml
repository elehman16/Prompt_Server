For four consecutive days, we alternately administered a standardized dried extract of <italic>Equisetum arvense</italic> (EADE, 900&#x02009;mg/day), placebo (corn starch, 900&#x02009;mg/day), or hydrochlorothiazide (25&#x02009;mg/day), separated by a 10-day washout period. Each volunteer served as his own control, and the groups' results were compared. We repeated the same evaluation after each stage of treatment to evaluate the safety of the drug. The diuretic effect of EADE was assessed by monitoring the volunteers' water balance over a 24&#x02009;h period. The <italic>E. arvense</italic> extract produced a diuretic effect that was stronger than that of the negative control and was equivalent to that of hydrochlorothiazide without causing significant changes in the elimination of electrolytes. There was no significant increase in the urinary elimination of catabolites. Rare minor adverse events were reported. The clinical examinations and laboratory tests showed no changes before or after the experiment, suggesting that the drug is safe for acute use. Further research is needed to better clarify the mechanism of diuretic action and the other possible pharmacological actions of this phytomedicine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Interest in phytotherapeutic agents is growing in North America and Europe [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that treatments using medicinal plants are highly lucrative internationally, and more than 100 countries have established regulations for phytotherapeutic products. The annual profits of this business reached 5 billion USD in Western Europe between 2003 and 2004, 14 billion USD in China in 2005, and 1.1 billion BRL in Brazil in 2011 [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>is from the family Equisetaceae, and it is popularly known as &#x0201c;cavalinha&#x0201d; in Brazil and &#x0201c;horsetail&#x0201d; in North America and Europe. <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>L. is one of the most widely prescribed medicinal plants. This plant is found across the Americas, Europe, Northern Africa, and Asia [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and it is traditionally used as a diuretic and a remineralization, antiedematous, and anti-inflammatory agent [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The aerial parts of <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>contain flavonoids, saponins, caffeic acid, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, sterols, and minerals (primarily silicon and potassium salts). The presence of high concentrations of flavonoids, phenolic compounds, and mineral salts indicates a mild diuretic action of this herbal medicine. The abundance of silicon salts indicates that <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>may possess remineralization properties [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Preclinical studies have revealed various pharmacological actions of <italic>Equisetum arvense</italic>, including antioxidant [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and antidiabetic [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] properties, but no acute hepatotoxicity [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The health regulatory agencies of the Federal Republic of Germany established the German Commission E in 1974. This commission approved the use of <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>for the treatment of posttraumatic and static edema and as a diuretic for bacterial and inflammatory diseases of the urinary tract presenting with urinary sediment [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Topical use as an adjuvant for the treatment of wounds that exhibit difficult healing has been reported [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, <italic>E. arvense </italic>does not satisfy the requirements as a well-established medicine, despite an ancient tradition of use because clinical studies of its effects on renal function and safety are lacking. The &#x0201c;Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use&#x0201d; of the European Medicines Agencies concluded that clinical data on the absorption, distribution, and pharmacokinetics of <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>are scarce or completely lacking [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The present study assessed the diuretic action and the short-term safety of a standardized dry extract of the aerial parts of <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>in healthy men using a randomized, double-blind clinical study. The effects of the extract on fluid balance (FB) and urinary catabolite excretion, as well as its possible toxic effects on liver, kidney, and heart function, were assessed. The drug effects were compared to those of a placebo (corn starch) and a classic diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide).</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Study Materials</title><p>Three compounds were prepared: a standardized dry extract of the aerial parts of <italic>E. arvense </italic>containing 0.026% total flavonoids, hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo (starch). These compounds were formulated by the Farm&#x000e1;cia Artesanal (Artesanal Pharmacy), a compounding pharmacy that is duly licensed and certified by the official regulatory agencies of the city of Goi&#x000e2;nia (Goi&#x000e1;s, Brazil) and that possesses the appropriate analytical and quality assurance certificates. The authenticity of the <italic>E. arvense </italic>sample used in the present study was assessed by the Laboratory of Natural Product Research (Laborat&#x000f3;rio de Pesquisa de Produtos Naturais (LPPN)) of the School of Pharmacy of the Federal University of Goi&#x000e1;s (Universidade Federal de Goi&#x000e1;s (UFG)) using thin-layer chromatography following the method described by Wagner and Bladt [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>The tested substances were placed in capsules, which were placed in vials and labeled with the letters A, B, and C.

Selection of Volunteers</title><p>The clinical trial complied with the guidelines of Resolution 196/96 of the National Health Council and the Declaration of Helsinki for research on human beings. The research ethics committee of UFG, which is accredited by the National Commission of Research Ethics of the National Health Council/Health Ministry, approved the protocol (no. 312/10).</p><p>The volunteers completed an informed consent form that granted the researchers the right to use the collected materials to perform the required tests to establish the correct medication use, as described in the experimental protocol.</p><p>The Recruitment Department of the Institute of Pharmaceutical Science (Instituto de Ci&#x000ea;ncias Farmac&#x000ea;uticas&#x02014;ICF) recruited and selected all of the volunteers using an institutional database of volunteers who were duly oriented to the importance of appropriate and reliable data collection. Furthermore, the records of these volunteers indicated that the results of biochemical screening tests three months before the onset of the study had been normal.</p><p>A total of 36 healthy male volunteers who were 20 to 55 years of age, 1.50 to 1.85&#x02009;m tall, and 50 to 90&#x02009;kg in weight were selected on the basis of their medical histories, past medication use, physical examinations, vital signs, and laboratory results.</p><p>Smokers and individuals with congestive heart failure, arterial hypertension, or a history of kidney disease, cardiovascular diseases, endocrine disorders, or other underlying diseases were excluded.</p><p>The other exclusion criteria included a lack of proper compliance with the protocol at any stage of the study and the appearance of unexpected or exacerbated reactions.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Experimental Protocol</title><p>The 36 volunteers (numbered 1 to 36) were randomly allocated to six different drug administration sequences (<italic>n</italic> = 6), in accordance with the design for practical use suggested by Williams (1949), which allows the detection of possible differences between drug treatments [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The volunteers were subjected to a three-step treatment protocol in which the order of the three treatments (i.e., <italic>Equisetum arvense, </italic>hydrochlorothiazide, and placebo) was alternated. Each treatment was administered for four consecutive days at each stage, and there was a 10-day washout interval between treatment stages. All of the volunteers consumed one capsule three times per day during each stage of the treatment, followed by the washout period, during which the volunteers received no treatments but continued to follow the diet and lifestyle recommendations (see below). All of the volunteers underwent all three treatments and served as their own controls. The treatment regimen was repeated under the same methodological conditions across the three stages of the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p><sec id="sec2.3.1"><title>2.3.1. Definition of the Study Time Points</title><p>Day 0 corresponded to the day before treatment onset. Days 1, 2, 3, and 4 were the treatment days, which were followed by the 10-day washout period. Therefore, day 10 of any washout period was also day 0 of the following stage.</p><p>The volunteers recorded their fluid input and urinary output over 24&#x02009;h (24&#x02009;h fluid balance) on day 0 and during the four days of the treatment to assess the effects of the treatments.

Drug Treatment</title><p>The capsules used in all the treatments exhibited an identical appearance (size 0 gel capsules). The volunteers received two vials, labeled Vial 1 and Vial 2, at each treatment stage. Vial 1 contained four blue capsules to be taken once per day in the morning for four days, and Vial 2 contained eight capsules to be taken twice per day for four days. The capsules were delivered randomly to the volunteers at the Clinical Research Unit of ICF.</p><p>
<italic>(i) Treatment A (Equisetum arvense). </italic>Vial 1 contained four blue capsules, and Vial 2 contained eight green capsules. All of the capsules contained 300&#x02009;mg <italic>E. arvense </italic>(a dry extract with 0.026% total flavonoids). The daily dose of 900&#x02009;mg was divided into three daily doses of one capsule each. </p><p>
<italic>(ii) Treatment B (Hydrochlorothiazide).</italic> Vial 1 contained four blue capsules of 25&#x02009;mg hydrochlorothiazide, and Vial 2 contained eight green capsules of 300&#x02009;mg starch (placebo). The total daily dose of hydrochlorothiazide was a single, 25&#x02009;mg dose taken in the morning, and two doses of placebo were taken daily.</p><p>
<italic>(iii) Treatment C (Starch).</italic> Vial 1 contained four blue capsules, and Vial 2 contained eight green capsules. All of the capsules contained 300&#x02009;mg starch. The volunteers took one capsule three times per day.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Laboratory Examinations</title><p>All the volunteers underwent blood and urine tests. The blood tests included a complete blood count and assessments of the concentrations of fasting blood glucose, albumin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin, direct and indirect bilirubins, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chlorine, phosphorus, and magnesium. The urine tests included a urinalysis and analyses of the sodium and potassium levels.</p><p>The blood and urine samples were collected at the Clinical Research Unit of ICF by pharmacists who were affiliated with the Group of Toxicopharmacological Studies and Research of UFG (NEPET-UFG). All the samples were appropriately packaged and were transported to the R&#x000f4;mulo Rocha Laboratory of the School of Pharmacy of UFG for analysis. The samples were collected exclusively on the day before treatment onset and the day after the end of treatment for each stage of the study.</p><p>All the volunteers underwent two ECG tests: the first test before the onset of the study and the second immediately following the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6. Medical Assessments and Treatment Prescriptions</title><p>The medical assessments were performed and the treatments were prescribed in the Clinical Research Unit of ICF. The complete clinical history of each volunteer was obtained at the beginning of the study, and a clinical assessment was conducted at each stage of the study prior to and after the treatments to record clinical manifestations, possible adverse reactions, and physical examination results.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7. Activities during the Experimental Phase</title><p>The volunteers were provided with guidelines for their lifestyle, diet, and physical activity before the onset of the experimental phase. The volunteers were requested not to change their diet during the study and to avoid drug use, alcoholic drinks, and beverages with a diuretic effect (e.g., coffee and tea). The volunteers were also asked to perform their usual physical and daily routine activities and avoid more intense or long-lasting exercises than usual.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>2.8. Recording of Fluid Input and Output and Fluid Balance</title><p>The volunteers were provided with backpacks to carry continually throughout the study. Each backpack included two separate compartments to store (in a hygienic manner) a graduated measuring cup to measure fluid intake, a vessel with a cap to measure urine, a notebook, and a pen to record the volumes of ingested fluids and urination. All of the volunteers signed a form indicating the receipt of the materials and their commitment to comply with the provided instructions. From day 0 to day 4, the volunteers recorded the volume of urine after each urination and, immediately after any intake of fluid, the volume of fluid ingested. These data served as the basis for the fluid balance (FB) calculations.</p><p>Therefore, the FB represented the difference between the volumes of fluid intake and excreted urine over 24&#x02009;h, from the first urination in the morning after awakening to the final urination before arising from bed the following morning [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.9"><title>2.9.

A negative final FB is an important criterion for establishing the presence of diuresis. Therefore, a negative final FB indicated the induction of a diuretic effect by <italic>E. arvense </italic>and hydrochlorothiazide and the absence of this effect with placebo [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). </p><p>
<italic>(b) Assessment of the Intergroup Final FB.</italic> Intergroup comparisons of the final FBs revealed significant differences between Groups A (<italic>E. arvense</italic>) and C (placebo) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and between Groups B (hydrochlorothiazide) and C (placebo) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.026). However, no difference between Groups A and B was observed (<italic>P</italic> = 0.566). These results demonstrate that <italic>E. arvense </italic>and hydrochlorothiazide were associated with similar, negative final FB values, which suggests that these agents produced a similar diuretic effect that was superior to that of the placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). </p><p>
<italic>(c) Assessment of the Effects of the Treatments on Urinary Electrolyte Concentrations</italic>. The rates of urinary sodium and potassium excretion were not significantly altered by the treatments at any of the three stages of the study. Pearson's correlation revealed no correlations between FB and sodium excretion during the first (<italic>P</italic> = 0.513), second (<italic>P</italic> = 0.824), or third (<italic>P</italic> = 0.513) stages of the study. Similarly, no correlations between FB and potassium excretion were observed during the first (<italic>P</italic> = 0.388), second (<italic>P</italic> = 0.425), or third (<italic>P</italic> = 0.931) stage.</p><p>The negative final FB of hydrochlorothiazide was similar to that of <italic>E. arvense</italic>, which supports the existence of a diuretic effect of <italic>E. arvense </italic>[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, the large standard deviations of the final FB values may have negatively affected the significance of the diuretic effect in the <italic>E. arvense </italic>group. This statistical result was caused by the wide heterogeneity of the volunteers' responses following hydrochlorothiazide administration. This result is not surprising; previous studies have reported variability in the response to this drug. Earley and Orloff [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Kim et al. [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] discussed the antidiuretic effects of hydrochlorothiazide in patients with diabetes insipidus. One clinical trial suggested that the observed variations in the pharmacokinetics of hydrochlorothiazide were functions of individual sensitivities to this drug and the presence of digestive disorders that may have impaired drug absorption [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Another study assessed the control of arterial pressure using hydrochlorothiazide. These authors reported such wide variations in the magnitude and direction of the response between the volunteers that they considered the measurement of blood pressure at medical offices to be inadequate for predicting arterial pressure control in an outpatient setting. However, these authors attributed the observed variability to discrepancies between the measuring techniques [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The dose of <italic>E. arvense </italic>administered in the present work was the maximum recommended dose for dry extracts (900&#x02009;mg) [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The use of this dosage might explain the comparable diuretic effects of <italic>E. arvense </italic>and hydrochlorothiazide at a daily dose of 25&#x02009;mg. The results concerning the diuretic effect of <italic>E. arvense </italic>corroborate some previous preclinical data. The European Medicines Agency has demonstrated a diuretic effect of <italic>E. arvense </italic>in dogs, and common horsetail is an effective and fast-acting diuretic agent in rats that does not induce a negative FB. Kreitmair (1936 and 1953) and Herre (1937) demonstrated results similar to ours. Volmer (1937, 1939, 1940, and 1941) used an <italic>E. arvense </italic>tea to demonstrate diuretic effects and negative FBs in rats and rabbits (as cited in [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]). Rebuelta and San Roman [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] observed a mild diuretic effect of <italic>E. arvense </italic>in a preclinical study.</p><p>Our experimental data confirm the ethnopharmacology and traditional use of <italic>E. arvense </italic>as a diuretic, which occurs worldwide, including in Brazil and other South American countries [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and in several European [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and Asian countries [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Additional Tests</title><p>The results of the additional tests (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2.10.2">Section 2.10.2</xref>) revealed that the values of all of the investigated variables remained within the normal ranges, which suggests that no acute manifestations of kidney, liver, hematological, or electrolyte toxicity occurred. The results of Student's <italic>t</italic>-test revealed significant variations in some of the assessed values, but none of these results exhibited values outside of the normal range. During stage 1, <italic>E. arvense </italic>induced significant reductions in the creatinine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.003) and uric acid (<italic>P</italic> = 0.010) levels.

One volunteer reported a strong, adverse reaction consisting of copious diuresis and polydipsia following a single dose of hydrochlorothiazide during the first stage of the study. Two volunteers reported irregular compliance with the protocol. The latter three volunteers were removed from the study and were immediately replaced with other volunteers from the same ICF volunteer database using the same inclusion and exclusion criteria. The rest of the reported symptoms were classified as mild. Most of the symptoms improved without the use of symptomatic medication, and only two volunteers used analgesics (acetaminophen) during the experiment. Headache was the most frequently reported symptom; it occurred with all of the treatments at most stages of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>3.6.

<italic>E. arvense </italic>produced a diuretic effect as assessed with FB measurements. This effect was comparable to that of hydrochlorothiazide (25&#x02009;mg) and was superior to that of placebo (starch).</p><p>
<italic>E. arvense </italic>did not exert significant effects on the urinary excretion of electrolytes and catabolites, and it was deemed safe for oral use. No alterations were observed in the liver, kidney, or hematological function tests, and the reported adverse reactions were mild and infrequent.</p><p>Future studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of the diuretic action of <italic>E. arvense </italic>and the other possible pharmacological actions of this phytomedicine.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the Goi&#x000e1;s State Research Foundation (Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Apoio &#x000e0; Pesquisa do Estado de Goi&#x000e1;s, Brasil&#x02014;FAPEG) for financial support; the Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, Brazil (ICF) for its collaboration during the entire experimental phase of the study; Farm&#x000e1;cia Artesanal (Artesanal Pharmacy), which generously supplied the drugs for the present study; and the Laboratory of Natural Products Research (LPPN) of the School of Pharmacy of UFG for the quality control analysis of the <italic>Equisetum arvense </italic>samples. </p></ack><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Geavlete</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Multescu</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Geavlete</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>
