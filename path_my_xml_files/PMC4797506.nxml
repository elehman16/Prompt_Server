Recent studies have reflected a growing interest in the validation of these hypotheses. Indeed, results from case series,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] a case-control study,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and randomized controlled trials (RCTs)[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] have supported the proposed safety and practicality of SILC. Unfortunately, results from meta-analyses and systematic reviews[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] have not determined definitively the precise benefits of SILC over TLC, because of small study populations and inadequate follow-up data.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>This prospective RCT was designed to assess the perioperative features and short-term outcomes of SILC versus TLC using a large population and 6-month follow-up in a single-center setting to gain better understanding of the benefits of these procedures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical approval of the study protocol</title><p>The Institutional Review Board of Beijing Friendship Hospital (Beijing, China) approved the study protocol in October 2011. The study had been registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (NCT01383031). The decision to participate was voluntary, and each patient provided written informed consent before enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Patient recruitment</title><p>Patients (aged 18&#x02013;75 years old) with symptomatic gallstones or polyps documented by imaging were enrolled. Patients were required to have a low degree of functional impairment (Karnofsky performance scale [KPS] of &#x02265; 70) and nonobese status (body mass index [BMI] of &#x0003c; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Patients were excluded according to a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, previous upper-abdominal surgery, current/anticipated pregnancy, current breast-feeding, preoperative indication for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, or indication for intraoperative imaging of the biliary tract. In addition, discretion was given to the surgeon to exclude otherwise eligible patients according to their judgment of contraindications for laparoscopy. Enrollment or exclusion of all participants was judged by a senior surgeon who worked independently of this RCT.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Randomization</title><p>Enrolled patients were assigned to receive SILC or TLC using a 1:3 ratio randomization scheme. The complete randomization sequence was generated by a statistician who had no other role in this RCT. The allocation sequence was delivered in sealed opaque envelopes to a nurse within the operating room (who was not otherwise engaged in the study) immediately before surgery. Only the operating surgeon and accompanying staff in the operating room were aware of the procedure selected.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical procedures</title><p>All surgical procedures were carried out by surgeons with extensive experience in TLC and who had undertaken &#x0003e;50 SILC procedures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy</title><p>All TLC-treated patients were placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position with their legs placed together. With the operating surgeon located on the patient's left side, a 10-mm subumbilical incision was made. Then, 12-mmHg insufflation of the abdominal cavity was performed. A 10-mm trocar was inserted to introduce a 30&#x000b0; laparoscope. Then, under direct vision, one 10-mm trocar and one (three-port) or two (four-port) 5-mm trocars were placed in the subxiphoid region and the right subcostal region along the midclavicular (third port) or anterior axillary line (fourth port). One or two graspers were used to retract the gallbladder and expose Calot's triangle. After dissection of the cystic duct and cystic artery, endoclips were applied, and the duct and artery were transected. The gallbladder was dissected from the gallbladder bed, placed in the retrieval bag, and removed through the subumbilical port. Finally, port openings were sutured, and all patients were dressed with four bandages to simulate four-port TLC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy</title><p>All SILC-treated patients were placed in the reverse Trendelenburg position with the legs well-separated to accommodate positioning of the operating surgeon. With the patient under general anesthesia, a 2.5-cm semicircular incision was made in the upper half of the umbilicus [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. After a pneumoperitoneum was generated in the abdominal cavity by adding 12 mmHg of insufflation pressure, two 5-mm trocars and one 10-mm trocar were inserted through the umbilical incision at different fascial levels and in a triangular fashion [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1d</xref>]. Then, a 5-mm, rigid, 30&#x000b0; laparoscope was introduced through the upper trocar; the remaining two trocars were used to introduce the various other instruments required for the laparoscopic procedure. All of the instruments used in the SILC procedure were the same as those used for TLC (see above) except that the grasper used to expose Calot's triangle was 10 cm longer to prevent external crowding. After dissection of the cystic artery and cystic duct, endoclips were applied to facilitate transection of both. Next, the gallbladder was resected completely from the gallbladder bed and retrieved through the 10-mm trocar. Finally, peritoneal and subcutaneous tissues were closed with a 4/0 absorbable suture. The skin was closed with an intradermal suture, and four bandages were left to simulate four-port TLC.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Blinding</title><p>Identical opaque dressings were used on all patients regardless of the surgical procedure. The dressings remained in place and unopened until pain scoring was completed during the first postdischarge visit (postoperative day [POD] 7). Thus, the randomization allocation was concealed from participants and investigators until the first postdischarge visit.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Patients received analgesics as required. Six hours after surgery, patients were encouraged to begin oral intake and mobilize. Duration of hospitalization and date of discharge from hospital were set according to routine practice of the hospital and discretion of the treating surgeon. The first follow-up examination (6 h after surgery) was undertaken in the surgical ward. All subsequent follow-ups were conducted in the outpatient department.</p><p>Primary endpoint of our RCT was postoperative pain, which was evaluated by a visual analog scale (VAS) and assessed at 6 h, 24 h, and 7 days, as well as 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Secondary endpoints were the KPS, wound-related complications, operative time, duration of hospital stay, and cost.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Sample size</title><p>The study was designed and initiated without calculation of sample size because of the lack of confirmative pain-score data in PubMed for dates earlier than October 2011. Therefore, we determined the mean VAS score for the first 10 patients in the SILC group and the first 30 patients in the TLC group. Using the mean VAS score (SILC: 3.9 &#x000b1; 1.5; TLC: 5.2 &#x000b1; 1.7), we calculated the sample size required to detect a significant difference between the experimental (i.e., SILC) group and control (i.e., TLC) group using a two-tailed test with a type-I error of 5% and statistical power of 80%, and allowed for a 10% dropout rate. The target number of SILC patients was 138, which is three-fold than number for TLC patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Collection of prospective data was carried out from enrollment through to follow-up. Data were recorded in a password-protected computerized database. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies. Continuous variables were summarized as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) or as the median with the 25<sup>th</sup> and the 75<sup>th</sup> percentiles (P25, P75). Categorical variables were compared using the chi-squared test. Continuous variables were compared using the Student's <italic>t</italic>-test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test according to the distribution. The relationship between VAS score and operative time was examined using scatter plots and Kendall's tau correlation coefficients. Statistical significance was determined by two-sided <italic>P</italic> values, with a <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 set as the threshold for significance.

Thus, SILS has been proposed as an alternative &#x0201c;conduit&#x0201d; procedure that may facilitate widespread transition from traditional laparoscopy to NOTES.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>As a new and rapidly developing method, SILS has been carried out on several complex procedures such as bariatric surgery,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] radical mastectomy,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] colorectomy,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] hepatic lobotomy,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] splenectomy,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and distal pancreatectomy.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Safety and feasibility of SILC have been validated, but a clinical trial with a large sample size is necessary to evaluate better the differences between SILC and TLC, particularly in terms of postoperative pain, KPS, wound-related complications, hospital stay, and cost. Our prospective RCT of SILC versus TLC was designed to evaluate a larger case series with longer follow-up than those documented previously.</p><p>Reports of SILC have provided inconsistent data regarding the presence and extent of postoperative pain and requirement for analgesics. For example, a prospective study suggested a trend in SILC-treated patients of less pain 3 h and 24 h after surgery.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, another study demonstrated that VAS scores differed only on POD 7, and that the SILC group had significantly worse pain than the TLC group.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Two meta-analyses of published RCTs have suggested that SILC might result in less postoperative pain,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] but robust data showing definitively that a single-incision reduces the risk of postoperative pain are lacking.</p><p>Several factors can affect postoperative pain such as sex, age, wound size, and recovery time of gastrointestinal function. VAS is the most objective evaluation criterion, which is why we chose it to evaluate the postoperative pain. Our results were not in complete agreement with previous studies on postoperative pain. Patients treated with SILC or TLC showed no significant differences in VAS score 24 h, 7 days, or 1, 3, or 6 months after surgery. Only at 6 h after surgery did the SILC-treated group showed a significantly lower pain score than that of the TLC-treated group. However, when putting this 1-point difference on a 10-point scale, there seemed to be no dramatic change in clinical practice.</p><p>Interpretation of the findings from several studies in publicly available literature is difficult because of the heterogeneous design of such studies. Several variables are known to influence a patient's experience of the postoperative pain. Some authors have suggested that the higher VAS score associated with SILC may be explained by the larger incision wound.</p><p>However, our RCT suggested that operative time may contribute (at least in part) to higher pain scores because a significant relationship was found for long operative times (&#x02265; 100 min) and the shortest operative time (&#x0003c; 40 min) when the potential correlation between postoperative pain and mean operative time was examined. Therefore, we postulated that single-incision-related pain might be more closely related to the multiple instruments &#x0201c;squeezed&#x0201d; into a single wound site than the wound size itself.</p><p>Unfortunately, our RCT did not address whether SILC-related postoperative pain was correlated with umbilical access methods such as direct-puncture or porous-channel puncture devices (e.g., TriPort [Olympus, Tokyo, Japan] or SILS Port [Covidien, Dublin, Ireland]). These commercial products not only protect the wound better during the procedure but can also shorten the operative time by reducing the risk of instrument collision within the wound site. Hospital cost would be increased considerably using these commercial products, and this has been considered a complicating factor that should be considered in future meta-analyses of RCTs of SILC.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] As such, the expense of such procedures must be considered when interpreting our data.</p><p>Although our study had limitations, it provided evidence that the immediate postoperative pain associated with SILC is only slightly lower than that associated with TLC. In addition, the pain score was shown to be strongly affected by the operative time. If surgeons who carry out SILC are well-trained and operative time is shortened as a result, SILC might be more beneficial to patients than TLC.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Financial support and
