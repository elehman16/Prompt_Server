Nine male members of the CrossFit&#x000ae; community (age 26.7 &#x000b1; 6.6 years; body mass 78.8 &#x000b1; 13.2 kg; body fat 13.5 &#x000b1; 6.2%; training experience 2.5 &#x000b1; 1.2 years) completed two experimental protocols (24 h apart): (1) strength and power exercises, (2) gymnastic movements, and (3) metabolic conditioning as follows: 10 min of as many rounds as possible (AMRAP) of 30 double-unders and 15 power snatches (34 kg). The same sequence as repeated on session 2 with the following metabolic conditioning: 12 min AMRAP of: row 250 m and 25 target burpees. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and osteoprotegerin were measured before, immediately post and 24 h after workout of the day (WOD) 1, immediately post, 24 and 48 h after WOD 2. Peak and mean power were obtained for each repetition (back squat with 50% of 1 repetition maximum) using a linear position transducer measured before, immediately post and 24 h after WOD 1, immediately post and 24 h after WOD 2. Blood lactate and glucose were measured pre and immediately post WOD 1 and 2. Although both sessions of exercise elicited an significant increase in blood lactate (1.20 &#x000b1; 0.41 to 11.84 &#x000b1; 1.34 vs. 0.94 &#x000b1; 0.34 to 9.05 &#x000b1; 2.56 mmol/l) and glucose concentration (81.59 &#x000b1; 10.27 to 114.99 &#x000b1; 12.52 vs. 69.47 &#x000b1; 6.97 to 89.95 &#x000b1; 19.26 mg/dL), WOD 1 induced a significantly greater increase than WOD 2 (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05). The training sessions elicited significant changes (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) in IL-6, IL-10 and osteoprotegerin concentration over time. IL-6 displayed an increase immediately after training WOD 1 [197 &#x000b1; 109%] (<italic>p</italic> = 0.009) and 2 [99 &#x000b1; 58%] (<italic>p</italic> = 0.045). IL-10 displayed an increase immediately after only WOD 1 [44 &#x000b1; 52%] (<italic>p</italic> = 0.046), and decreased 24 and 48 h following WOD 2 (~40%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.018) as compared to pre-exercise values. Osteoprotegerin displayed a decrease 48 h following WOD 2 (~25%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.018) as compared with pre intervention. In conclusion, two consecutive Crossfit&#x000ae; training sessions increase pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines with no interference on muscle performance in the recovery period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>inflammatory response</kwd><kwd>weight training</kwd><kwd>extreme condition</kwd><kwd>muscle power</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="21"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5534"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>CrossFit&#x000ae; is a growing exercise regimen characterized by high intensity, constantly varied, functional movement (Tibana et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Typical CrossFit&#x000ae; workouts include Olympic lifting (snatch, clean, and jerk), power lifting (squat, deadlift, press/push press, bench press), and gymnastic movements (pull-ups, toes-to-bar, knees-to-elbows, lunges, muscle-ups, burpees, dips, push-ups, rope climbs; Tibana et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). These exercises are often combined into high-intensity workouts that are performed in rapid, successive repetition, with limited or no recovery time.</p><p>However, high-intensity training modalities have also been the subject of scrutiny, with concerns of elevated risk of nonfunctional overreaching. Recently, investigators have demonstrated that a CrossFit bout elicited an acute blood oxidative stress response comparable to a traditional bout of high-intensity treadmill running in males with 3 or more months of CrossFit experience (Kliszczewicz et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Similarly, Szivak et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Heavens et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed in &#x0201c;sister articles&#x0201d; that a high-intensity short rest protocol (which consisted of a descending pyramid scheme of back squat, bench press, and deadlift, beginning with 10 repetitions of each, then 9, then 8, and so on until 1 repetition on the final set) elicits significant increases in indirect blood markers of muscle damage [myoglobin, inteleukin-6 (IL-6) and creatine kinase] and resulted in exacerbated metabolic (lactate) and adrenal function (cortisol) activation in men and women with experience in resistance training. This prolonged response can lead to compounding physiological stress over consecutive exercise sessions, and can contribute to a nonfunctional overreaching.</p><p>Moreover, it has been shown that repeated intense interval exercise (three consecutive days of an intermittent run protocol to exhaustion) elicited significant CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ lymphocyte cell death and migration after the third day of running. Considering this immune response, it would be recommended to incorporate a rest day following two consecutive days of high-intensity intermittent running to minimize immune cell modulations and reduce potential susceptibility to infections (Navalta et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Nonetheless, Tuan et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) submitted trained runners to treadmill exercise at 85%VO<sub>2</sub>max for 30 min daily over 3 consecutive days and found that high-intensity exercise induced a significant dysfunction of the mitochondrial energy status in peripheral blood immune cells, which was accompanied by an increased propensity for apoptosis and an increase in tumor necrosis factor-alpha.</p><p>These alarming physiological responses, training complexity and huge number of individuals taking part in exercise activities such as Crossfit&#x000ae;, increase the need for studies to evaluate the effect of this mode of activity on the immune and metabolic system. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to analyze the effects of two consecutive sessions of CrossFit based training (CFBT) on IL-6, IL-10, osteoprotegerin, muscle power, blood lactate and glucose in trained men. The initial hypothesis is that two consecutive CFBT sessions exacerbate cytokine responses accompanied by muscle power impairment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experimental approach to the problem</title><p>This study was designed to compare the effects of two different CFBT sessions on cytokines, metabolic and neuromuscular responses in trained, adult men. In this study, the workouts of the day (1 vs. 2) were independent variables, while the dependent variables consisted of the changes in IL-6, IL-10, IL-10/IL-6 ratio, OPG, lactate, blood glucose, and mean power (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The responses of cytokines, lactate, blood glucose, and mean power was assessed before and immediately post following workouts of the day and following 24 h (cytokines and mean power) and 48 h (cytokines) after workout of the day 2. The CFBT sessions 1 (predominantly Olympic lifting) and 2 (body weight exercises) consisted of performing strength and gymnastic exercises paired with endurance intensive efforts (Chamari and Padulo, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). This design allowed us to individually assess the influence of different CFBT sessions on immune response in our cohort of adult men.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Experimental design</bold>.

Samples were then centrifuged at room temperature at 2500 rev. min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 15 min. All subjects were encouraged to avoid smoking, alcohol and caffeine consumption to avoid influence on these parameters. The serum was removed and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for further analysis. Serum was analyzed for amyloid A using a DADE Dimension RXL clinical chemistry analyzer (Dade-Behring, Inc, Newark, DE, USA). The analyzer was calibrated daily using Liquid-Assayed Multiqual (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and two levels of quality control with known concentrations. In addition, serum IL-10 and IL-6 were assessed using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (BioLegend's ELISA Max Deluxe, San Diego, CA, USA) and osteoprotegerin (R&#x00026;D System Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA). Standard curves were generated using commercially available microplate reader-compatible statistical software (MicroWin 2000, Microtek Laborsysteme GmbH, Overath, Germany). All samples were determined in duplicate to guarantee the precision of the results. For all measures the mean intra-assay coefficient of variation was 2.9&#x02013;9.5%, the inter-assay coefficient of variation was 5.9&#x02013;7.0%, and the sensitivity was 0.0093 pg/mL.</p><p>Standard procedures were followed for blood lactate and glucose collection, management and analysis (Goodwin et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).

The results reported in the present study are in agreement with other investigations that observed significant metabolic and inflammatory stress following CFBT. For example, Szivak et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Heavens et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) showed in companion articles that a high-intensity with short rest protocol (which consisted of a descending pyramid scheme of back squat, bench press, and deadlift, beginning with 10 repetitions of each, then 9, then 8, and so on until 1 repetition on the final set) elicits a significant increase in muscle damage (myoglobin and creatine kinase), inflammation (IL-6 immediately post of exercise for men: ~3 pg/mL; women: ~3.5 pg/mL) and produced hyperreactions in metabolic (lactate immediately post exercise for men: ~14 Mmol.L-1; women: ~9.1 mmol.L-1) and adrenal function (cortisol) in men and women with experience in resistance training, but not in Crossfit.</p><p>Furthermore, Kliszczewicz et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) found that the CrossFit bout (&#x0201c;Cindy&#x0201d; protocol consisting of as many rounds possible of 5 pullups, 10 push-ups, and 15 air-squats in 20 min) elicited an acute increased on blood oxidative stress (lipid peroxides 1 h post-exercise: CrossFit = ~+143% vs. Treadmill = ~+115%), a decrease on total enzymatic antioxidant capacity immediately post exercise (CrossFit = ~&#x02212;10% vs. Treadmill = ~&#x02212;12%), produced high cardiovascular demands at 20 min (CrossFit = ~97% of maximum heart rate vs. Treadmill = ~93% of maximum heart rate) and resulted in a greater rating of perceived exertion (CrossFit = ~9 vs. Treadmill = ~7) response comparable to a traditional bout of high-intensity treadmill running (run at a minimum intensity of the 90% maximal HR) in males with a minimum of 3 months CrossFit training experience.</p><p>Similarly, in the present study both CFBT sessions elicited significant increases in IL-6 (~6 pg/mL) and lactate (1.20 &#x000b1; 0.41 to 11.84 &#x000b1; 1.34 and 0.94 &#x000b1; 0.34 to 9.05 &#x000b1; 2.56 mmol/l) response comparable with the results of Heavens et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) (IL-6 immediately post of exercise for men: ~3 pg/mL) and Szivak et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) (lactate immediately post of exercise for men: ~14 mmol/l). However, different from the present study, Szivak et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and Heavens et al. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) used subjects with no experience with Crossfit and the protocol was limited to a single training session, which does not accurately reflect the general daily practice of Crossfit training. In response to exercise, circulating levels of IL-6 increase up to 100-fold, when long duration and high intensity exercise is performed (Ostrowski et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Suzuki et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Reihmane et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Initially, IL-6 was considered as an immunomodulatory cytokine produced predominantly by leukocytes as an inflammatory response to exercise-induced muscle damage (Bruunsgaard et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). When it was shown that IL-6 release can be affected by the bioavailability of carbohydrates (Nieman et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), it was suggested that IL-6 could improve skeletal muscle energy supply (Petersen and Pedersen, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Moreover, exercise provokes an increase primarily in IL-6, followed by an increase in IL-1ra and IL-10 (Petersen and Pedersen, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>).</p><p>Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine normally released locally from immune cells to help resolve inflammation, and is best characterized for its ability to inhibit macrophage activation (Moore et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). IL-10 also prevents cytokine synthesis by posttranscriptional mechanisms, as shown in human macrophages where the inhibition of IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and TNF-&#x003b1; release induced by LPS is a direct consequence of mRNA degradation of their corresponding genes (Petersen and Pedersen, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In this sense, in the present study the response of IL-10 concentration presented a statistically significant increase immediately after only training session 1 (44 &#x000b1; 52%). But 24 h after training session 1, post training session 2, 24 and 48 h after training 2, IL-10 concentrations were not statistically significant different (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) from pre intervention. Interestingly, we evaluated the balance between Th2 and Th1 response with IL-10/IL-6 ratio, and this parameter showed a decrease of ~50%, 24 and 48 h after the session 2 when compared to baseline demonstrating a disruption in the balance of pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines following CFBT.</p><p>With regard to OPG, it is a cytokine member of the TNF receptor superfamily that binds to two ligands, the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), a key cytokine for the differentiation of osteoclasts, and a ligand related to the induction of apoptosis (TRAIL), involved in immune surveillance. Although clinical results confirm that OPG is an active cytokine in a wide range of diseases (osteoporosis, arthritis, vascular calcification, bone cancer related disease; Sasso et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), there are still conflicting results regarding OPG and exercise. For example, Pereira et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) showed that an acute resistance training session (3 sets of 10 repetitions in whole body exercises with 60% of 1RM) induced no additional increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines nor a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines and OPG (measured before, immediately post and 60 min after exercise) in women with or without Metabolic Syndrome. On the other hand, Mezil et al. (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) found that high intensity exercise (12 min on a cycle ergometer) of six 1-min intervals separated by 1-min rest intervals stimulates a rapid increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1a: 40,3%; IL-1b: 41,3%; IL-6: 70%; and TNF-a: 76%) followed by a decline 24 h later, resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels below baseline value. No significant exercise-induced changes in IL-10 were observed. Nevertheless, at 5 min post-exercise, OPG increased from baseline (13.5%), at 1 and 24 h post-exercise the values decreased. Furthermore, they observed a positive correlation between the percent decline in OPG and IL-10 at 24 h post-exercise in comparison to their values at 5 min and 1 h.</p><p>However, the main difficulties in comparing our results with previously published studies are that most studies were limited regarding the time-course analyses (1&#x02013;24 h post exercise) of OPG and different exercise (resistance training vs. high intensity interval training) protocols were used. Nevertheless, individuals involved with CFBT or any high intensity functional movement program should be aware of these exacerbated cytokine responses to avoid functional overreaching, regardless of muscle power recovery.</p><p>Some limitations of the present study should be highlighted, such as the reduced number of individuals, lack of diet control and the absence of female participants and upper limb power measures. Finally, conducting a session with only 24 h of recovery may have been influenced the response of cytokines on subsequent WOD. Therefore, further studies comparing different intensities and WOD with adequate recovery days are needed to elucidate these answers. Nonetheless, future studies including muscle biopsies could improve understanding of the muscle environment and not only select systems such as the immune or metabolic systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, 2 consecutive days of Crossfit training elicited a significant decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines without impairments in muscle power. Further training and longitudinal investigations are necessary to determine the consequences of this finding. While we observed no negative effect on muscular power, it is still recommended that caution be exercised due to the suppressive effect 2 consecutive days of CFBT had on the immune system. While future research is needed to determine the significance of this result, it is recommended that the incorporation of lower intensity sessions and/or resting days would help to minimize immune disturbances. This could be a particularly useful training strategy for individuals who are in an immunocompromised status (such as a chronic stress state, or returning from an acute bout of illness), or during specific parts of the year in which viruses tend to weaken the immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: RT, DN, and JP.
