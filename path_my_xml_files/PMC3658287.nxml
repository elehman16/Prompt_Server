The objective was to evaluate the reduction in 24-h proteinuria in T2DM patients with nephropathy by weight loss, with conventional therapy (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) as the control arm. A prospective, randomized controlled trial was conducted between June 2010 and May 2011. T2DM patients with confirmed nephropathy by 24-h urinary protein estimation with a body mass index (BMI) of &#x0003e;25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were studied. Patients who had nondiabetic nephropathy, uncontrolled hypertension (&#x0003e;125/75 mmHg) irrespective of antihypertensive drugs, excess weight due to edema or obesity due to other specific diseases, alcoholics, smokers, and patients who were on hemodialysis were excluded from the study. The patients were divided into three groups, namely, group A, patients on ACE inhibitor therapy; group B, patients on lifestyle modifications for weight loss; and group C, patients on an antiobesity drug (orlistat) and lifestyle modifications. At the end of 6 months, all the three groups were compared. Data were analyzed using software SPSS version 15.0. This study encompassed a total of 88 patients; 12 patients were dropped during the study period and 76 (group A: 22, group B: 23, and group C: 31) patients remained. The mean age of the patients was 58.36 &#x000b1; 10.87 years (range: 30-70 years). At baseline, age, gender, mean BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and 24-h proteinuria did not vary significantly among the three groups. At 6 months, the mean BMI significantly decreased in group C (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) compared to that in the other two groups. Among the parameters BMI and WHR, the proportional form of BMI correlated well with the degree of reduction in proteinuria (r = 0.397, <italic>P</italic> = 0.01). Reduction in weight using lifestyle modifications and antiobesity drugs might improve renal function and proteinuria safely as observed in obese patients with diabetic nephropathy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>diabetic nephropathy</kwd><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>proteinuria</kwd><kwd>weight loss</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetic nephropathy remains a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), microalbuminuria is associated with a two-to four-fold increase in the risk of death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In patients with overt proteinuria and hypertension, the risk is even higher.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It is estimated that 25-40% of the patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 5-40% of patients with T2DM develop diabetic kidney disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Interventions effective in slowing the progression from microalbuminuria to macroalbuminuria include (1) normalization of glycemia, (2) strict control of blood pressure, and (3) administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Newer approaches include protein restriction to 0.75 g/kg per day, and the use of lipid-lowering agents as renoprotective drugs, protein kinase C inhibitors, and sulodexide, an agent postulated to restore the glomerular charge by repleting the loss of glycosaminoglycans, thus acting as an antiproteinuric and ultimately a renoprotective drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] In dietary treatment of diabetic nephropathy, several studies reported that a high-calorie, low-protein diet was beneficial for renal function and proteinuria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, obesity has emerged as a significant risk factor for renal dysfunction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] It is observed that a reduction in weight in obese people leads to an improvement in parameters of renal dysfunction, with overall reduction in the level of proteinuria unrelated to medications for reducing proteinuria provided to patients with diabetic nephropathy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] A definitive classified protocol is yet to be developed to address this unique observation where nonpharmacologically or by the use of weight-reducing medication, the hallmark of diabetic nephropathy, that is, proteinuria, can be reduced. Considering this, we planned this study to demonstrate the improvement in proteinuric status in nephropathy by reducing the weight of the patient in a stipulated time frame.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We conducted a prospective, randomized controlled trial with the approval of the institutional Ethical Committee. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants. Consecutive T2DM patients, attending the outdoor clinic at our institute, with nephropathy confirmed by 24-h urinary protein estimation and patients having both micro- and macro-albuminuria with a body mass index (BMI) of &#x0003e;25kg/m<sup>2</sup> were included in the study. Patients who had nondiabetic nephropathy, uncontrolled hypertension (&#x0003e;125/75 mmHg) irrespective of antihypertensive drugs, excess weight due to edema or obesity due to other specific diseases, alcoholics, smokers, and patients who were on hemodialysis were excluded from the study.</p><p>The patients were divided into three groups; namely, group A, who were kept on ACE inhibitor therapy; group B, who were provided with specific guidelines for lifestyle modifications to be followed strictly for weight loss; and group C, who were put on an antiobesity drug (orlistat) and also provided the above-mentioned guidelines for weight loss.</p><p>A thorough clinical examination was carried out in all the patients with special attention given to edema over the feet, any evidence of endocrine dysfunction, and recording of blood pressure. The patients were in normotensive state (with or without antihypertensive treatment) but were not on antihypertensives which reduce proteinuria. The three groups were matched according to age, gender, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), blood urea, serum creatinine, and 24-h urinary protein. Obesity parameters such as weight, height, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and WHR were calculated in all the patients, and routine blood tests for diabetes and 24-h estimation of urinary protein were performed in all patients at enrolment. Obesity parameters and routine tests for diabetes, blood urea, serum creatinine, and 24-h estimation of urinary protein were repeated at 6-month follow-up.</p><p>Lifestyle modifications involved attention to three essential elements of lifestyle: dietary habits, physical activity, and modification of behavior.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The primary focus on diet therapy was to reduce overall consumption of calories.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The target was to decrease the caloric intake of about 500-1000 kcal/day in the routine dietary intake of the patient.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] This calorie deficit was compensated by suggesting substitutions or alternatives to the diet; examples included choosing smaller meal portions, eating more fruits and vegetables, consuming more whole-grain cereals, selecting leaner cuts of meat, skimmed dairy products, reducing fried foods, avoiding other added fats and oils, and drinking water instead of caloric beverages.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>The combination of dietary modification and exercise is the most effective behavioral approach for the treatment of obesity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] A 30-min moderate-intensity physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the week was advised to all the patients. Focusing on simple ways to add physical activity into the normal daily routine through leisure activities, travel, and domestic work was suggested; examples included walking, using the stairs, doing home and yard work, and engaging in sport activities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] These tips were given by a registered dietician of the hospital. Behavioral therapy was monitored by frequent enquiries with their caregivers on the telephone and checking the data sheet given to the patients about duration and type of exercise done and food habits.</p><p>Among the medications used in this study, the antiobesity drug orlistat was used in the group C patients along with lifestyle modifications. Orlistat is a synthetic hydrogenated derivative of a naturally occurring lipase inhibitor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The patients were advised to take 120 mg of orlistat with every major meal like breakfast, lunch and dinner for a period of 6 months. They were sufficiently informed about the dose, dosage, side effects, and complications of the drug.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] All the groups were followed for a period of 6 months. Obesity parameters, routine tests for diabetes, and 24-h estimation of urinary protein were carried out at 6 months. The patients in group A were provided with ACE inhibitor therapy (ramipril 5-10mg/day), which is a well-known drug to reduce proteinuria as observed in many studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>At the end of 6 months, all the groups were compared and statistical analysis was carried out.

Group A patients were on ACE inhibitors without much emphasis on advised guidelines for lifestyle modifications, and ACE inhibitors were given with an eye on overall improvement in nephropathy. Our study findings were similar to that of the study conducted by Chagnac <italic>et al</italic>., who showed that after weight loss, BMI decreased by 32 &#x000b1; 4% to 32.1 &#x000b1; 1.5%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Another study by Saiki <italic>et al</italic>. showed that mean body weight decreased by 6.273 kg.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Praga <italic>et al</italic>. showed in their study that weight loss was moderate (averaging 4.1 &#x000b1; 3% at the end of the 5-month study), but the effect on the level of proteinuria was striking; a 31 &#x000b1; 37% reduction in baseline values was found.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Navaneethan <italic>et al</italic>. in their study showed that weight loss was achieved with various nonsurgical interventions (diet, exercise, and/or antiobesity agents).
