With less than 50% of Canadian adults reaching the recommended amount of daily physical activity, there is an urgent need for effective programs targeting this risk factor. Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; is a healthy lifestyle prescription program, developed from an extensive research base to address risk factors for chronic disease such as physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour and poor eating habits. Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; participants are provided with in-person lifestyle coaching and access to <italic>e</italic>Health technologies delivered in community-based primary care clinics and health care organizations.</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p>To determine the effectiveness of Health<italic>e</italic>steps&#x02122;, we will conduct a 6-month pragmatic randomized controlled trial with integrated process and economic evaluations of Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; in 5 clinic settings in Southwestern Ontario. 110 participants will be individually randomized (1:1; stratified by site) to either the intervention (Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program) or comparator (Wait-list control). There are 3 phases of the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program, lasting 6&#x000a0;months each. The <italic>active phase</italic> consists of bi-monthly in-person coaching with access to a full suite of <italic>e</italic>Health technology supports.

The high level of physical inactivity combined with a poor diet amongst adults has led to higher rates of chronic disease, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, osteoporosis, depression, and premature death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the cost of physical inactivity in Canada is estimated at $6.8 billion per year, representing approximately 3.7% of all direct and indirect government spending [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Fortunately, modest increases in levels of PA can reduce this spending by $2.6 billion over the next 25&#x000a0;years, making low-cost and effective healthy lifestyle interventions that target physical activity an important public health and economic priority in Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Living a physically active lifestyle provides numerous health benefits, including protection from chronic diseases and improved quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In fact, being physically active is associated with a greater than 50% reduction in risk for premature death, and even small improvements in physical fitness can significantly reduce one&#x02019;s risk for chronic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Research shows that many chronic diseases can be prevented by decreasing four main behavioural risk factors: physical inactivity, poor nutrition, smoking and alcohol consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Public health organizations have worked to develop many resources to address these risk factors; however, previous research has noted that those who are the most physically inactive are not aware of these resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] or may be unsure of how to use this information to make a change. While research interventions promoting PA and healthy eating in controlled settings have shown unequivocal results in reducing chronic disease risk under certain conditions, effective methods for implementing this evidence into everyday primary care practice requires further exploration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is particularly true for rural and remote regions in Canada where increased rurality leads to an increased risk for chronic disease and also limited access to cost-effective, evidence-based, chronic disease prevention programs and tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program was developed in response to the literature demonstrating the effectiveness of primary care-based chronic disease prevention programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], consultations with stakeholders and experts across Canada (including targeted discussions with knowledge users), and the need for such programs especially in rural and remote areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program was developed from an extensive research base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; draws on evidence from diverse areas including PA, nutrition, behaviour change, and knowledge translation; and has been refined by our experience implementing the program in diverse community settings including Family Health Teams, Community Health Centres, health clubs, and&#x000a0;workplaces.</p><p>The Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program provides individuals with a specific plan of action to improve their PA levels, healthy eating habits, and reduce their sedentary behaviour. This is achieved through personalized coaching, grounded in the principles of Motivational Interviewing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and Co-Active coaching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and supported by innovative health services technologies, hands-on training, and widely available health promotion resources and tools. A distinct advantage of Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; is the pragmatic nature of the program and ability to work within the existing workflow of an organization. While certain elements of the program must be conducted exactly as designed to follow the evidence-based protocols, other aspects are flexible. For example, the program may be conducted in-person in small groups or one-on-one; it can be run in a variety of primary care based settings; and it can be integrated with other existing programs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study aims</title><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>A 6-month, two-arm, pilot, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with integrated process and economic evaluations will be conducted within five clinic/health care organization settings in both urban and rural communities in Southwestern Ontario. Participants will be individually randomized (1:1, stratified by site [three sites in London, one site in Forest, and one site in Tillsonburg, Ontario Canada]) to either the intervention (Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122;) or the comparator (Wait-list control).

</p><p>Study recruitment will begin in May 2015 at the 5 clinic sites, with the intervention starting in June 2015. Western University Health Sciences Research Ethics Board approved this study and all participants will provide written informed consent. The pragmatic RCT portion of this study was registered on April 6, 2015 with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT02413385).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment of study sites &#x00026; coach training</title><p>This trial was designed to recruit primary care sites and/or health service organizations as they provide greater opportunities to recruit participants at risk or diagnosed with a chronic disease. We will solicit interest from primary care community sites for participation in the trial by contacting primary care leads in target communities where they had not been previously exposed to the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program. Sites will be recruited opportunistically through connections with the research team. A variety of staff from each site will be recruited for training to be coaches in the program. Meetings with sites will occur with the central research team to ensure the coaches are trained in the program protocol and understand the commitment required (space, coaching staff, and timelines). Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; coaches will be trained by the central research team or via <italic>e</italic>Learning modules available through the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In order to keep the trial highly pragmatic, coaching sessions and measurement sessions will occur at the sites.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Sample size</title><p>We set a recruitment target of 110 participants. Baker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] conducted a 12-week RCT of a pedometer-based walking program plus PA consultation in 80 community-dwelling Scottish adults [mean (SD) age: 49.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.8&#x000a0;years; 79% women] who were not meeting current PA recommendations (20% withdrawal rate by 12&#x000a0;weeks). After 12&#x000a0;weeks, this study reported a difference between intervention and control groups in mean change of 3021 steps per day &#x02013; favouring the intervention group. Using a pooled standard deviation of 3498 steps per day results a Cohen&#x02019;s d effect size of 0.86. In order to be conservative, we reduced the effect size to 0.65, a moderate to large effect size. Thus, with 38 participants per group, our study would have 80% power at a 0.05 two-sided significance level to detect an effect size of 0.65 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We estimate a dropout rate of 30% over the 6-month period, which will&#x000a0;increase our target to 110 participants (55 participants per group). Since we have 5 sites who expressed interest in taking part in this study, we propose that each site will need to enroll 22 participants (i.e., 11 participants per group per site).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Participant recruitment &#x00026; enrollment</title><p>Participants will be recruited at the sites through poster advertisements, word of mouth, health care provider referrals, staff e-mails, and in-person recruitment booths. Those interested in participating will be contacted by the central research team and asked to attend an in-person screening session. At this session they will be screened for eligibility and if deemed eligible will take part in baseline measurements. Randomization will occur after baseline assessments. All individuals who contact a study site will be asked to report where they heard about the program. Participants who are ineligible and those who choose not to enroll in the study after initial contact will be tracked, along with reasons for ineligibility/not enrolling. Acceptability of randomization will be estimated from the percentage of participants who adhered to their allocation assignment (i.e., attend program sessions if allocated to the intervention group) and/or attend measurement sessions. Participation in the follow-up measurement sessions will be used to assess retention throughout the trial. Attendance at program sessions will be obtained from coach&#x02019;s logs and will be used to assess adherence to the program.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Individuals 18&#x02013;85 years of age; one or more self-reported or measured risk factors for chronic disease including: body-mass index (BMI) greater than 25&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; less than 150&#x000a0;min of exercise per week; 3 or more hours sitting per day; consuming less than 8 fruit and vegetable servings per day; diagnosis of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes; and clearance to participate in PA via the Physical Activity Readiness-Questionnaire (PAR-Q) or a health care provider.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Individuals who are unable to comprehend the letter of information and consent documentation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization and allocation</title><p>Following the baseline measurement, participants at each site will be individually allocated to either the intervention (Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program) or comparator (Wait-list control).

The outcome of adverse events will be followed until the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention group: Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; Program</title><p>There are three phases to the intervention: an <italic>active phase</italic> that encompasses the first six months, a <italic>maintenance phase I</italic> for the next six months, and finally a <italic>maintenance phase II,</italic> which is the last six months of the trial.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Active phase (months 0&#x02013;6)</title><p>Participants assigned to the intervention group will start the Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; program within three weeks of completing their baseline measurement session. Participants will receive a handbook that contains documents to help them track their progress throughout the program and will be given a pedometer to use to track their PA. The research team chose to utilize pedometers to measure step counts as they are inexpensive, easy to use, and easily interpreted by the participant and research team [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In total, participants will receive four bi-monthly in-person coaching sessions (occurring at months 0, 2, 4, and 6) with a Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; coach who will be trained on how to create an action plan with the participant to help them work towards achieving their lifestyle prescriptions. Strategies for setting lifestyle prescriptions are based on S.M.A.R.T. goal setting principles (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and timely for the participant), as goal setting has been found to produce positive behaviour change in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The lifestyle prescriptions and supports are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>
<italic>Exercise Prescription:</italic> The exercise prescription focuses on making incremental changes in the amount of time the participant engages in moderate to vigorous activity or the amount of time they exercise within their target heart rate zone, up to the recommended 150&#x000a0;min/week. At each program session, participants will complete a sub-maximal fitness test, the Step Test and Exercise Prescription tool (STEP&#x02122; Test) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Based on their fitness score from this test (i.e., predicted maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max), participants will receive an exercise prescription with a personalized target heart rate (65&#x02013;85% of estimated maximum heart rate) for exercise. Coaches will then encourage participants to exercise at their training heart rate and/or at a rating of 5&#x02013;8 on the 10-point modified Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale during aerobic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The Health<italic>e</italic>Steps&#x02122; coach will collaborate with the participant to set a weekly target of exercise minutes that includes frequency, duration, and type of exercise to facilitate achievement of their exercise prescription.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Physical Activity Prescription:</italic> The PA prescription focuses on making incremental changes to the participants&#x02019; daily step count to reach the recommended 10,000 steps per day. This requires setting a baseline step count, which for coaching session 1 will be the participants&#x02019; step count recorded during the baseline measurement session. For sessions 2&#x000a0;to&#x000a0;4, the prescription will be based on steps logged in the participants&#x02019; handbook completed between sessions. If the participant did not track their step counts between coaching sessions, the coach and participant will work together to develop a reasonable target step count to set a new PA prescription.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<italic>Healthy Eating Prescription:</italic> Using Eating Well with Canada&#x02019;s Food Guide, participants will work with their coach to determine their current daily intake from each food group, their water intake, and consumption of a healthy balanced breakfast. The healthy eating goal is set through increasing or decreasing a serving in one of the food groups to better meet the recommendations (i.e., increasing one serving of vegetables and fruit or decreasing a serving of meats and alternatives), increasing water intake and increasing the number of days the participant consumes a healthy balanced breakfast.</p></list-item><list-item><p>

This study also aims to determine the acceptability of the program to inform future optimization. Lastly, this study aims to determine the direct cost per participant involved in the program, and the cost to the community or site running the program. If the results are promising, our next step will be to further scale-up the program into rural and remote communities focusing on delivery in primary care, workplace wellness, and community-based facilities.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body Mass Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p>Blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DINE</term><def><p>Dietary Instrument for Nutrition Education</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L</term><def><p>European Quality of Life &#x02013; 5 Dimensions &#x02013; 3 Level</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MET</term><def><p>Metabolic Equivalent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PAR-Q</term><def><p>Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>pRCT</term><def><p>Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STC</term><def><p>Starting the Conversation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STEP</term><def><p>Step Test and Exercise Prescription</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual analog scale.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank those involved in coaching and measurement sessions: Beth Munro, Rebecca Brown, Abby Malott, Ashley Aker, Andy Alway, Leah Willemse Julie Potts, Kandis Tieman, Rebecca Everaert, Narlon Cassio Boa Sorte Silva, Elizabeth Fryer, Thomas Petrella, John Petrella, Brendan Riggin, Erin Shellington, Michael Gregory, Claire Riley, Emma McCrady, Sam Titheridge, Stephanie Muise, Katie Mairs, Amanda Deosaran, John Bocti, and Andrea Petrella.
