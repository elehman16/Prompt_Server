Shorter and thinner atraumatic electrodes have been designed to preserve the residual hearing in the implanted ear. However, the insertion of the electrode array into the cochlea, with potential mechanical trauma and the presence of this foreign body inside the cochlea, may lead to free radical formation and reduced blood perfusion of the cochlea which can result in the loss of residual hearing.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>In this single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind phase II clinical trial the effect of free radical scavengers and a vasodilator on the residual hearing of 140 CI patients will be evaluated. The formulation is composed of &#x003b2;-carotene (vitamin A), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), dl-&#x003b1;-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) and the vasodilator magnesium (Mg), or ACEMg. Medication is administered twice daily per os for approximately 3&#x000a0;months. The primary measure is based upon the reduction in postoperative low-frequency air-conducted pure-tone thresholds compared to preoperative thresholds in ACEMg-treated patients compared to those of a placebo group. Additionally, the effect of different electrode lengths (20, 24 and 28&#x000a0;mm) is analyzed. Study visits are scheduled 2&#x000a0;days before surgery, at first fitting, which is the adjustment and start of stimulation via CI 4&#x000a0;weeks after surgery and 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months after first fitting. The primary endpoint is the air-conduction hearing loss at 500&#x000a0;Hz 3&#x000a0;months after first fitting. Additionally, speech recognition tests, hearing aid benefit in the implanted ear and electrophysiological measurements of implant function are assessed.</p><p>Since this is a blinded clinical trial and recruitment is still ongoing, data continue to accrue and we cannot yet analyze the outcome of the ACEMg treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>There is an unfulfilled need for new strategies to preserve acoustic hearing in CI patients. This study will provide first-in-man data on ACEMg-mediated protection of residual hearing in CI patients. Performing all surgeries and patient follow-up at one study site improves consistency in diagnosis and therapy and less variability in surgery, audiological test techniques and fitting. This approach will allow investigation of the influence of ACEMg on residual hearing in CI patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The German Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM) application number 4039192, was registered on 6 December 2013 with protocol amendment version 3.0 from 19 August 2014. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/search?query=2012-005002-22">EudraCT number: 2012-005002-22</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cochlear implant</kwd><kwd>Antioxidants</kwd><kwd>Free radicals</kwd><kwd>Hearing preservation</kwd><kwd>Residual hearing</kwd><kwd>EAS</kwd><kwd>Electric acoustic stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004963</institution-id><institution>Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>304925</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lenarz</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The cochlear implant (CI) is the standard treatment for unilateral and bilateral severe/profound hearing loss, both in adults and children. The CI stimulates the auditory nerve electrically through electrodes placed inside the inner ear, the cochlea. Recently, as speech understanding with the CI has improved, indication criteria have been extended towards patients with more residual hearing. At the same time, thinner and shorter atraumatic electrodes have been designed to preserve the (low-frequency) residual hearing in the implanted ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. If hearing has been preserved, then the electrical stimulation of the implant may be combined with a hearing aid in the same ear (electric acoustic stimulation, EAS).</p><p>The insertion of the electrode array into the cochlea with potential mechanical trauma, and the chronic presence of this foreign body inside the cochlea may induce loss of residual hearing. As Talbot and colleagues stated in 2004, a substantial acoustic hearing loss occurs in 24&#x000a0;% of EAS CI patients, and among them 13&#x000a0;% show a total loss of residual hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. More recent studies prove that the occurring problem is not yet solved since a large number of patients continue to suffer from partial or total loss of residual hearing. In 15&#x000a0;% of patients analyzed by Skarzynski a partial to total hearing loss was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Other studies published a complete loss of residual hearing in 22.7&#x000a0;% of subjects and a partial loss of hearing in 50.1&#x000a0;% of the total patient population (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] or a mean threshold shift &#x0003e;15&#x000a0;dB 24&#x000a0;months after first fitting (FF) in 41.2&#x000a0;% (Cochlear Implant Model Hybrid-L24, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;51) and 71.4&#x000a0;% (Cochlear Implant Model CI422, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Experimental studies on the auditory system have demonstrated that antioxidants plus a vasodilator reduce both noise- and drug- (aminoglycoside)-induced inner ear pathology and hearing loss by over 75&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This formulation is &#x003b2;-carotene (converted in the body to vitamin A), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), dl-&#x003b1;-tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) and the vasodilator magnesium. Together (ACEMg) they are remarkably effective in vivo. Data indicate that free radicals play a key role in sensory and neural cell death and loss of residual hearing with CI implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] which reduces the benefits of implantation. The goal of ACEMg treatment is to eliminate one important contributing factor, the stress of surgery and implantation of a foreign body that may reduce residual acoustic hearing in the implanted patient.</p><p>Our PROHEARING clinical trial (PROtect residual HEARING) is the first human trial to assess the efficacy of ACEMg to prevent permanent hearing loss in CI patients with residual hearing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The PROHEARING trial is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and complies with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP).

CI screening includes a medical examination, pure-tone audiogram and the Freiburg Speech Test at 65&#x000a0;dB best aided to test the speech intelligibility. Air-conducted hearing thresholds at the ear to be implanted have to be less or equal to 85&#x000a0;dB HL at 125, 90&#x000a0;dB HL at 250&#x000a0;Hz and better or equal than 95&#x000a0;dB HL at 500&#x000a0;Hz. The auditory speech understanding must be less or equal to 60&#x000a0;%. Before inclusion in this clinical trial, patients have to answer additional questions about their health and lifestyle. The inclusion of patients in this clinical trial depends on the results of these investigations. Only if the patient fulfills all inclusion and exclusion criteria and agrees to sign the Informed Consent Document is he recruited for the study.

Initial sample size estimation was based on historical data from the MHH Department of Otolaryngology with patients receiving CI electrodes of different lengths. The type-I error was set at 5&#x000a0;% (two-sided) and sample size was calculated for a power of 80&#x000a0;% using a two-group <italic>t</italic> test. A change in hearing thresholds from baseline to 3&#x000a0;months after FF of 15.6&#x000a0;dB with a standard deviation of 15.5&#x000a0;dB at 500&#x000a0;Hz has been observed. For the sample size calculation it has been assumed that the standard deviation is the same in the placebo and in the active treatment group and that the mean change in hearing thresholds is 5&#x000a0;dB smaller with ACEMg therapy compared to placebo. Under these assumptions a required sample size of 150 patients per group was targeted. However, recruitment has been difficult up to now and a total of 300 patients cannot be enrolled in a reasonable time frame. The sample size target was reduced to 70 patients per group in a recent amendment. The power to detect a relevant 5-dB treatment effect decreases to approximately 50&#x000a0;% (which means an increase in the type-II error to 50&#x000a0;%), but a total of 140 patients should be sufficient to decide in this phase II trial whether ACEMg offers a promising treatment concept for protection of residual hearing in CI. The power increases to 80&#x000a0;% if the treatment difference is in the order of 7.5&#x000a0;dB. No interim analysis will be performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analysis is based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population consisting of all randomized patients who took the study medication at least once. The primary null hypothesis of equal hearing loss in ACEMg and placebo will be evaluated with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model including the factor treatment (ACEMg versus placebo), the baseline residual hearing, surgeon, planned length of electrode and formulation of medication (chewing pills versus softgel capsules). The null hypothesis, of no smaller reduction in residual hearing for ACEMg patients, is rejected if the upper bound of the ANCOVA-derived two-sided 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval of the difference in change from baseline (ACEMg minus placebo) is less than 0.</p><p>To evaluate the robustness of the estimated treatment effect, the primary analysis will be repeated based on the per-protocol population. In addition, the primary objective is evaluated with the nonparametric, stratified Gehan test as a sensitivity analysis. Moreover, analysis will be conducted using real length of electrode instead of planned length of electrode as independent factor.</p><p>Secondary analyses will be conducted on the ITT population and on the per-protocol population as sensitivity analyses. Key secondary analyses include the comparison of ACEMg group to placebo in terms of residual hearing for different frequencies and different timepoints after surgery. All analyses will be performed in line with the primary analysis using ANCOVA. Differences in the treatment effects within patient groups with different electrode length are evaluated descriptively.</p><p>Absolute and relative frequencies of (serious) adverse events will be listed for each treatment group separately.

If the patient reaches the upper detection limit of the 500-Hz air-conducted pure-tone audiometry of 110&#x000a0;dB without hearing, the measurement is set to 120&#x000a0;dB as the upper limit of detection&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x000a0;dB. This &#x0201c;upper limit +10&#x0201d; approach is used in all analyses concerning residual hearing (for all frequencies).</p><p>The anticipated drop-out rate is expected to be low in PROHEARING as patients in the initial phase after CI are closely followed for clinical reasons. Frequency and reasons for drop-out will be recorded as far as possible and will be analyzed in both study arms. Missing values in the ITT analysis of pure-tone audiometry are replaced by worst possible value, that means that a missing value at any follow-up visit is replaced by the respective upper limit of quantification&#x02009;+&#x02009;10&#x000a0;dB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Data management</title><p>All study data are collected by study personnel. Data are entered via an eCRF in a clinical trial database. For each patient enrolled an eCRF must be completed after the patient&#x02019;s visit. This also applies to records for those patients who fail to complete the study. Only SAEs will be additionally documented and notified on paper forms.</p><p>Verification of the data in the eCRF occurs by monitoring as well as via range, validity, and consistency checks programmed in the system. In certain cases, queries can be detected by the study software or by an authorized study staff member. Based on the queries, the investigator can review and answer the discrepancies that are found directly in the system. All changes of data entered in the eCRF can be followed by an audit trail.</p><p>A quality control will be performed before the database is closed. This procedure is documented. After the close-out visit at the study center the access of the investigator to the eCRF/database is changed to a &#x0201c;read-only&#x0201d; access (modification of data is no longer possible). After database closure the investigator and the data manager can only read the data, they can not change them; the final data set is transferred to the Institute for Biometry for statistical analysis of the SAS data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Patient information/informed consent and data protection</title><p>The investigator is responsible for obtaining the patient&#x02019;s written informed consent after adequate explanation of the aim, study assessments, potential risks, benefits, and consequences of the study, as well as alternative treatment options. The patient information/informed consent form has to be signed in duplicate by the patient and the investigator. One document will be given to the patient, the other remains in the Trial Investigator File (TIF) at the trial site. No study procedures are allowed to be conducted until the patient&#x02019;s written informed consent has been obtained.</p><p>The patient information/informed consent form has to be revised whenever important new information becomes available that may be relevant to the subject&#x02019;s consent. The patients have to be informed and asked to give their consent to continue study participation by signing the updated form.</p><p>All study staff members have to give due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality. The collection, transfer, storage and analysis of personal study-related data are performed pseudonymized according to national regulations. The declaration of data protection is contained within the patient information/informed consent form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Monitoring and audits/inspections</title><p>To ensure compliance with the protocol, to legal and regulatory requirements applicable for clinical trials and with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) and GCP, monitoring visits are scheduled to take place during the study. At those regular monitoring visits, the monitor reviews the eCRF for completeness and clarity and performs source data verification. Source data are defined as any printed, optical and electronic document containing source data (e.g., hospital records, laboratory notes, drug accountability records). The monitor also reviews notification of SAEs and the TIF.</p><p>Audits (by the sponsor) and inspections (by regulatory authorities) may be performed in order to verify that the clinical study is performed according to the study protocol as well as to other applicable regulatory requirements. The auditor or inspector is independent in regard to personnel involved in the conduct of this clinical trial. This may occur at any time from start to after closure of the study.</p><p>Generally the sponsor quality manager audits the conduct of a clinical trial on a regular basis (determination of frequency is risk-adapted; usually annually). Inspections by regulatory authorities happen infrequently and cannot be foreseen by the investigator or sponsor.</p><p>The establishment of a data monitoring committee (DMC) for this clinical study was not considered necessary by the sponsor as a &#x0201c;non-critical indication where patients are treated for a relatively short time and the drugs under investigation are well characterized and known for not harming patients&#x0201d; (cited from &#x0201c;Guideline on data monitoring committees,&#x0201d; EMA 27 July 2005) is being investigated. In addition, safety endpoints are verified by the monitor during periodic monitoring visits and reported to the sponsor within the written report after each visit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discussion</title><p>The insertion of a CI into the inner ear is to some extent potentially damaging to the inner ear tissue, which can affect the endocochlear potential, create oxidative stress, and initiate proapoptotic pathways associated with direct injury to, and loss of, hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Even though to our knowledge the exact mechanisms involved during CI surgery that results in loss of residual hearing are not completely understood recent findings on caspase activation, JNK activation, oxidative stress with reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] give a first hint of possible targets for drug-based therapies of insertion trauma-related hearing loss.</p><p>There is an increasing role for antioxidants in the protection of residual hearing loss as there is more evidence that links high levels of oxidative stress to programmed cell death of the remaining hair cells. Knowledge of the mechanisms underlying noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and drug-induced hearing loss (DIHL) has led to the hypothesis that cochlear-implantation-related hearing loss is based on the same pathophysiology. Noise and ototoxic drugs induce free radical formation in the inner ear, which up-regulate apoptotic cell-death genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. If free radical build up is sufficient, cell membranes are attacked, resulting in necrotic cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Some exogenous antioxidants were tested in animal models and some degree of benefit has being shown against cisplatin, carboplatin, aminoglycoside, and noise-induced trauma to the inner ear: D-methionine (D-met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]); ascorbic acid (vitamin C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]); <italic>dl</italic>-&#x003b1;-tocopherol (vitamin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]); <italic>N</italic>-acetylcysteine (NAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). Clinical trials examining the benefit of antioxidants on hearing loss of different origins are various and include NAC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00552786), NAC&#x02009;+&#x02009;Mg (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01727492) or ACEMg (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00808470), which has been evaluated for the treatment of NIHL. NAC (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02094625) has been tested for the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss or sodium thiosulfate to prevent carboplatin- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] or cisplatin-induced hearing loss (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01369641; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00716976; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02281006). Prevention of drug-induced ototoxicity is being tested by NAC treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01131468). But, to our knowledge, only one study has addressed hearing loss associated with electrode insertion trauma and cochlear implantation. In this study the researchers were able to demonstrate benefit with NAC treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This benefit only pertained to the high frequencies of the basal turn and did not extend significantly to low-frequency hearing located in the apical section of the cochlea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Unfortunately, delivery of NAC to the round window prior to implantation caused a slight increase in hearing thresholds and greater amounts of osteoneogenesis, which may preclude its use locally in the protection of residual hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, there have been no randomized controlled trials to investigate antioxidant effects on CI electrode-insertion-related hearing loss. The study protocol of this clinical trial allows controlling of all parameters influencing residual hearing after cochlear implantation. Performing all surgeries and patient follow-up at one study side leads to maximum consistency in diagnostics and therapy by there being less variability in surgery and audiological testing techniques and fitting. This approach will allow a better detection of the influence of ACEMg on residual hearing in CI patients.</p><p>The dosage of vitamin C (magnesium ascorbate; 500&#x000a0;mg), magnesium (magnesium citrate, magnesium ascorbate, magnesium stearate; 315&#x000a0;mg), vitamin E (<italic>dl</italic>-&#x003b1;-tocopherol acetate; 267&#x000a0;mg), and &#x003b2;-carotene (18&#x000a0;mg) administered in this placebo-controlled trial was chosen to find the correct balance between a potential therapeutic effect and the suggested tolerable upper intake level: the maximum level of total chronic daily intake of a nutrient (from all sources) judged to be unlikely to pose a risk of adverse health effects to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>If the hypothesis that decreasing free radicals with this formulation of micronutrients will preserve residual hearing in CI patients is correct, then these patients will benefit from better hearing sensation.</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p>The PROHEARING trial is ongoing, with 51 patients recruited as of June 2015.
