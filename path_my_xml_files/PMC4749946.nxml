This trial offered mobile reminder to follow up for definitive tests during opportunistic screening of diabetes mellitus in Puducherry, India (2014). (&#x0201c;Effect of mobile reminders on screening yield during opportunistic screening for type 2 diabetes mellitus in a primary health care setting: a randomized trial&#x0201d; (Kumar et al., 2015) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>) Variables collected included the baseline characteristics of study participants (<italic>n</italic>=390) and information on initial screening and eligibility for definitive test, study group (intervention/control), follow up for definitive test and definitive test results. The data was double entered with adequate checks and validated in EpiData. Final data after correcting the data entry errors has been shared here. In addition, we have shared data entry plan, EpiData triplet files for data entry and program file for data analysis. They may be used by other researchers who intend to replicate this research in their setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Diabetes mellitus, type 2</kwd><kwd>Reminder system</kwd><kwd>Opportunistic screening</kwd><kwd>Loss to follow up</kwd><kwd>Data set</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><title>Specifications Table</title><p><table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><alt-text id="at0005">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td><italic>Medicine</italic></td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td><italic>Community medicine</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td><italic>Text (ASCII) files</italic></td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td><italic>Data pertaining to routine opportunistic screening in the PHC was collected.

Among those who were eligible for definitive tests, the variables collected were group (intervention/control), whether the mobile reminder call was answered (for intervention arm), follow up done (yes/no), fasting and post-prandial blood glucose (for those who followed up). Some variables were derived during data entry: eligibility for definitive tests based on RBG value and diabetes status based on the fasting and post-prandial blood glucose values. Additional variables were derived during data analysis: epidemiologic diagnosis of diabetes and pre-diabetes (if either one of the two definitive tests was within the diabetic or pre-diabetic range).</p><p>We are also sharing the case record form, data entry plan (codebook), empty EpiData files, EpiData files which include the REC file containing data and EpiData program file (computer code) for analysis (EpiData version 3.1 for entry and version 2.2.2.182 for analysis, EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark).

The study was registered with Clinical Trials Registry &#x02013; India (CTRI/2014/10/005138). The data collection was carried out in accordance with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).</p><p>This was a randomized trial conducted in a primary health care setting offering routine opportunistic screening for diabetes mellitus <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. As the patients registered for outpatient department visit, patients satisfying the selection criteria were given the option to be part of the study. After getting written informed consent, patient id was given; and mobile phone number, age and sex recorded. RBG was done using a glucometer and data recorded. Those with RBG &#x02265;6.1&#x000a0;mmol/l (eligible outpatients) were given a slip for definitive tests and asked to return in overnight (8&#x000a0;h) fasting state. After outpatient department visit, eligible outpatients were randomized into intervention and control arm by an independent statistician (central randomization). Investigator made a standard call over mobile phone the same evening to the intervention arm. A note was made of those participants in intervention arm who did not attend the call. Data of FBG and PPBG among those who returned for follow up was noted by the laboratory technician at the laboratory. Patient id was used to link the data of patient at registration and at the laboratory. Data was collected in a case record form.</p><p>A codebook or plan of data entry was prepared using a Microsoft Excel sheet before data entry. With the codebook as the base, EpiData triplet files were created for electronic data entry. A program file was prepared for data analysis and can be run using EpiData analysis software.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Funding statement</title><p>This was an operational research carried out using available resources and manpower at the Primary Health Centre.
