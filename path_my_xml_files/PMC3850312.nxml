and other animals has decreased (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) over the
last 50 years, during which considerable changes
have occurred in the physical, chemical, biological
and socio-cultural environments of humans (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Some recent studies have reported the effects
of exposure to occupational chemicals and physical
hazards on semen quality (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)
has introduced infertility due to occupational
exposure to harmful chemical factors as
a major research subject (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Because of the
wide use of formaldehyde (FA, H<sub>2</sub>CO) in industry,
science and households, the potential for its occupational or environmental exposure is increasing
(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Industries or occupations of significant FA exposure
include medical specialties (coroners,
hospital housekeeping staff, and laboratory
workers), embalmers, industrial (FA synthesis,
molding compound, decorative laminates, plastic
moldings and photographic films), textile and
wood workers (plywood, particle board and furniture)
(<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Inhalation of vapors can produce irritation to the
eyes, nose and upper respiratory system. Whilst
occupational exposure to high FA concentrations
may result in respiratory irritation and asthmatic
reactions, it may also aggravate pre-existing asthma
(<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Skin reactions following exposure to FA
are common because the chemical can be both irritating
and allergenic (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>The harmful effects of FA in the air are welldocumented
for the respiratory system, such as
nasal squamous cell carcinoma and mutagenity
(<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, its effects on other systems and
organs are still being studied. Chowdhury et al.
(<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) have noted the inhibition of steroidogenesis,
disruption of Leydig cells and spermatogenesis
arrest that resulted from intraperitoneal injections
of FA at dosages of 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg in rats.
&#x000d6;zen et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) have shown that exposure to FA
(10 and 20 ppm) caused a severe decrease in Leydig
cells in mouse testes.</p><p>The negative impact of FA exposure and sperm
parameters was investigated in some studies. Tang
et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>) observed the teratogenic and cytotoxic
effects of FA. In their study, administration of high
intraperitoneal doses of FA caused changes in seminiferous
epithelial cells.</p><p>However, reports concerning the effects of FA
on sperm parameters are few and insufficient. In
the present research we have investigated the effect
of FA vapor on sperm parameters and testicular
tissue. We used the high levels of FA vapor
concentrations in the workplace (10 and 20 ppm)
and studied their effects on sperm cells at two experimental
time points. The effects of these vapor
concentrations on mean seminiferous tubular
diameters (STD) and serum testosterone levels
were also investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Formaldehyde (FA) production and treatment

In this experimental study, mice were placed
in a vitreous Plexiglass quadrangular chamber
(30&#x000d7;25&#x000d7;29 cm) that contained two holes for in and
out flows of air. Air circulation in the chamber was
at a fixed flow rate (12 times per hour) maintained
by air pumps. The exposure chamber temperature
was 22 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0;C. FA gas was generated by thermal depolymerization
of Paraformaldehyde (Merck AG,
Darmstadt, Germany) at 70-90&#x000b0;C according to a
method described by Chang et al. (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). FA concentration
in the exposure chamber reached a desirable
range by changing the airflow, using a micro
valve, and control by a rotameter. FA concentration
was measured and monitored four times each
hour by a photo ionization detector (Photocheck
+5000, Ionscience Co., UK). The preciseness of
the measurement was controlled according to the
3500 method recommended by National Institute
of Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) with
a sensitivity of less than 0.1% ppm (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Animals and treatment</title><p>
This experimental study was performed on 36
normal, eight-week old male NMRI mice (25-35
g). The animals were purchased from Iran Pasteur
Institute and maintained in the animal house at
Tarbiat Modares University according to standard
laboratory conditions in terms of temperature (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>-
24&#x000ba;C), light (12 hours light:12 hours dark), ventilation
and free access to food and drinking water.
The experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Tarbiat
Modares University (Tehran, Iran).</p><p>The mice were randomly assigned to three
groups (n=12) based on the study design. The control
group (C) was maintained under experimental
conditions but mice were not exposed to FA.
Experimental group F1 was exposed to FA (10
ppm) eight hours per day (8:00 am- 4:00 pm) for
ten consecutive days. Experimental group F2 was
exposed to FA (20 ppm) eight hours per day (8:00
am- 4:00 pm) for ten consecutive days.</p><p>The population in each group (n=12) was determined
based on the results from previous studies and preliminary experiments (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Other researchers
reported that exposure to inhaled FA at
10 and 20 ppm which led to liver toxicity (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Epididymal sperm preparation and sperm quality
evaluation</title><p>
For epididymal sperm preparation, mice were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation either 24 hours
or 35 days after the end of the exposure period.
The cauda epididymides were dissected and placed
in 1 ml pre-warmed Ham's F-10 (nutrient mixture-
Ham-X1, Gibco, UK) culture medium with 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco, UK). Gentle agitation
along with tearing of the tissue was applied
to enable spermatozoa to swim into the medium in
a Falcon culture dish (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Semen samples were
incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 minutes before analysis
of sperm parameters.</p><p>Sperm count and motility were analyzed with a
Computer-assisted Sperm Analyzer (CASA) as described
by Krause (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The CASA system consisted
of a phase contrast microscope (Eclipse E-200,
Nikon Co., Japan) with a heat plate equipped with
Sperm Class Analyzer&#x000ae; software (SCA, full research
version 5.1, Microptic Co., Barcelona,
Spain). Images were captured by a video camera
(Basler Vision, A312FC at 50 fps, Tecnologie Co.,
Ahrensburg, Germany) at 100x magnification. For
this purpose, 4 &#x000b5;l sperm samples were placed in
a standard count analysis chamber (Leja, Nieuw
Vennep Co., Netherlands). The loaded chamber
was placed on the warm plate of the microscope
(37&#x000b0;C) for 3 minutes before analysis. Then, specimens
were observed with a Nikon microscope
10x/0.25 negative phase contrast field Ph1 BM,
with an intermediate magnification of 0.7 and a
green filter. Several fields of view were captured
and at least 400 spermatozoa counted for each
analysis.</p><p>performed eosin-Y staining by mixing 10 &#x000b5;l of
the sperm sample with 10 &#x000b5;l of dye (0.5% wt/vol,
Merck Chemical Co., Germany) on a microscope
slide which was then covered with a coverslip. A
total of 200 sperm cells were counted within a few
minutes after the addition of the dye (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Evaluation
of live (unstained) and dead (red stained)
spermatozoa was performed with a phase contrast
microscope at x400 magnification.</p><p>For the assessment percentage of the normal
sperm morphology, we used SpermBlue&#x000ae; fixative
and stain. Briefly, once the smear air dried at room
temperature it was fixed for 10 minutes by placing
the slide with the dried smear in a staining tray that
contained SpermBlue&#x000ae; fixative. The fixed smear
was stained for 10 minutes by immersing the slide
in a staining tray that contained SpermBlue&#x000ae; stain
(<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Morphologic assessment was performed at
x1000 magnification with a phase contrast microscope,
and at least 200 spermatozoa were counted
on each slide.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological analysis and morphometric technique</title><p>
For histological examination, testicular tissues
were dissected and samples fixed in Bouin&#x02019;s fixative
for 24 hours, then processed by a graded ethanol
series and embedded in paraffin. The paraffin
sections were cut in 5 &#x000b5;m thick slices and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopic
examination (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>Sections were viewed and photographed by a
microscope (Magnum-3, Ceti, England) with an
attached camera (Sony-DSC-H50). We compared
the integrity of seminiferous tubules and interstitial
cells, including Leydig cells, with the control
group. An estimate of STD was performed by examining
20 fields in 5 histological sections from
each testis (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), using digitalized microscopic
images (x10) with the software Image Tools 3.0
(Obtain from <uri xlink:href="http://compdent.uthscsa.edu/dig/itdesc.html">http://compdent.uthscsa.edu/dig/itdesc.html</uri>).</p></sec><sec><title>Testosterone hormone measurement</title><p>
Serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000&#x000d7;g
for 15 minutes, then collected and stored at -20&#x000b0;C
until analysis. Serum testosterone level was evaluated
following the standard protocol supplied by a
kit (Monobind Inc., USA, Product code: 3775-300)
and read by a fully automated ELISA reader (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS statistical software version 11.5 (SPSS, Inc.,
Chicago, IL). All data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD. Comparisons between control and FA-exposed
groups were performed using one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA), followed by the Scheffe
test. The level of statistic significance was set at
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Formaldehyde concentration</title><p>
The mean FA concentrations in the exposure
chamber were 10.89 &#x000b1; 0.76 ppm for group F1 and
19.79 &#x000b1; 1.56 ppm for group F2. During all exposure
sessions we registered minor, insignificant
fluctuations in the FA vapor concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Testicular weight</title><p>
The mean of testes weights in experimental

groups F1 and F2 were 96.85 &#x000b1; 7.15 and 106.03 &#x000b1;
14.77(mgs), respectively during long-term analysis.
No statistical decrease was observed in all experimental
groups compared to the control group
(p&#x0003c;0.05) in mice sacrificed at 24 hours and 35 days

sperm count, viability, progressive motility and
normal morphology in all exposure groups significantly
reduced in long-term analysis compared
with the control group.</p><p>These results involve novel information that
deals with the adverse effects of FA on sperm progressive
motility in two specified time points, one
day after exposure and 35 days after exposure. Regeneration
of the full cycle of epithelium cells in
seminiferous tubules in mice is 8.6 days, whereas
for spermatogenesis, the period is 35 days. Thus
changes in sperm physiological parameters are observed
better after a period of 35 days (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><p>With respect to the findings of our study, subacute
exposure in the workplaces and high concentrations
of FA vapor exposure can lead to histological
changes to the seminiferous tubules and
Leydig cells. These structural changes are related
to the time of analysis.</p><p>There is a possibility that FA will cross the blood
testis barrier and induce oxidative stress and lipid
peroxidation by increasing reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Thus, in our study degeneration of Leydig
cells and decreased seminiferous tubule diameters
have likely resulted from oxidative damage from
FA vapor. Degeneration of Leydig cells is possibly
in charge of decreased testosterone levels which
affect sperm parameters of sperm progressive motility,
count and normal morphology.</p><p>In this study, the results obtained from analysis
of the effects of FA on testis weight have shown
no statistically significant difference between experimental
groups and control group both in shortterm
and long-term analyses. The non-significant
differences possibly were the result of individual
differences in mice. Some researchers have reported
the decrease in testis weight due to the oral use
of FA (5 mg/kg) in quail (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) and FA inhalation (10
mg/m<sup>3</sup>) during two weeks of exposure in rats (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).
Zahra et al. (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) studied mice that were administered
FA (5 and 10 mg/kg) for 40 days. At the end
of the exposure period, there were no significant
differences observed between the experimental
and control groups, which supported the findings
of the present study in terms of testis weight.</p><p>In the current study, animals sacrificed 24 hours
after FA exposure did not show histopathological
changes in testes tissues, in contrast, disintegration
of seminiferous epithelial cell, increasing the
distances between the seminiferous tubules and
decreasing the mean of STD observed in long-term
analysis (35 days after the end of exposure).</p><p>The increase in inter-tubular specimens appears to
parallel the decrease in STD, however the number
of Leydig or interstitial cells in FA-exposed groups
during in long-term analysis decreased when compared
with the control group. We demonstrated that
the testosterone level improved 35 days after the
end of the exposure; however it was significantly
lower than either the control group or level of testosterone
measured at 24 hours after exposure.</p><p>The increase in inter-tubular specimens appears to

to FA (5-10 ppm) for 91 days caused significant
reductions in tubular diameters. The experimental
study by Golalipour et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) also showed
that exposure to FA vapor for 18 weeks in the rat
induced histological changes in seminiferous tubules
and decreased the mean of STD.</p><p>The result of Zhou et al. (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) stated that exposure to FA vapor (10 mg/m<sup>3</sup> for two weeks) led to
seminiferous tubule atrophy, a decrease in spermatogenesis
cells and disintegration of seminiferous
epithelial cells.</p><p>In the current study, FA vapor exposure at the
concentration and duration mentioned caused histological
changes in the seminiferous epithelium
and decreased the mean STD in mice. The morphometric
findings obtained in the present study,
in a way, were consistent with the findings of
Golalipour et al. (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).</p><p>Kose et al. (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) studied the effect of FA on the rat
reproductive system. In their study, experimental
animals were exposed to FA vapor (10 ppm/1 hour)
for 35 days. They observed the detrimental effects
of FA on sperm count, motility and normal morphology.
These researchers reported a relationship
between reduction of STD and decreased numbers
of Leydig cells in rats. Henkel et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) determined
a direct correlation between sperm motility
and decrease in Leydig cells.</p><p>According to the study by Tang et al. (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), intraperitoneal
injections of FA at doses of 0.2, 2, and 20
(mg/kg) negatively impacted sperm count, viability
and sperm motility in rats. They reported that seminiferous
tubule atrophy and degeneration of seminiferous
tubules lead to reduced sperm counts.</p><p>The findings of long-term sperm analysis in our
study were compatible with the results of the above
studies. Further, the results of the long-term analysis
(35 days after the end of exposure) revealed
a significant difference between experimental
groups F1, F2 and the control group in terms of
progressive motile sperm.</p><p>The present research showed that FA vapor decreased
progressive motile sperm. According to
Mazzilli et al. (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) non-progressive, immotile and
abnormal sperm can produce anion super oxidase,
which is an oxidative factor by itself that can decrease
sperm quality, including sperm motility.</p><p>Decreasing sperm motility depends on various
factors for which the reason is still unknown. Increasing
the production of ROS and attenuation
of testis tissue neurogenesis are two factors that
decrease sperm motility; the latter plays a more
pivotal role in creating dysfunctions to sperm morphology
(<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study showed that FA vapor adversely affects
mice sperm parameters, including decreased
counts, viability, normal morphology, progressive
motility and increased percentages of immotile
sperm. It has been recommended that more attention
should be paid to the relationship between the
FA vapor and gene expression in male fertility.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by financial aid
