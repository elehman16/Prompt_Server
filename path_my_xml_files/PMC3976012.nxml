functional and neurological brain recovery via a rat model with intracerebral hemorrhage.
[Subjects] Thirty rats with intracerebral hemorrhage were divided into 2 groups randomly:
the control group (CON) that did not receive any treatment, and the experimental group
(SRT) that received skilled reach training. [Methods] The experimental group was trained
through skilled reaching training with the affected upper limb in 15-minute sessions
administered 6 days per week for 4 weeks. [Results] In the behavioral test, the results
showed that motor function was significantly improved in the skilled reach training group
compared with the control group. In the neurological teat, the expression level of
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was significantly increased in the skilled reach
training group compared with the control group. [Conclusion] Skilled reach training is
able to facilitate both the expression of neurotrophic factor in the motor cortex and
motor function recovery following intracerebral hemorrhage.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Intracerebral hemorrhage</kwd><kwd>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor</kwd><kwd>Skilled reach training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke, the major cause of motor impairment throughout the world, results in the problems
such as motor, sensory, and cognitive disability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because there are many subtypes of
stroke, it could be classified into two main categories: ischemic and hemorrhagic
stroke<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although research regarding
ischemic stroke has been lively studied, pathophysiological mechanisms of hemorrhagic stroke
such as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) have rarely been disclosed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most patients surviving stroke have many significant impairments including social,
cognitive, and sensorimotor aftereffects, and these are considered factors having great
influence on quality of life<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with left or right hemiparesis resulting from
stroke have difficulties in performing activities of daily living due to paresis of the limb
contralateral to the injured site of the brain<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, motor function of the upper limbs is considered one
of the most important factors because it is closely related to patients&#x02019; quality of life.
For this reason, therapists working in the field of rehabilitation should concentrate on
recovery of function in the more affected upper limb<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Learning new motor skills can affect cortical reorganization in a damaged site of the
brain, thereby causing neural plasticity. New motor skills can be acquired by Task-specific
treatments<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neuronal recovery of function as well as structure can be promoted
by task-specific training such as skilled reach training<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Neurotrophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), play an
important role in generation and differentiation of neuronal progenitor cells and regulation
of neuronal survival<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. BDNF, one of the neurotrophic factors most extensively
distributed throughout the brain, is well known to have effects in relation to the growth,
survival, and proliferation of neurons<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The especially high expression of BDNF usually observed in the hippocampus implies that BDNF
influences learning and memory as well as neurogenesis in the hippocampus<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Less research about ICH has been conducted than about ischemic stroke, although ICH
patients have higher mortality as well as lower functional recovery than patients with
ischemic stroke<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because of the lack of
research, the pathophysiology of ICH has been unclearly revealed<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. For these reasons, the present study was performed to
investigate effects of skilled reach training on brain recovery in rats with ICH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250&#x02005;g and 300&#x02005;g were used and maintained
with a 12 hour on/12 hour off light/dark cycle and ad libitum access to food and water.
The animals were divided into 2 groups randomly: a control group (CON) that did not
receive any treatment and an experimental group (SRT) the received skilled reach training.
Each group consisted of 2 subgroups: a group sacrificed 1 week after surgery for brain
injury (CON1, SRT1) and a group sacrificed 4 weeks after surgery (CON4, SRT4). All
surgical procedures followed Daegu University&#x02019;s guidelines and were approved by the
Institution of Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>All rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with 2&#x02005;mL/kg of a 50% Zoletil and
50% xylazine hydrochloride mixture and placed in a stereotaxic frame for induction of
brain injury. Animals were subjected to a 3.0-mm-diameter craniotomy centered on the left
side, 3.0&#x02005;mm lateral to the sagittal suture and 0.2&#x02005;mm posterior to the bregma, and a
30-gauge Hamilton syringe needle was inserted through the hole into the striatum 6.0&#x02005;mm
ventrally; 1&#x02005;&#x000b5;L containing 0.23 collagen digestion units of collagenase type VII (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) was administered for 5 minutes to induce the intracerebral hemorrhagic
injury. Skilled reach training was conducted in a plexiglass chamber (45&#x02005;cm in height,
15&#x02005;cm in width, 40&#x02005;cm in length) containing a 1&#x02005;cm by 10&#x02005;cm window in the front wall,
which allowed for one of the rat&#x02019;s paw to reach through for a pellet. Animals were
acclimated to the chamber with 4.5&#x02005;mg of sugar-flavored food pellets (Research Diets, New
Brunswick, NJ, USA) placed on a shelf placed in a small indentation 3&#x02005;cm from the inside
wall of the chamber and trained in 15-minute sessions administered 6 days per week for 1
or 4 weeks. To investigate the effect of skilled reach training on brain recovery in rats
with ICH, a skilled ladder rung walking test was performed. The ladder walk device
consisted of a 1-m-long wooden-rung walkway with the distance between rungs varying by
1.5&#x02005;cm. Rats were video recorded as they traversed the walkway 3 times. In a single
testing session, the animals crossed the walkway three times and received a score for the
number of fore and hind limb foot faults per each 10 steps. Only affected limbs were
analyzed, and a foot fault was characterized as a total miss or slip from the rung, or a
misplacement of a paw on the rung. To analyze the difference in BDNF expression between
groups, Western blot analysis was performed. The brains of each group were collected,
washed twice in PBS, and then homogenized and lysed with buffer (137&#x02005;mM NaCl, 8.1&#x02005;mM
Na2HPO4, 2.7&#x02005;mM KCl, 1.5&#x02005;mM KH2PO4, 2.5&#x02005;mM EDTA, 1&#x02005;mM dithiothreitol, 0.1&#x02005;mM PMSF,
10&#x02005;&#x000b5;g/ml leupeptin [pH 7.5]) for 30&#x02005;min on ice. The lysates were centrifuged for 10&#x02005;min at
15,000&#x02005;rpm and 4&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. Equal amounts of protein (40&#x02005;&#x000b5;g) were resolved via 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes. The blots were washed with TBST (10&#x02005;mM Tris &#x000b7; HCl [pH 7.6], 150&#x02005;mM NaCl, 0.05%
Tween 20), blocked with 5% skim milk for 1 hour, and then incubated with the appropriate
primary antibodies at the dilutions recommended by the suppliers. The membranes were
washed, and the primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG. The bands were then visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The results were expressed as the means
&#x000b1; standard error. All experiments were analyzed via independent t-test. Some experiments
were analyzed via comparisons of the treatment mean with the controls using the
Bonferroni-Dunn test. Differences were considered statistically significant when p &#x0003c;
0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results showed that BDNF expression in CON4 (p&#x0003c;0.05) was decreased compared with in

stroke as a result of spontaneous recovery. However, the rate of patients who regain their
motor functions is no more than 20%<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the factors having a close
relation to this recovery is neurotrophic factor, and it can not only enhance
neuroplasticity but also influence neuroprotective function following brain injury<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercise has been well known to provide stroke patients with various
beneficial effects related to neural recovery<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous study showed that
voluntary wheel running promotes neuronal plasticity via BDNF expression and demonstrated
that increased BDNF expression caused by exercise affects the molecular mechanism leading to
changes in neuronal plasticity<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Among the many different types of physical exercises, behaviors including reaching and
grasping via the forepaws are referred to as prehensions. Although there are various forms
of prehensions that may be controlled by similar neural pathways, skilled reaching is
considered the behavioral basis for other forms of reaching. Skilled reaching in rat models
is extensively used for many different conditions such as spinal cord injury, stroke, and
Parkinson&#x02019;s disease because there are close similarities in skilled reaching in rats and
primates<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to investigate the effect of skilled reach training on neurotrophic factor
expression, the present study observed BDNF expression through Western blot analysis. BDNF
expression in SRT4 was significantly increased compared with in CON4. This increased
neurotrophic factor expression corresponded with the results of previous research with
regard to effects of voluntary, involuntary, and forced exercises on recovery following
ischemic stroke<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The skilled ladder rung walking test was also conducted for assessment of forelimb motor
function. The results showed more improvement of motor function in the affected limb in SRT4
compared with in CON4. It is thought that task-specific training such as skilled reach
training can be helpful to recovery of affected upper limb motor function through repeated
stimulation of the damaged motor cortex area. Although a significant difference was found
not only between CON1 and CON4 but also between SRT1 and SRT4, the error ratio for SRT4
decreased more than that for CON4. In order to demonstrate the effect of skilled reach
training more clearly, it is suggested that a long-term study should be conducted in the
future.</p><p>In conclusion, skilled reach training may be effective for improvement of motor function
and recovery in the brain. However, several things were not considered in the present study.
One thing necessary to be examined additionally is identification of the optimal intensity
for application of skilled reach training. Also, the quantity of training applied to each
rat may not be equal. Therefore, it is suggested that further study will be needed for
efficient application of skilled reach training to patients with ICH.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Desrosiers</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bourbonnais</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Corriveau</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effectiveness of unilateral and symmetrical bilateral task
