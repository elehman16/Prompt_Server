<bold>Background.</bold> Self-management and self-efficacy for physical activity is not routinely considered in neurologic rehabilitation.</p><p>
<bold>Objective.</bold> This study assessed feasibility and outcomes of a 14-week physical activity self-management and coaching intervention compared with social contact in Huntington disease (HD) to inform the design of a future full-scale trial.</p><p>
<bold>Design.</bold> Assessor blind, multisite, randomized pilot feasibility trial.</p><p>
<bold>Setting.</bold> Participants were recruited and assessed at baseline, 16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks in HD specialist clinics with intervention delivery by trained coaches in the participants&#x02019; homes.</p><p>
<bold>Patients and Intervention.</bold> People with HD were allocated to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity coaching intervention or a social interaction intervention.</p><p>
<bold>Measurements.</bold> Eligibility, recruitment, retention, and intervention participation were determined at 16 weeks. Other outcomes of interest included measures of mobility, self-efficacy, physical activity, and disease-specific measures of motor and cognition. Fidelity and costs for both the physical activity and social comparator interventions were established.</p><p>
<bold>Results.</bold> Forty percent (<italic>n</italic> = 46) of eligible patients were enrolled; 22 were randomized to the physical intervention and 24 to social intervention. Retention rates in the physical intervention and social intervention were 77% and 92%, respectively. Minimum participation criteria were achieved by 82% of participants in the physical intervention and 100% in the social intervention. There was no indication of between-group treatment effects on function; however, increases in self-efficacy for exercise and self-reported levels of physical activity in the physical intervention lend support to our predefined intervention logic model.</p><p>
<bold>Limitations.</bold> The use of self-report measures may have introduced bias.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions.</bold> An HD physical activity self-management and coaching intervention is feasible and worthy of further investigation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>
<bold>H</bold>untington disease (HD) is a fatal, autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder with a prevalence of 6&#x02013;13/100 000.<sup><xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Death usually occurs between 15 and 30 years after onset of symptoms, prior to which the complex disease symptoms, including motor, cognitive, and behavioral impairments, result in loss of functional independence and progressive escalation of healthcare costs.<sup><xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The personal, social, and economic consequences of HD are devastating.</p><p>Arguably in HD, to date, trials of exercise interventions have surpassed pharmacological interventions in achieving functional benefit.<sup><xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Indeed, numerous studies suggest that lifestyle factors, including physical activity and specific motor training, may help drive compensatory neural networks, which may in turn compensate for the failing brain and change the course of the disease.<sup><xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Such interventions implemented in long-term, neurodegenerative diseases such as HD have the potential to maintain function and facilitate independent living in a cost-effective manner and are critical secondary prevention strategies that should be a core component of contemporary neurologic physical therapy practice. However, long-term self-management skills for physical activity are rarely considered in clinical trials and home-based therapies.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>In HD, the nature of the disease (motor and nonmotor features) can negatively impact motivation to initiate and sustain participation in physical activity and exercise interventions. The associated cognitive and mood disorders such as apathy and decreased motivation can affect the willingness and the ability of individuals to engage in physical activity, structured exercise, or activities outside the home. There is little evidence for effectiveness of behavioral interventions to support longer-term participation in complicated chronic conditions including stroke<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and, to our knowledge, no disease-specific approaches that have been purposely developed for HD or other highly complex neurodegenerative conditions. This is a critical area to address not only to achieve the potential functional benefits that can be conferred from regular physical activity<sup><xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> but also to manage sedentary behaviors that place these individuals at increased risk of secondary health complications.</p><p>We aimed to assess feasibility and explore outcomes of the ENGAGE-HD physical activity self-management and coaching intervention through conducting a randomized, controlled pilot feasibility trial to inform the design of a future full-scale trial.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In focusing on a self-management approach that encouraged autonomy and goal setting, we were also interested in understanding the relevant interactions between provider and participant. For this reason, we included a social contact comparator. We also conducted a detailed economic costing to inform our understanding of the cost-benefit relationship of a physical activity intervention in relatively rare long-term neurodegenerative diseases such as HD.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design Overview</title><p>This was a single blind, multisite pilot feasibility trial (ISRCTN 65378754) reported in line with the CONSORT extension for randomized pilot studies.<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Participants were assessed at baseline on enrollment into the trial. Following baseline assessment, participants were randomized to a physical activity or social interaction intervention. A blinded assessor reassessed participants at 16 weeks following randomization, and then again at 26 weeks. At the end of the study, all participants were offered a brief version of the alternative intervention with 1 home visit and 1 follow-up phone call.

<p>Participants enrolled in the ENGAGE-HD physical activity intervention received 6 home visits and interim telephone calls over the course of 14 weeks, during which time they were supported by trained activity coaches to develop an individualized lifestyle approach to enhancing physical activity.</p>
<p>During the first face-to-face visit, the coach introduced the participant to the ENGAGE-HD physical activity intervention, the workbook, and the exercise diaries, which participants were asked to complete each week. The initial interactions considered benefits of physical activity and each participant's individual exercise history, as well as setting specific physical activity goals. Further discussion topics on physical activity included implementing a daily activity plan, monitoring exercise intensity, dealing with safety, weather, equipment, and typical barriers (such as time, boredom, lack of equipment, lack of specific knowledge, and support). In the remaining 5 home sessions, the coach continued to support discussions related to the activities in the workbook, and supervised the participant performing components of the <italic>Move to Exercise</italic> DVD exercise program or other physical activities. Coaches also reviewed exercise diaries completed during the previous week(s).</p>
<p>Supportive telephone calls were conducted 3 times over the 14-week period. These calls served to provide encouragement and advice with respect to the promotion of regular physical activity. During the calls, the coach also asked about any falls, health, or medication changes and confirmed the date and time of the next visit.</p>

<p>The training model was for a team, including the intervention coordinator, trial chief investigator, and trial manager, to travel to the site location and conduct a 6-hour training session in a small group setting. Coaches at sites received training in both interventions during this 6-hour session.</p>
<p>Training for the physical coaches included a 1.5-hour, one-to-one session with either the chief investigator or the intervention coordinator. Both the chief investigator and the intervention coordinator were research physical therapists with extensive experience working with the HD community in both clinical practice and research, who oversaw development of the training materials and ongoing support of the coaching staff. A coach's manual was provided to each coach, and was used as a guide for each of the training sessions. The manual gave an explicit, session-by-session guide, familiarized the coaches with the specific challenges of working with patients with HD, and offered a background to the intervention's SDT framework.</p>
<p>In addition to the initial training sessions and coaching manuals, coaches received ongoing support from the intervention coordinator. This support was particularly important in helping guide coaches who have had little or no experience of working with patients with this relatively rare disease. Before each coach visited a participant for the first time, they were able to have a discussion with the intervention coordinator to assist them in interpreting a participant's baseline assessment scores. This allowed them to appropriately anticipate the ability level and potential needs of each participant. After the initial home visits, coaches had a further discussion with the intervention coordinator to develop realistic goals for the participants, based on each participant's particular interests and their current ability levels. Coaches were further encouraged to contact the intervention coordinator if they had any questions about the home visits as the intervention progressed, by either email or video-conferencing.</p>

A set of 10 questions with a mix of rating scales (directly comparable to those scores used to rate fidelity) and free text answers were developed and delivered to the coaches via a web-based survey. The questions covered each coach's views on the training provided, participation in the intervention to SDT, accompanying materials used in the delivery of the intervention, and the intervention in general.

Conversation cards (with images and text) representing a wide range of topics stimulated discussions (contact corresponding author for more information).&#x000a0;Health and falls diaries were completed, but we did not ask those in the social intervention to keep exercise diaries.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4-3"><title>Coaches and training</title><p>Coaches were either a) healthcare professionals (eg, physical therapists, occupational therapists, or nurses) with experience of delivering exercise-related activities or with specific experience with HD; or b) exercise professionals. All staff had to meet specific health competencies. Nevertheless, across the sites, the coaches had a wide range of backgrounds and experiences, hence the need for centralized and standardized training and support. This was provided by the chief investigator and the intervention coordinator, both of whom were research physical therapists with extensive experience working with the HD community in both clinical practice and research. All coaches attended a 1-day face-to face training day prior to the start of the trial at each site and were trained to deliver both the physical and social interventions according to structured protocols. In addition, physical activity coaches participated in a minimum of 2 phone/video conferences (per participant) with the intervention coordinator to discuss goal setting or any participant-specific concerns or issues.</p><p>A coach's manual provided a session-by-session guide, familiarized the coaches with the specific challenges of working with patients with HD, and offered a background to the intervention's SDT framework. Full details of the visit schedules, training, and coaching support are reported elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2-4-4"><title>Intervention fidelity</title><p>The multiple modalities of intervention delivery necessitated different fidelity measures. Fidelity of the physical activity intervention was measured using a combination of self-report checklists, independent analysis of audio recordings, and a self-assessment completed by the intervention coaches. Full details of physical activity intervention fidelity (including the use of a purpose-developed rating scale) are published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Social intervention fidelity was assessed as total time spent in the home during the visit and length of interim telephone calls. This was chosen to control for any confounds in relation to contact time. As a further evaluation, coaches were asked to record details of the conversations that we used to confirm the focus of discussions (and in particular to establish that the discussions were not related to physical activity).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Outcomes and Follow-Up</title><p>Baseline measures included age, gender, height, weight, level of education, Social Support for Exercise survey, and several disease-specific measures. The Social Support for Exercise survey<sup><xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> assesses the level of support individuals feel they are receiving from family and friends while making health behavior changes. Disease-specific measures (obtained from Enroll-HD or clinical records) included the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS)<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Total Motor Score (TMS), which measures voluntary and involuntary motor impairments specific to HD, and Total Functional Capacity (TFC), which assesses capacity to work, handle finances, perform domestic chores and self-care tasks, and live independently. Functional Assessment and Independence Scale were also assessed. Medication at baseline (coded as analgesic, anti-choreic, anti-depressant, antihypertensive, diabetes, and other) was also recorded. See Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> for complete details of outcomes and follow-up time points.</p><p>We defined a priori feasibility objectives based on our evaluation of eligibility (assessed through screening logs maintained at each research site) and recruitment and retention rates (monitored through a bespoke clinical trials database and evaluated based on the final number of participants successfully consented, randomized, and retained). We also monitored completion of outcome measures, protocol deviations (using standard operating procedures as part of a formal quality management system inherent in a UK registered clinical trials unit), and documented both intervention fidelity and participation in the intervention (measured using patient diaries) as well as safety (adverse event reporting documented in accordance with the governance requirements of safety reporting in a trial not involving an investigational medicinal product). We agreed that a retention rate greater than 75% would suggest that the intervention and trial processes were feasible. If the proportion retained was less than this but greater than 65%, we would consider adjusting the intervention. Participation in both the physical and social intervention was considered sufficient if at least 75% of the participants completed visits 1, 2, and 3 with their activity coach (of a possible 6 visits). We set this threshold for participation relative to the number of visits required to discuss all content of the physical activity workbook and to agree on goals. The minimum threshold for participation to exercise diary completion was defined as valid data reported for at least 4 days or more in over half the weeks during the intervention for any one of the components.</p><p>As recommended in the CONSORT extension for randomized pilot studies,<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> reporting effect size estimates and measures of uncertainty is critical to inform fully powered future evaluation. We therefore explored a range of potential outcomes in both groups. Function was assessed using the Physical Performance Test (PPT), an assessment incorporating a series of 9 primarily timed functional tasks that are converted to categorical variables (0-4) and summed to give a score between 0 (severe problems) and 36 (minimal problems).<sup><xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Self-reported physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)&#x02013;short form.<sup><xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Home and community mobility was reflected by the Life Space Assessment.<sup><xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The Lorig scale provided a measure of self-efficacy.<sup><xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Walking ability was assessed using the 6-minute walk test,<sup><xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> a measure of walking endurance that measures distance walked in 6 minutes, and the Timed Up and Go Test,<sup><xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> which measures the time to stand up from a chair, walk 3 meters, turn, walk back, and sit down. Participants completed the EQ-5D generic health capability measure<sup><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> and the ICECAP-A generic health measure via interview.<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Self-reported frequency, circumstance, and severity of any falls over the past 4 months were recorded at the baseline, primary endpoint assessments, and over the past two months at follow-up. The PAS Healthcare Climate Questionnaire (short form)<sup><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> was used to assess participants&#x02019; perceptions of the degree to which their coach accommodated their individual needs, choices, and perspectives. Motor function was assessed using the modified UHDRS Motor Score (mMS), a subset of items in the UHDRS TMS, chosen due to its specific focus on voluntary motor impairments. Cognitive function was assessed using verbal fluency and symbol digit modality tests,<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> both of which have been shown to be sensitive to cognitive impairments in HD.<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We planned to recruit 62 participants to estimate feasibility proportions for retention and participation within 14 percentage points on either side using a 95% confidence interval. This target allowed for 25% loss to follow-up. Descriptive analyses (with 95% confidence intervals where relevant) included an evaluation of eligibility, recruitment, retention rates, and completion of outcome measures and assessments. Diary usage was summarized by constituent components, ie, DVD use, pedometer use, and reported walking time. Falls diary data was analyzed using frequency analysis.</p><p>Both unadjusted and adjusted between-group differences for outcome measures are presented. Adjusted estimates were calculated controlling for baseline measures of outcome scores (ie, Analysis of Covariance [ANCOVA]) in addition to the balancing variables (age, gender, and UHDRS motor score). This approach was taken in order to provide the most valid effect size estimates for this relatively rare study population.<sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Standard transformations were explored to improve model fit. All these analyses were on an intention to treat (ITT) basis, although the primary analysis used the complete case dataset.</p><p>The cost to deliver both the physical and social interventions was calculated by multiplying the hourly salary rate of the intervention staff (including salary on costs) by the time taken to arrange, travel to, and conduct sessions; mileage costs were based on a reimbursement rate of &#x000a3;0.40 per mile. Journey time and mileage were calculated as the round-trip (eg, a 12-minute journey to visit the participant is recorded as 24 minutes of staff time).</p><p>

In the physical intervention arm, 82% of participants completed visits 1, 2, and 3, and 68% completed all scheduled visits; 100% of participants in the social intervention completed visits 1, 2, and 3, and 88% completed all visits.</p><p>Exercise diary data was available for 17/22 participants at the primary endpoint (only those in the physical intervention completed the exercise diaries). Thirteen (76%) participants participated in at least 1 component of the intervention for a minimum of 7 weeks during the course of the intervention. Forty-six percent of participants recorded walking time, 51% recorded pedometer readings, and 70% recorded using the DVD. The average daily time spent using the DVD over 13 weeks was 16.4 (SD 3.0) minutes, and the average daily time spent walking was 63 minutes (SD 14.5), with average daily pedometer count 6254 steps (SD 998).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Participant Goals (Physical Intervention Only)</title><p>Up to 3 goals were recorded by the end of visit 3 for the 19 participants in the physical activity group. In total, 50 goals were recorded for 19 participants; 19 of these were related to walking, 21 to structured exercise, 6 to increasing general activity, 2 to reducing sitting time, and 2 were sports and recreational activity based. Of the 19 participants that recorded goals at the start of the intervention, 3 participants (1 who had made 3 goals and 2 who had made 2&#x000a0;goals) did not complete the intervention. Sixty-seven percent of goals were achieved at the expected outcome or better, with the majority of these being related to general activity goals and walking goals.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">5</xref> summarizes the baseline and follow-up scores of key outcome variables, as well as presenting unadjusted and adjusted between-group differences.

We have shown that it is possible to recruit participants to this study, and through the robust intervention description and development of comprehensive training and monitoring of associated fidelity we have clear indications of how to support the delivery of such a trial. The dropout rate was lower in the social intervention than physical intervention. Trial discontinuation records suggest that those participants withdrawing from the physical intervention were faced with a variety of unrelated life challenges and reported difficulty in participating in the requirements of the physical activity intervention. This highlights the importance of considering the personal challenges experienced by those living with a neurodegenerative disease so that therapists are able to identify when individuals may benefit from extra support to sustain physical activity. This trial was conducted across 6 specialist centers in the United Kingdom, covering both rural and urban areas. The intervention was highly manualized and included expert oversight from a lead intervention therapist and preliminary cost analyses that altogether provide excellent evidence for designing future definitive trials in a UK setting.</p><p>Critical to our intervention development was acknowledgment of the complex array of cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms that can lead to highly risky sedentary behaviors in HD.<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Our intervention approach included one-to-one coaching and telephone support and a coaching style that highlighted autonomy, competence, and relatedness as well as considering disease-specific barriers (in this case cognitive limitations and apathy, a common behavioral problem in HD) and wider environmental and social aspects. To our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a social contact comparator in a physical activity intervention trial targeting a neurological population; thus, the observable between-group differences in physical activity provide some initial suggestion that the coaching approach was indeed linked to physical activity outcomes rather than benefit incurred through social contact. The relative increase in self-efficacy for exercise along with increased levels of physical activity as a result of the coaching intervention despite the complexity of impairments in HD reinforces the importance of specific support for exercise in complex and chronic conditions such as HD and is therefore a target for future confirmatory studies. It also lends support to our predefined logic model and gives us some confidence that the observed outcomes, namely improved Life Space and self-efficacy, could be related to the intervention inputs. However, it is likely that a critical factor to achieving functional benefit is exercise participation over a longer duration.</p><p>We must acknowledge the limitations inherent in this pilot feasibility trial. The large number of outcome measures may have been unduly burdensome for sites and participants, but we are now in a position to define a more focused assessment battery in a definitive trial. Additionally, the self-report measures utilized, such as the IPAQ, may have introduced bias. Employing more intuitive monitoring approaches, eg, wearable technologies to quantitatively measure physical activity,<sup><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> may be helpful. This study also did not assess any carer impact as a result of the person with HD participating in this trial. Future trials may want to consider recruiting carer-companions or HD family dyads not only to optimize recruitment and retention but also to facilitate wider physical activity&#x02013;related health benefits.<sup><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>Defining and developing methods to facilitate physical activity behavior change is of great interest to neurologic physical therapy practice. This may in part be due to the greater acknowledgment of the critical role for physical activity as a potential disease-modifying intervention,<sup><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> but more likely the urgent need for implementing secondary preventive strategies for the large numbers of individuals living with chronic diseases.<sup><xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> There is an increasing focus on the development and evaluation of theory-driven approaches embedded in specifically tailored programs to achieve sustained behavior change for people with neurodegenerative and neuro-inflammatory diseases such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS).<sup><xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>-<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Here we report the first such pilot feasibility trial in HD, a well-characterized single gene neurodegenerative disorder that is an excellent model that can be easily adapted to individuals with dementias and movement disorders more generally,<sup><xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> as well as for individuals with rare neurodegenerative diseases. Supporting ongoing physical activity in an environment of changing physical and cognitive function has the potential to enhance meaningful participation in usual life activities and could lead to important public health benefits for these populations. Given the success achieved (with relatively low cost) in this highly challenging and complex condition, we suggest that this approach has wider applicability and should be subject to a full-scale efficacy evaluation in HD over a longer duration and is worthy of exploration in a broad range of neurodegenerative conditions where cognition, behavior, and apathy limit ongoing physical activity engagement.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Author Contributions and Acknowledgments</title><p>Concept/idea/research design: M.
