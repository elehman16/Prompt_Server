Medication management in paediatric patients is particularly complex and consequently potential for harms are greater than in adults. Electronic medication management (eMM) systems are heralded as a highly effective intervention to reduce adverse drug events (ADEs), yet internationally evidence of their effectiveness in paediatric populations is limited.

In stage 1, 8 wards within the first paediatric hospital will be randomised to receive the eMM system 1&#x02005;week apart. In stage 2, the second paediatric hospital will randomise implementation of a modified eMM and outcomes will be assessed. Prescribing errors will be identified through record reviews, and MAEs through direct observation of nurses and record reviews. Actual and potential severity will be assigned. Outcomes will be assessed at the patient-level using mixed models, taking into account correlation of admissions within wards and multiple admissions for the same patient, with adjustment for potential confounders. Interviews and direct observation of clinicians will investigate the effects of the system on workflow.

Compared with adults, medication errors in children are three times more likely to result in harm.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Paediatric patients are at particular risk of certain errors, such as 10-fold dosing errors facilitated by mistakes in dose calculation, poor documentation of decimal points and confusion with the use of zeros. Some errors have led to death.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> The complex medication decision process in children often requires information about age, weight, dosing ranges and off-label use of medicines.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Systematic reviews show errors occur in 5&#x02013;27% of all medication orders for children.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> Prescribing errors account for 3&#x02013;37% of errors, dispensing 5&#x02013;58%, administration 72&#x02013;75% and documentation 17&#x02013;21%, although accuracy of estimates is affected by the great variability in definitions and measurement methods used.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There is much less research about the harms associated with medicine use. One Australian study found 19.2% of paediatric inpatients experienced adverse drug events (ADEs) and estimated 12.3% were potential ADEs, 7.0% were actual ADEs and 3.6% were preventable.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>The frequency and severity of medication administration errors (MAEs) in Australian adult hospitals is a cause for concern.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In 4271 medications administered to 720 patients, 74.4% were found to have at least one procedural failure (eg, failure to check a patient's identification).<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> One in four had a clinical error (eg, wrong dose). Of intravenous drug administrations, 70% had one clinical error, of which 25.5% were judged to be serious and likely to cause permanent harm.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> MAEs among children are rarely studied.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A major barrier to MAE research is the methodological challenges. MAEs cannot be accurately detected from retrospective record reviews; they require direct observation of nurses administering medications to patients.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Can information technology reduce medication errors?</title><p>Electronic medication management (eMM) systems incorporate software which provides users with the ability to prescribe, monitor and administer medications to patients. These systems also provide the capacity to incorporate decision support tools such as alerts for drug&#x02013;drug interactions.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> eMM is usually integrated into a hospital's clinical information system (computerised provider order entry system). These systems are expected to reduce medication errors and ADEs significantly as a result of improved legibility of medication orders, complete and legally compliant documentation, and through both the active and passive decision support tools embedded in them. However, rigorous evidence demonstrating these effects is limited.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> A systematic review identified eight studies of eMM effectiveness among paediatric patients. Meta-analysis showed a significant reduction in prescribing error risk (RR 0.08; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.77) across the three included studies, but not in ADEs or mortality.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> There are no Australian studies of eMM system use in a paediatric setting. Previous studies have often relied on incident reports to measure error rates, which are generally unreliable.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Only one study<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> of paediatric inpatients has used a control group to assess eMM effectiveness. Internationally there is currently insufficient evidence to demonstrate clinical benefit from eMM in paediatric patients. This view was confirmed by a policy review for the American Academy of Pediatrics<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> which called for the demonstrable enhancement of eMM systems to better meet the specific needs of paediatrics to ensure their safety and effectiveness. Further, existing eMM systems used in paediatrics have been found lacking in functionalities required for safe prescribing, dispensing and administration of medications.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In 2005, Han <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> reported a significant increase in the mortality rate among critical care children at a US paediatric hospital following introduction of a commercial eMM system. The rapid implementation process and limited attention to the significant workflow redesign required were considered as major factors in this outcome. Subsequent studies<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> have shown no increase in mortality rates. However, the Han <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> study caused considerable alarm and served to demonstrate the substantial dangers of poor implementation and the importance of monitoring outcomes following system implementation and responding to the problems identified.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>eMM use in adult hospitals, while highly effective at reducing medication errors,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> also introduced new &#x02018;system-related&#x02019; errors. An investigation of 1164 prescribing errors post-eMM in two adult Australian hospitals found 42.4% were facilitated by the system (78 per 100 admissions).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The most frequent mechanism was incorrect selection from a drop-down menu. Results from that study were used to instigate changes to eMM software and to inform changes to user training programmes. The study was one of the first to quantify the rate of &#x02018;system-related&#x02019; errors and produced an innovative dual classification for categorising both the manifestations and mechanisms of these system-related errors.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The nature and magnitude of such potential new risks have rarely been studied in paediatrics.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Why evaluate eHealth systems</title><p>eHealth systems are having an increasing impact on the delivery of healthcare services, yet, despite their widespread effects and vast cost, they are rarely subject to rigorous research.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This limited evidence base significantly hinders improvements and innovation in the design, implementation and use of health information technology (IT) systems. Internationally the need for IT evaluation studies to employ more robust designs and sophisticated analyses is well recognised.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Excessive reliance has been placed on uncontrolled before-and-after and qualitative studies. Evidence of eHealth system effectiveness and safety is crucial to facilitate policymakers' and healthcare organisations' informed decisions about investments and prioritisation of health IT systems.</p><p>This project presents an innovative and comprehensive programme to assess eMM system's effectiveness in reducing medication errors, ADEs and length of stay (LOS) and rapidly deploying new knowledge into practice for subsequent implementation.</p><p>The project aims are:

Cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCT) are ideally suited to test interventions where individual patient randomisation is not possible. CRCTs commonly use a parallel group design, in which the clusters are randomised to either the intervention or the control arm of the study. It is often regarded as unethical to withhold an intervention from a proportion of participants if it is believed that the intervention will do more good than harm. The SWCRCT design, where the intervention is delivered sequentially to all trial clusters over a number of time periods, is an alternative to the traditional parallel groups design. The order in which the clusters (wards) receive the intervention is randomised, and by the end of the study all clusters will have adopted the intervention.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The steps represent the predetermined periods when data relating to each of the clusters will be collected. This design is the closest to the gold standard of an RCT, when such a design is not possible. The stepped-wedge design offers particular strengths in allowing the modelling of the effect of time on the effectiveness of the intervention. In stage 1 a SWCRCT will be conducted at site 1, and in stage 2 a SWCRCT will be conducted at site 2.</p><p>The study setting is the Sydney Children's Hospitals Network which incorporates the two major urban tertiary referral paediatric hospitals in Sydney, Australia, The Children's Hospital at Westmead (CHW; site 1) and Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick (SCH; site 2). The network provides care for 51&#x02005;000 inpatient admissions, 92&#x02005;000 emergency department presentations and over 1&#x02005;000&#x02005;000 outpatient services events each year. Both sites are acute paediatric tertiary hospitals with emergency departments, outpatient and home services. During the study period, the eMM will not be available in the intensive care units (ICUs), theatres or outpatients. Site 1 accommodates 310 beds and site 2 has 180 beds. Both hospitals provide a complex and comprehensive range of services caring for seriously ill and injured children and adolescents across the state of New South Wales and beyond.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>The eMM intervention</title><p>At baseline medication orders are written on paper medication charts and details of medications administered are written on the same charts. The eMM clinical module will be an addition to the hospitals' existing commercial electronic clinical information system (Cerner Corporation). Both hospital sites use the same commercial clinical system; however, the software can be customised to meet each hospital's individual requirements. Based on the results from our first site and applying our action research methodology, we will provide advice to the second implementation site on optimal customisation of the eMM (and associated processes) for their site. The eMM allows electronic prescribing, recording of drug dispensing, drug administration and medication reconciliation and monitoring processes (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary material file</xref> for screenshots from the eMM). The system allows for the ordering and administration of all oral, and intrvenous medications and fluids, but excludes anaesthesia medications. The eMM contains both passive and active decision support in the form of links to guidelines, policies, protocols, order sets, order sentences, safety alerts (eg, drug&#x02013;drug interactions, dose range checks) and dosage calculators. During the course of the study, the eMM system will be accessible via any computer in the hospital allocated for inpatient clinical care, but will not be available for patients in the ICUs, theatres or outpatients. The system will be predominantly accessed in hospital wards and in the hospital pharmacy. Both fixed and mobile computing devices are available to staff using the system.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-011811.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-011811supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Medication reconciliation on admission and at discharge will be performed using the eMM system when implemented.

<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Procedural errors include, for prescribing orders, illegible orders, illegal orders (in which an aspect of the prescription does not comply with hospital policy, with law, or with the State Department of Health policies) and incomplete orders. Medication administration procedural errors include, for example, failure to follow the correct patient identification process prior to drug administration, and correct conduct of medication double-checking requirements (many drugs within paediatric hospitals require two nurses to independently check aspects of the drug preparation and administration process). Clinical errors include wrong dose, wrong drug, wrong route and wrong strength errors.</p><p>Once an error has been identified, a rating of the potential severity of that error will be made, based on the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC-MERP) rating scale for adverse event outcomes.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Subsequently, records will be reviewed for the evidence of error detection and interception, and for any actual harm to the patient. Thus, medication errors which occur will receive both a &#x02018;potential&#x02019; harm rating and an &#x02018;actual harm rating&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011811F2">figure 2</xref>). As most previous medication error studies do not assess actual harm, this double classification process will allow us to compare our findings with previous studies, as well as allow an assessment of the accuracy of such approaches compared with estimating the actual harm from medication errors.</p><p>Evidence of harm as a consequence of a medication error will be identified through a comprehensive review of patients' medical records. This clinical review process will be assisted by the provision of specific harm identification guides for reviewers which will identify, for specific drugs and error types, the types of evidence which would suggest harm had occurred following the medication error. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016011811F4">Figure&#x000a0;4</xref> presents an example of one of the harm identification guides to be used.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016011811F4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Example of harm assessment guide for paediatric opioid errors, to be used during medical record review following identification of an opioid prescribing error.

For aim 3, the findings of the SWCRCT at CHW (ie, stage 1) will be reported to the Project Evaluation Committee (PEC) made up of members of the research team, and the hospitals' eMM system Project Steering Committee. The PEC will meet every month to consider the implications of study findings across a number of domains including the system's technical features (eg, compatibility with other hospital systems), effectiveness (eg, error reduction and system-related errors); professional attitudes (eg, satisfaction) and organisational features (eg, work processes), as a means of formulating changes to eMM system design features and user training.</p><p>This will form the key component of an action-oriented approach aimed at optimising system performance leading to an enhanced eMM system which will then be implemented across the second site, SCH (stage 2). The SWCRCT design will be repeated at site 2 using the same methods as above. Power calculations for stage 2 will be based on results from stage 1.

Importantly, the findings will be directly applied to enhance the eMM system design, and work processes and then tested further through evaluation of the enhanced eMM system at a second paediatric hospital. These results will be particularly valuable for other paediatric hospitals yet to start implementations. Exploiting the SWCRCT design within an action research model is highly innovative, and will deliver high-quality data on system effectiveness. Such a model of formally integrating health IT assessment results as a basis for active engagement with IT vendors and clinicians to bring about system change has both national and international significance.

Results will also be reported through academic journals and conference presentations. The project is funded through a National Health and Medical Research Council Partnership Grant. As such, the project team includes academic researchers, hospital clinicians and experts involved in the implementation of the eMM system at the two hospital sites, along with senior policymakers from agencies within the State Health Department involved in eHealth system strategy and policy.
