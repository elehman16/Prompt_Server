To compare total fluid intake (TFI), defined as the sum of water and all other fluid types, assessed with a 24-h dietary (food and fluid) recall with mean TFI assessed with a 7-day fluid-specific record among adolescents and adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>
This repeated cross-sectional study compared TFI as assessed by two fluid assessment instruments using a crossover approach. 290 adolescents (17.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.8&#x000a0;years, 50&#x000a0;% boys) and 289 adults (43&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.3&#x000a0;years, 50&#x000a0;% men) from Indonesia completed the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Significant correlations were observed between fluid intake assessed with the 24-h recall and the 7-day fluid record (<italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.333; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). The Bland&#x02013;Altman method, however, showed an underestimation (bias) of mean TFI by a 24-h recall when compared with the 7-day fluid record [mean difference (95&#x000a0;% CI) &#x02212;382&#x000a0;mL (&#x02212;299, &#x02212;465); <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001]. The mean difference also increased with increasing TFI: Mean difference for the lowest and highest quartiles of TFI was 139 versus &#x02212;1265&#x000a0;mL/day. The 7-day fluid record recorded two (95&#x000a0;% CI &#x02212;1.9, &#x02212;2.4; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) extra drinking acts compared with the 24-h recall, whereas the mean volume per drinking act was significantly higher with the 24-h recall [mean difference (95&#x000a0;% CI) 39&#x000a0;mL (31, 47); <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Compared with a 7-day fluid record, a 24-h dietary recall significantly underestimated TFI. Subjects recalled two less drinking acts, while estimating the volume consumed per drinking act to be larger. Since the adequate intakes for total water intake are based on median intakes observed in national surveys that most frequently used the 24-h recall method, they may potentially be underestimated.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Water intake</kwd><kwd>Total fluid intake</kwd><kwd>7-day fluid record</kwd><kwd>24-h dietary recall</kwd><kwd>Indonesia</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is widely known that the composition of the human body is mainly water, and that water is vital for normal body function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Water also plays a role in the maintenance of normal thermoregulation and normal physical and cognitive functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, the Indonesian Food and Nutrition Conference 2012 (<italic>Widyakarya Nasional Pangan dan Gizi 2012</italic>) set adequate total daily water intake recommendations (RDI) for adolescent aged 16&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years at 2.1&#x000a0;L/day for girls and 2.2&#x000a0;L/day for boys, while for adults aged 19&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years, consuming 2.3 and 2.5&#x02013;2.6&#x000a0;L/day was recommended for women and men, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The intake of the nutrient water is provided by both foods and fluids (drinking water and beverages of all kind), but mainly by fluids (approximately 80&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Surveying populations once recommendations have been made, allows establishing whether or not the recommendations are being met. However, although it is essential to measure water intake from both foods and beverages, until now, no dietary methods have been validated to accurately and precisely estimate total water or total fluid intake (TFI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since all instruments have specific limitations, the results obtained from the same respondents, but with different instruments, can <italic>vary </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This may lead to inconsistent conclusions and make comparisons between surveys using different instruments difficult, if not invalid. Therefore, it would be valuable to compare and determine the difference in TFI measured with frequently used methods. A 24-h recall record is a retrospective method that assesses what the respondent consumed during the previous 24&#x000a0;h. It is a relatively quick and inexpensive method, and therefore, it is commonly used in epidemiological surveys. However, this method tends to overestimate &#x0201c;healthy intakes&#x0201d; and underestimate &#x0201c;unhealthy&#x0201d; intakes as intakes are self-reported; in addition, it does not take into account the variability in intakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. On the contrary, a dietary record is a prospective method usually recording the intakes over several consecutive days. Even though this instrument is resource-intensive, time-consuming, and can be a burden on some subjects, it is considered to provide relatively accurate data concerning intake of food and nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Consequently, a 7-day dietary record is used as a criterion method, and as such, other nutrition assessment methods are often compared with it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recently, a dietary record has been developed to specifically estimate fluid intake over 7 consecutive days in several cross-sectional surveys in different countries from different continents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The aim of the present study was to compare habitual TFI assessed with this 7-day fluid-specific record and with a 24-h dietary recall among apparently healthy Indonesian adolescents (16&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years) and adults (19&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>A crossover study design was used to assess fluid intake of the subjects using 24-h recall and 7-day records as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; a washout period of 7&#x000a0;days was incorporated into the study design. After screening for inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible subjects were enrolled, and data on their sociodemographic characteristics and medical history were collected. Physical and anthropometry assessments were also taken. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the two groups using concealed envelopes. Group 1 started on day 1 with the 24-h recall followed by 7&#x000a0;days of washout period and consequently started on study day 9 with the 7-day fluid diary. The second group started on day 1 with the 7-day fluid record, on day 8 with the washout period, and finished on day 15 with the 24-h dietary recall. Subjects were requested to keep their habitual food and fluid intake throughout the study period of 15&#x000a0;days.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study with crossover design to assess fluid intake of adolescents and adults with a 24-h dietary recall and a 7-day fluid record</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="394_2015_954_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>After explaining the study protocol to all subjects, a written informed consent was obtained. The study was approved on April 17, 2012 by the Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia (number 151/PT02.FK/ETIK/2012).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p>Two age groups were defined: adolescents aged 16&#x02013;18&#x000a0;years and adults aged 19&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years. The study aimed to recruit 300 subjects per age group and 60 subjects per municipality. The municipalities were selected in five areas of Jakarta (North, West, Central, East, and South Jakarta), and from each municipality, one primary health center (<italic>Puskesmas</italic>) was selected to be the study center. Each primary health center identified households that contained at least one adolescent and one adult living together. From these households, all eligible subjects were recruited until the target sample size of this study was reached. Study inclusion criteria were female and male individuals aged 16&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years, who were apparently healthy based upon a physical examination performed by a physician. Additionally, the subjects had to be resident in the study area for at least 1&#x000a0;year and had to be of middle-level socioeconomic status (B and C based on AC Nielsen criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). Pregnant women, lactating women, subjects with special dietary restrictions, and subjects who were illiterate and/or had difficulties to communicate orally were not eligible for recruitment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Intake assessment methods</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>24-h dietary recall</title><p>Trained nutritionists visited the subjects at home to recall their food and fluid intake during the previous 24-h period. The face-to-face interview was done in four stages. During the first phase, the interviewer obtained a complete list of all foods and beverages consumed the previous day, followed in the immediate second phase by a detailed description of each food and beverage consumed, including cooking methods and brand name. In the third phase, estimates of the amount of each food and beverage item consumed were recorded. Photographs, household utensils, or food models were used as memory aids to assess portion sizes. In the fourth pass, the interviewer repeated all detailed food and beverage items recorded to ensure completeness. Only the data on fluid intake, defined as the intake (in mL) of water and all other beverages, were extracted from the 24-h recall for this analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>7-day fluid record</title><p>A trained nutritionist delivered and explained the fluid record to the subjects during a face-to-face interview in their homes. Each day, the same nutritionist visited the subject at home to collect the fluid record of the previous day and to provide a new record for the next day. The aim of these daily home visits was to maintain a high participation rate and to avoid subjects copying the previous day&#x02019;s data into the next-day record. In total, 30 trained nutritionists were involved in the data collection. Each nutritionist was responsible for visiting a maximum of five households or 10 subjects during the same period.</p><p>The fluid record was structured to collect the following detailed information on each drinking act in open spaces on the record: the hour of consumption, the type of fluid, the brand of fluid, the volume of the recipient from which the volume was consumed, and the volume actually consumed. For these variables, no answers were proposed to the subjects. For the last two variables, the temperature of the fluid and the location where the drinking act took place, the answers were predefined for the subjects. The temperature at which the fluid was consumed could be: chilled with ice cubes, chilled without ice cubes, warm, or at room temperature. The predefined locations were at home, the office, school/college, a restaurant or canteen, or other location. To assist the subjects in estimating the consumed volumes, the records were supported by a photographic booklet of standard containers of fluids.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Classification of fluid types</title><p>All fluids recorded by the 24-h dietary recall and the 7-day fluid record were classified accordingly: water (bottled water and boiled water), hot beverages (coffee and tea), milk and derivatives, soft drinks (carbonated and non-carbonated sugar-sweetened drinks, carbonated and non-carbonated non-calorically sweetened drinks, ice-based, coconut-based, chocolate-based, and fruit- and vegetable-based drinks), and other beverages (traditional drinks, cereal drinks, herbal drink, soy bean milk, others). TFI was established by the sum of all these categories. Any addition (e.g., sugar) to a fluid was not taken into account during the fluid classification. A drinking act was defined as any act of consumption of any fluid type at any time of the day. Mean volume per drinking act was calculated by dividing TFI by the number of drinking acts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data management and analysis</title><p>Data were recorded daily using specific forms, then checked, coded, and entered into spreadsheets (SPSS version 20, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Subjects reporting a mean total daily fluid intake below 0.4&#x000a0;L/day or higher than 6&#x000a0;L/day, as well as subjects not completing all 7&#x000a0;days of the 7-day fluid record were excluded from the analysis. The null hypothesis to test was that both assessment methods did not result in a different TFI (i.e., zero difference), assuming that each individual ate and drank the same way throughout the study period. Within-person intakes of fluids were compared using a general linear model for repeated measured data and Spearman rank correlation test. The Bland&#x02013;Altman method was used to assess the agreement between the results obtained with both instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For each subject, the following values were calculated based on TFI obtained by the 24-h dietary recall and the 7-day fluid record: difference in TFI between both methods (formula&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) and mean TFI for both methods (formula&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>). The limits of agreement (LOA, formula&#x000a0;<xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="">3</xref>) were calculated for the total study sample, the adolescent and the adult sample.<disp-formula id="Equ1"><label>1</label><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

The results indicated that, at group level, the 24-h dietary recall significantly underestimated TFI compared with the 7-day fluid record, and that there was poor agreement between both methods.</p><p>There are several possible explanations for the differences in TFI at group level estimated with the two methods. Firstly, the 7-day fluid record is a prospective method, whereas a 24-h dietary recall is a retrospective method that depends on respondents&#x02019; memory, recall, and conceptualization abilities. The underestimation by the 24-h recall compared with the 7-day fluid diary might thus be due to subjects not recalling some drinking acts. This hypothesis is supported by the current results showing two extra drinking acts with the 7-day fluid record compared with the 24-h recall. A second explanation could be linked to the specificity of the instruments: With the 24-h dietary recall, both foods and fluids were recorded; therefore, subjects might have focused on their food and fluid intake at meal time. Depending on the country, fluids are more frequently consumed outside of meals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]; thus, drinking acts outside of meals may have been overlooked during the 24-h recall. However, it is not possible to verify this hypothesis because information was not collected on the intake occasion (within or outside meals) at which the two extra drinking acts were recorded with the 7-day fluid diary. A third possible explanation for the difference in TFI is the fact that the 7-day fluid record takes into account TFI across 7&#x000a0;days, whereas a 24-h recall does not. Given that no day-to-day variability was observed with the 7-day fluid diary, this is unlikely to be the cause for the difference in TFI of both methods. Moreover, as shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>, the difference in TFI between the 24-h recall and <italic>any day</italic> of the 7-day fluid record was comparable to the difference in TFI between the 24-h recall and the mean of the 7&#x000a0;days of the fluid record. This means that the intake of a group estimated by the 24-h recall cannot be used/interpreted as the intake on any given day. A last possible explanation for the difference in TFI between both instruments could be a social desirability bias. When performing the 24-h recall, the subject was face to face with a nutritionist and might have over- or underreported their TFI or intake of a certain fluid type (e.g., overestimated the intake of a &#x0201c;healthy&#x0201d; fluid and underestimated the intake of an &#x0201c;unhealthy&#x0201d; drink) to meet a socially desired health standard. The over- or underestimating of a certain fluid type was, however, considered to be unlikely as the subjects consumed 75&#x02013;76&#x000a0;% of their TFI as water. Moreover, the contribution of the different fluid types to TFI was comparable between both methods. An over- or underreporting of the volume consumed was likely as the volume per drinking act significantly differed between both methods, with a higher volume per drink act observed with the 24-h recall. These observations suggest that (1) with a 24-h recall, subjects recall two drinking acts less than with a 7-day fluid record, but they estimated their volume consumed per drinking act to be larger and (2) a 24-h recall seems to be an acceptable method if the aim was to describe the contribution (in %) of different fluids to TFI of a group. The latter observation should, however, be confirmed in a sample with a more diverse fluid intake pattern than the one of this Indonesian sample (75&#x02013;76&#x000a0;% of TFI was water).</p><p>Despite the disagreement in TFI measured with both instruments, the TFI data of the 24-h recall and TFI of 7-day fluid record were significantly correlated. Yet, according to the Dancey and Reidy&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] categorization, the correlations were weak to moderate. Additionally, a correlation coefficient measures the strength of a relation between two variables, not the agreement between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. During the interpretation of the results, importance is therefore mainly given to the Bland&#x02013;Altman method, which is recommended as the preferred method for the comparison of measurement or assessment methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Some limitations of the study need to be acknowledged. Since both instruments were compared in the absence of an objective biomarker of TFI, this is a relative comparison. In nutrition however, when different instruments are compared, a 7-day dietary record is frequently used as the reference method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Since the 7-day dietary record in this study was specifically focusing on fluids, the assumption was made that the accuracy and specificity for recording of TFI were even higher than the standard dietary (food and fluid) record. The high prevalence of obesity observed in the adult population might also be a limitation, since the adult sample might not be representative of the whole Indonesian adult population. It is known that obese subjects significantly underestimate intakes, and therefore, this could potentially have affected the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, the possible effect on reporting due to the high prevalence of obesity was minimized by the crossover study design, in which each subject is his own control. A third limitation is related to the habitual intake of different fluid types in Indonesia. The subjects included in this study, but also adolescents and adults participating in another survey in Indonesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], appeared to consume mainly water. The other fluids contributed only a small amount to TFI. Therefore, differences in reporting of certain fluid types other than water might not be detectable in this study. Additionally, the statistical model did not account for periods, sequence, and clustering by community and household. However, the effect of period was controlled for by randomization at group level. No or minimal period effect (or carryover effect) was anticipated as subjects were requested to keep their habitual food and fluid intakes. A last limitation to acknowledge is that food intake was not controlled over the study period. Since food intake can influence fluid intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the possibility remains that fluid intake at individual level differed by study week due to a different food intake. Subjects were, however, requested not to change their food intake during the study period.</p><p>This study also had several strengths. Firstly, a large sample was recruited, with an equal distribution of gender and an equal coverage of both age groups. Moreover, the study was completed with a high compliance rate (i.e., &#x0003e;80&#x000a0;%). The crossover approach is a second strength to highlight. This enabled a pairwise comparison between both instruments, but it also allows to conclude that the systematically higher fluid intake estimated with the 7-day fluid record is not due the nutritionists improving their interview skills or participants learning over time to report more fluid intake. A third strength worthy of mentioning is the use of the Bland&#x02013;Altman method for data analysis, which is the most recommended validation procedure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This analysis can indicate whether two measurement techniques agree sufficiently to be interchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The results of this study indicated that a 24-h dietary recall cannot replace a 7-day fluid diary.</p><p>The results of this study have implications in several contexts. The current recommendations on total water intake in Indonesia, but also in the USA defined by the Institute of Medicine, are adequate intakes based solely on median observed intakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The dietary reference values for total water intake set by the European Food Safety Authority are also adequate intakes based on observed intakes, although other factors including achievable or desirable urine osmolality were also considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These observed intakes were derived from population surveys in which 24-h recall was used most frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The current results suggest that the observed intakes and consequently also the recommended adequate intakes of total water might be underestimated. Additionally, the outcomes of an evaluation of adequacy of total water intake might differ substantially depending on the instrument used, as shown by the results of the cross-classification. The 24-h dietary recall indicated that 24&#x000a0;% of the subjects did not reach 75&#x000a0;% of the water recommendation, whereas the 7-day fluid record estimated this proportion to be 17&#x000a0;%. The implication of this different adequacy evaluation depends on the fluid type involved. In the case of water intake, a 24-h dietary recall might overestimate the number of individuals at risk for a negative health impact associated with a low water intake (e.g., chronic kidney disease, or new-onset hyperglycemia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This, however, does not necessarily have negative consequences; an individual with a low water intake will be recommended to drink more, preferably water, and this has been shown to be beneficial for health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In the case of other beverages such as soft drinks, a 24-h recall may overestimate the number of individuals with a low consumption or underestimate the number of individuals with a high consumption. Consequently, the size of the risks associated with an excessive soft drink consumption such as weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], development of metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], or other health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] may be underestimated by surveys using 24-h recalls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>When compared with a 7-day fluid record, a 24-h dietary recall significantly underestimated TFI with the difference between TFI assessed with these two instruments increased with increasing mean TFI. Both instruments showed disagreement in 23&#x000a0;% of the study population on the classification of the adequacy of their water intake. These results suggest that the evaluation of the public health risk associated with inadequate or over consumption of different types of fluids based on 24-h recall data may not be accurate, and that the adequate intake for total water (currently based on 24-h intakes) may require revision in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>This article is part of a supplement supported by Danone Nutricia Research.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors thank all the subjects for their participation and the Nutrition Department, Faculty of Medicine, Universitas Indonesia, for the study conduct.</p><sec id="d30e1717"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>I.G. and R.M. are employees of Danone Research.
