INTRODUCTION</title><p>Since the 1990s, a 6-month course of adjuvant chemotherapy has been the standard of care for patients with resected high-risk stage <sc>ii</sc> or <sc>iii</sc> colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-co15-6-262">1</xref>. Despite recent advances in adjuvant therapy, a substantial proportion of such patients still experience disease relapse and premature death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-co15-6-262">2</xref>. Recently published observational data suggest that physical activity (<sc>pa</sc>) is associated with a reduced risk of disease relapse and premature death in these colon cancer survivors.</p><p>In 2006, Meyerhardt <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-co15-6-262">3</xref> reported results of a prospective observational study of 832 patients with stage <sc>iii</sc> colon cancer enrolled in a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial and followed for a median of 3.8 years from trial entry. In that trial, <sc>pa</sc> was self-reported approximately 6 months after completion of chemotherapy and was quantified as weekly metabolic equivalent task (<sc>met</sc>)&#x02013;hours (for example, walking briskly is approximately 4.0 <sc>met</sc>s). Categories of <sc>pa</sc> were predefined in terms of these <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours: fewer than 3 (referent), 3&#x02013;8.9, 9&#x02013;17.9, 18&#x02013;26.9, and more than 27. Analyses adjusted for known prognostic factors, including body mass index (<sc>bmi</sc>), indicated that higher levels of <sc>pa</sc> were associated with superior disease-free (<sc>dfs</sc>), recurrence-free, and overall survival. The 3-year <sc>dfs</sc> was 75.1% in patients who exercised for fewer than 18 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly as compared with 84.5% in patients who exercised for more than 18 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly [hazard ratio (<sc>hr</sc>): 0.57; 95% confidence interval (<sc>ci</sc>): 0.39 to 0.85].</p><p>In a second article, Meyerhardt <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-co15-6-262">4</xref> reported results of a prospective observational study of 573 women from the Nurses&#x02019; Health Study diagnosed with stages <sc>i</sc>&#x02013;<sc>iii</sc> colorectal cancer. Self-reported leisure-time <sc>pa</sc> before diagnosis and 1&#x02013;4 years post-diagnosis was assessed, and analyses were again adjusted for known prognostic factors, including <sc>bmi</sc>. An inverse relationship was observed between the amount of <sc>pa</sc> post-diagnosis and the risk of both colorectal cancer&#x02013;specific and overall mortality. Specifically, as compared with women exercising for fewer than 3 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly, the risk of colorectal cancer&#x02013;specific mortality declined in successive groups performing more exercise: the <sc>hr</sc> was 0.92 (95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.50 to 1.69) in the 3&#x02013;8.9 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly group, 0.57 (95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.27 to 1.20) in the 9&#x02013;17.9 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly group, and 0.39 (95% <sc>ci</sc>: 0.18 to 0.82) in the more than 18 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly group. Risk of overall mortality was similarly reduced. Furthermore, change in <sc>pa</sc> from pre- to post-diagnosis was also predictive of outcome. Compared with women who did not change their <sc>pa</sc>, women who increased their <sc>pa</sc> by at least 1 predefined <sc>met</sc> category&#x02014;for example, from fewer than 3 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours to 3&#x02013;8.9 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours&#x02014;between their pre-diagnostic and post-treatment assessments experienced improved outcomes; women whose exercise levels decreased by at least 1 predefined <sc>met</sc> category had poorer outcomes. Further analysis of these data suggested that no additional benefit accrued with an increase in <sc>pa</sc> post-diagnosis in women who were already achieving at least 9 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly before diagnosis (that is, those who were roughly already meeting current public health guidelines).</p><p>Several plausible biologic mechanisms could account for an association between <sc>pa</sc> and colon cancer outcomes, including metabolic consequences of obesity; decreased gastrointestinal transit time; decreased levels of insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and pros-taglandin ratios; lowered bile acid secretion; and altered gut flora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-co15-6-262">5</xref>. Moreover, there is evidence that colon cancer survivors experience significant declines in <sc>pa</sc> during adjuvant therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-co15-6-262">6</xref> and that they report among the lowest <sc>pa</sc> participation rates of any cancer survivor group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-co15-6-262">7</xref>, suggesting that, in the current <sc>pa</sc> levels of colon cancer survivors, there is considerable room for improvement from a public health perspective. Finally, progress has been made in the science of health behaviour change over the past decade demonstrating that <sc>pa</sc> can, indeed, be increased substantially and maintained over extended periods of time with an appropriate behavioural support program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-co15-6-262">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-co15-6-262">10</xref>. Together, these observations suggest that interventions to increase <sc>pa</sc> in colon cancer survivors may improve disease outcomes, that associated correlative biologic studies may provide insights into the mechanisms of colon cancer pathogenesis, and that sufficient understanding exists to implement an effective intervention.</p><p>Despite the highly suggestive observational findings, a randomized controlled trial (<sc>rct</sc>) is needed to establish unequivocally the causal nature of this association and to inform policies for health care delivery. The primary objective of the Colon Health and LifeLong Exercise Change (<sc>challenge</sc>) trial <sc>co</sc>.21 being undertaken by the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (<sc>ncic ctg</sc>) is to determine the effects of a 3-year structured <sc>pa</sc> intervention on <sc>dfs</sc> in survivors of high-risk stage <sc>ii</sc> or <sc>iii</sc> colon cancer who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy in the preceding 2&#x02013;6 months and who are insufficiently active.

METHODS</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>2.1 Study Design and Participants</title><p>We will be conducting a multinational, multicentre, phase <sc>iii</sc> trial with randomization to a <sc>pa</sc> intervention versus general health education materials. This study will be led by the <sc>ncic ctg</sc> and will include collaboration with the Australasian Gastro-Intestinal Trials Group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-co15-6-262">Figure 1</xref> presents the anticipated flow of participants through the trial. Medically-fit survivors of high-risk stage <sc>ii</sc> or <sc>iii</sc> colon cancer who have received their last dose of adjuvant chemotherapy within the preceding 60&#x02013;180 days will be recruited. This group has been identified as being at high risk for disease recurrence or death, being most likely to adhere to the intervention, and being individuals for whom the <sc>pa</sc> intervention is safe. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tI-co15-6-262">Table I</xref> details the eligibility criteria.</p><p>Pre-registration evaluations will focus on current <sc>pa</sc> involvement and medical eligibility for study participation. Patients who are already meeting current public health guidelines for <sc>pa</sc> (150 minutes or more of moderate-to-vigorous or 75 minutes or more of vigorous <sc>pa</sc> weekly), as estimated for the month before registration using the Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, will be ineligible. Consenting patients will be registered and will then undergo submaximal exercise testing to ensure that they are able to exercise safely at a moderate-to-vigorous intensity. Provided that 2 stages of the treadmill test are completed with acceptable heart rate and blood pressure responses, patients will then complete the remaining baseline investigations, including a physical functioning test, anthropometric testing, blood collection for correlative studies, <sc>pro</sc>s, <sc>pa</sc> behaviour and determinants, health utility, and a health economics work productivity and activity impairment questionnaire (<sc>wpai</sc>). Patients will then be stratified by centre, disease stage (high-risk <sc>ii</sc> vs. <sc>iii</sc>), <sc>bmi</sc> (&#x02264;27.5 vs. &#x0003e;27.5), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs. 1), and will be randomized to receive the <sc>pa</sc> intervention program (intervention arm) or general health education materials (comparison arm).</p></sec><sec><title>2.2 Physical Activity Intervention</title><p>Participants in both arms will be provided with general health education materials including information about nutrition and <sc>pa</sc>. Participants in both groups will also receive follow-up care at the participating cancer centre, including regular physician visits, imaging, blood work, and colonoscopy. Participants assigned to the <sc>pa</sc> intervention will receive a structured 3-year <sc>pa</sc> program delivered by a local <sc>pa</sc> consultant (<sc>pac</sc>). The goal for the <sc>pa</sc> intervention group is to increase recreational <sc>pa</sc> from baseline by at least 10 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly to a maximum of 27 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly. The 10 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly is roughly equivalent to the current public health guidelines of about 2.5 hours (for example, 5 days of 30 minutes daily) of moderate-intensity <sc>pa</sc> weekly, such as brisk walking (4 <sc>met</sc>s), or 1.25 hours (for example, 3 days of 25 minutes daily) of vigorous-intensity <sc>pa</sc> weekly such as jogging (8 <sc>met</sc>s). At the end of 6 months, a decision to encourage participants to increase <sc>pa</sc> by more than 10 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly will be determined and will depend on their adaptation to the initial goal of an increase of 10 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly. Patients will not be encouraged to increase their <sc>pa</sc> beyond 27 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly, which is equivalent to about 1 hour daily of brisk walking for 7 days each week or 1 hour daily of jogging for 3.5 days each week.</p><p>Achieving an increase in <sc>pa</sc> from baseline of at least 10 <sc>met</sc>&#x02013;hours weekly will require a significant amount of behaviour support. Participants in the intervention arm will therefore receive an intensive behaviour support program based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-co15-6-262">11</xref> and modelled after the successful behavioural change program in the Diabetes Prevention Program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-co15-6-262">10</xref> and the Look <sc>ahead</sc> trial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-co15-6-262">8</xref>. The <sc>pa</sc> intervention will be delivered in 3 distinct phases and will consist of behaviour support sessions and supervised <sc>pa</sc> sessions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tII-co15-6-262">Table II</xref>). The intervention will include a personalized <sc>pa</sc> prescription that accounts for the individual&#x02019;s baseline fitness test results, <sc>pa</sc> history, performance status, personal preferences, and individual barriers to activity.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3 Behaviour Support Sessions</title><p>Behaviour support sessions will include training in behavioural strategies to promote the adoption and long-term maintenance of <sc>pa</sc>. Key behavioural strategies will include an emphasis on the unique benefits of <sc>pa</sc> for colon cancer survivors; strategies for making <sc>pa</sc> enjoyable, for overcoming barriers, for securing social support from family and friends, and for identifying environmental opportunities; and time management, self-monitoring, goal setting, planning, stimulus control, and self-reinforcement. At the core of the behavioural intervention will be a <sc>pa</sc> guidebook that will contain topics and materials that the <sc>pac</sc>s can use to reinforce and expand on during counselling sessions. The guidebook, called <italic>Step Up to the Challenge!,</italic> will be distributed to each <sc>pa</sc> intervention participant as an ongoing resource. It is modeled after a guidebook originally developed for breast cancer survivors and has been shown to be effective for increasing motivation, <sc>pa</sc>, and quality of life in breast cancer survivors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-co15-6-262">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-co15-6-262">14</xref>. Throughout all phases of the study, <sc>pac</sc>s are able to provide additional behaviour support sessions if they determine that a patient is experiencing difficulty with adherence.</p><p>Advanced behavioural strategies will be considered for patients who have significant struggles in adopting or maintaining <sc>pa</sc> despite continued support from the <sc>pac</sc>. A behavioural toolbox will assist in overcoming barriers to <sc>pa</sc>, many of which will likely be related to issues of opportunity to perform exercise in the winter. The primary approach will be to have a facility available free of charge year round at each centre. All patients will also be provided with pedometers to motivate them and to help them track their <sc>pa</sc>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4 Supervised Physical Activity Sessions</title><p>In addition to counselling sessions focusing on behaviour support, patients will also receive supervised <sc>pa</sc> sessions. These sessions will be combined with behaviour support sessions and will also occur independently. Their focus will be to teach proper <sc>pa</sc> technique and how to monitor intensity and to progress <sc>pa</sc> safely and effectively. In the first 6 months, these mandatory sessions will be supervised by the <sc>pac</sc>. Thereafter, supervision is strongly recommended. The supervision may be 1:1 with the <sc>pac</sc> or in a group format. Throughout all phases of the study, <sc>pac</sc>s will be able to provide additional supervised <sc>pa</sc> sessions if they determine that a patient is experiencing difficulties with adherence. Patients will be provided free access to a fitness facility at times outside of their supervised <sc>pa</sc> sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5 Primary and Secondary Endpoints</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tIII-co15-6-262">Table III</xref> presents the nature and timing of the study evaluations. The primary endpoint is <sc>dfs</sc>, because available data demonstrate that 3-year <sc>dfs</sc> is highly correlated with overall survival in patients with resected colon cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-co15-6-262">15</xref>. This endpoint is now accepted for registration of trials by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Secondary endpoints will include overall survival, <sc>pro</sc>s assessing quality of life [the Short Form (<sc>sf</sc>-36) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, General subscale], fatigue (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy, Fatigue subscale), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), and anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and objective testing of physical functioning consisting of anthropometric measurements, cardiovascular fitness (submaximal exercise test using the Balke treadmill protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-co15-6-262">16</xref>); and physical functioning (Seniors Fitness Test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-co15-6-262">17</xref>). Adherence to <sc>pa</sc> will be assessed at baseline and every 6&#x02013;12 months by using a slight modification of the Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-co15-6-262">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-co15-6-262">19</xref>. The Past Year Total Physical Activity Questionnaire has been shown to have acceptable reliability and validity for measurement of past-year <sc>pa</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-co15-6-262">19</xref>. Correlative biologic markers will include blood measures of insulin, insulin-like growth factors, and selected cytokines. Finally, an economic evaluation will be performed to assess cost-effectiveness and cost&#x02013;utility of the <sc>pa</sc> intervention. Patient utilities will be measured using the <sc>sf</sc>-6D, which is derived from the <sc>sf</sc>-36 quality-of-life measure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-co15-6-262">20</xref> that has been validated in population surveys and clinical trials settings. Resource utilization and <sc>wpai</sc> will be collected prospectively as part of the economic analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>2.6 Statistical Considerations</title><p>The analysis will be performed using the intent-to-treat principle and is powered to detect a <sc>hr</sc> of 0.75 for <sc>dfs</sc> between patients randomized to two treatment arms. To detect such a <sc>hr</sc> with a power of 80% and a two-tailed alpha of 0.05, we will need to observe 380 events during follow-up. It is anticipated that a total of 962 patients will be randomized over 3 years. To observe 380 events, we assume that the patients in the comparison group will have a 3-year <sc>dfs</sc> of 75% and will not materially change their <sc>pa</sc> behaviour from baseline. It is also assumed that 20% of patients randomized to the intervention group will not adhere to their <sc>pa</sc> program. With these assumptions, it is estimated that, to observe 380 events among 962 patients randomized, 4.7 years of additional follow-up after the last patient is randomized will be required, which leads to an approximate total study duration of 7.7 years. Four interim analyses will be performed: the first analysis will assess the feasibility of accrual principles, the second will assess the feasibility of the <sc>pa</sc> behaviour change, and the final two will assess for unexpectedly large magnitudes of benefit or futility.</p></sec><sec><title>2.7 Trial Management</title><p>The development and oversight of the <sc>co</sc>.21 trial is provided by the Trial Steering Committee, which includes the study chairs and the Design and Conduct Committee members; the coordinators for Quality of Life, Economic Evaluations, and Correlative Sciences committees; and the <sc>ncic ctg</sc> central office physician coordinator, senior biostatistician, and study coordinator. Because of the complexities of delivering a lifestyle intervention and because of the uniqueness of this study, four working groups were established to provide expertise in protocol development and trial implementation in four key areas: <sc>pa</sc>, <sc>pro</sc>s, health economics, and correlative studies. Each of these working groups is chaired by a member of the Trial Steering Committee with expertise in the respective field. A PA Working Group will provide oversight to the <sc>pa</sc> and behaviour support components of the study, including monitoring of adherence. This working group is led by the study chair.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>3. DISCUSSION</title><p>Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in Canadian men and women and the second leading cause of cancer-related death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-co15-6-262">21</xref>. There are more than 110,000 colorectal cancer survivors in Canada. This growing number of survivors has generated interest in behaviour and lifestyle interventions that might further improve disease outcomes and quality of life. In colon cancer, <sc>pa</sc> has been strongly associated with improved disease outcomes, and there are plausible biologic mechanisms for this association. However, the data published to date have been observational. Moreover, few colon cancer survivors currently exercise, partly because of the physical and psychological effects of their disease and treatments, and partly because of the lack of guidance and support from cancer care organizations. However, recent progress in behavioural change suggests that, with appropriate support, such populations can be motivated to adopt long-term lifestyle changes. Consequently, all the necessary evidence, rationale, and justification exist to warrant the conduct of an <sc>rct</sc> of <sc>pa</sc> and disease outcomes in colon cancer survivors.</p><p>Moreover, in the era of molecularly targeted anti-cancer therapy, funding of new and expensive agents is becoming increasingly difficult. Should a <sc>pa</sc> intervention be found to have a significant clinical benefit in colon cancer patients, this type of intervention could be a very cost-effective therapy, with the potential for many other non-cancer-related health benefits. The magnitude of the associations between <sc>pa</sc> and disease outcomes in the observational studies of colon cancer compares favourably with the benefit observed with the use of adjuvant chemotherapy, but would likely involve lower toxicity and cost. Importantly, the cost-effectiveness of this <sc>pa</sc> intervention will be prospectively evaluated as part of this clinical trial, because all interventions are recognized to have a cost component that needs to be considered when evaluating the effectiveness of the intervention to reduce the burden of a disease at a population level.</p><p>Positive findings from the <sc>challenge</sc> trial would support a new and additional paradigm to be tested in patients with other forms of cancer and would enhance interest in applying these results to test strategies for cancer prevention. One of the greatest challenges to implementing <sc>pa</sc> programs in any population has been ensuring adequate support and resources to promote behaviour change with regard to <sc>pa</sc>. Cancer patients are, in general, a sedentary but motivated population. Previous work has suggested good adherence and a willingness to pursue lifestyle modifications following a diagnosis of cancer. If this <sc>rct</sc> is able to demonstrate a significant benefit in <sc>dfs</sc>, that finding would provide an impetus to patients to participate in <sc>pa</sc> and to oncologists and cancer care organizations to promote <sc>pa</sc>. It could also potentially lead to changes in public perception that might influence the policies by which <sc>pa</sc> experts are utilized within the health care system. The <sc>challenge</sc> trial will also have an opportunity to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of potential policy recommendations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>4. CONCLUSIONS</title><p>In various populations, both healthy and with a disease, <sc>pa</sc> has been associated with numerous health benefits. As yet, no conclusive evidence has been found that <sc>pa</sc> will reduce the likelihood of colon cancer recurrence or will extend survival. Our study has the potential to answer this question definitively and will provide valuable insights into this association regardless of the final results of the trial. In addition, the study will obtain robust data about the effect of <sc>pa</sc> on important secondary endpoints in colon cancer survivors including quality of life, fatigue, mood, biologic correlative measures, and cost-effectiveness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>5.
