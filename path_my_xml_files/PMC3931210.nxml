There are three main classes of phytoestrogens: isoflavones, coumestans and lignans. The major dietary sources of these include: Legumes and soybean products (isoflavones); whole grain cereals, fruits, seeds and alcoholic sources (lignans); bean sprouts and fodder crops (coumestans). Isoflavones make up the most common form of phytoestrogens.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Phytoestrogens can act as idealized selective estrogen response modifiers with the desirable properties of being anti-estrogenic in breast and uterine tissue, but being pro-estrogenic in bone and brain and in lipid metabolism.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] A number of cardioprotective benefits have been attributed to dietary isoflavones including a beneficial effect on lipid profile; inhibition of platelet aggregation and an improvement in vascular reactivity; antioxidant action and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion proteins and inducible nitric oxide production.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>In an <italic>in vitro</italic> study, R&#x000fc;fer and Kulling demonstrated the antioxidant efficacy of isoflavones at concentrations within the range found in the plasma of subjects consuming soy products.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Genistein has been shown to inhibit hydrogen peroxide production and increase the activity of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase. Furthermore, genistein and to a lesser degree daidzein, can inhibit superoxide anion generation by xanthine/xanthine oxidase.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] low-density lipoprotein (LDL) exposed to flavonoids demonstrated reduced oxidizability and flavonoids suppressed the formation of lipid peroxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In an <italic>in vivo</italic> study conducted in male Sprague-Dawley rats, Anderson <italic>et al</italic>. studied the effects of a low isoflavone soy protein isolate and a genistein-rich soy protein isolate.

Moreover, there is a lack of such data in postmenopausal women, the group which is most commonly prescribed with isoflavones for the relief of menopausal symptoms. Hence, the present study was planned to evaluate the antioxidant effect of isoflavones in oophorectomized menopausal women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All the women who reported to the obstetrics and gynecology out-patient department of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India were screened for inclusion in the study. They were included in the study if they had undergone bilateral oophorectomy, were less than 55 years of age and were willing to comply with the protocol. They were excluded if any of the following criteria were present: (i) Already on isoflavones (ii) taken hormone replacement therapy/estrogen replacement therapy within previous 8 weeks (iii) presence of renal and/or hepatic disease (iv) active major psychiatric disorders (v) history of thrombophlebitis or thromboembolism or cerebrovascular disorders (vi) uncontrolled hypertension with blood pressure &#x0003e; 180/100 mmHg (vii) uncontrolled diabetes (viii) presence of active infection or malignancy (ix) present or past history of soya or nut related food allergies.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and all the women participating in the study signed a written informed consent prior to enrolment. The study was conducted in accordance with ICMR ethical guidelines for biomedical research on human subjects. Eligible women were randomized and hence that they had an equal probability of assignment to either of the two groups. The randomization code was developed using a random number table to select random permuted blocks of length four. The identity of the drugs was hidden by packing in numbered opaque envelopes to ensure concealment of the sequence until assigned. Randomization, allocation sequence generation and packing of envelopes was done by investigators not directly involved in dispensing and evaluating the treatments so that it was double-blind both the patient and evaluating clinician not aware of the assigned treatment. The participants remained on the same allocation throughout the study period if they continued. The randomization code was revealed to the investigators once recruitment, data collection and laboratory analyses were complete. The participants attended the clinic at the time of randomization (baseline) and at the interval of every 3 week for 12 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study interventions</title><p>The participants were randomized to either placebo or study drug to be administered once a day orally for 12 weeks. The study drug and matching placebo tablet was obtained as a free gift sample from Dr. Reddy's Laboratory, Hyderabad (there was no conflict of interest), which contained 75 mg of soy isoflavones extract standardized to provide isoflavones 40% genistein and genistin 25%; daidzein and daidzin 15%. Placebo tablet matching in color, size, shape and the taste was used as control treatment. Patients were advised to take one tablet daily at bedtime with 150 ml of plain water for a total 12-week period. All the patients were instructed to stop the dietary isoflavones consumption by avoiding soy, seeds and sprouts, beans and legumes during the study period. However, concomitant treatments for other illnesses were allowed. Patients were asked to bring the drug envelopes during subsequent visits and compliance was assessed by pill counting. More than 80% of compliance was considered as an adequate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Samaple collection</title><p>Fasting blood sample was taken for antioxidant parameters before the start of study medications and at the end of 3-month study period.

One of the postulated mechanisms is its antioxidant effect. In this study, isoflavones (75 mg/day) were evaluated for the presence of antioxidant activity by evaluating erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase, SOD, GSH-Px and lipid peroxidation in surgical menopausal women. However, none of the enzyme activities was altered to a significant level with isoflavones compared with placebo group, demonstrating a lack of antioxidant potential of isoflavones under the study conditions.</p><p>Similar findings have been observed in the study by Hsu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] in which the effect of soy isoflavones on erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities was assessed in postmenopausal women. A total of 37 postmenopausal women were included in this 6 month trial and were given 150 mg/day of isoflavone supplements twice daily. At 3 and 6 month measures of erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities did not differ significantly from baseline, thereby concluding that isoflavone supplementation did not appear to have antioxidant activities.
