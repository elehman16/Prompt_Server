This can be attributed to prolonged admission, prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased mortality, and it can have a negative impact on the degree of independence and quality of life. In the NONSEDA trial we randomize critically ill patients to non-sedation or sedation with a daily wake-up trial during mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. It has never been assessed whether non-sedation affects physical function. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of non-sedation versus sedation with a daily wake-up trial on physical function after discharge from intensive care unit.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Investigator-initiated, randomized, clinical, parallel-group, superiority trial, including 700 patients in total, with a substudy concerning 200 of these patients. Inclusion criteria will be intubated, mechanically ventilated patients with expected duration of mechanical ventilation &#x0003e;24&#x000a0;h. Exclusion criteria will be patients with severe head trauma, coma at admission or status epilepticus, patients treated with therapeutic hypothermia, patients with PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;9 where sedation might be necessary to ensure sufficient oxygenation or placing the patient in a prone position. The experimental intervention will be non-sedation supplemented with pain management during mechanical ventilation. The control intervention will be sedation with a daily wake-up trial. The co-primary outcome will be quality of life regarding physical function (SF-36, physical component) and degree of independence in activities of daily living (Barthel Index), and this will be assessed for all 700 patients participating in the NONSEDA trial. The secondary outcomes, which will be assessed for the subpopulation of 200 NONSEDA patients in the trial site, Kolding, will be 6-min walking distance, handgrip strength, muscle size (ultrasonographic measurement of the rectus femoris muscle cross-sectional area) and biomechanical data on lower extremity function (maximal voluntary contraction, rate of force development and endurance).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first to investigate the effect of no sedation during critical illness on physical function.

The rectus femoris muscle is part of the quadriceps muscle. Patients will be placed in supine position with their back raised to 45 degrees, with their legs in passive extension. The transducer will be placed over the rectus femoris muscle, perpendicular to the long axis of the right thigh, not depressing the dermal surface. Measurements will be made at 2/3 of the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the superior patellar border. This distance will be defined when the patient is placed as noted above, not with the patient standing up, since this changes the distance. For the scan, a linear transducer will be used, flat footprint, 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;MHz. The muscle is identified visually and an ultrasonographic picture is taken. Using the ultrasonographic software, the outer edge of the muscle is marked, and the cross-sectional area is calculated using planimetry</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_856_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig><fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Study setup for biomechanical measurements of the lower limbs. <italic>1</italic>: Custom-made chair, where the participant will be seated, back straight, with 90 degree flexion in the hip, 90 degree flexion in the knee, to ensure that the lower leg is in a vertical position.

This protocol describes a substudy concerning physical function (quality of life regarding physical function, walking ability, ability to perform everyday tasks, biomechanical data and muscle size) and will be based on these 200 patients.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patient population</title><p>In Denmark approximately 30,000 patients (2-3&#x000a0;% of all hospital patients) are admitted to ICUs every year. In 2011 mortality during the ICU stay was 12.7&#x000a0;% and 30-day mortality 21.2&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. An intensive care admission can have substantial consequences for patients, and studies show that ICU survivors have a decreased quality of life and increased mortality for years after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Current care and treatment</title><p>Muscle wasting and ICU-acquired weakness is frequently encountered in the ICU, affecting up to 25&#x000a0;% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation for more than a week and more than half of the patients suffering from severe sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Muscle mass reduces rapidly, with severely septic patients losing 15-20&#x000a0;% within the first week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is a condition with high costs for both the patient and the healthcare system, since it is associated with increased length of stay in the ICU and hospital, prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased in-hospital mortality, and it affected the quality of life for months or even years after discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Since the dawn of ventilator therapy, it has been standard care to sedate the patients continuously. The first ventilators were rather primitive and very uncomfortable for the patients, making the sedation practice necessary. As ventilators have become increasingly advanced, and now allow for high patient-ventilator interaction and relative comfort, the focus has been on a lighter level of sedation. Numerous trials have documented beneficial effects of less sedation, namely shorter duration of mechanical ventilation, lower morbidity and shorter length of stay in the ICU and hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Ali and colleagues have demonstrated an association between the time patients spend in coma and muscle wasting and ICU-acquired weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Schweikert and colleagues carried out a randomized, clinical trial of sedation interruptions combined with early physiotherapy for mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Their intervention group had more ventilator-free days and a better functional outcome at hospital discharge. Several trials have demonstrated that it is both feasible and safe to mobilize mechanically ventilated ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>It is appealing to speculate that less sedation will lead to more alert and thereby more physically active patients, who can be mobilized to a larger extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, it has not been established whether physical function following ICU discharge is affected by non-sedation versus the standard care of sedation with a daily wake-up trail.</p><p>In the NONSEDA trial protocol we did at systematic literature search, which established that, for the present (October 2014), only one randomized clinical trial on the effect of non-sedation versus sedation with a daily wake-up trial has been published, namely the aforementioned trial from Odense University Hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

The NONSEDA trial is an investigator-initiated, randomized, clinical, parallel-group, multinational, superiority trial designed to include 700 patients from at least six intensive care units in Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Two hundred of the 700 patients will be included, treated and followed up in the ICU in Kolding.

If the patient arrives intubated from another ICU, the patient will be randomized within the first 24&#x000a0;h after arrival. The randomization will be carried out centrally by the Copenhagen Trial Unit according to a computer-generated allocation sequence with a variable block size, kept concealed from the investigators at the clinical sites. The allocation sequence will be stratified by center, age (up to 65&#x000a0;years or older) and shock at admission (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;70&#x000a0;mmHg or above). The 200 patients for this substudy will be all the patients included in the Kolding trail site. Since we will stratify for center, we will obtain an equal distribution of the patients. The randomization system will be Internet based with 24&#x000a0;h access a day, 7&#x000a0;days a week. The participant allocation will be carried out by an investigator who logs in to the CTU&#x02019;s Online Randomization System using a personal ID and PIN code. Then the investigator will type in all relevant information about the participant, and the participant will be subsequently allocated to either the &#x02018;non-sedation group&#x02019; or the &#x02018;sedation group.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Blinding</title><p>Due to the nature of the trial interventions, it will not be possible to blind the investigators at clinical trial sites, the participants or the participants&#x02019; relatives.

If not otherwise stated, data originate from medical records included in the Critical Information System (CIS) or other electronic patient files.</p><p>The SF 36v2 questionnaire and the Barthel Index will be sent to the participant, who will fill it out at home and bring it to the follow-up. If a participant has not filled out the questionnaire before the follow-up, the participant will be asked to complete the questionnaire at follow-up. They will be seated in privacy in a calm place, with sufficient time to fill out both questionnaires (at least 30&#x000a0;min).</p><p>In an effort to minimize missing data as much as possible, both the SF-36v2 and Barthel Index can be performed as a telephone interview. Telephone interviews are a last resort, and every effort will be made to ensure that as many patients as at all possible fill out the questionnaires themselves. SF-36 can only be carried out as an interview with the participant in person, since it concerns the person&#x02019;s self-perceived quality of life. The Barthel Index is preferably performed as an interview with the participant in person, but if no other option exists, it can be carried out with a proxy instead. Therefore, if a participant for some reason is unable to participate in the follow-up and unable to fill out the questionnaire, a telephone interview will be performed. It is estimated that a telephone interview will take approximately 20&#x000a0;min.</p><p>Measurements of muscle size and biomechanical data will be obtained by investigator HKJ and a trial nurse. If the participant is not able to come to the hospital for follow-up, we will ask if we can come to their home to do the follow-up. The 6-min walk test can be performed on an outdoor, marked 30-m trail at the participant&#x02019;s home if they are able to walk. Ultrasonographic measurements of muscle size can likewise be performed at the participant&#x02019;s home. Biomechanical data can only be collected in the hospital because the equipment is very difficult to move.</p><p>Before contacting any patient after discharge, we will check with national central person registrations to assure that the patient is not deceased. In summary, the process for establishing the follow-up will be as follows: Approximately 14&#x000a0;days prior to the 3-month follow-up we will send a letter to the patient, containing the invitation to the follow-up and the questionnaires to be filled out (SF-36 and Barthel Index). If the patient does not respond within 10&#x000a0;days, we will phone the patient. We will first repeat the invitation to participate in the follow-up and clarify any misunderstandings concerning payment for transportation or the like. If the patient declines to come to the hospital, we will offer to come to the patient&#x02019;s home and do the follow-up there (6-min walk test and muscle size). If the patient declines this, we will ask if we can perform the SF-36 and Barthel Index over the telephone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Data management</title><p>An electronic Case Record Form (eCRF) for the NONSEDA trial in Open Clinica is developed in cooperation between the coordinating investigator and a data manager at Copenhagen Trial Unit.

Having non-sedated patients on the ventilator seems to increase the amount of physical activity not only during formal physiotherapy sessions, but also for the rest of the days, where the patient is able to move around in a bed or chair to a greater extent. Whether this plays a role in the physical status after discharge is unknown.</p><p>Since this trial is a part of a larger trial, where sedation with a daily wake-up call versus non-sedation is the intervention, there is no separate intervention concerning physical function. Since it is obvious to speculate that the non-sedated patients will be mobilized to a larger extent, we will quantify the degree of physical activity every day, both active (e.g., standing on the floor, bed-biking) and passive (e.g., passive movements of the limbs by the physiotherapist). However, all the small movements a non-sedated patient might make during the day cannot be quantified. Taking other possible confounders into concern, e.g., blood sugar, use of neuromuscular blocking agents or steroids, this might be part of the explanation if non-sedated patients prove to have a better physical status. These factors will also be quantified.</p><p>ICU survivors are a group of mainly elderly patients with a high degree of comorbidity. This complicates the follow-up investigation, since some patients will be too weak to participate. As secondary and exploratory outcomes, we try to obtain data on physical function already at the time of extubation and at ICU discharge. This might prove to be futile, since patients at these time points are far from recovered. With two pilot patients we attempted to obtain biomechanical data on lower limb function at ICU discharge, but we had to realize that the patients at this time point are not in a condition where this is possible. In an attempt to obtain early data that are not depending on patient cooperation, we measure the muscle size of the rectus femoris muscle and thereby quantify the amount of muscle wasting in the two groups. What could complicate these measurements is the degree of edema, which ICU patients (especially septic patients) are prone to. It does seem reasonable to assume that the degree of edema will be equal between the two groups at the time of inclusion and at the time of extubation and discharge. We are also aware that the mere size of a muscle does not in itself translate to function, and muscle size must be regarded as a surrogate parameter.</p><p>Poulsen and colleagues in 2013 published results on biomechanical function in ICU survivors (males, aged 50&#x02013;75 years, 12&#x000a0;months after ICU discharge) compared to healthy, age- and sex-matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Their study is the first to provide data on biomechanical data in ICU survivors and, to the best of our knowledge, still the only one. Our setup is in many respects similar to theirs, hopefully providing the basis for comparisons. Among others, Poulsen et al. found that especially the rate of force development was negatively affected in ICU survivors. The rate of force development is known to be an important factor in activities of daily living since it is crucial for postural stability. The rate of force development can be improved with specific training programs. Should our study support this finding or reveal other characteristics of muscles recovering after critical illness, it could provide further basis for targeted physiotherapy interventions.</p><p>&#x0003e;The validity of this trial is affected by the fact that it is not blinded, but blinding is not possible with this intervention. We find that the very realistic clinical context the trial is set in&#x02014;broad inclusion criteria, mixed ICU and numerous caregivers&#x02014;increases its generalizability and external validity.</p><p>We find that the use of sedatives for critically ill patients is still affected by tradition and habits, and it varies from department to department. With the NONSEDA trial we hope to shed light on the possible benefits or harms of being non-sedated. Non-sedation is a complex intervention and has numerous possible consequences, and all of these deserve to be clarified in order to obtain a nuanced picture of whether non-sedation is the way forward. One of these possible consequences is the effect on physical function.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is now actively recruiting patients.
