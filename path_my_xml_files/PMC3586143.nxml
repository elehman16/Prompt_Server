Participants and Intervention: Study A: 18 healthy male subjects aged 21&#x02013;44 years were randomized to receive each of the following two regimens, separated by a &#x02265;6-week washout period: (i) oral rifampicin 600mg/day on days 1&#x02013;31 with a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 10; and (ii) a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 1. Study B: 16 healthy male subjects aged 20&#x02013;44 years were randomized to receive each of the following two regimens, separated by a 3-month washout period: (i) oral itraconazole 200mg/day on days 1&#x02013;24 with a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 4; and (ii) a single oral dose of vandetanib 300mg on day 1.</p><p><bold>Main Outcome Measure:</bold> Blood samples for measurement of vandetanib (both studies) concentrations and its metabolites, N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide (Study A only), were collected before and at various timepoints after vandetanib administration for up to 28 days (Study A) and 37 days (Study B). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using noncompartmental methods. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 504 hours (AUC<sub>504</sub>) and maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of vandetanib were compared in the presence and absence of rifampicin, and in the presence and absence of itraconazole.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Study A: coadministration of vandetanib with rifampicin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in AUC<sub>504</sub> (geometric least square [GLS]mean ratio [vandetanib + rifampicin/vandetanib alone] 0.60; 90% CI 0.58, 0.63). There was no significant difference in C<sub>max</sub> of vandetanib (GLSmean ratio 1.03; 90% CI 0.95, 1.11). AUC<sub>504</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> of N-desmethylvandetanib increased by 266.0% and 414.3%, respectively, in the presence of rifampicin compared with vandetanib alone. Exposure to vandetanib N-oxide was very low compared with that of vandetanib, but was increased in the presence of rifampicin. Study B: coadministration of vandetanib with itraconazole resulted in a significant increase in AUC<sub>504</sub> (GLSmean ratio [vandetanib + itraconazole/vandetanib alone] 1.09; 90% CI 1.01, 1.18) and no significant change in C<sub>max</sub> (GLSmean ratio 0.96; 90% CI 0.83, 1.11). Vandetanib was well tolerated in both studies.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Exposure to vandetanib, as assessed byAUC<sub>504</sub> in healthy subjects, was reduced by around 40% when a single dose was given in combination with the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. Because of this, it may be appropriate to avoid coadministration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with vandetanib. Vandetanib exposure was increased by about 9% when it was taken in combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole. It is unlikely that coadministration of vandetanib and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors will need to be contraindicated.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Adis Data Information BV 2011</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Vandetanib (ZD6474) is a novel, orally available inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and rearranged during transfection (RET) tyrosine kinase activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] VEGFR-2, EGFR, and RET are involved in signaling pathways promoting angiogenesis and tumor growth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] Vandetanib is in development as an anti-tumor drug in several tumor types, including medullary thyroid cancer.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] Data have recently been reported from three double-blind, randomized, phase III studies of vandetanib in patients with advanced, previously-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] In the ZODIAC (Zactima&#x02122; in cOmbination with Docetaxel In non-small cell lung Cancer) study, vandetanib in combination with docetaxel produced a significant improvement in progression-free survival compared with docetaxel alone (p &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] Results from the ZEAL (Zactima&#x02122; Efficacy with Alimta&#x000ae; in Lung cancer)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and ZEST (Zactima&#x02122; Efficacy when Studied versus Tarceva&#x000ae;)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] studies demonstrated activity in NSCLC for the combination of vandetanib with pemetrexed,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and for monotherapy with vandetanib.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the main CYP enzyme involved in the metabolism of vandetanib.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] Vandetanib is converted by CYP3A4 to N-desmethylvandetanib and by flavine-containing mono-oxygenases in the kidney (FMO1) and liver (FMO3) to vandetanib N-oxide. A recent study in healthy male subjects using radiolabelled vandetanib confirmed the presence of N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide in plasma, urine, and feces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] Both N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide have shown <italic>in vitro</italic> pharmacologic activity in cellular assays for vascular endothelial growth factor and epidermal growth factor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] N-desmethylvandetanib is of similar potency to vandetanib, while vandetanib N-oxide is &#x0003e;50-fold less active than vandetanib. Since vandetanib is metabolized by CYP3A4, it was considered important to determine whether induction or inhibition of this enzyme would influence exposure to vandetanib. Oncology patients are likely to take a range of other drugs in addition to their therapy for cancer, possibly including agents that induce or inhibit metabolic enzymes. Significant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions could lead to alterations in plasma concentrations of vandetanib, potentially resulting in a reduction in efficacy or an increase in drug-related toxicity.</p><p>This article reports the results of two studies investigating potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions between vandetanib and rifampicin, a potent CYP3A4 inducer (Study A; AstraZeneca study code D4200C00026), and vandetanib and itraconazole, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor (Study B; D4200C00015). Further objectives included determining the effects of rifampicin on the pharmacokinetics of the vandetanib metabolites N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide (Study A only), and confirming the safety and tolerability of vandetanib (both studies).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Subjects</title><p>Both studies recruited healthy male subjects aged 21&#x02013;50 years (Study A) or 21&#x02013;45 years (Study B) with no clinically significant medical history or clinically important abnormalities in vital signs, ECG, or clinical chemistry, hematology, or urinalysis results, and who had not received any recent treatment with CYP inhibitors or inducers.</p><p>The studies were performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, which are consistent with the International Conference on Harmonisation and Good Clinical Practice.

In Study A, samples were then collected at 24-hour intervals up to 10 days post-dose, at 48-hour intervals up to 18 days post-dose, and at 21 and 28 days after the dose. In Study B, samples were collected at 24-hour intervals up to 14 days post-dose, at 48-hour intervals up to 22 days post-dose, and at 25, 32, and 37 days after the dose.</p><p>In Study A, during the rifampicin treatment period, blood samples for the determination of rifampicin in plasma were collected at 2 hours after the dose of rifampicin on days 1, 5, 10, 20, and 31. In Study B, during the itraconazole treatment period, blood samples for the determination of itraconazole and hydroxy-itraconazole in plasma were collected before dosing with vandetanib and at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours post-dose, at 48-hour intervals up to 22 days post-dose, and at 25 and 37 days after the dose. These samples were taken to confirm exposure to the CYP3A4 inducer or inhibitor.</p><p>All blood samples were centrifuged within 30 minutes of collection and the plasma stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C. In Study A, plasma samples were analyzed for vandetanib and its metabolites by Eurofins Medinet, the Netherlands, and for rifampicin by Pharma Bio-Research Group, the Netherlands. In Study B, plasma samples were analyzed for vandetanib and itraconazole by BAS Analytics, UK, and for hydroxy-itraconazole by MDS Pharma Services, UK. The method used for analysis of vandetanib and its metabolites was protein precipitation extraction followed by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). &#x02018;Solvent first&#x02019; methodology, using Isolute&#x000ae; PPT+ protein precipitation plates (Biotage, Sweden), was used to remove proteins from the plasma sample. A total of 0.3 mL acetonitrile, internal standard, and 0.1 mL sample were applied sequentially onto the PPT+ plates. After homogenization, filtration was performed under a vacuum and the filtrate was transferred to a clean tube. After evaporation to dryness at 40&#x000b0;C under a stream of nitrogen, the dry residue was reconstituted in 100 &#x003bc;L of mobile phase (acetonitrile : water-ammonium acetate 8 : 2). Aliquots of 10 &#x003bc;L were injected onto an HPLC system comprising an Inertsil ODS-3 150 &#x000d7; 4.6 mm C18 column (GL Sciences Inc., USA), a 4 &#x000d7; 2 mm C18 guard column, and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Detection was performed using a PE Sciex triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with heated nebulizer source. Vandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide were detected by positive ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with mass settings of 475&#x02192;112 and 491&#x02192;128. The mass settings for the internal standard, <sup>13</sup>C&#x02013;D<sub>3</sub>-vandetanib, were 479&#x02192;116. N-desmethylvandetanib was detected by MRM with mass settings of 461&#x02192;98 and a mass setting for the internal standard (AZ10031527) of 418&#x02192;98. The peak areas of vandetanib and its metabolites relative to the internal standard were calculated and the concentration was determined by reference to the relevant calibration curve. The lower limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for vandetanib, and 1 ng/mL for N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide. For vandetanib, mean accuracy was 105&#x02013;110% and precision was 6.6&#x02013;7.4%. For N-desmethylvandetanib, mean accuracy was 99.5&#x02013;104% and precision was 6.3&#x02013;12.3%.

These studies were considered necessary because CYP3A4 is known to be involved in the metabolism of vandetanib, and any pharmacokinetic interactions with agents that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 may have clinical implications. In both studies, two single doses of vandetanib 300 mg were given to healthy subjects. Once daily dosing with vandetanib at 300 mg was well tolerated by patients with advanced solid tumors in previous phase I studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] Single doses of vandetanib were used in the pharmacokinetic studies reported here because it was not considered possible to conduct multiple dose studies in healthy subjects due to safety and tolerability issues. However, multiple-dose pharmacokinetics can be accurately predicted by single-dose pharmacokinetics for vandetanib. AUC<sub>504</sub> and C<sub>max</sub> were selected as primary pharmacokinetic parameters for both studies. It was important to measure the AUC over a long time period because vandetanib is known to have a t<sub>1/2</sub> of around 10 days but the maximum number of doses of rifampicin and itraconazole that could be given to healthy subjects also had to be considered. Therefore, rifampicin was given for 10 days and itraconazole for 4 days before vandetanib was dosed. This allowed the maximal induction and inhibition effects of the agents to be achieved before vandetanib was administered. After vandetanib administration, rifampicin and itraconazole were continued for a further 20 days (approximately two vandetanib half-lives) so that the induction and inhibition effects were maintained over a sustained period during which the vandetanib pharmacokinetics were characterized. Plasma concentrations of vandetanib were below the level of quantification in all samples that were collected pre-dose, confirming that the washout periods between treatment arms were of sufficient length. Plasma concentrations of the metabolites of vandetanib were not measured in the CYP3A4 inhibition study because our understanding of the metabolism of vandetanib was incomplete when this study was planned. By the time the CYP3A4 induction study was initiated, the two main metabolites of vandetanib, N-desmethylvandetanib and vandetanib N-oxide, had been identified and it was considered important to investigate potential changes in the plasma levels of the metabolites together with the parent compound.</p><p>In both studies, vandetanib was absorbed slowly, reaching C<sub>max</sub> at a median time of 5&#x02013;6 hours after administration to healthy subjects. Exposure to vandetanib following a single 300 mg dose, assessed by AUC<sub>504</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>, was similar across the two studies. Plasma concentrations declined slowly with a biphasic disposition and a t<sub>1/2</sub> of about 9 days (216 hours). These results are consistent with those obtained previously in healthy subjects.</p><p>In Study A, CYP3A4 was induced by administration of rifampicin 600 mg/day for 10 days before dosing with vandetanib.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] This regimen has been shown to achieve maximal CYP3A4 induction within about 1 week[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and has been used in previous drug-drug interaction studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] It was noted that one subject had a significantly low plasma concentration of rifampicin on the day that vandetanib was administered compared with rifampicin concentrations measured before and in the days after vandetanib administration. However, this subject had adequate levels of rifampicin on all other occasions when it was measured, and there was no evidence to suggest that he had not taken the study medication. Therefore, data from this subject were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. In all subjects, rifampicin dosing was continued for a further 21 days after administration of vandetanib to ensure that enzyme induction was maintained throughout the pharmacokinetic sampling period. Although the plasma half-life of rifampicin is short (2&#x02013;5 hours), and it is cleared from the body within about 24 hours of dosing, rifampicin may continue to exert an induction effect for up to 3 weeks after the last dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] A washout period of at least 6 weeks was used in this study to ensure that the effects of rifampicin had been dispersed before crossover to the alternative treatment.</p><p>When vandetanib was administered in combination with rifampicin, vandetanib exposure, as assessed by AUC<sub>504</sub>, was significantly reduced by 40%. The C<sub>max</sub> of vandetanib was unchanged by rifampicin, and the AUC of vandetanib in the presence and absence of rifampicin showed little difference for the first 24&#x02013;48 hours post-dose. These observations indicate that the bioavailability of vandetanib was unaltered by CYP3A4 induction. Thus, the reduced AUC<sub>504</sub> appeared to be due to increased metabolic clearance of vandetanib. Consequently, the vandetanib t<sub>1/2</sub> was reduced during administration of vandetanib in combination with rifampicin.</p><p>The AUC<sub>504</sub> of N-desmethylvandetanib was increased by 266.0% in the presence of rifampicin, consistent with CYP3A4 induction. AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub> of N-desmethylvandetanib was not calculated for the majority of subjects as the accuracy of the estimate was limited by the amount of extrapolation that was required. Exposure to the metabolite relative to the parent drug, as assessed using AUC<sub>504</sub> levels, increased from approximately 7% to 43% during coadministration of vandetanib with rifampicin, indicating that metabolism by this route was increased. Plasma concentrations of vandetanib N-oxide were very low, and comparison of exposure to this metabolite compared with that of the parent drug by measurement of AUC was not possible. Based on C<sub>max</sub>, it appeared that exposure to vandetanib N-oxide was increased by around 179% following vandetanib dosing in combination with rifampicin compared with vandetanib alone. However, it should be noted that the change in absolute plasma levels of vandetanib N-oxide was small, and did not result in an obvious change in exposure relative to the parent drug (1.8% vs 2.0%). Overall, the results of this study are consistent with <italic>in vitro</italic> data, which indicate that vandetanib is a CYP3A4 substrate.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] It is anticipated that coadministration of vandetanib with a potent CYP3A4 inducer could result in reduced steady-state exposure to vandetanib. Although reduced exposure to vandetanib has the potential to reduce its efficacy, a clear relationship between exposure and clinical effect has not been defined for vandetanib. Since N-desmethylvandetanib is of similar potency to vandetanib, increased exposure to the metabolite may compensate to some extent for reduced exposure to the parent compound.</p><p>In Study B, CYP3A4 was inhibited by administration of itraconazole 200 mg/day for 4 days before dosing with vandetanib. This itraconazole regimen is commonly used in drug-drug interaction studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] Based on the t<sub>1/2</sub> of itraconazole (&#x02248;36 hours at steady state), it has been predicted that its CYP3A4 inhibitory effect continues for about 2 weeks after the last dose.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] Thus, the extended washout period used in this study (3 months) was considered adequate to dissipate the action of itraconazole. Coadministration with itraconazole resulted in a small, statistically significant increase (9%) in exposure to vandetanib as assessed by AUC<sub>504</sub>, probably due to reduced metabolic clearance consistent with CYP3A4 inhibition. There was no evidence of an effect on C<sub>max</sub> or t<sub>max</sub>. The vandetanib t<sub>1/2</sub> increased slightly when vandetanib was administered in combination with itraconazole. These minor pharmacokinetic changes are not considered to be clinically relevant. The results of this study indicate that coadministration of vandetanib with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor is unlikely to have a clinically relevant effect on steady-state exposure to vandetanib and would not require contraindication or dosage adjustment.</p><p>In these studies, single doses of vandetanib 300 mg were well tolerated by healthy subjects, both alone and in combination with rifampicin or itraconazole. The tolerability profile of vandetanib was consistent with that observed in previous single-dose studies in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Exposure to vandetanib, as assessed by AUC<sub>504</sub> in healthy subjects, was reduced by 40% when a single dose was given in combination with the potent CYP3A4 inducer rifampicin. Because of this, it may be appropriate to avoid coadministration of potent CYP3A4 inducers with vandetanib. Vandetanib exposure was increased by about 9% when it was taken in combination with the CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole. It is unlikely that coadministration of vandetanib and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors will need to be contraindicated.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported financially by AstraZeneca.
