Primary prevention of CVD requires adequately controlled blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidaemia as well as a reduction in obesity, smoking and alcohol consumption [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hypertension is responsible for over 50% of strokes and 25% of CVD worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The global burden of diabetes is no less challenging with over 400 million people estimated to have the disease, half of whom are undiagnosed, with complications being a major cause of disability and reduced quality of life [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Every year over nine million people die from hypertension-related disease and nearly five million die from diabetes, with most of this mortality being premature [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite this huge disease burden, access to prevention and treatment remains out of reach for most people in low- and middle-income countries [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In China, CVD accounts for 38% of total mortality [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In 2010, the country had an estimated 266 million people with hypertension, 180 million with hyperlipidaemia, 92 million with diabetes and 240 million who were overweight [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a result of these risk factors CVD events are predicted to increase by 23% from 2010 to 2030, resulting in 21.3 million additional CVD events and 7.7 million deaths [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Despite this heavy burden of disease the health services generally fail to detect and manage hypertension, diabetes and other CVD risk factors effectively. Surveys in China demonstrate that only 24% of hypertensive patients knew their condition, only 19% were on therapy and less than 5% had their blood pressure adequately controlled [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Adherence to medication is a major issue as less than 20% of hypertensive patients took anti-hypertensive medication in a timely way [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Similarly, a national survey in 2010 showed a Type II diabetes prevalence of 12% among adults, with only 26% receiving treatment [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>CVD risk reduction cannot be achieved by treating hypertension or diabetes as separate diseases [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A more comprehensive approach is needed. Patients with a calculated 10-year CVD risk (i.e. risk of coronary heart disease or stroke) of 20% or above are in need of therapeutic and lifestyle interventions delivered predominantly at the primary care level [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies have shown that medications such as modern anti-hypertensives, statins, and aspirin, especially in low-dose combinations, can substantially reduce CVD events [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183169.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Healthy lifestyle interventions may have moderate effects in CVD risk reduction [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Smoking cessation and increased exercise are important in reducing long-term morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183169.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Salt reduction or substitution can lead to reduced blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with a study in China showing that salt substitution reduced mean systolic blood pressure by 3.7 mmHg [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>In 2009 China embarked on a series of health reforms aiming to build a primary care oriented system. Key components include the provision of a universal health insurance package and basic public health services, including detection and management of hypertension and diabetes at the community level. In rural areas, the township hospital is responsible for providing clinical care to the resident population, including public health activities such as the follow-up of patients according to national hypertension and diabetes guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the management of hypertension and diabetes is not integrated, and there is no specific medication adherence support or systematic health education [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. After developing a suitable intervention of a comprehensive approach, we initiated a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) in the primary care setting of rural China to assess the health effects of the interventions over two years. Here we aimed to assess whether these interventions of the trial were being delivered over a 12-month period, were associated with reduced blood pressure, and, in a smaller sub-group, whether there were any differences in a range of intermediate outcomes at 12 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of the University of Leeds, UK (reference HSLTLM/12/010) and the Ethics Committee of Zhejiang Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, China (reference 18/06/2012). All participants have given written informed consent before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was based on an on-going, two-arm, parallel-group, cluster-randomized controlled trial that aims to answer to what extent the intervention strategies have been implemented. This was designed as a pragmatic trial as i) eligibility criteria for hospitals and patients were broad and inclusive to represent typical rural populations; ii) medications were not freely provided but were covered up to 30% by the rural health insurance scheme; and iii) delivery of the services was embedded within the routine job descriptions of family doctors. To assess delivery of interventions we compared the following outcomes between intervention and control townships: i) the prescribing and taking of medications at quarterly intervals over 12 months; and ii) blood pressure readings at quarterly intervals over 12 months. To assess intermediate outcomes at 12 months we selected a sub-group panel in which we measured medication adherence using Morisky questionnaire, healthy lifestyles, changes in body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin levels (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) and lipid profiles at 12 months compared with those found at baseline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183169.s001">S1 Table</xref>).</p><p>Three counties located in central Zhejiang province were selected on the basis that their townships hospitals had electronic health records and agreed to participate in the trial [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We excluded one township whose hospital was used for a pilot study. In each township we recruited patients aged 50 to 74 years who held permanent residence in the township and were either hypertensive with a 10-year CVD risk of 20% or higher calculated using the Asian Equation [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], based on information available in the electronic health records [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], or had a recorded medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. All eligible participants were identified from existing health records. We excluded patients with mental health problems, physical disabilities, history of severe CVD events, or other severe diseases. We also excluded patients who were hospitalized during recruitment; patients who had serious adverse effects to the recommended drugs; those whose diastolic blood pressure were lower than 60 mmHg; or those who had high risk of CVD but did not have hypertension or diabetes; or those who declined to participate in the trial. Potentially eligible participants were asked to visit the township hospital where they were assessed by family doctors for eligibility criteria, consulted about their willingness to participate in the study and invited to provide informed written consent. Patients in Zhejiang were used to visit their own township hospitals based on health insurance regulations, also due to the familiarity of doctors, thus the potential for cross contamination is low [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Participant recruitment lasted from December 2013 to May 2014, and the participants had been followed up for 12 months when this analysis was conducted. The authors confirm that all ongoing and related trials for this intervention are registered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183169.s002">S1 File</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size for the whole study group was based on the primary outcome measure: the CVD event rate. We assumed the intervention would lead to a relative reduction of at least 20% from the current CVD event rate of 5% within two years, based on published values. We estimated to require 32 clusters per arm with 450 participants per cluster to detect such a difference with 90% power, assuming a coefficient of variation of 0.15 and testing at the 5% level.</p><p>The sample size calculation for the panel sub-group was conducted to power the detection of effects in outcomes measured from the panel patients&#x02019; blood samples: HbA<sub>1c</sub>, total serum cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. This sample size was based on detecting changes in TC, because it was expected to display the smallest change. Based on pilot data and values from the literature, and assuming just one-third of patients took their statins, we expected a 6% relative reduction in the level of TC. We estimated we required 6 clusters per arm to detect this change with 90% power, with 100 participants per cluster and 10% loss to follow-up, assuming an intracluster correlation coefficient of 0.01, and testing at the 5% level. Full details of the sample size calculations are given in the trial protocol [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>An independent biostatistician randomly allocated eligible township hospitals to intervention or control arms in a 33:34 ratio using sequential numbers without stratification. Allocation took place after subject recruitment. All eligible participants in each township received the study treatment allocated to their township hospital. Blinding was not feasible for patients or providers. Written informed consent was obtained from both hospital directors and individuals. For the panel, six clusters (100 participants per cluster) were randomly selected from each arm.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Intervention arm</title><p>The intervention case management guideline, training and performance monitoring meeting and patient support activities were designed to fit within the job description of family doctors in the township hospitals. These comprised: 1) prescription of a standardised package of highly effective medicines targeted at those with hypertension or with diabetes; 2) advice about specific lifestyle interventions; and 3) advice about medication adherence [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Intervention activities were documented in a deskguide, which included a clinical treatment algorithm and information on the use of recommended medicines (on the essential medicine list); healthy lifestyle education; medication adherence support; and how to change and replace existing medicines if necessary [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Training of trainers on the use of the deskguide was provided for senior doctors on a half-day course annually. These doctors then became trainers in their own township hospitals and conducted initial and refresher trainings quarterly. In addition, the township hospitals discussed the performance and improvement strategies in their monthly internal meetings based on the feedback of performance indicators sent by local CDCs.</p><p>All hypertensive patients in this trial had high risk of CVD, thus the clinical treatment algorithm recommended, for all hypertensive patients in the trial, prescribing a standard combination [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] of two anti-hypertensives (two different kinds selected from thiazide-diuretics, calcium-channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, or beta-blockers, according to the Chinese Hypertension Guideline) [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], a statin, and a low dose of aspirin. Patients with diabetes only were prescribed a standard combination of one anti-hypertensive, a statin, and a low dose of aspirin, plus their anti-diabetic medicines if any. Patients already on other anti-hypertensive medicines were advised to switch to the modern medicines in the standardised packages. All doctors were educated of side effects and contradictions of the medicines, such as not giving aspirin to haemorrhagic patients, and how to detect the early sign of any side effects. According to the health insurance policies, patients could purchase their medications from the hospital pharmacy or any qualified street pharmacies using doctor prescriptions according to health insurance policies.

During consultations doctors recorded patient prescriptions and their actual intake of medications. They also recorded patients&#x02019; blood pressures, measured using mercury sphygmomanometers after patients had sat for five minutes. In both arms doctors entered data on patients&#x02019; blood pressure, height and weight into the routine internet-based public health management information system. Additionally, those participants selected for the panel population underwent an examination, where doctors recorded their BMI, blood pressure, and levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub>, TC and LDL at baseline, 12 and 24 months after randomization [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All laboratory specimens and tests results were quality assured at the provincial central reference laboratory.

This data was recorded in a parallel internet-based trial management system designed for family doctors.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome of the trial is the incidence of severe CVD events (i.e., coronary heart disease and stroke) over 36 months of follow-up recorded by Zhejiang&#x02019;s CVD surveillance system, which will not be reported in this process evaluation paper. In this study we report descriptively quarterly outcomes for rates of prescribing and actual drug-taking of recommended highly effective medicines, and mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg), for all participants. We also analyze changes in these outcomes between baseline and 12 month follow-up. Similarly, in the panel population we report and analyze changes in patient intermediate outcomes at baseline and 12 months for levels of HbA<sub>1c</sub> (%), TC (mmol/L) and LDL (mmol/L), as well as rates of smoking and alcohol consumption, salt intake, exercise, BMI, and participant adherence to medications (i.e., whether taking medicines timely and with full dosage among patients who have taken medicines) using the Morisky scale, where achieving 6&#x02013;8 within a scale of 0&#x02013;8 was regarded as good adherence [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].

Data were analyzed according to the randomized allocation of their township, and irrespective of their adherence to the protocol. Another biostatistician (MKCC) who was responsible for data analysis was blinded to the treatment allocation. Descriptive analyses of means, medians and proportions were used to report baseline socio-demographic and clinical information. For the panel sub-group, the intervention effects on continuous 12 month outcomes (i.e. systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HbA1<sub>c</sub>, TC, LDL and BMI) were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models adjusted for clustering (i.e. a random effect of township hospital), and baseline covariates, namely age, gender, education levels, and annual incomes. The intervention effects on binary 12 month outcomes, such as changes in smoking rates, were analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression models adjusting for clustering and the same demographic/socio-economic factors. The effects of the intervention on 12 month systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the whole population group were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models adjusting for clustering, and other potentially confounding covariates as above. Hypothesis testing was two-sided and at the 5% level. Cases with missing outcome or covariate data were excluded. Standard model assumptions, such as homoscedasticity and normality of errors/random effects, were assessed to ensure models were valid.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec017"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Delivery of interventions for the whole study group</title><p>All the 67 eligible township hospitals are currently participating in the study.

first pragmatic randomized controlled trial that implements a comprehensive package at the primary healthcare level for high CVD risk hypertensive or diabetic patients. Though in many developed countries some of our CVD risk prevention package is now standard care, in China and most LMICs it is not generally provided. Within the framework of this trial, we conducted an analysis which showed that interventions were delivered and that these were signs of improvement at 12-months. The primary indicator (CVD events) will be analysed at the end of the trial.</p><p>A high proportion of patients in the intervention arm were given prescriptions of the anti-hypertensive drugs, a statin and aspirin, as recommended in the standard medication package [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Most family doctors in the intervention arm have changed prescribing behaviour by 12 months, which compares very well with rates for interventions in a systematic review [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, the actual taking of medications according to these prescriptions was low. There was a modest improvement in the (previously very low) rates of prescribing statins. But the rates of taking anti-hypertensive drugs were similar between intervention and control arms. This may be because there was a relatively high level of general anti-hypertensive use at baseline in both arms (over 70%), and 75% of patients in both arms achieved targeted blood pressure control. This high drug uptake at baseline may limit the anti-hypertensive gain that we hoped for in the trial, and it was reported that patients were reluctant to switch to or add another anti-hypertensive [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Similar positive findings on blood pressure control were observed in urban clinics in China where patients were managed under primary care facilities [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], but these contrast with the relatively poor national average [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183169.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In a pragmatic trial using one anti-hypertensive in a setting with low medicine usage (&#x0003c;7%) in China and India, only 20% of participants took the prescribed medications in 12 months, and this was associated with a small (&#x0003c;3 mmHg) average reduction in systolic blood pressure [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>We did observe that a higher proportion of patients in the intervention arm took aspirin and statins compared with the control arm. However, the drug-taken rates were disappointing, around 10%, compared to that approximately 90% of patients were prescribed aspirin and statins during consultations. We felt that the gap may be that doctors, who identified the low drug-taken during consultation, were reluctant to persuade patients for a number of reasons. The worry for aspirin was related to fears of gastrointestinal bleeding [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], while the concern of statins may be economic. Statins cost over 120 RMB/ USD 20 per month, but only 30% of drug costs were covered by health insurance [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Patient education on these two drugs have to come from a variety of sources, including their experience of consultations with doctors from big hospitals and public educations. This is a potential area to be improved. In addition, a fixed combination pill is not available in China, though this might improve drug taking adherence compared with separate pills [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>There were several strengths to this study. First, the intervention was developed with the provincial health authorities according to the &#x02018;embedded research and development&#x02019; approach, where research questions are focused on local opportunities for going to scale; interventions are designed and evaluated in real-world setting with public health agencies, and the results can directly inform program development [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Our trial was designed to be implementable, replicable and sustainable within the routine health services, and supported government policy on essential public health interventions. The intervention package was embedded into daily primary care practice [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Second, the intervention package and the research procedures were tested and refined in a pilot study before the trial [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Third, the sample was large and patients were managed on the basis of their CVD risk rather than just treatment of their hypertension and/or diabetes.</p><p>Several limitations need to be stated. First, this was a pragmatic trial implemented by primary care staff who received half-day training annually and referesh training monthly within their own hospitals. More intensive training may be needed to target doctor-patient communication regarding the benefits of using combination medications and changing to healthier lifestyles. Second, we relied on routine reporting systems and inevitably there were missing data. Patient lifestyle indicators were self-reported. We have provided training for doctors in both arms regarding standard measurement and consultation reports [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Third, the study did not show any significantly improvement of biomedical indicators regarding blood pressures, BMI, HbA<sub>1c,</sub> total cholesterol and LDL between baseline and 12 months in the intervention arm compared with the control arm, though there is strong evidence that the four-drug combination is associated with improvements in intermediate outcomes and a marked reduction in CVD events [<xref rid="pone.0183169.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0183169.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This may be due to relatively high uptake of antihypertensive in both arms at baseline, and low uptake of aspirin and statin in the intervention arm during the intervention. To be of notice, all our medications were not supplied free-of-cost, but were prescribed in routine practice with partial reimbursement through health insurance schemes. Although countries like China have implemented universal health coverage, health insurance covers only a marginal part of outpatient costs, and this can substantially reduce the uptake of more expensive drugs such as statins. The rural health insurance needs to improve its outpatient reach to cover statins and other highly effective medications. Fourth, there was no blinding for healthcare providers or patients, although the outcome analysis was blinded. Fifth, the trial was not designed and powered to test the effects of individual components within the comprehensive intervention package. Sixth, we used complete case analyses which may introduce bias into the results depending on the missing data mechanism.</p><p>Several programmatic and policy implications can be drawn from this trial. First, the trial has demonstrated that the essential public health policy, with operational components developed in the design of the trial, is feasible and implementable with minimum input. Though the health gains in the first 12 months are modest due to both practice and policy factors, they may be substantial at the population level when we revisit these indicators as well as CVD events after a longer follow-up period. Policy makers need to consider raising coverage for essential medicines for hypertension and diabetes during for outpatient consultations in primary care facilities, so that patients can be effectively treated in communities and costlier CVD events are prevented. And innovative patient education is clearly needed. There has been strong ownership and involvement of the health authorities, so the comprehensive package will be ready for scale-up if proven successful later.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The comprehensive intervention package, designed to be replicable within context, was feasible, and implemented as planned by routine health staff. Additional measures, such as more intensive training of doctors, innovative patient education and improved health insurance cover for outpatients are needed. Intervention packages such as this are necessary to ensure quality improvements in primary health facilities regarding CVD risk, hypertension and diabetes care in China and elsewhere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183169.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist of information to include when reporting a cluster randomised trial.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0183169.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0183169.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Study protocol: Cardiovascular disease risk reduction in rural China: A clustered randomized controlled trial in Zhejiang.</title><p>Adapted from &#x0201c;Wei X, Zou G, Gong W, Yin J, Yu Y, Walley J, et al.
