Adequate levels of physical activity and a healthy diet are recognised as important lifestyle factors for the maintenance of a healthy weight and prevention of chronic diseases. Retirement village (RV) residents rarely engage in physical activity and nutrition programmes offered, with poor attendance and low use of existing facilities such as on-site fitness centres and classes and nutrition seminars. The RV provides a unique setting to access and engage with this older target group, to test the effectiveness of strategies to increase levels of physical activity, improve nutrition and maintain a healthy weight.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and analysis</title><p>This cluster-randomised controlled trial will evaluate a physical activity, nutrition and healthy weight management intervention for insufficiently active (&#x02018;not achieving 150&#x02005;min of moderate-intensity physical activity per week&#x02019;) adults aged 60&#x02013;75 residing in RV's. A total of 400 participants will be recruited from 20 randomly selected RV's in Perth, Western Australia. Villages will be assigned to either the intervention group (n=10) or the control group (n=10) each containing 200 participants. The Retirement Village Physical Activity and Nutrition for Seniors (RVPANS) programme is a home-based physical activity and nutrition programme that includes educational resources, along with facilitators who will motivate and guide the participants during the 6-month intervention. Descriptive statistics and mixed regression models will be performed to assess the intervention effects. This trial will evaluate an intervention for the modification of health risk factors in the RV setting. Such research conducted in RV's has been limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Curtin University Human Research Ethics Committee (approval number: HR128/2012).

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Coinciding with increasing age is decreasing physical activity levels and increasing overweight/obesity. In excess of 46% of those aged 65 and over are insufficiently active and 60% of older adults are classified as obese or overweight.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The obesity epidemic represents a significant public health issue, translating into an estimated annual cost of $21 billion in Australia,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> further highlighting the need for physical activity and nutrition programmes capable of engaging this older group.</p><p>In 2009, 5% of Australians aged 65 and over lived in retirement villages; this figure&#x000a0;is expected to rise to 6% by 2016 and 7.2% by 2025.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> As a consequence, demand for retirement villages as a residential option will increase.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Retirement villages in this study are defined as congregate housing communities that cater for adults aged 55&#x02005;years and over with independent living units, recreational facilities and social and physical supports allowing residents to age in place while retaining functional independence.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Services offered by retirement villages are important to attract residents with a diverse range of needs, especially support for physical activity and healthy eating.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Adults living in retirement villages are typically sedentary with low attendance at offered physical activity programmes.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, physical activity contributes to independent living, which is a core value of retirement village communities.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Most physical activity programmes offered in retirement villages are often limited, being predominantly therapy-based (eg, falls prevention) or light recreational activities such as lawn bowls.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Typically, such programmes lack a nutrition component<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> even though older adults are at high risk of poor nutrition (malnourished) or inadequate nutrition (obesity and overweight).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Evaluation of physical activity and nutrition programmes has been reported in aged care rather than retirement village settings,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> while research in the latter has been mainly limited to falls prevention, functional decline, group exercise classes and weight training.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref> In addition, such evaluations have been conducted with small samples, or the programmes are outdated.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> There is an urgent need for the development of a physical activity and nutrition intervention for older adults living in retirement villages, which includes rigorous evaluation.</p><p>Reshaping physical activity, diet and overweight and obesity is about supporting behaviour change for positive health outcomes. Supporting behaviour change is most effective when interventions also target the social and physical environment, and policy within organisations.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;21</xref> Home-based health promotion interventions for community-living people aged 60 and over have been shown to be effective,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and an evaluation of a recent physical activity and nutrition programme yielded promising results, indicating potential for such an approach to be adapted to other settings.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>This proposed large scale cluster-randomised trial will evaluate a physical activity, nutrition and healthy weight management intervention for adults aged 60&#x02013;75&#x02005;years residing in retirement villages, which will ultimately reduce the risk of chronic disease (eg, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers).<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> We hypothesise that by the end of the intervention there will be significant improvements (p&#x0003c;0.05) in physical activity (time/intensity), dietary behaviours (reduction in dietary fat; increased intakes of fibre, fruit and vegetables) and body composition of the intervention group participants, compared with the control group participants. The Retirement Village Physical Activity and Nutrition for Seniors (RVPANS) study is developed based on a previously validated study whereby the intervention programme and instruments were successfully implemented and tested (pre and post) in older Australian adults.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This cluster-randomised controlled trial will evaluate a physical activity, nutrition and healthy weight management intervention for adults aged 60 to 75 residing in retirement villages in metropolitan Perth, the capital of Western Australia.

There will be a section for participants to comment specifically on features they like/dislike about the booklet. This method of process evaluation will similarly be applied to other resources and to assess the programme ambassadors. The process evaluation approach has been demonstrated to be an effective &#x02018;incentive&#x02019; for participants to review the materials carefully, thus increasing their level of engagement in the programme.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Adverse events from activity participation will be recorded by the programme ambassadors as well as through process evaluation during the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Formative research focus groups</title><p>Focus groups involving three retirement villages will be conducted in two phases. The purpose of the first phase is to clarify enablers and barriers to programme delivery and to review potential intervention strategies. Such information is deemed valuable to modify the intervention procedure and resources, as suggested in previous studies,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;23</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> so that the intervention programme can be tailored specifically to suit the retirement village setting. The second phase will then test and refine the intervention resources and modify and fine tune programme delivery.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Exit interviews</title><p>At the conclusion of the intervention, a total of 30 intervention participants will be randomly selected to take part in the exit interviews. Programme completers (n=15) as well as non-completers (n=15) will be invited to undertake a face-to-face interview to gain information regarding their perceptions of the programme, the resources and the programme ambassadors. The non-completers will be asked the reasons for withdrawing. All qualitative data will be transcribed within 2&#x02005;weeks of interview completion. At least 10% of such qualitative data will be randomly selected and reviewed. Data will be collated and presented thematically with direct quotes from participants.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Sample size</title><p>In the IPAQ, participation (&#x0003e;10&#x02005;min in duration) in various modes of physical activity is initially recorded in binary form (yes, no). We expect the intervention group to exhibit significantly higher prevalence of participation in strength exercise, walking and moderate-intensity activities than the control group at 6&#x02005;months. The power calculations are based on a logistic mixed regression model with the outcome variable being the prevalence of such physical activity participation, and assuming 70% complete data across the two assessments due to attrition and non-respondents. In the power analyses, small to medium effect sizes (10&#x02013;20% change in prevalence estimates) are expected for conservative estimation adjusting for age and gender only. A sample size of n=400 (100 per gender by intervention condition) will provide sufficient power of 80% to detect such moderate effect sizes at 5% level of significance.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise participants&#x02019; demographic, health characteristics and the outcome variables. The main objective involves the assessment of intervention effect on changes in physical activity and nutrition behaviours over time. For the hierarchical data (repeated measurements of individuals nested within retirement villages) collected over the observational period, multilevel two-part models are appropriate for the semicontinuous variables. In estimating the prevalence of physical activity participation, the logistic mixed regression model accounts for the inherent correlation of the observations via random (retirement village) effects, whereas the generalised &#x003b3; mixed regression part, with suitably defined correlation structure, can provide correct statistical inferences concerning the observed physical activity levels.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Multilevel models will also be used to analyse other primary and secondary outcomes of interest. In addition, intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to assess sensitivity of the results to the expected attrition and withdrawal of participants from the RVPANS study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Retirement villages are expected to increase in numbers over the coming years to accommodate the burgeoning ageing population. They provide a unique setting to access, engage and test strategies to increase physical activity, to improve nutritional intake and maintain a healthy weight. To date, limited research has been conducted. It is therefore timely to evaluate an intervention targeting the modification of health risk factors in retirement villages.</p><p>This innovative research will contribute to a better understanding of health behaviours of older adults in the retirement village setting. It has the potential to provide evidence on barriers and enablers to participation in preventative programmes specific to retirement village residents, particularly on the effectiveness of strategies to improve their dietary intake and physical activity levels. Moreover, the findings will contribute to policy, environmental and infrastructure changes that support the adoption and maintenance of such health-enhancing behaviours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e216" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005107.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e217" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2014-005107.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> A-MH contributed to the study design and protocol development, is responsible for acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation; also contributed to drafting the article, revising it as well as final approval of version to be published.
