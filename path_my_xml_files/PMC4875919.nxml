It is estimated that 4 million valve replacement procedures have been performed in the last 50&#x000a0;years and it remains the only definitive treatment for most patients with advanced heart valve disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Oral anticoagulation with warfarin and similar vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is recommended lifelong for patients with bioprosthesis who have other indications for anticoagulation, such as atrial fibrillation (AF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Even with the appropriate use of therapy, there is a high incidence of thromboembolic events: 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;% per year. Furthermore, bleeding risk is significant, ranging from 2 to 9&#x000a0;% per year. Because of VKAs&#x02019; narrow therapeutic index, interactions, genetic variants, and need for blood monitoring of patients, different anticoagulants with more predictable pharmacological effects have been searched for. Alternatives to warfarin are now available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Dabigatran etexilate is the prodrug of dabigatran, a direct thrombin (factor IIa) inhibitor, which was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular AF, and has also been approved for the treatment of acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Antithrombotic therapy for thromboprophylaxis in patients with mechanical heart valves remains challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Until now, the Oral Dabigatran Etexilate in Patients after Heart Valve Replacement (RE-ALIGN) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] comparing dabigatran etexilate to warfarin was the only randomized controlled study in patients with mechanical valve prosthesis, but it was terminated prematurely because of an excess of thromboembolic and bleeding events among patients in the dabigatran group. Additional studies are needed to find suitable alternatives to VKAs in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. There are no published studies in humans evaluating the efficacy and safety of dabigatran or any other new oral anticoagulant (NOAC) in patients with mitral and/or aortic bioprosthesis valve. The Dabigatran Versus Warfarin After Bioprosthesis Valve Replacement for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation Postoperatively (DAWA) study was designed to provide the first clinical trial that tested dabigatran use in patients with bioprosthesis and AF postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Oversight</title><p>DAWA is a phase II, prospective, open-label, randomized, pilot study. The main variable to be observed in this study is intracardiac thrombus. There are no formal primary or secondary clinical efficacy or safety outcomes because it is a pilot study. Mortality and morbidity events (reversible ischemic neurological deficit, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, any bleeding, prosthesis valve thrombosis and death) were evaluated in an exploratory manner. The details of the trial design have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The trial protocol was approved by the local ethics and research committee in the city of Salvador-Brazil (under protocol number 14284813.9.0000.0045), and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. An independent data and safety monitoring board closely monitored the trial. All the authors contributed to the interpretation of the results, wrote the first version of the manuscript and approved all versions, made the decision to submit the manuscript for publication, and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and the fidelity of this article to the study protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients and Randomization</title><p>Patients eligible for inclusion in the study were 18&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years old, underwent mitral and/or aortic bioprosthesis valve replacement at least 3&#x000a0;months prior to entering the study and had documented AF postoperatively in addition to exclusion of atrial thrombus or valve prosthesis thrombosis by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). Non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) without hemorrhage or findings of acute cerebral infarction on the last 2&#x000a0;days of screening was also necessary. The complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in the protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to receive dabigatran or warfarin by a computer generated list of random numbers performed to a 1:1 ratio between the groups. Following that, the allocation sequence was concealed from the researcher enrolling participants in sequentially numbered, opaque, black, sealed envelopes. After randomization, patients had study visits scheduled at 7&#x000a0;days (via telephone) and at 30&#x000a0;days (personally), with a monthly follow-up for 90&#x000a0;days. After this, non-contrast brain CT (or magnetic resonance imaging when necessary) and TEE were repeated in all randomized patients. The former was executed to document possible cerebral events with no clinical expression and the latter to analyze the incidence of intracardiac thrombi, new dense spontaneous echo contrast (SEC) or its resolution, in addition to thrombosis or dysfunction of valvular prosthesis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Drug Administration Protocol</title><p>Patients assigned to the dabigatran group received 110&#x000a0;mg of dabigatran etexilate twice daily. Patients with previous use of warfarin underwent washout with immediate introduction of dabigatran once the international normalized ratio (INR) was &#x0003c;2.5. The warfarin dose was adjusted to maintain the INR between 2.0 and 3.0. Doses were between 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg in the first days for most individuals, with subsequent dosing based on INR response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint was the detection of intracardiac thrombus in TEE at the end of follow-up (90&#x000a0;days).

Left atrial (LA) abnormalities such as thrombus and dense SEC were assessed by TEE in all patients. Dense SEC was defined as a dynamic smoke-like signal that swirled slowly in a circular pattern within the LA and appendage, with a gradation of &#x0003e;2+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The bleeding risk was based on the criteria of the Control of Anticoagulation Subcommittee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and HAS-BLED (Hypertension, Abnormal Renal/Liver Function, Stroke, Bleeding History or Predisposition, Labile International Normalized Ratio, Elderly, Drugs/Alcohol) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Considerations</title><p>The SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform statistical analysis of the collected data.

However, the trial was stopped early because of a significant decrease of eligible candidates for recruitment. Among the most important reasons for this, we detected a high rate of intracardiac thrombus in the selection phase, low socioeconomic status in many others, and addition to the negative results of the Re-align study.</p><p>Despite the small sample size of this randomized pilot study, to the best of our knowledge, our current study is the first that has held a direct comparison between an NOAC (dabigatran) and warfarin in patients with a bioprosthesis valve and AF until now. The primary and all secondary endpoints had quantitatively few events in both groups. The bioprosthesis emerged last century with the expectation of replacing existing mechanical prosthesis, due to not theoretically requiring permanent oral anticoagulation. Actually, the recommendations of the main international guidelines on antithrombotic therapy after bioprosthesis implantation demonstrate a low level of evidence (Grade C), which may be explained by the lack of randomized trials in this scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>However, certain patients with bioprosthesis may require long-term anticoagulant therapy when there are other indications, in particular with AF. In these cases, thrombogenicity is due to AF and not to the prosthesis. It can be expected that the current absence of indication of NOACs for mechanical prosthesis will be an incentive to continue, or even strengthen, the trend towards favoring implantations of bioprosthesis at the expense of mechanical valves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The reason for evaluating the formation of thrombus or SEC by TEE is justified since they are independent predictors for thromboembolic events, as evidenced in several previous studies. About 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% of patients with SEC or intracardiac thrombus evolve with major thromboembolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Patients with AF and dense SEC have a high likelihood of cerebral embolism (22&#x000a0;%) and/or death, despite oral anticoagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, microembolization of small thrombi derived from the fibrillating LA may be significant causes of silent brain infarction in nonvalvular AF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Regarding the dosage of dabigatran 110&#x000a0;mg twice a day chosen in this study, it was based on the results of the Long-term Multicenter Extension of Dabigatran Treatment in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation (RELY-ABLE) trial, which showed no significant difference in stroke or mortality, but a higher rate of major bleeding with the higher versus lower dabigatran dose (150 vs. 110&#x000a0;mg twice a day, respectively) and no difference between the doses in net clinical benefit as estimated by the composite of stroke, bleeding and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recently, a separate analysis of the two low-dose NOAC regimens (which included dabigatran) showed that although they have a similar efficacy to warfarin for protection against all stroke or systemic embolic events, they are not as effective for protection against ischemic stroke in particular. However, they do have a safer profile than warfarin and preserve the mortality benefit noted with the high-dose regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Beyond that, it is possible that patients with AF and bioprosthesis or valve repair have a risk of thromboembolism not substantially different from that with more common forms of &#x02018;non-valvular&#x02019; AF, and in any case, on the basis of preliminary evidence accrued from trials with NOACs, there is no evidence of different efficacy or safety compared with warfarin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>About neurological events, in the RE-ALIGN study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it is important to see that most thromboembolic events among patients in the dabigatran group occurred in &#x0201c;population A&#x0201d; (patients who had started a study drug within 7&#x000a0;days after valve surgery), with fewer occurring in &#x0201c;population B&#x0201d; (patients who had undergone valve implantation more than 3&#x000a0;months before randomization). Besides, stroke, death and major bleeding occurred only in the first group. All patients in our study have more than a 3-month interval from surgery for recruitment, a period known to have a lower incidence of embolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>There are several limitations of DAWA, among which we highlight the following: unicentric pilot study; small sample size; and short follow-up (90&#x000a0;days) for the occurrence of major clinical events. Despite this, it can be very useful as a hypothesis generator for a large randomized trial.</p><p>In summary, the DAWA study encourages a larger multicentric prospective study to assess the use of this NOAC in such a population (bioprosthesis) since usual doses would be enough to avoid the formation of thrombi and its several complications, including hard endpoints such as prosthesis thrombosis, stroke or major bleeding.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with Ethical Standards</title><p>We appreciate the efforts of the institution Ana Nery Hospital.
