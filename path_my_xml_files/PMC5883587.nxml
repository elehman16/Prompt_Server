This trial will compare early colonoscopy (performed within 24 h) versus elective colonoscopy (performed between 24 and 96 h) to examine the identification rate of stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH) in ALGIB patients. We hypothesize that, compared with elective colonoscopy, early colonoscopy increases the identification of SRH and subsequently improves clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">This trial is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial examining the superiority of early colonoscopy over elective colonoscopy (standard therapy) in ALGIB patients. The primary outcome measure is the identification of SRH. Secondary outcomes include 30-day rebleeding, success of endoscopic treatment, need for additional endoscopic examination, need for interventional radiology, need for surgery, need for transfusion during hospitalization, length of stay, 30-day thrombotic events, 30-day mortality, preparation-related adverse events, and colonoscopy-related adverse events. The sample size will enable detection of a 9% SRH rate in elective colonoscopy patients and a SRH rate of &#x02265;&#x02009;26% in early colonoscopy patients with a risk of type I error of 5% and a power of 80%.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This trial will provide high-quality data on the benefits and risks of early colonoscopy in ALGIB patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">UMIN-CTR Identifier, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&#x00026;action=brows&#x00026;type=summary&#x00026;recptno=R000024259&#x00026;language=J">UMIN000021129</ext-link>.

The most important issue with diagnostic colonoscopy for ALGIB is infrequent identification of stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which lowers the success of hemostasis. If SRH could be definitively identified enabling clinicians to perform accurate hemostasis, adverse clinical outcomes, such as rebleeding or transfusion requirement, could be reduced in ALGIB. An observational study found a positive association between early timing of colonoscopy and the identification of SRH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; however, it remains controversial as to whether an early procedure improves clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although almost nearly half of all hospitals with a high colonoscopy procedure volume perform early colonoscopy, which is defined as being performed within 24 h, other hospitals perform later elective colonoscopy after full bowel preparation as standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Recently, three meta-analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] that included two single-center randomized controlled trials (RCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] for early versus elective colonoscopy in patients with ALGIB, showed that early colonoscopy has the potential to increase the identification of SRH and decrease the length of stay and associated costs; however, the meta-analyses also that early colonoscopy did not improve outcomes such as transfusion requirement, rebleeding, or mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, these RCTs were stopped during enrollment because of difficulties in reaching the prespecified sample size. In addition, one of the RCTs was performed between 1993 and 1995, when colonoscopic procedures had not been standardized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Thus, high-quality evidence for the early timing of colonoscopy in ALGIB is required.</p><p id="Par14">To address these issues, we are conducting a multicenter RCT to compare the clinical outcomes between patients receiving early versus elective colonoscopy in ALGIB patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p id="Par15">This will be a parallel, randomized, open-label, superiority trial, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive early colonoscopy or elective colonoscopy (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Schematic of study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2558_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Timeline</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2558_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Approvals</title><p id="Par16">The trial has been approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of The University of Tokyo (P2015034&#x02013;11Y, January 21, 2016) and the IRB of each participating institution.

One of the RCTs, an open-label trial by an American study group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], compared early and elective colonoscopy in 100 ALGIB patients and reported that early colonoscopy had a higher identification of SRH than that with elective colonoscopy, although it did not improve clinical outcomes, including rebleeding, transfusion, and mortality. In contrast, the second RCT, an open-label trial by another American study group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], compared early and elective colonoscopy in 72 ALGIB patients and reported no difference in identification rate of SRH, rebleeding, transfusion, or length of stay. However, both trials were terminated before reaching the originally planned sample size and were unable to demonstrate the superiority of early colonoscopy. In the study involving propensity matching analysis, we performed the largest retrospective propensity-score-matched analysis to compare identification rates of SRH and clinical outcomes (including success of endoscopic hemostasis, 30-day rebleeding, and length of stay) between early and elective colonoscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Early colonoscopy was associated with a higher identification rate of SRH (26%) compared with elective colonoscopy (9%), as well as with a higher success rate for endoscopic hemostasis and shorter length of stay; however, the significance of the findings were limited by unmeasured confounders. These findings further highlighted the need for a multicenter RCT to determine the benefits and risks of early colonoscopy in ALGIB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Outcome</title><p id="Par97">In this trial, we focus on the identification of SRH as the most important and feasible primary outcome. Although SRH identification may be a surrogate for clinical outcomes such as rebleeding or death, we hypothesized that early colonoscopy increases the identification of SRH and enables adequate endoscopic treatment, leading to fewer cases of rebleeding, less transfusion requirement, and shorter hospital stays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Another reason is sample size &#x02013; if the sample size calculation were based on a 6% difference in the rate of 30-day rebleeding between early and elective colonoscopy (13% vs. 7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], quite a large sample size of 784 patients (392 per group) would be needed, and conducting RCTs in this situation may be challenging considering that a prior RCT took 6 years to complete in an emergency setting of ALGIB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Strengths</title><p id="Par98">This trial will build upon collaborations between major hospitals in Japan to deliver a study that may begin to inform the rational use of early colonoscopy for patients admitted with ALGIB. The RCT study design is justified in order to demonstrate that early colonoscopy can be implemented at a hospital-wide level, to reduce contamination between trial interventions, and to aid in the operational aspects of trial delivery. This is ethically acceptable, given that both early and elective colonoscopies are within the realms of normal practice in Japan and that all clinicians have the discretion to perform a colonoscopy in contravention of the policy if they think it is necessary, thereby ensuring patient safety is not compromised. We believe the study may also help inform the wider debate about the use of early colonoscopy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par99">Open label study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Perspective</title><p id="Par100">Together with existing data, the high-quality data provided by this trial will inform clinicians and guideline committee members on the utility of early colonoscopy in ALGIB patients, as well as accumulate evidence for its use in moderate to severe outpatient cases of ALGIB.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par101">Recruitment is planned to end by March 2019.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec40"><p>
