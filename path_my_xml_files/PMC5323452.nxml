In the present study, we conducted a clinical observation study involving 48 patients diagnosed with gastric ulcer treated with either hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole or esomeprazole alone. The results showed that hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole was superior to esomeprazole alone in improving gastric ulcer healing quality.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gastric ulcer is mainly caused by an imbalance in defense mechanisms and injurious factors at the gastric mucosa. The use of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<italic>H. pylori</italic>) eradication therapy and the wide application of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have improved the clinical healing rate of gastric ulcer, but its recurrence rate remains high. Tarnawski et al[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] proposed the concept of quality of ulcer healing (QOUH) in 1991 for the first time, which considers the fact that tissue regeneration is often incomplete within ulcer scars. QOUH suggests that the evaluation of gastric ulcer healing should focus on whether the structure and function of mucosal and submucosal tissue have been completely regenerated in addition to endoscopic examination and evaluation of ulcer size. It has been shown that ulcer recurrence is closely related to QOUH. Esomeprazole is an H<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-ATP enzyme inhibitor, which can effectively inhibit acid, and thereby promotes ulcer repair. However, excessive acid suppression may cause indigestion, gastrointestinal bacterial infection and induce atrophic gastritis or even gastric cancer. Ulcers frequently recur following anti-acid drug treatment alone[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Therefore, combination therapies for gastric ulcer are favorable. To this end, hydrotalcite[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a gastric mucosal protective agent, in which the mechanism of action includes the formation of a protective membrane at the ulcer site, provides an HCO3<sup>-</sup> reservoir and repairs the mucous bicarbonate barrier. Moreover, it upregulates various protective and repair factors in the gastric tissue such as promoting the formation of prostaglandins, improving mucosal blood flow and metabolism at the ulcer site, thereby enhancing mucosal functional repair. However, previous studies comparing the efficacy of hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole <italic>vs</italic> esomeprazole therapy alone for the treatment of gastric ulcer did not lead to conclusive results, as these studies merely evaluated the endoscopic morphology of gastric mucosa and not the histologic and ultrastructural changes in the mucosal and submucosal layers. In addition, most studies were conducted using rat models[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Irregular punctate and linear gastric pits are usually abundant in normal gastric mucosa, surrounded by a rich and irregular microvascular network[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The morphology of gastric pits and the microvascular network may change corresponding to pathological changes in the gastric mucosa[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, these changes cannot be observed under white light endoscopy, but are clearly visible under narrow band imaging (NBI) magnifying endoscopy[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Thus, in the present study, we used NBI magnifying endoscopy to observe morphological changes in the gastric pits and microvascular network of regenerated mucosa. The efficacy of hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole in improving QOUH of adult gastric ulcers was assessed by the maturity of regenerated mucosal tissue. Eradication therapy was also administered to patients with a positive <italic>H. pylori</italic> test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Patient selection</title><p>Forty-eight patients diagnosed with gastric ulcer[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who received treatment in our hospital between June 2014 and December 2015 were randomly divided into the combination therapy group and the monotherapy group. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were recruited into the healthy control group. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) patients with bleeding, obstruction, perforation and cancer or other related complications of gastric ulcer; (2) complications such as heart, brain, kidney, lung and other major diseases; (3) recent treatment for gastric ulcer; and (4) contraindications to hydrotalcite or esomeprazole. All subjects were tested for <italic>H. pylori</italic> using the rapid urease test (CLO test; Delta West Pty Ltd., Western Australia). The study was approved by the ethics committee of our hospital (2014-XHNK-003) and registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IPR-16008317). Informed consent was obtained from all patients or their family members.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>The combination group received oral hydrotalcite (1.0 g three times a day) combined with oral esomeprazole (20 mg twice a day), and the monotherapy group received oral esomeprazole alone (20 mg twice a day). Treatment duration was eight weeks. <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive patients also received amoxicillin, clarithromycin and colloidal pectin bismuth for 10-14 d. The healthy control group received no treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Examinations</title><p>Endoscopic ulcer healing was observed first under white light endoscopy, and then gastric pits and microvascular morphology were observed using NBI magnifying endoscopy by the same experienced endoscopist. Following endoscopy, gastric mucosal tissues from patients were biopsied before and after treatment at the same location. Tissues were similarly biopsied from healthy volunteers. Part of the specimen was embedded in paraffin, sectioned and used for Masson, immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining. The remainder was preserved at -80 &#x000b0;C for subsequent determination of hydroxyproline content by ELISA.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Measurement data following normal distribution were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD. These data were compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by multiple comparisons using the LSD or Dunnett&#x02019;s T3 method based on their determined homogeneity of variance. For data which were not normally distributed, the Kruskal-Wallis test was used followed by multiple comparisons by pairwise methods. Enumeration data were compared using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. <italic>P</italic> values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Gastric ulcer mainly recurs <italic>in situ</italic> or at areas adjacent to the healed ulcer. Tarnawski et al[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] showed that the recurrence of gastric ulcer was closely related to QOUH. These authors believe that compromised histological and ultrastructural healing of gastric mucosa impairs the function of mucosal defense, accounting for the pathological basis of ulcer recurrence[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In the present study, we observed morphological changes in gastric pits and the microvascular network of regenerated mucosa using NBI magnifying endoscopy, and evaluated the effects of hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole on the healing quality of gastric ulcer following <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy. The results showed that hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole improved the maturity of regenerated mucosal tissue both structurally and functionally.</p><p>This study also showed that the <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive rate and endoscopic ulcer healing were similar between the combination therapy group and the monotherapy group after treatment. In addition, morphology of the gastric pits under the NBI magnifying endoscope was similar to the normal gastric mucosa in the combination therapy and monotherapy groups. This indicates that both treatments promoted superficial mucosal healing and improved gastric pit morphology.</p><p>Previous research[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] confirmed that collagen fibers in gastric tissue were mainly composed of collagen I and collagen III. Type I collagen accounts for approximately 80% of collagen fibers and strong expression of collagen I is found in newborn granulation tissue. Collagen I plays a supportive role in wound healing and excessive deposition can result in scar tissue formation. Collagen III accounts for the remaining 20% and strong expression of collagen III is found in the active capillary proliferation period, which determines the diameter and elasticity of collagen fibers. In contrast to collagen I, deposition of collagen III inhibits scar formation and regulates cell proliferation, growth and differentiation. However, over-deposition of collagen fibers in general leads to scar tissue formation and impaired physiological function. Under normal circumstances, the formation and degradation of collagen fibers are in dynamic equilibrium. Research[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] has confirmed that the ratio of collagen I to collagen III is maintained at 2:1 to 4:1 in normal tissues, which is directly related to the quality of tissue repair. Amino acids in collagen fibers consist mainly of glycine, proline and hydroxyproline[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Hydroxyproline is a non-essential amino acid, with just 1%[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] distributed in elastic proteins and almost all of the remainder found in collagen. Hydroxyproline accounts for approximately 13.4% of all amino acids in collagen[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is believed that hydroxyproline is unique to collagen fibers, as hydroxyproline content is often used as a quantitative index of collagen deposition in ulcer healing[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>This study showed that the collagen deposition area, ratio of collagen I to collagen III and hydroxyproline content in the combination therapy group were significantly higher than those in the monotherapy group after treatment. The levels of these factors in the combination therapy group after treatment were similar to those in healthy control tissues. Therefore, hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole for the treatment of gastric ulcer promotes deposition of collagen fibers, maintains the ratio of collagen I to collagen III, and improves the histological structure of regenerated gastric tissues similar to that in normal mucosa tissues, which is consistent with the findings of Griffin et al[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In conclusion, hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole was superior to esomeprazole alone in improving ulcer healing quality.</p><p>Immunohistochemical staining of factor VIII was performed to measure the number of newly generated microvessels[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We found that the combination therapy group had higher factor VIII expression and the percentage of regular microvascular network was much higher than that in the monotherapy group after treatment, according to NBI magnifying endoscopy. This may be attributed to the fact that hydrotalcite promotes the expression of various growth factors and stimulates angiogenesis, thus increasing oxygen and nutrient supply to the ulcer site to accelerate ulcer healing[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown that the gastric ulcer healing process is regulated by various growth factors and receptors[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. As a multifunctional growth factor, TGF-&#x003b2;1 plays an important role in tissue remodeling, extracellular matrix formation and angiogenesis, ultimately promoting ulcer repair[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. This study demonstrated that the expression level of TGF-&#x003b2;1 in the combination therapy group was significantly higher than that in the monotherapy group after treatment, which was similar to the level in normal control tissues. This may be due to induced expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1 by hydrotalcite, consistent with the study by Chen et al[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole is superior to esomeprazole alone in improving the healing quality of gastric ulcer. Specifically, combination therapy improved morphology of the microvascular network, promoted collagen fiber formation, angiogenesis, and the expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1, thereby improving the maturity of regenerated mucosal tissue as well as structure and function of the mucosa. This combination therapy is worthy of wider clinical application. We did not observe the recurrence of gastric ulcer due to our small sample size and short follow-up period. In future, a larger sample size and longer follow-up time will be included to determine whether hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole can also reduce the recurrence rate of gastric ulcer.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Gastric ulcer is mainly caused by an imbalance in defense mechanisms and injurious factors in the gastric mucosa. The use of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> eradication therapy and the wide application of proton pump inhibitors have improved the clinical healing rate of gastric ulcer, but its high recurrence rate remains a clinical challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>Gastric ulcers represent a public health problem. However, there are very few studies on human gastric ulcer, and most have focused on endoscopic morphology. A research hot spot is to investigate the effects of hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole on the healing quality of human gastric ulcer in order to understand the background and trends in the treatment of gastric ulcer.</p></sec><sec><title>Innovations and breakthroughs</title><p>Previous studies of quality of ulcer healing (QOUH) concentrated on endoscopic morphology and not on histologic and ultrastructural changes. In addition, most studies were conducted using rat models. In the present study, the authors determined the effects of hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole on the healing quality of gastric ulcer by observing morphological changes, and the degree of structure maturity and function of regenerated mucosa. The results showed that hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole was superior to esomeprazole alone in improving the healing quality of gastric ulcer, specifically, the morphology of the microvascular network, collagen fiber formation, angiogenesis, and high expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1.</p></sec><sec><title>Applications</title><p>The findings of this study suggest that hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole was superior to esomeprazole alone in improving the healing quality of gastric ulcer. Furthermore, this study also provides readers with important information regarding the best treatment for gastric ulcer. This combination therapy is worthy of wider clinical application.</p></sec><sec><title>Terminology</title><p>Gastric ulcer is a common disease in the department of gastroenterology, and is related to acid secretion. Mucosal injury in gastric ulcer is found in the muscularis mucosa layer, which is a characteristic of chronic ulcer formation. Clinical symptoms are mainly a repeated periodic rhythm of upper abdominal pain, accompanied by belching, bloating discomfort, bleeding, perforation, and even cancer, all of which can seriously harm human health.</p></sec><sec><title>Peer-review</title><p>Available studies on QOUH of human are rare. The authors in this study analyzed the healing quality of gastric ulcer, specifically, the morphology of the microvascular network, collagen fiber formation, angiogenesis, and expression of TGF-&#x003b2;1. This study showed that hydrotalcite combined with esomeprazole was superior to esomeprazole alone in improving the QOUH. The results were meaningful and provided important information concerning the background and trends of treatments for gastric ulcer.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Manuscript source: Unsolicited manuscript</p></fn><fn><p>Specialty type: Gastroenterology and hepatology</p></fn><fn><p>Country of origin: China</p></fn><fn><p>Peer-review report classification</p></fn><fn><p>Grade A (Excellent): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Grade B (Very good): B</p></fn><fn><p>Grade C (Good): C, C</p></fn><fn><p>Grade D (Fair): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Grade E (Poor): 0</p></fn><fn><p>Institutional review board statement: The study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China, approval No. 2014-XHNK-003.</p></fn><fn><p>Informed consent statement: All patients gave written informed consent.</p></fn><fn><p>Clinical trial registration statement: This study is registered at http://www.chictr.org.cn/usercenter.aspx.
