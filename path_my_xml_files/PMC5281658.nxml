The detectability of the vital anatomical structures (anterior ethmoid artery, optic nerve, cribriform plate and lamina papyracea) was scored using a five-point scale (from excellent to unacceptable) by a radiologist and sinus surgeon. Polyp sizes were quantified endoscopically according to the Lildholdt&#x02019;s scale (LS). Olfactory function was tested with the &#x0201c;Sniffin&#x02019; Sticks&#x0201d; test. On the low-dose CT images, detectability ranged from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic cases to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps. Identification of lamina papyracea on low-dose scans was significantly worse in each group and the same was the case with cribriform plates in patients with advanced polyposis and anosmia. Cribriform plates were the most poorly identified (between poor and average) among all the structures on low-dose images. Identification of anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) with reduced dose was insignificantly worse than with standard-dose examination. The AEA was scored as an average-defined structure and was the second weakest visualised. In conclusion, preoperatively, low-dose protocols may not sufficiently visualise the surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with CRS and bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps (LS&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2) and history of sinus surgery. Low mAs value enables comparable detectability of sinonasal landmarks with standard-dose protocols in patients without analysed risk factors. In the context of planned surgery, the current preferences of the tube should be carefully evaluated for different patient constitutions to minimise the risk of complications.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rhinosinusitis</kwd><kwd>Nasal polyps</kwd><kwd>Computed tomography</kwd><kwd>Low dose</kwd><kwd>Radiation</kwd><kwd>Complications</kwd><kwd>Anatomy</kwd><kwd>Endoscopic sinus surgery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) is considered to be an effective treatment modality of choice for patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) who fail medical therapy. Adequate preoperative patient evaluation involves computed tomography (CT) examination, which is paramount in preventing complications in ESS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The growing prevalence of patients complaining of sinus-like symptoms requiring diagnostic imaging has increased the awareness of potential hazards from radiation exposure. Consequently, several attempts were made to elaborate the reduced-dose CT protocols which are now often employed as a screening method for the detection of inflammation within sinuses. Although reducing the radiation dose is accompanied by compromised CT image quality, low-dose scanning has come to be increasingly applied for preoperative planning. This is probably because ESS is often considered to be a relatively safe procedure and due to the growing number of easily accessible low-dose CT scanners. This is despite the fact that the appropriateness of dose reduction in pre-endoscopic examination has not been established and given that some reports suggest for that reason only standard-dose (SD) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is still a lack of both universally accepted standards of disease-related image quality and reliable comparisons of the visualisation of surgically relevant anatomical structures on low- and standard-dose CT images.</p><p>Congenital anomalies, anatomical variants and post-surgical changes undetected on preoperative CT scans can lead to pathological consequences due to the proximity of the sinonasal region to vital structures. It has been shown that the standard-dose sinus CT provides a high (about 90&#x000a0;%) consistency of radiological and intraoperative findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A similar level of consistency has not yet been analysed in relation to low-dose CT&#x000a0;scanning.</p><p>It could be suspected that using dose reduction CT protocol in chronic rhinosinusitis patients with initially higher risk for perioperative complications, like those with bronchial asthma, after previous sinus surgery and with enhanced nasal polyposis, may potentially further increase the risk of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the study was to assess the extent to which the use of a low-dose multidetector CT protocol affects the identification of surgically relevant anatomical structures in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis and the above-mentioned risk indicators. Therefore, this analysis is also an attempt to customise radiation doses to the clinical indication and the patient&#x02019;s constitution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient selection</title><p>A cross-sectional, uncontrolled, randomised, single-blind study was conducted on symptomatic, uncomplicated adult patients with CRS admitted to the Department of Otolaryngology at Wroclaw Medical University. CRS was diagnosed according to previously established rules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The patients were selected consecutively as they fulfilled the criteria for participation in a prospective study. Paranasal sinus imaging was part of the routine preoperative clinical assessment. CT scans were scored according to the Lund&#x02013;MacKay (L&#x02013;M) staging system (ranging from 0 to 24). Patients without bilateral inflammatory changes were excluded. Diagnosis of asthma was confirmed by pulmonary function testing according to the GINA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The ASA intolerance was confirmed by aspirin challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Each patient gave written consent for the CT examination to be performed and to participate in the study. The study protocol was approved by our institutional review board.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Endoscopic appearance scores</title><p>Polyp sizes were quantified endoscopically according to the Lildholdt&#x02019;s scale (LS) which classifies nasal polyps into four stages: no polyposis (0), polyps only in the middle meatus (1), polyps beneath the lower edges of the middle turbinate (2) and large polyps reaching the lower border of the inferior turbinate (3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The total score might range from 0 to 6.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessment of olfactory function</title><p>Olfactory function was tested with the Sniffin&#x02019; Sticks Screening 12 Test (Burghart, Wedel, Germany) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s instruction and previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Low-dose protocols included parameters formulated on a cadaver head: tube potential 120&#x000a0;kVp, 45&#x000a0;mAs; detector configuration 64&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.625&#x000a0;mm; pitch 1.3; section thickness 0.625; and gantry rotation time 0.4&#x000a0;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The images were reconstructed with an adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) algorithm using 50&#x000a0;% ASIR.</p><p>In the standard-dose group, the following protocol was used: tube potential 120&#x000a0;kVp, 100&#x000a0;mAs; detector configuration 64&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;0.625&#x000a0;mm; pitch 0.9; section thickness 0.625; gantry rotation time 0.7&#x000a0;s. All other scanning parameters were the same for both groups. Patients were randomly selected for LD or SD protocols according to the day of examination. LD was performed on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, whereas SD was performed on Tuesdays and Thursdays. During the experiment, participants were blind to the doses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Subjective evaluation of image quality</title><p>Quantitative analysis was performed for each study using certified diagnostic workstations: AW 4.6 (GE Healthcare, USA). The reviewed images were reconstructed with 0.625 slice thickness and displayed with a window level/width of 2000/350 HU and sharp filter-s3. Two researchers, a radiologist (MG) and an ENT specialist (MF) (both with 11&#x000a0;years of experience), evaluated the reformatted axial and coronal images of each patient independently and separately in a blind manner.</p><p>Using a five-point subjective scale [5-excellent image quality, 4-good, 3-moderate (hardly any artefacts), 2-poor (many artefacts), 1-unacceptable], four surgically relevant anatomical structures were assessed: the course of the anterior branch of the ethmoidal artery (AEA), the course of the optical nerve (cranial nerve II; CNII) next to the sphenoid sinus, cribriform plate (CP) and lamina papyracea (LP).

Although the overall incidence of major complications is low (0&#x02013;2&#x000a0;%), minor complications occur in up to 20&#x000a0;% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The clear identification of key landmarks in this region preoperatively on CT scans minimises the risk for intra- and postoperative difficulties. The present study includes radiological identification of vital anatomical structures, the failure of which may cause the most common complications during ESS, i.e. haemorrhage, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and orbital injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The described low-dose CT protocol enabled identification of anatomy scored from 2.42 (better than poor) for cribriform plate among anosmic patients to 4.11 (better than good) for lamina papyracea in cases without nasal polyps.</p><p>Lamina papyracea was the only structure for which visibility in each of the analysed groups (i.e. among asthmatics, patients with enhanced polyposis, anosmia and history of sinus surgery) was significantly worse on low-dose than on standard-dose CT scans. Thinning and congenital or acquired defects of the LP which increase the risk of orbital damage can easily be overlooked on standard-dose CT scans and are unlikely to be identified with reduced-dose examination in the higher-risk patients, as suggested by the present data. Another consequence of insufficient pre-endoscopic visualisation of LP and the skull base is the possible limitation of the surgery resulting from greater caution on the part of the surgeon. Residual, unopened ethmoid cells at the LP are a common finding in revision ESS, even in as many as 79&#x000a0;% cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Simultaneously, recent studies suggest extending ESS range in subjects with nasal polyps and asthma to prolong the time interval until revision surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Definition of the cribriform plate was only significantly worse on low-dose scans in subjects with advanced polyposis and lack of smell. However simultaneously, CP was the poorest identified among all the important structures. The lateral lamella of the CP might only be 0.05&#x000a0;mm and this is the weakest part of the skull base and a common site of CSF leak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. An important finding during preoperative review of CT is to note the length of the lateral lamella and asymmetry of the CP, which is observed in 50&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The incidences of CSF leak during endoscopic sinus surgery are mostly the result of misjudging the anatomy. Hypothetically, this might happen more frequently in subjects with the above risk factors diagnosed with low-dose CT technique.</p><p>The detectability of the anterior ethmoid artery by reduced-dose protocols was revealed not to be significantly worse compared to standard-dose examinations. However, the AEA was the second most poorly defined anatomical structure after CP, in particular, in the opinion of the sinus surgeon. The AEA can be easily injured during surgery, which is the most frequent cause of orbital haematoma. In 40&#x000a0;% of cases, the artery has a separate osseous canal at a distance of approximately 3.5&#x000a0;mm from the skull base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Present data suggest that low-dose CT examination in some cases may not be sufficient to determine AEA location.</p><p>The optic nerve was the most visible among the analysed anatomical structures on low-dose scans independent of the group of patients. This may be explained by the relatively large nerve diameter, 0.3&#x000a0;mm thick, and rarely dehiscent (less than 8&#x000a0;%) bone coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The obtained data show that the changes resulting from previous sinus surgeries including altered anatomy, scarring and neo-osteogenesis cause a greater deterioration in image quality on low-dose scans than on standard-dose CT scans. A significant difference between protocols was found only for lamina papyracea, but identification of cribriform plate on low-dose images in reoperated subjects was also unsatisfactory. A careful study of reduced-dose CT scans appears to be particularly important in patients before revision surgery who are considered to have an increased risk of complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Both severe polyposis and loss of smell are the consequences of advanced inflammatory processes within sinuses. Similarly, coexistence of bronchial asthma and rhinosinusitis often results in enhanced nasal polyps. One could, therefore, expect convergent results in the evaluated groups of patients. A separate analysis enabled proof of the predictive value of each of the clinical parameter. On the basis of medical history (presence of anosmia, asthma or history of sinus surgery) or nasal endoscopy (detection of sever polyposis), it can be assessed whether the definition of anatomical structures will be significantly deteriorated on low-dose scans. Although anosmia is not a risk factor for intraoperative complications, it correlates well with the severity of the disease and is easy to evaluate. Previous data revealed that the self-rated olfaction function correlates significantly with measured olfactory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Both, patients with asthma and anosmia had polyps in nasal endoscopy.&#x000a0;Subjects&#x000a0;with polyps&#x000a0;graded &#x0003c;3 according to Lildholdt&#x02019;s scale presented high degree of sinuses opacification on CT scans&#x000a0;(L&#x02013;M&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;12) which influenced the image quality, and thus these cases were not excluded from the study. In future, it would be interesting, however, to examine in the similar manner&#x000a0;asthmatics without nasal polyps.</p><p>Optimisation of the radiation doses is an important issue in diagnostic radiology. Consequently, low-dose protocols are more widely used and have replaced standard settings recommended by the CT manufacturers. According to opponents, a dose of 6&#x02013;14&#x000a0;Gy required for cataract formation would be absorbed after 100&#x02013;200 standard CT examinations, which is much more than any patient is likely to receive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The risk of radiation-induced malignant neoplasms of the thyroid based on a stochastic risk is stated to be 0.0075 per Gy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This means that the likelihood of inducing a cataract or thyroid cancer after being examined with even periodically repeated standard CT scanning seems to be negligible.</p><p>Finally, an important consideration is the medico-legal consequence of a doctor&#x02019;s decisions. In this regard, it should be remembered that patients being treated for rhinosinusitis account for about 70&#x000a0;% of all malpractice claims against otolaryngologists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of complications during ESS in patients with preoperative low-dose and standard-dose protocols has not been compared yet. In the present analysis, there was only one case of palpebral ecchymosis (data not shown) in each of the groups, but the number of patients included in the study did not enable reliable conclusions to be drawn. This is, to a certain degree, a limitation of the work.</p><p>Exposure parameters used in the present comparison were chosen on the basis of our previous study on a cadaver head defining the minimum acceptable image quality and institutional ALARA (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Radiation dose for the described technique is lower than for the cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) considering the appropriate field of view (0.078 vs. 0.2&#x000a0;mSv, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The above settings correspond with results from previous reports recommending scanning at 40&#x02013;60&#x000a0;mAs for confirmation of the clinical diagnosis of sinusitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. According to some studies, such parameters reduce the radiation significantly while retaining an image quality sufficient for assessing the osseous structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In contrast to the present work, the major limitation of those researches was the use of only phantoms, cadaveric heads and the lack of clear inclusion criteria, even if the study was performed on patients.</p><p>In conclusion, the low-dose technique has a reasonable diagnostic value for screening chronic rhinosinusitis. However, in the context of planned surgical interventions, when knowledge of the individual anatomy becomes particularly important, its application should be well thought out. Higher mAs settings enable a more accurate evaluation of surgically relevant anatomical structures and should be considered, especially among those subjects with an initially higher chance of intraoperative difficulties. CT scans should alert the surgeon to the potential for injury, but it seems that low-dose protocols may not do this sufficiently well in patients with bronchial asthma, advanced nasal polyps, history of sinus surgery or anosmia. In all other uncomplicated cases, deterioration of image quality as a result of dose reduction is minor and should not preclude its use. When choosing an appropriate preoperative scanning protocol, it is worth recalling the maxim &#x0201c;The eyes see what the mind knows&#x0201d;, which is very true in the case of endoscopic sinus surgery.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>All procedures performed in the studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Informed consent</title><p>Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study.</p></sec></notes><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Fraczek M, Masalski M, Guzinski M (2016) Reliability of computed tomography scans in the diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis.
