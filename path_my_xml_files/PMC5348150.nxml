The inhibition of cellular immunity was mainly achieved through the interaction of nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> The immune cells secreted and released a variety of neuropeptide hormones, endocrine hormones, and receptors (endogenous opioid, nonopioid peptide, cortisol, and catecholamine).<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Surgical anesthesia methods might be closely related to cellular immunity in the body, and all these hormones and receptors mentioned above could inhibit the activities of immune cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and humoral immune cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup></p><p>The anesthesia method for surgery has been a major concern in plenty of cancer researches.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> General anesthesia (GA), local anesthesia, and other anesthesia methods had significant effects on postoperative immune cells activity, which may lead to tumor recurrence and metastasis so as to affect prognosis through suppressing immune cell activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Zhao et al<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> pointed out that either general anesthesia or epidural anesthesia influences cellular immunity during surgical stimulation. Epidural anesthesia is one of common methods for intraoperative and postoperative analgesia. However, it may easily lead to repetitive changes in blood pressure and heart rate (HR) during surgery, which induces hypotension or abnormalities of heart rate.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> The hemodynamic assessment has been applied to monitor the blood pressure during the period of anesthesia, and the stability of hemodynamic responses is considered an indicator of surgical outcome.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> The present clinical surgeries for GBC patients were generally applied with either general anesthesia or epidural anesthesia. But limited reports concerned about the effect of combined epidural-general anesthesia on the blood pressure, cellular immune activity for GBC patients. This study aims to investigate the effects of combined epidural and general anesthesia on intraoperative hemodynamic responses, postoperative cellular immunity, and prognosis in patients with GBC, so as to provide a promising improvement of postoperative prognosis.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Ethical statement</title><p>This clinical study was performed with the approval of the Ethics Committee at the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region People's Hospital.

Inclusion criteria: patients were younger than 80 and were classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I or II according to the ASA classification.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Patients were pathologically confirmed as GBC during or after the surgery. Patients received laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were diagnosed as stage I to IV GBC according to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC).<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Patients had no history of endocrine disease, and had not received any radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonotherapy, or blood transfusion before surgery. Exclusion criteria were hematopoietic dysfunction, autoimmune disease, immunodeficiency diseases, severe coronary heart disease, or (and) hypertension. Besides, emergency patients or patients unwilling to participate were excluded. There were 86 female patients and 58 male patients, aged 31 to 76 years, with a mean age of (47.85&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.61) years. All included patients were divided into the combined epidural and general anesthesia (CEGA) group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;72) and the GA group (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;72). There were 30 male patients and 42 female patients in the GA group, whose mean age was (48.15&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.89) years. There were 28 males and 44 females in the CEGA group, whose mean age was (47.01&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6.31) years.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Surgical approaches</title><p>Among all the 144 patients, patients with stage I GBC underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. And patients with stage II to IV GBC underwent laparoscopic radical cholecystectomy, followed by the resection of hepatic tissue within 2&#x0200a;cm around the gallbladder bed, and lymph node dissection that includes removal of the lymph nodes in the gallbladder, around the hilar, around the common bile duct, retroperitoneum, in the hepatoduodenal ligament, around the common hepatic artery, and at the posterior superior region of the pancreas head.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Anesthesia methods</title><p>Before anesthesia, all patients were injected with sodium lactate ringer solution. After intravenous infusion of Atropine (0.5&#x0200a;mg), pure oxygen inhalation was conducted via a facial mask at 6&#x0200a;L/min. The epidural puncture at the site of interspinous space between thoracic vertebrae 10 and 11 was performed for patients in the CEGA group, where 5 mL of 0.5% levobupivacaine was injected (50&#x0200a;mg/10&#x0200a;mL, Zhuhai Rundu Mintong Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Guangdong, China) with a tube inserted 4&#x0200a;cm above the puncture point. After the epidural block was identified as successful, an additional dose of local anesthetics (5&#x02013;10 mL) was injected into patients via a puncture tube. When the level of anesthesia was up to the expected level for the surgery, the induction of general anesthesia was conducted. The agents for the general anesthesia included 0.1&#x0200a;mg/kg of vecuronium bromide (Zhejiang Xianju Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Zhejiang, China), 1&#x0200a;ug/kg of remifentanil (Hubei Yichang Human-well Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Hubei, China), and 0.2&#x0200a;mg/kg of midazolam (Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Xuzhou, Jiangsu, China). The mechanical ventilation was performed after the intubation. Patients received an intravenous injection of vecuronium bromide 0.1&#x0200a;ug/(kg&#x000b7;min) and remifentanil 0.1&#x0200a;ug/(kg&#x000b7;min) to maintain anesthesia, followed by continuous inhalation of 1%&#x02013;3% sevoflurane (Maruishi Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd, Osaka, Japan). The injection of muscle relaxants was terminated 30&#x0200a;minutes before the end of surgery, and the injection of all anesthetics was terminated 10&#x0200a;minutes before the end of surgery. The induction and maintenance of anesthesia for patients in the GA group were performed as same as the CEGA group, except epidural block. Patients of both 2 groups received routine intravenous infusion.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Hemodynamic assessment</title><p>During anesthesia, the multifunctional anesthesia monitoring equipment was used to detect heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the depth of anesthesia (bispectral index [BIS]). The values of SBP, DBP, HR, and BIS were observed and recorded at 7 different time points: before anesthesia induction (t0), at intubation (t1), at the beginning of surgery (t2), 5&#x0200a;minutes after pneumoperitoneum (t3), at the end of surgery (t4), after recovery of spontaneous breathing (t5), after regaining consciousness (t6), and after extubation (t7). All patients received treatment of blood pressure control before the surgery. And timely rescue measures would be taken when adverse reactions occurred during the surgery.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Vein blood sample (6&#x0200a;mL each patient) was extracted with intravenous catheter respectively at the following 5 time points: 30&#x0200a;minutes before anesthesia induction (T1), 2&#x0200a;hours after the beginning of surgery (T2), at the end of surgery (T3), 1 day after surgery (T4), 3 days after surgery (T5). Each vein blood sample was dispensed into 2 tubes. The 4 mL sample was coagulated in a silicone tube, followed by a 15-minute centrifugation (2000&#x0200a;r/min) at 4&#x000b0;C with the Beckman Coulter high-speed centrifuge (Beckman Coulter Inc, Hialeah, FL). Then the serum was extracted, and placed into an Eppendorf (EP) tube, labeled and preserved in a &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C freezer (Sanyo, &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C cryogenic refrigerator). Meanwhile, the other 2 mL blood sample was loaded into an Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA) anticoagulant tube and stored for no more than 24&#x0200a;hours at 4&#x000b0;C. A 3-color flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter FC500; Beckman Coulter Inc, Hialeah, FL) was used to analyze the survival rates of T cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+) and natural killer (NK) cells (CD3+/CD16+CD56+). The numbers of T cell subsets were measured using PerCP-labeled mouse antihuman CD3, Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled mouse anti-human CD4, and PE-labeled mouse antihuman CD8 monoclonal antibodies (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). And the numbers of NK cells were detected with the FITC-labeled mouse antihuman CD3 and PE-labeled mouse antihuman CD16/56 monoclonal antibodies (Beckman Coulter Inc, Hialeah, FL).

Outpatient follow-up was performed for survivals. To improve the follow-up rate and get maximum real information of patients, routine outpatient follow-up and 4 fixed follow-up in the first week of 3rd, 6th, 9th, 12nd months were implemented. The follow-up of all patients should be completed within a week. Outpatient follow-up was performed if patients came to the hospital, and telephone follow-up would be applied if they could not come to hospital. All the required information should be collected by telephone and recorded continuously for 3 years until January 2015.

This study measured survival rates of T cell subsets (CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+) and NK cells before, during, and after the surgery, and found that CD3+, CD4+, CD4+/CD8+ cells of patients with combined epidural-general anesthesia were increased in contrast to these of patients with general anesthesia. The immune function of the body was consistent with the cell level of CD3+. Therefore, the elevated CD3+ level could increase the corresponding immune function of the body.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> CD4+ cell, which could secret a large number of cytokines and assist CD8+ to kill tumor cells, plays a crucial role in the antitumor immunity.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> When the cellular immune function was recovered or improved after the surgery, CD4+ was increased first, followed by an increase of CD4+/CD8+ cells. When the cellular immune function was severely damaged after the surgery, the numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells changed along with balance destruction between 2 groups. The cell immune disorders and dysfunction occurred with the reduction of immune cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> The increased volume of NK cells could improve immune function activity of the body, which contributes to a capacity of killing tumor cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Several anesthetics lead to an inhibition of cellular immunity, such as sufentanil, remifentanil, and dexmedetomidine, which indicates a correlation of cellular immunity with anesthesia.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Thus, an appropriate anesthesia method is vital for patients with cholecystectomy. In this study, both 2 anesthesia methods had suppression on the cellular immune function of patients with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. But the results showed less inhibition of T cell immunity of patients with combined epidural-general anesthesia. Thus, the combined epidural-general anesthesia might be a better choice for GBC patients.</p><p>Another important result in the study revealed that SBP, DBP, and HR values were prominently lower in the CEGA group than that in the GA group. Additionally, our findings indicated lower incidences of adverse reactions and VAS score in the CEGA group in comparison to the GA group, implying that combined epidural-general anesthesia is more effective and safe during the cholecystectomy. To our best knowledge, higher SBP is considered an important risk factor in the cancer.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> And higher DBP is also associated with the cognitive impairment.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> In consistent with our results, Khajavi et al<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> conducted a research with regard to combined epidural-general anesthesia versus general anesthesia in elective lumbar spine disk surgery, and they demonstrated that the combined anesthesia contributed to lower mean arterial blood pressure and HR, as well as reduced pain score in the combined epidural-general anesthesia group during the postoperative period. Interestingly, Senoglu et al<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> demonstrate that the patients exhibit remarkably lower heart-rate and blood-pressure levels with combined epidural analgesia and general anesthesia during laparoscopic cholecystectomy than these with the general anesthesia. As Pei et al<sup>[<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> have reported that combined epidural-general anesthesia results in a better clinical outcome through reducing the dosage of anesthetic agents to promote the intact and sustained immunological function. Based on these findings, this study further proved that combined epidural-general anesthesia contributed to more stable hemodynamic responses during surgery, and attenuated adverse reactions after surgery. Although the present study found that the survival rate of patients in the CEGA group is slightly higher than that in the GA group, this result is limited with small sample size and short-term follow-up, which still needs to be confirmed in future studies.</p><p>In summary, the combined epidural-general anesthesia might attenuate intraoperative hemodynamic responses and adverse reactions, and improve postoperative cellular immunity. The combined epidural-general anesthesia was more suitable for the immune function protection of GBC patients with a more satisfactory therapeutic effect, thereby improving the living quality and life quality of patients. However, the sample size of this study is quite small, and the follow-up is not so long to provide a stronger evidence for this finding. Furthermore, this study did not mention the immune function of the patients with noncancer cholecystectomy. Thus, more evidences should be provided with larger sample and longer follow-up in future, and a comparison of immune function between noncancer cholecystectomy and cancerous ones should also be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors show their gratitude for helpful comments on this paper received from their reviewers.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AJCC = American joint Committee on Cancer, ANOVA = one-way analysis of variance, ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, BIS = bispectral index, CEGA = combined epidural-general anesthesia, DBP = diastolic blood pressure, EDTA = ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, EP = eppendorf, GA = general anesthesia, GBC = gallbladder cancer, HR = heart rate, NK = natural killer, PONV = postoperative nausea and vomiting, SAS = sedation agitation scale, SBP = systolic blood pressure, SPSS = Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, t0 = before anesthesia induction, t1 = at intubation, T1= 0 min before anesthesia induction, T2 = 2 hours after the beginning of surgery, t2 = at the beginning of surgery, t3 = 5 minutes after pneumoperitoneum, T3 = at the end of surgery, T4 = 1 day after surgery, t4 = at the end of surgery, T5 = 3 days after surgery, t5 = after recovery of spontaneous breathing, t6 = after regaining consciousness, t7 = after extubation, TNM = tumor-node-metastasis, VAS = visual analog scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Graff</surname><given-names>AE</given-names></name><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Bear</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
