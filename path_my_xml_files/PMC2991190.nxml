Older adults were assigned to either a 3-month aerobic training group or to a control group. Individuals in the training group participated in an aerobic training program of three 60-min sessions per week. The control group did not receive any training. Results indicated that 12&#x02009;weeks of aerobic training induced a significant improvement in cardiorespiratory capacity (VO<sub>2</sub>max estimate). All participants who completed the aerobic program showed improvement after training in the choice RT task, along with enhanced preparation, such that they maintained preparation over time more efficiently after the training program. Moreover, enhanced ability to use the short PI was observed but only in lower fit individuals. Results of the present study suggest that improving aerobic fitness may enhance attentional control mechanisms in older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>aerobic training</kwd><kwd>task complexity</kwd><kwd>response preparation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="32"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="7876"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aging is accompanied by important changes in the central nervous system, which can lead to cognitive declines. In fact, substantial anatomical and physiological modifications have been observed in the frontal areas of the cerebral cortex in the aging brain (West, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1996</xref>; Raz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2000</xref>), and this has been associated with declines in attentional control (for a review, see McDowd and Shaw, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2000</xref>). The ability to prepare a speeded response, and to maintain this preparation over time, is an attentional control process that has been found to decline with age in some conditions (Salthouse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1985</xref>; Bherer and Belleville, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">b</xref>). However, recent studies have shown that age-related cognitive decline is heterogeneous among older individuals and that lifestyle factors, such as physical exercise, can modulate the impact of aging on cognition (Kramer et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2004</xref>; Hertzog et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2009</xref>). The present study assessed whether a physical exercise program can lead to significant changes in attentional control mechanisms that support response preparation.</p><p>Cross-sectional studies have suggested that physical activity can be an important moderator of age-related cognitive decline. For instance, Spirduso (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">1975</xref>) observed that older racquet and handball players were faster in both simple and choice reaction time (RT) tasks compared to age-matched non-players. Clarkson-Smith and Hartley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">1989</xref>) also observed faster RTs in physically active elderly participants than in sedentary older adults (for similar results in women aged over 60, see Abourezk and Toole, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1995</xref>).</p><p>Further evidence for the moderating effect of physical activity on age-related cognitive declines stems from intervention studies. Dustman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1984</xref>) compared middle age and older individuals that completed a 4-month training program to an age-matched control group that engaged in strength and flexibility exercises, and a control group that did not exercise. Improvements in cardiorespiratory function were found in the training group only, along with improvements in a simple RT task. Similar results were obtained in women aged 57&#x02013;85&#x02009;years old, following a 3-year physical training program (Rikli and Edwards, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1991</xref>). Hawkins et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">1992</xref>) reported that, in older adults, a 10-week aquatic fitness program, led to larger improvement in tasks conditions that tap dual-task and switching abilities compared to conditions that do not require executive or attentional control processes. Kramer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1999</xref>) also observed that after a 6-month walking program, participants (aged 65&#x02013;70&#x02009;years old) showed significant improvement in task conditions that required executive or controlled functions. These findings have been further supported in a recent meta-analysis on 18 intervention studies with participants aged 60&#x02009;years and older (see Colcombe and Kramer, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2003</xref>; but see Etnier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2006</xref> for different conclusions).</p><p>Most of the studies reported previously suggest that in older adults, enhancing aerobic fitness leads to significant improvement in attentional control functions. However, some of them that used RT paradigms, reported equivalent improvement after training, in both simple and choice RT tasks. This observation is at odds with the assumption that fitness training has a larger impact on the controlled aspect of cognition, which should lead to larger training effects on choice compared to simple RT tasks (Hall et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2001</xref>). Surprisingly, few studies have directly compared improvement in simple and choice RT tasks after aerobic fitness training. Moreover, RT tasks often vary among studies in term of decision complexity and the ability to predict the moment at which a stimulus will occur. Indeed, RT tasks may engage controlled aspects of attention before the stimulus occurrence if anticipation or response preparation can take place (Niemi and N&#x000e4;&#x000e4;t&#x000e4;nen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1981</xref>).</p><p>Preparatory processes are a voluntary or attention-demanding set of strategic behaviors that support an optimal processing state prior to the execution of movement (Stuss et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1995</xref>). In a cross-sectional study, Hillman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2002</xref>) observed reduced amplitude of the contingent negative variation (CNV), an electrophysiological marker of response preparation, in young and old physically fit participants compared to sedentary individuals. The authors argued that older adults with better aerobic fitness level engaged less cognitive resources than sedentary individuals to prepare a speeded response. In a more recent study, Renaud et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>) observed better response preparation in high fit compared to low fit older adults, particularly when response preparation needed to be maintained over several seconds. Together, these cross-sectional studies suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with more efficient response preparation processes. However, to date, no intervention study has supported this observation, which limits our understanding of how improved cardiovascular fitness influences response preparation processes.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate whether sedentary older adults who participate in an aerobic fitness training program would demonstrate enhanced performances in a simple and a choice RT task. The temporal parameters of the RT tasks were varied to generate specific preparatory effects that have been shown to be affected in normal aging (Salthouse, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1985</xref>; Bherer and Belleville, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">b</xref>). Moreover, based on findings from a recent study (Renaud et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>) that showed that a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with better response preparation, another goal of the present study was to assess the effect of baseline physical fitness level on the impact of aerobic training on response preparation. In addition, the tasks used in the present study also provide a measure of both initiation and execution times. These measures allow for the distinction between improvements in attentional control processes involved in response preparation and improvements in motor speed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Prior to acceptance in the study, all the participants completed a telephone interview evaluating their physical health. Participants also completed the modified Questionnaire of aptitude to physical activity (QAA-P), a screening instrument used to detect individuals who may be at risk if they engage in intense physical activity, and the Modifiable Activity Questionnaire (MAQ; Vuillemin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2000</xref>) to evaluate their level of physical activity over the 12 past months. All participants met the criteria of sedentary older adults, as they engaged in physical activity less than two times a week.</p><p>Participants were excluded if they reported: a history of neurological disease or major surgery in the year preceding the study; auditory or visual impairments that have not been corrected; cardiovascular disease or vascular peripheral attacks, and/or moderate to severe hypertension. To exclude individuals with dementia or depression, participants completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE, Folstein et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">1975</xref>, cut-off score of 26/30), and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (Yesavage et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">1983</xref>, cut-off score of 11). General verbal and mental abilities were also assessed (Similarities subtest of the WAIS-III, Wechsler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">1997</xref>).</p><p>Seventy-seven older adults were recruited through advertizing announcements and posters in community centers in the Montreal area. Ten participants did not meet the inclusion criteria. Of the remaining 67, 32 participants were assigned to the experimental group and 35 were assigned to the control group that did not receive any intervention. Assignment was based on the order of recruitment in the study and on participants&#x02019; willingness to engage in a 3-month fitness training program. Seventeen individuals (7 assigned to the training group and 10 to the control) decided not to engage in the study for personal reasons after completing the pre-test session. In the training group, there was no difference in baseline characteristics between the seven individuals who discontinued and those who remained in the study (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In the control group, those who discontinued were older (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and had lower scores (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) on the Similarities subtest of the WAIS-III than those who participated. All the individuals that accepted to participate completed the entire study. In the training group, percentage of attendance to the training sessions was 86.58%. The training group was composed of 21 women and 4 men with a mean age of 67.80&#x02009;years (SD =&#x02009;6.60) and 14.36&#x02009;years (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.17) of formal education. The control group was also composed of 21 women and 4 men, with a mean age of 67.72&#x02009;years (SD =&#x02009;6.01) and 12.92&#x02009;years (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.61) of formal education. The groups were equivalent on a five-point health-rating scale (5&#x02009;= excellent). Training and control participants mean ratings were 4.21 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.74) and 4.17 (SD&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.72) respectively.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>Participants&#x02019; baseline characteristics as a function of baseline fitness level</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control group</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Training group</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lower fit</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Higher fit</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lower fit</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Higher fit</th></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>M</italic> (SD)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>M</italic> (SD)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>M</italic> (SD)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>M</italic> (SD)</th></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.00 (6.09)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.82 (4.69)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">72.82 (5.56)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.86 (4.31)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="tfn1">*</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Education</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.36 (2.31)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.64 (2.91)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.09 (5.28)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.57 (3.25)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MMSE</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.43 (1.02)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.82 (1.25)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.64 (1.12)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.64 (1.08)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>VERBAL INTELLIGENCE</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Similarities</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.50 (3.98)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.45 (5.03)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.36 (5.99)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.21 (4.17)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>MOOD ASSESSMENT</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GDS</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.29 (3.41)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.55 (5.36)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.64 (1.43)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.33 (3.41)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><bold>FITNESS ASSESSMENT</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MAQ</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.04 (1.97)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.72 (3.34)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.57 (5.68)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.46 (2.96)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tfn1"><p>*<italic>Age difference between the two groups that differed on baseline fitness level p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;<italic>0.001</italic>.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>In a first testing session, participants signed a consent form and completed all screening tests and questionnaires. In a second session all participants completed the simple and the choice RT tasks, followed by a test of cardiorespiratory fitness (Rockport one-mile test; Kline et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1987</xref>). After these pre-tests, the training group participated in a 12-week aerobic fitness program. After the 12-week period, both the training and the control groups completed a post-test session that included the simple and choice RT tasks and the cardiorespiratory fitness walking test. The study was completed within a 14-week period (1&#x02009;week of pre-testing, 12&#x02009;weeks of training, 1&#x02009;week of post-testing).</p></sec><sec><title>Aerobic fitness program</title><p>Training group participants engaged in a 3-month physical exercise program with three, 1&#x02009;h training sessions per week. During each training session, participants performed different physical activity routines that involved stretching and cardiorespiratory exercises (fast walking and aerobic dancing). Participants did not have a choice in the activities they were enroled in. Basic principles and guidelines for exercise programming (Nelson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2007</xref>) were followed, including adequate warm-up and cool-down periods, progressive and gradual increments in exercise duration and energy expenditure. Duration of cardiorespiratory exercise was also gradually increased during the training program, beginning at 15&#x02009;min per session and increasing until participants were exercising for 40&#x02009;min per session. The training sessions were conducted by two professional kinesiologists.</p></sec><sec><title>Pre- and post-test measures</title><sec><title>Cardiorespiratory fitness assessment</title><p>The Rockport one-mile test (Kline et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1987</xref>) was used to assess cardiorespiratory fitness. This walking test provides an accurate estimate of the maximum level of oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>max). Kline et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1987</xref>) have reported a strong correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88) between the Rockport estimated VO<sub>2</sub>max and a direct measure of VO<sub>2</sub>max during an increment test on a treadmill. For the Rockport one-mile test, participants were instructed to walk one mile without stopping, as fast as possible. They were equipped with a Polar S120 Heart rate Monitor (Polar Electro, Lake Success, NY, USA). The time required to complete the distance was manually recorded on a stopwatch. Heart rate frequency was recorded 1&#x02009;min after the end of the walking test. VO<sub>2</sub>max was estimated using the equation provided by Kline et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1987</xref>)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1"><sup>1</sup></xref> that takes into account participants&#x02019; weight, age, sex, cardiac frequency post-exercise, and time taken to cover the one-mile distance.</p></sec><sec><title>Simple and choice RT tasks</title><p>Response preparation was assessed with a RT paradigm that has shown age-related differences in response preparation (Bherer and Belleville, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">b</xref>). To begin each simple and choice RT trial participants pressed a central button on a response box with the index finger. During each trial, they had to keep the home key depressed until the response signal occurred. An auditory signal occurring at the beginning of the trial served as a preparatory signal. The response signal was a black circle appearing in the center of the screen (simple RT) or either on the right or the left side of a white circle located in the center of the screen (choice RT; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the simple RT task, the participant had to press the response key located on the right side of the home key with the index finger. In the choice RT task, the response button corresponded to the position of the black circle (left or right). In both, the choice and the simple RT tasks, temporal preparation was assessed using preparatory intervals (PI) embedded in a short (PI of 1, 3, 5&#x02009;s) and a long (PI of 5, 7, 9&#x02009;s) temporal window. In each window, the three PIs varied randomly and unexpectedly between trials. This procedure produces preparatory functions according to which response time decreases as the PI increases. Thus, as the probability of the response stimulus increases there is increased response preparation. In fact, if three PIs are used randomly, the probability that a response must be provided at the 1st PI is 0.33. If nothing occurs at the 1st PI, probability increases to 0.50 at the 2nd PI. If no signal occurs at the 2nd PI, the probability that it will occur at the 3rd PI is 1.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Figural description of the response preparation task</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnagi-02-00148-g001"/></fig><p>The presentation order of the long and short duration conditions was counterbalanced across participants. Participants were asked to respond as quickly and accurately as possible to each trial. Dependent variables were initiation time (IT), which corresponds to the latency elapsed between the response signal and the release of the home key, and execution time (ET), measured by the time to move from the home key to the response key. Error rates were also recorded.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>To assess the effect of baseline fitness level on training outcomes, all participants were categorized as higher or lower fit individuals based on a median split using the estimated VO<sub>2</sub>max score at baseline.

IT corresponds to the latency elapsed between the moment where the response signal (the black circle) appears on the screen and the moment at which the participant releases the home key. ET was measured from the moment the participant raises the index from the home key and presses the response key. Only RTs for correct responses were included in the analyses and trials were excluded from the analyses if IT was shorter than 100&#x02009;ms or global RT was longer than 3000&#x02009;ms. Two types of errors can be produced in the RT tasks. Incorrect responses occur in the choice RT task and anticipation errors occur in both simple and choice RT tasks. In the choice RT task, participants produced virtually no incorrect responses. In fact, only two participants in the control group made one error at post-test. In general, participants made very few anticipation errors (leaving the home key before the response stimulus actually occurred). In the simple RT task, the mean number of anticipation errors at pre-test was 0.05 for the training group (lower fit: 0.06; higher fit: 0.04) and 0.04 for the control group (lower fit: 0.05; higher fit: 0.02). At post-test, the mean number of anticipation errors was 0.04 for the training group (lower fit: 0.06; higher fit: 0.02) and 0.09 for the control group (lower fit: 0.03; higher fit: 0.17). The mean number of anticipation errors in the choice RT task was 0.03 for the training group (lower fit: 0.04; higher fit: 0.05) and 0.03 for the control group (lower fit: 0.04; higher fit: 0.02) at pre-test, and at post-test, 0.02 for the training group (lower fit: 0.02; higher fit: 0.02) and 0.07 for the control group (lower fit: 0.03; higher fit: 0.11). Anticipation errors were submitted to non-parametric tests (Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis), which revealed that experimental groups produced a comparable number of anticipation errors and obtained similar anticipation scores in the simple RT task at pre-test, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50)&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.36, ns, and post-test, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (3, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50)&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.46, ns.

The cardiorespiratory fitness level assessed with the Rockport one-mile test (Kline et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1987</xref>) indicated that 3&#x02009;months of physical exercise lead to a 25 % increase in physical fitness level. This suggests that even between 60 and 80&#x02009;years of age, engaging in a physical fitness training program engenders strong benefits in cardiorespiratory function.</p><p>One goal of the present study was to assess the effect of aerobic fitness training in RT tasks while taking into account task complexity (simple vs. choice RT tasks). Past studies suggested that physical fitness should be associated to better performances in more complex tasks, because those tasks require controlled and effortful cognitive processing (Hall et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2001</xref>). The results reported in this study are consistent with this view. After the 3-month aerobic training program, improvement in initiation time was more important in the choice than in the simple RT task, thus suggesting that a speeded task that engages more cognitive processes would show greater improvement after training.</p><p>Another important question addressed in the present study was the effect of an aerobic training program on response preparation processes. Salthouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">1985</xref>) proposed two forms of inefficient preparation in normal aging: an incapacity to develop an optimal prepared state rapidly and an inability to maintain preparation over a certain period of time. Other studies have suggested that response preparation deficits could also be observed in older adults due to an inability to prepare for unlikely events (Bherer and Belleville, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">b</xref>). The RT tasks used in the present study were designed to assess these three types of preparation deficits. In these tasks, a warning signal indicated to the participant to prepare for a speeded response to an upcoming stimulus, occurring after three PI of different durations. Within each temporal window, PIs varied randomly and could vary from 1, 3, or 5&#x02009;s in the short duration window or from 5, 7, or 9&#x02009;s in the long duration window. With such a variable PI paradigm, preparation depends upon the probability of stimulus occurrence, which increases with time after the warning signal has been presented. This produces a preparatory function according to which RT gets faster as PI duration increases within a given temporal window (Niemi and N&#x000e4;&#x000e4;t&#x000e4;nen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">1981</xref>).</p><p>The results observed in the present study suggest that an aerobic training intervention can lead to significant improvement in response preparation deficits in many ways, and that in some conditions, the improvement depends on the baseline fitness level of the participants. After controlling for age difference among higher and lower fit individuals, lower fit individuals that completed the aerobic training program showed better response preparation at the 2nd and the 3rd PI of the short temporal window of the choice RT task, suggesting enhanced ability to use stimulus probability. Moreover, all participants that completed the training program showed better performance in the long temporal window of the choice RT task, suggesting that they were better at maintaining a high level of preparation over time after the training program. The enhanced ability to maintain preparation over time was independent of the baseline fitness level.</p><p>These results bring further support to Hillman et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2002</xref>) findings that more active older and younger adults tend to show more efficient and less effortful response preparation than lower fit individuals in speeded RT tasks. In line with this finding, Renaud et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>) used a cross-sectional design to compare the performances of lower and higher fit individuals in tasks that were similar to the one used in the present study. They observed that participants with higher levels of fitness responded faster at the shortest intervals of the short temporal window. Moreover, higher fit individuals were able to better maintain a higher level of preparation for a long period of time, up to 9&#x02009;s. The interpretation of these results was limited by the very nature of a cross-sectional design. Results of the present study bring additional support to these findings by showing that a 3-month exercise training program leads to significant improvement in response preparation. To our knowledge, it is the first intervention study to show that response preparation can be enhanced in older adults after an aerobic fitness training program.</p><p>One limitation of the present study is that the control group did not receive any form of intervention. One may argue that the effects of the intervention could be attributed to other factors than the aerobic intervention. For example, the training group was getting significantly more social interaction and this interaction could have contributed to improve cognition. However, other studies have controlled for this aspect and still found significant training effects. For instance, Kramer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">1999</xref>) assessed cognitive performances of sedentary older adults aged between 60 and 75&#x02009;years old who were randomly assigned to an aerobic (walking) or a stretching and toning exercise group. They found that the participants who received aerobic training showed substantial improvement in attentional control tasks, which was not observed in the anaerobic group (for similar results see Dustman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">1984</xref>). These results suggest that social interaction may not be sufficient to improve cognitive performances in the context of exercise training intervention.</p><p>This study provides further support to the notion that cardiorespiratory fitness may offer a protective buffer against age-related cognitive decline. Evidence from neuroimaging studies could help to explain why executive control functions tend to benefit more readily from fitness training. It has been shown that enhanced cardiovascular functions after aerobic training are associated with greater task-relevant activity in brain areas recruited in an attentional control task (Colcombe et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2004a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2006</xref>). Thus, cardiorespiratory fitness has significant effects on brain regions that are strongly associated with the integrity of attentional control processes, such as those required in speeded response preparation tasks (Stuss et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">1995</xref>).</p><p>Executive control functions are vital to the human autonomy, and although there is evidence for decline in these functions with advancing age, the results of the present study suggest that physical activity could be used as an intervention tool to attenuate this decline. The advantage of physical activity programs is that they can be relatively inexpensive, are accessible, and easy to begin at any age. Many everyday activities, such as driving, entail substantial executive controls demands. Indeed, the response preparation task using variable PIs design appears to reflect real-life demands as we often have to anticipate and prepare fast and accurate responses (e.g., at an intersection the yellow light warns the driver that a stop will soon be required). An important question for future research would be to see if the training benefits observed in experimental tasks as used in the present study transfer to everyday situations.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a grant from the Institut universitaire de g&#x000e9;riatrie de Montr&#x000e9;al (CAREC program) and a scientist fellowship from the Fonds de Recherche en Sant&#x000e9; du Qu&#x000e9;bec to Louis Bherer.
