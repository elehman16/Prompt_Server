Various options are available, with the most efficacious and widely used being talc pleurodesis. Talc can either be applied via a chest drain in the form of slurry, or at medical thoracoscopy using poudrage. Current evidence regarding which method is most effective is conflicting and often methodologically flawed. The TAPPS trial is a suitably powered, multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial designed to compare the pleurodesis success rate of medical thoracoscopy and talc poudrage with chest drain insertion and talc slurry.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>330 patients with a confirmed MPE requiring intervention will be recruited from UK hospitals. Patients will be randomised (1:1) to undergo either small bore (&#x0003c;14&#x02005;Fr) Seldinger chest drain insertion followed by instillation of sterile talc (4&#x02005;g), or to undergo medical thoracoscopy and simultaneous poudrage (4&#x02005;g). The allocated procedure will be performed as an inpatient within 3&#x02005;days of randomisation taking place. Following discharge, patients will be followed up at regular intervals for 6&#x02005;months. The primary outcome measure is pleurodesis failure rates at 3&#x02005;months. Pleurodesis failure is defined as the need for further pleural intervention for fluid management on the side of the trial intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial has received ethical approval from the National Research Ethics Service Committee North West&#x02014;Preston (12/NW/0467). There is a trial steering committee which includes independent members and a patient and public representative. The trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and presented at international conferences, as well as being disseminated via local and national charities and patient groups. All participants who wish to know the study results will also be contacted directly on their publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN47845793.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pleurodesis</kwd><kwd>Malignant pleural effusion</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Talc</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Suitably powered multicentre, randomised controlled trial of talc pleurodesis interventions in the general malignant pleural effusion population.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First study to specifically investigate poudrage using medical thoracoscopy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Robust 6-month patient follow-up.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinically relevant and applicable definition of pleurodesis success.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Pleurodesis performed as part of diagnostic thoracoscopy not included.</p></list-item><list-item><p>No comparison with indwelling pleural catheters.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pleural effusions are a common complication of many cancers, with symptoms often requiring intervention. Data from 10&#x02005;years ago suggest that there are up to 175&#x02005;000 new cases of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) in the USA per year and around 40&#x02005;000 cases per year in the UK,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> although these figures may now be conservative as the global burden of malignancy continues to rise each year, and with it the incidence of MPE.</p><p>Pleurodesis is the adherence of the visceral and parietal pleura, which causes an obliteration of the pleural space. Removing the pleural space reduces the possibility of pleural fluid build-up, which means that induction of pleurodesis is considered the mainstay of treatment for recurrent MPE. Many substances have been shown to induce chemical pleurodesis, although by far the most commonly used one in Europe and North America is talc, which has been shown to be superior to alternatives such as tetracycline or bleomycin.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Overall, pleurodesis success rates with talc are typically high, ranging from 81% to 100%,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> although this efficacy may vary considerably in real-world practice due to differences between clinicians and individual centres. The traditional method to instil talc, the control arm in this study, requires a patient to be admitted to hospital for chest tube insertion and fluid drainage. Talc is administered as slurry and is made up with a physiologically inert fluid such as 0.9% saline. The chest tube is removed once subsequent drainage volumes become low, potentially indicating successful pleurodesis.</p><p>An alternative to this approach is the application of sterile talc powder under direct vision at thoracoscopy (insufflation or poudrage). However, despite an increasing number of hospitals having access to medical thoracoscopy, it is still much less ubiquitous than Seldinger chest drain insertion, with the requirement for specialist training and the increased costs of the procedure being major limitations, along with the more complex nature of the procedure. The efficacy of talc poudrage at 1&#x02005;month for pleurodesis has been documented in a number of studies. Published success rates tend to lie around 85%, although there is significant heterogeneity between study groups limiting reliability. A number of studies regarding talc slurry and talc poudrage were compared as part of the 2004 Cochrane review which, along with suggesting talc was the most efficacious sclerosant, found talc poudrage at thoracoscopy to have an improved relative risk of non-recurrence (1.19) over talc slurry.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A subsequent large randomised trial by Dresler, published in 2005, suggested there was only a trend towards superiority of poudrage (p=0.1), with no significant overall difference between the two methods. Post hoc subgroup analysis demonstrated a rise in pleurodesis success once patients with trapped lung were excluded, as well as a significant difference between poudrage (82%) and slurry (71%; p=0.045).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>The role of talc poudrage for the induction of pleurodesis and the prevention of fluid recurrence in MPE remains unclear. Chest drain insertion with talc slurry is universally available, less expensive and relatively easy to perform, but may have a significantly poorer success rate and may result in longer hospital stays. The TAPPS trial aims to definitively resolve the question of whether talc poudrage is a superior method for the induction of pleurodesis in MPE, allowing clinicians to make the most appropriate and best informed decisions and recommendations to patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This study, evaluating the efficacy of thoracoscopy and talc poudrage versus pleurodesis using talc slurry (TAPPS trial), is a multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial. The trial is sponsored by the North Bristol NHS Trust (NBT) and coordinated jointly by the Academic Respiratory Unit at the University of Bristol and the Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit (ORTU) at the University of Oxford. Data management is undertaken by the ORTU. The trial is registered on the International Standardised Randomised Controlled Trial Registry (ISRCTN47845793) and funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Health Technology Assessment programme. The study is included in the NIHR Clinical Research Network portfolio (ID: 12537). The trial will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and good clinical practice (GCP).</p><p>The primary research question is: For patients with a confirmed MPE and good performance status, does thoracoscopy and talc poudrage increase the proportion of patients with successful pleurodesis at 3&#x02005;months postprocedure, when compared with standard therapy with chest drain insertion and talc slurry instillation?</p><p>The secondary research questions are:

A suitable site for drain placement will be identified using contemporaneous ultrasound. Drains will only be inserted by persons with adequate training and experience. Trial pleural fluid samples (see section below) should also be taken as necessary.</p><p>A CXR should be performed between 18 and 24&#x02005;h after drain insertion. If there is no evidence of trapped lung or significant fluid, as determined by the patient's primary physician, then the patient should have 4&#x02005;g talc slurry instilled through the chest drain, following the appropriate TSP. Patients who continue to have evidence of significant pleural opacification may need to undergo further imaging to confirm the cause. If the significant component of the opacification is felt to be due to pleural thickening rather than fluid, then slurry instillation should proceed according to the TSP.</p><p>Patients who have evidence of trapped lung, or who have significant opacification due to fluid on CXR, may have thoracic suction applied if it is felt appropriate. Patients should undergo slurry instillation once the primary physician is satisfied that at least 50% of the visible pleura are apposed. If, by 48&#x02005;h post drain insertion, there is inadequate pleural apposition on CXR, or the primary physician feels that talc slurry instillation would be inappropriate for another reason, then further management decisions lie with the primary physician. Such patients should continue to receive follow-up in the standard manner and should have all treatment decisions clearly documented. A flow chart for patient management in the control arm is provided (see online supplementary appendix 5).</p><p>Following slurry instillation, thoracic suction should be applied if available and tolerated. Once documented drainage falls below 250&#x02005;mL per 24&#x02005;h (in the presence of a patent drain), the drain should be removed, unless the primary physician feels there is reason for the drain to remain in place for longer. Following drain removal, a further CXR should be performed and an appointment given for the first trial follow-up visit at 1-month postrandomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2h2"><title>Intervention (talc poudrage) arm</title><p>All participants who undergo thoracoscopy will have their procedure performed by persons with adequate training and experience. Patients will be given adequate sedation (if required) and local anaesthetic for the procedure. Biopsy samples will be taken as needed. Trial pleural fluid samples (see section below) should also be taken as necessary. At the end of the procedure, 4&#x02005;g of sterile talc should be sprayed over the pleural surfaces. A 16&#x02013;24&#x02005;Fr chest drain should be inserted at the end of the procedure and connected to an underwater seal. Patients should be attached to thoracic suction, if available and tolerated.</p><p>The future care decisions of any patient whose procedure is abandoned or curtailed before poudrage is performed (at the discretion of the operator) remain with the primary physician. Such patients will remain under trial follow-up and should have all care decisions and associated delays clearly documented in their notes.</p><p>A CXR should be performed between 18 and 24&#x02005;h after drain insertion to assess lung re-expansion. If there is evidence of incomplete re-expansion, then drain patency should be checked. The management of patients with incomplete lung expansion is at the discretion of the primary physician, and may include the continued use of thoracic suction.</p><p>All patients&#x02019; drains should remain in place for a minimum of 24&#x02005;h. When a patient has drained 250&#x02005;mL or less in the previous 24&#x02005;h, then the drain should be removed, unless the primary physician feels that it needs to remain in place for longer. A flow chart for patient management in the intervention arm is provided (see online supplementary appendix 7).

Patients at North Bristol and Oxford should also have 2 EDTA, 1 serum gel and 1 lithium heparin tube filled with pleural fluid during either thoracoscopy or initial drain insertion (&#x02018;trial pleural fluid samples&#x02019;). At these sites, trial blood and pleural fluid samples should be centrifuged, labelled and stored locally initially as per the appropriate TSP. All processed samples will eventually be transferred to the Respiratory Research Unit at North Bristol. Genetic compositional analysis may also be undertaken on participants&#x02019; samples if specific consent for this has been obtained.</p><p>Additionally, on the second day post talc administration (or on discharge if sooner), patients should have blood samples taken and analysed locally for C reactive protein, full blood count, and urea and electrolytes, with the results entered onto the discharge case report form.</p></sec><sec id="s2i4"><title>Trial follow-up appointments</title><p>Trial follow-up appointments will take place at 1-month, 3-month and 6&#x02005;month postrandomisation, with telephone follow-ups being performed if necessary.

If fluid is confirmed, and the CXR shows pleural opacification to be one-third or greater than the volume of the hemithorax (by visual estimation), the primary physician should undertake any further investigations or interventions as deemed appropriate. In patients who have less than one-third of the hemithorax occupied by pleural fluid, the primary physician should discuss with another local physician who is blinded to the treatment arm whether pleural intervention is required.</p></sec><sec id="s2i6"><title>Data management</title><p>Clinical Record Forms (CRF) will be completed by the trial team at recruiting centres and sent to the ORTU.
