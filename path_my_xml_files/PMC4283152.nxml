Main risk factors include hypercholesterolemia, which is caused in most cases by a high saturated fat diet. Plant stanol esters partly block cholesterol absorption in the digestive tract and thereby reduce total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol serum levels. Based on epidemiological data, a 10 percent reduction of LDL cholesterol leads to a 20 percent decrease in the coronary heart disease risk throughout life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of yogurt drink with added plant stanol esters (Benecol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> yogurt drink) in higher doses than the typically used (2g/d stanols), in lowering blood lipids in moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A randomized double-blind crossover, placebo-controlled study in moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) aged between 20 and 50&#x000a0;years old.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Yogurt drink with added plant stanols (4&#x000a0;g) as esters (Benecol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Colanta) consumption compared to regular yogurt drink caused a statistically significant decrease in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 7.2% and 10.3%.

Structurally, they are similar to cholesterol, but their absorption rate is much lower. Foods with added plant stanol esters, which could be cholesterol-lowering functional foods, provide the consumer an opportunity for cardiovascular disease prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The cholesterol-lowering mechanism of plant sterols and plant stanols lies in the reduced intestinal absorption due to a replacement of cholesterol in intestinal micelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The structural similarities to cholesterol are responsible for both hypocholesterolemic effects and also lowered absorption at the intestinal level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Tests indicate an intestinal effect that decreases cholesterol absorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], which gains an important place in strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Several clinical studies show that plant stanol esters are effective for lowering plasma total and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and this reduction occurs within two to three weeks after including foods with added dietary plant stanol esters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. With a regular consumption, the effect remains constant at least up to a year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A meta-analysis of both plant stanol and plant sterol ester studies yielded on average an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol for a mean daily dose of 2.15&#x000a0;g phytosterols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Such a reduction in LDL-C is beneficial for cardiovascular health. Based on epidemiological data, a 10 percent reduction of LDL cholesterol leads to a 20 percent decrease in the coronary heart disease risk throughout life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>A review of clinical evidence supports the notion that higher doses than currently recommended of plant stanol esters could have a dose-effect relationship between consumption and reduced serum LDL cholesterol concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 113 publications suggests that an ingestion of more than 2&#x000a0;g/day of plant stanols is associated with an additional LDL-C reduction compared to the lower doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The recent European Food Safety Authority Panel in Dietetic Products, Nutrition, and Allergies concluded that plant stanol esters at a daily intake of three grams (range 2.7&#x000a0;g to 3.3&#x000a0;g) lowered LDL-cholesterol by 11.4 percent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Here, we evaluated the efficacy of a yogurt drink with added plant stanols as esters (in Benecol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Colanta) in higher than the typically recommended dose in reducing total and LDL cholesterol in Colombian subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia.

However, the subjects might not have consumed the yogurt drink immediately after a meal and thus the liquid nature of the food product might have influenced the cholesterol-lowering efficacy. This may be the case as in the previous studies using yogurt drinks as the cholesterol-lowering efficacy is achieved by smaller doses of plant stanols. In the study by Algorta-Pineda and co-workers, a 10.3 percent reduction in LDL-cholesterol and in the study by Krienginyos, a 13.5 percent reduction was achieved by two grams of plant stanols in a yogurt drink [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

A sample size of 38 subjects will have 90% power to detect the 8% difference between Benecol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and placebo treatments statistically significant with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. The differences of 10% and 12% between Benecol<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and placebo would require smaller sample sizes, 25 and 17 subjects, respectively.</p><p>Baseline characteristics for subjects in the two treatment sequences were compared using Chi-squared test for categorical variables, Mann-Whitney U test for laboratory safety variables and t-test for independent samples for other continuous variables.</p><p>Serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (both direct measured and calculated by Friedewald equation) were the primary outcome variables. Serum HDL-cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides (TG) were the secondary outcome variables. The primary and secondary variables were evaluated after the run-in period (before the first treatment period) referred to as the &#x0201c;first-period baseline&#x0201d; and at the end of each treatment period, referred to as &#x0201c;end of treatment&#x0201d;.</p><p>For all serum lipids both absolute values (mg/dl) at the end of treatments and percentage change (% change) from first-period baseline were analyzed. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) for cross-over designs was used to test the effects of treatment, period, and carry-over. Although there were no significant period or carry-over effects for lipid variables expressed as absolute value or percentage change, the order of treatments was included in all models. The results are given as means with 95% confidence intervals. The distribution of serum triglyceride (mg/dl) was skew to the right and the analysis was repeated using the logarithmically transformed values. Statistical analyses were performed according to the intention to treat. All tests were two-sided and a p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered to indicate a significant difference. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics (version 22.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Authors&#x02019; information</title><p>Elsa Maria Vasquez-Trespalacios.
