Nitric oxide (NO) promotes redistribution of blood flow to the ventilated areas and decreases the pulmonary shunt effect improving oxygenation.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To evaluate the effects of 10 ppm of inhaled nitric oxide, combined to two ventilation modalities - pressure-controlled ventilation and volume-controlled ventilation - on the respiratory function of 40 patients undergoing heart surgery with extracorporeal circulation and respiratory dysfunction characterized by PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio &#x0003c;200 in postoperative heart surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>The patients were randomized into four groups: PCVNO group, pressure controlled ventilation with NO; PCVWNO group, pressure-controlled ventilation without NO; VCVWNO group, volume-controlled ventilation without NO; and VCVNO group, volume-controlled ventilation with NO. Evaluations were performed at times zero (baseline), 60, 120, 240 and 360 min. NO was administered in all times for groups I and IV.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There were no significant changes in hemodynamic parameters, peak inspired pressure and oxygenation among the groups. There was a significant difference in the four groups for the following parameters throughout the different times: systolic pulmonary pressure (SPP); diastolic pulmonary pressure (DPP); mean pulmonary pressure (MPP); systolic systemic pressure (SSP); mean blood pressure (PBP); transpulmonary gradient (TPG); pulmonary/systemic vascular resistance index (PVRI/SVRI); ratio of partial arterial oxygen pressure and fractional inspired oxygen concentration (PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>); partial arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO<sub>2</sub>); oxygen consumption index (VO<sub>2</sub>I); pulmonary shunt (Qs/Qt); oxygen extraction rate (O<sub>2</sub>ER); alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (A-aO<sub>2</sub>)G; and pulmonary compliance (Cst) expressed by hemodynamic and oxygenation improvement.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>No significant differences were observed for hemodynamic and respiratory parameters and those related to respiratory mechanics, when volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) was compared to pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV). NO inhalation did not show significant improvement in blood oxygenation of the studied patients. Ventilation time seems to have had a favorable influence on the clinical course. Ideal PEEP was calculated for all patients prior to the study</p></sec></body></article>
