<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref> With current biologic therapies approaching patent expiration, there has been considerable interest in developing biosimilar products, which are highly similar but not identical and not &#x02018;bioidentical&#x02019;, to approved &#x02018;reference&#x02019; agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref></p><p>CT-P13 is an IgG1 chimeric human-murine mAb biosimilar to INX. CT-P13 is produced in the same type of cell-line (Sp2/0-AG14&#x02014;purchased from ATCC, Cat. CRL-1581) and has an identical amino acid sequence to INX. CT-P13 and INX have demonstrated comparable in vitro primary pharmacodynamics (PD) in a range of studies (CELLTRION, Inc. Unpublished data (see online supplementary appendix A)). CT-P13 and INX showed comparable binding affinities to monomeric and trimeric forms of human TNF&#x003b1; (hTNF&#x003b1;), transgenic mouse hTNF&#x003b1; (tmhTNF&#x003b1;) expressed by Jurkat cells and to Fc&#x003b3; receptors and FcRn. Comparable hTNF&#x003b1; neutralising activity against a TNF&#x003b1;-sensitive mouse sarcoma cell-line (WEHI-164) has also been demonstrated. CT-P13 and INX are also comparable in terms of: lack of binding activity to human TNF&#x003b2; and TNF&#x003b1; from a range of different species known not to bind infliximab; relative binding affinities to complement protein C1q; and complement-dependent cytotoxicity effects and apoptotic effects against a Jurkat T-cell-line expressing tmhTNF&#x003b1;. Comparable cytotoxic activities have been achieved as a result of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity evaluation of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells against tmhTNF &#x003b1;-Jurkat T cells, demonstrating biosimilarity of CT-P13 and INX. Highly comparable human tissue cross-reactivity results have been observed for biotinylated CT-P13 and INX.</p><p>According to biosimilar guidelines from European Medicines Agency (EMA) and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), comparative clinical trials for pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy are required for demonstration of clinical comparability, preferably double-blind, normally equivalence trials. <bold>P</bold>rogramme eva<bold>L</bold>uating the <bold>A</bold>utoimmune disease i<bold>N</bold>v<bold>E</bold>stigational drug c<bold>T</bold>-p13 in <bold>AS</bold> patients (PLANETAS) was conducted with the approval of the regulatory authorities, including the EMA. PLANETAS was not a conventional dose finding Phase 1 clinical trial but a Phase 1 biosimilar study designed to demonstrate PK equivalence and efficacy and safety comparability of CT-P13 and INX in active AS patients.

Patients were permitted to receive both oral glucocorticoids (equivalent to &#x02264;10mg daily prednisolone) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, if they had received a stable dose for &#x02265;4&#x02005;weeks prior to screening. Additional details of patient eligibility criteria are provided online (see online supplementary appendix B).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01220518) was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and International Committee on Harmonisation good clinical practices. The protocol was reviewed and approved by regulatory authorities and the ethics committees of each study site. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The study was conducted at 46 sites across 10 countries in Europe, Asia and Latin America.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either 5&#x02005;mg/kg of CT-P13 (CELLTRION INC, Incheon, Republic of Korea) or INX (Janssen Biotech Inc, Horsham, Pennsylvania, USA), both administered by 2-h IV infusion, at weeks 0, 2, 6 and then q8&#x02005;weeks up to week 30. Patients were premedicated with antihistamine (chlorpheniramine 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;mg or dose of equivalent antihistamine, eg, 10&#x02005;mg of cetirizine) 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;min prior to the start of infusion at the investigator's discretion.</p><p>Patients underwent clinical assessments and blood sampling at baseline, weeks 14 and 30. At each visit, patients were questioned about adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications and were monitored for any clinical signs and symptoms of tuberculosis (TB). Additional study details are provided in (see online supplementary appendix C).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was to demonstrate PK equivalence at steady state (area under the concentration-time curve (AUC] and observed maximum serum concentration (C<sub>max,ss</sub>)) between CT-P13 and INX assessed between weeks 22 and 30 (doses 5 and 6). Serum blood samples for PK analysis were obtained immediately prior to the study treatment infusion, at the end of the infusion and 1&#x02005;h after the study treatment infusion. For primary PK analysis, a total of 10 serum blood samples were obtained between weeks 22 and 30. All PK analyses were conducted using a flow-through immunoassay platform (GyrolabxP; Gyros AB, Sweden).</p><p>In an equivalence trial, we conclude that two treatments are equivalent if the observable difference (&#x00394;<sub>E</sub>) between them lies within an established interval for predefined clinical equivalence margin (&#x02212;d, d). In general, the &#x02018;null hypothesis&#x02019; is that the difference (&#x00394;<sub>E)</sub> is outside of the equivalence margin, that is, either &#x00394;<sub>E</sub>&#x0003e;d or &#x00394;<sub>E</sub>&#x0003c;&#x02013;d. If collected data on the true difference &#x00394;<sub>E</sub> reject the null hypothesis of &#x02018;non-equivalence&#x02019; then we can accept the alternative explanation (&#x02212;d&#x02264;&#x00394;<sub>E</sub>&#x02264;d) that the two treatments work equally well.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> An equivalence margin of 80&#x02013;125% was selected based on recommendations for bioequivalence trials.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10 R11 R12 R13">10&#x02013;13</xref> The use of 90% confidence intervals (CIs), lying within the equivalence margin of 80&#x02013;125%, was therefore considered to be the best available method of determining bioequivalence for PK comparative trials. In our PK analysis, the predetermined difference is defined by its corresponding ratio since we use the ratio of geometric means of PK endpoints.</p><p>Secondary endpoints included additional PK, efficacy, immunogenicity and safety parameters. The secondary PK endpoints included assessments of observed maximum serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), minimum serum concentration (C<sub>min</sub>), time to reach C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>) up to week 30 and the comparison of the following parameters from week 22 to 30: average concentration at steady state (C<sub>av,ss</sub>); minimum concentration at steady state immediately before the next infusion (C<sub>min,ss</sub>); swing ((C<sub>max,ss</sub>&#x02212;C<sub>min,ss</sub>)/C<sub>min,ss</sub>); degree of fluctuation ((C<sub>max,ss</sub>&#x02212;C<sub>min,ss</sub>)/C<sub>av,ss</sub>); mean residence time (MRT); terminal elimination half-life calculated between doses 5 and 6 (T<sub>1/2</sub>); total body clearance (CL<sub>ss</sub>) and volume of distribution at steady state (V<sub>ss</sub>).</p><p>Efficacy endpoints were assessed at weeks 14 and 30 and included: proportion of patients achieving ASAS20 or ASAS40 responses; Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) score; change in BASDAI, BASFI and BASMI scores versus baseline; change in chest expansion score versus baseline; and QOL (assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)).</p><p>Blood samples were assessed for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at weeks 14 and 30. Antibodies against CT-P13 or INX were measured using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay method utilising the Meso Scale Discovery platform (MSD, Rockville, Maryland, USA).</p><p>Safety endpoints included incidence and type of AEs, serious AEs (SAEs) and incidence of infusion-related reactions, infection and changes in clinical laboratory parameters from baseline. AEs were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and severity was characterised as mild, moderate or severe. ECGs were recorded at week 30.</p><p>All patients were screened for latent or active TB by an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) utilising QuantiFERON-TB Gold in tube (Cellestis Ltd, Australia) and chest x-ray. Patients with latent TB received prophylactic medication according to the local guidelines. For countries with an increased incidence of TB, IGRA was used to identify positive conversion from negative results at weeks 14 and 30, in line with the WHO recommendations for sole use of IGRA in non-HIV adults receiving anti-TNF therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>

These values were within the predefined margins for equivalence (80&#x02013;125%), thereby satisfying the criteria set for PK equivalence of CT-P13 to INX.
