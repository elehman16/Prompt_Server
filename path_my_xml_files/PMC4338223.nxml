Allergen-induced cross-linking of IgE bound to the surface of mast cells and basophils via Fc&#x003b5;RI leads to the degranulation of these cells and the release of inflammatory mediators, proteases and pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. IgE also enhances allergen uptake and presentation to T cells by antigen presenting cells (dendritic cells, monocytes and B cells) via binding to Fc&#x003b5;RI and the low affinity IgE receptor Fc&#x003b5;RII (CD23) [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In addition, IgE prolongs the survival of mast cells and up-regulates the expression of its receptors (Fc&#x003b5;RI, CD23) [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that mast cell and basophil sensitivity correlates with the levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114991.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Several clinical studies have demonstrated that recurrent allergen contact increases the levels of allergen-specific IgE antibodies and the clinical sensitivity towards the corresponding allergens [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], whereas prolonged lack of allergen contact will decrease allergen-specific IgE and eventually lead to clinical unresponsiveness [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In this context it was shown that antigen/allergen stimulation particularly via the nasal mucosa is followed by an increase of allergen-specific IgE levels [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114991.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>For allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) it was demonstrated that the induction of allergen-specific IgG was associated with a reduction of the boosts of allergen-specific IgE production after allergen exposure, suggesting that SIT has a suppressive effect on allergen-specific IgE production [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) represent a first line anti-inflammatory drug used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis but their underlying effects on the allergic immune response are not entirely clear. While the anti-inflammatory properties of corticosteroids are well studied, less is known about their impact on allergen-specific IgE levels. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies using cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have demonstrated that corticosteroids enhance interleukin (IL)-4-induced rises of IgE levels [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similar observations were made in allergic patients, who exhibited a polyclonal rise of IgE antibodies in their sera after systemic treatment with prednisolone [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. On the other hand, corticosteroids have been shown to selectively reduce rises of nasal IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13-producing cells following <italic>in vivo</italic> allergen exposure [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], thereby possibly being capable of down-regulating IgE production. A few studies which investigated the effects of topical corticosteroids on IgE production showed either no or a dampening effect [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>In the present double-blind placebo-controlled study we used purified recombinant allergens for controlled nasal provocation in allergic subjects to investigate whether treatment with a frequently used topical corticosteroid, i.e., nasal fluticasone propionate, impacts on systemic allergen-specific IgE levels following nasal allergen exposure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0114991.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0114991.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.

The study has been registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov/</ext-link> under the trial number: NCT00755066. Inclusion of patients was started before registration at clinicaltrials.gov because the importance to do so was unknown to the investigators at the time. The study was however registered at the EudraCT website before inclusion of patients was initiated (Eudract-number: 2005-004274-24).

Volunteers were recruited using posters to advertise the study at the Medical University of Vienna. The study design is depicted graphically in <xref rid="pone.0114991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. Study participants were randomized to receive four weeks of either fluticasone propionate (100&#x003bc;g daily into each nostril, corresponding to the recommended daily treatment dose of 200&#x003bc;g) or placebo nasal spray. After two weeks of treatment, subjects underwent nasal provocation with either rPhl p 5 or rBet v 1 on two consecutive days. A pre-treatment phase of 2 weeks before allergen exposure was chosen in order to comply with the ARIA guidelines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.whiair.com">www.whiair.com</ext-link>) which suggest that the maximum efficacy of corticosteroids requires up to two weeks of treatment. Serum IgE levels to the allergen used for nasal provocation (rPhl p 5 or rBet v 1) and to a control allergen (rBet v 1 or rPhl p 5 or rPhl p 1, respectively) were the primary outcome measure and were determined in blood samples obtained on the day of nasal provocation and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks thereafter. The whole study was performed in winter outside the birch and grass pollen season to exclude effects due to natural seasonal allergen contact.</p><fig id="pone.0114991.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0114991.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Distribution of study subjects.</title><p>Of the 48 volunteers who were randomized, 45 completed the trial.

All but one of the subjects was sensitized to at least two of the three allergen molecules. Subjects&#x02019; demographic and clinical data including standard test results and specific IgE levels to recombinant allergens are shown in <xref rid="pone.0114991.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Twenty-five subjects were randomized to be treated with fluticasone propionate nasal spray and 23 subjects were assigned to placebo (<xref rid="pone.0114991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Randomized study medication was provided in blocks of four by GlaxoSmithKline and decoding information was kept in a sealed envelope which was opened for de-blinding only in case of a systemic adverse reaction and after database closure was completed and all data were deposited with an independent statistician. The compliance of the study participants was ensured by weighing all treatment bottles after two and four weeks of treatment. All subjects had stable lung function and did not receive antihistamines or corticosteroids other than the study drug during the study. Corticosteroids were not allowed within three months and antihistamines were not allowed two weeks prior to the study. Subjects suffering from perennial allergic rhinitis and signs of airway infection during the treatment period were excluded from the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Nasal provocation</title><p>At the beginning of the study all study participants were asked about the severity of their nasal symptoms during the previous birch and grass pollen season. Symptoms (i.e., nasal itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal blockage) were graded as follows: 0 points: not present; 1 point: present but no discomfort; 2 points: present, some discomfort, not interfering with daily life activities; 3 points: bothersome and interfering with daily life activities or disturbing sleep [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The use of medication to control symptoms received 2 additional points.</p><p>Based on this score the allergen from the source which had caused more severe symptoms was chosen for nasal provocation. Twenty-six subjects were assigned to nasal provocation with rPhl p 5 and 20 subjects to nasal provocation with rBet v 1 (<xref rid="pone.0114991.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Nasal provocation with recombinant allergens was performed as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114991.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Subjects underwent nasal application of the same allergen on two consecutive days after a two week period of treatment with either fluticasone propionate or placebo (<xref rid="pone.0114991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Purified recombinant allergens were diluted to 20&#x003bc;g/ml in sterile 0.9% sodium chloride solution and administered using a metered-dose nasal pump spray delivering 40 &#x003bc;l of solution per spraying action. On each day of nasal provocation, two sprays of the solution were given into one nostril, resulting in a dose of 1.6&#x003bc;g of allergen per study day and in a cumulative dose of 3.2 &#x003bc;g of recombinant allergen per subject. The dose used for nasal provocation was chosen because it has been used in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and because it is in the same range as the daily dose of allergen which a patient would be exposed to during high pollen season [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In fact, it has been shown that during the peak pollen season, a grass pollen allergic patient inhales approximately 5000 pollen grains per day, corresponding to 0.6&#x003bc;g of Phl p 5 allergen [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. As Phl p 5 represents only one of 11 allergens contained in grass pollen [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], the amount of allergen used by us (i.e., 1.6&#x003bc;g of one recombinant allergen per study day) is in a dose range occurring during natural exposure.</p><p>Measurement of changes in nasal flow and nasal symptoms were recorded merely in order to ensure that nasal provocation was successful in all subjects. Therefore, these data were only a secondary endpoint of this study. Nasal flow was determined by active anterior rhinomanometry at 150 Pa measured before administration of test substances, 10 minutes after application of 0.9% sodium chloride, and 10 and 20 minutes after administration of test substances. Flow reduction was calculated by subtracting nasal flow after administration of test substances from nasal flow after administration of 0.9% sodium chloride solution. Subjective nasal symptoms after provocation were determined by adding scores (maximum: 12 scores) for the symptoms nasal itching, nasal congestion and nasal discharge using a 4-point scale (0: no symptoms, 1: mild symptoms, 2: moderate symptoms, 3: severe symptoms) and by counting the number of sneezes (0: no sneezes, 1: &#x02264;5 sneezes, 2: 6&#x02013;10 sneezes, 3: &#x0003e;10 sneezes) [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114991.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, subjects recorded how long it took for their nasal symptoms to subside after nasal provocation.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Blood samples, measurement of antibodies</title><p>For the preparation of serum, blood samples were taken by puncture of the antecubital vein on the day of nasal provocation as well as 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks thereafter (<xref rid="pone.0114991.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Serum samples were stored at -20&#x000b0;C until use and analyzed for IgE, IgA, IgM and IgG<sub>1&#x02013;4</sub> antibodies to the allergen used for nasal provocation and to an unrelated control. For subjects who had received rPhl p 5 by nasal provocation, rBet v 1 or rPhl p 1 served as control allergen, whereas for subjects who had received rBet v 1 for nasal provocation, rPhl p 5 or rPhl p 1 were used as control allergens (control allergen: Phl p 1: n = 17; Bet v 1: n = 8; Phl p 5: n = 19; no control allergen: n = 1).</p><p>Total and allergen-specific IgE levels were determined by ImmunoCAP measurements (Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden). All serum samples collected during the study were measured at the end of the study in a blinded manner. Allergen-specific IgA, IgM and IgG<sub>1&#x02013;4</sub> levels were measured by ELISA as described [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>The six serum samples obtained from each subject during the course of the study were analyzed for each isotype and subclass against each of the recombinant allergens on one plate to assess accurately the time course of antibody responses.

Reference sera for each isotype and subclass were included on each plate to avoid plate-to-plate variations.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, Version 20.0 (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY) and SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Sample size calculations were based on the following assumptions: It was expected that during the eight weeks period rPhl p 5/rBet v 1-specific serum IgE antibody levels would increase after challenge to a level of at least one standard deviation above baseline [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our hypothesis was that this increase would be prevented by INCS by a true effect of at least 1 standard deviation at one time point. Assuming a moderate correlation of 0.4 between repeated measurements within a patient, a sample size of 19 per group (placebo, fluticasone) was calculated to result in a power of 80% to detect the assumed difference between groups using an F-Test from a repeated measures design at a significance level of 0.05. A higher number of patients was included to account for possible drop-outs.</p><p>The changes in Phl p 5- and Bet v 1-specific IgE-levels between t1 and t2, t3, t4, t5 and t6, respectively, were assessed by linear mixed effect models. The data were log-transformed before the analyses, due to the right skewed distribution of the raw data. The differences between the IgE values at time-points t2 to t6, respectively, and the baseline value at t1 were calculated for the log-transformed data. A linear mixed model was fit to explain the differences in log-IgE values by the categorical variable time-point, treatment group (placebo vs. fluticasone) and the interaction between time-point and treatment. A random intercept for the patient was included to account for the within-patient correlation of repeated observations.</p><p>From this model, the null hypothesis of no effect of time and the null hypothesis of no treatment effect at any time point were tested by F-tests.</p><p>The effect of treatment was estimated at each time-point as the mean log-IgE difference in the fluticasone group minus the mean log-IgE difference in the placebo group. A corresponding 95% confidence interval was calculated. In addition, the average effect of treatment on the log IgE difference over all five time-points was estimated.</p><p>Following back-transformation, the estimated effects can be interpreted as median of the ratio of relative changes from t1.</p><p>The analysis was performed for Phl p 5-specific IgE levels, Bet v 1-specific IgE and combined Phl p 5- and Bet v 1-specific IgE levels.</p><p>Including the baseline (t1) value of log-IgE in the regression model was considered, to account for a possible influence of the initial amount of IgE on the change. However, for both, Phl p 5 and Bet v 1, and the combination of both allergens the effect of baseline IgE was not significant and small in magnitude and it was not included in the final models.</p><p>The calculations were done using PROC Mixed in SAS 9.4.

Symptoms and flow reduction after nasal provocation were recorded to ensure that the provocation procedure was performed successfully in all patients but these results were not a primary outcome of this study. Nasal provocation was followed by an increase in the symptom scores in all 43 patients. There was however no relevant difference between those subjects who had been pre-treated with steroid and placebo nasal spray regarding their nasal symptoms after the first nasal provocation (median placebo: 7 scores, median steroid: 6 scores, n.s.) and second nasal provocation (median placebo: 6 scores, median steroid: 6 scores, n.s.). Also, we observed a decrease in nasal flow in 21 of the 22 subjects in the placebo group (median decrease: day 1: 223 ml/s, p&#x0003c;0.001, day 2: 217 ml/s, p&#x0003c;0.001) and in 19 of the 21 subjects in the steroid treated group (median decrease: day 1: 185 ml/s, p&#x0003c;0.001, day 2: 167ml/s, p&#x0003c;0.001).

In fact it has been demonstrated that higher levels of allergen-specific IgE caused increased clinical sensitivity to the culprit allergens [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Furthermore, increases of IgE levels have been shown to prolong the survival of and to up-regulate the expression of Fc&#x003b5; receptors on mast cells, basophils and antigen presenting cells [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The latter leads to enhanced degranulation and release of inflammatory mediators, proteases and pro-inflammatory cytokines from mast cells and basophils [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and to increased IgE-facilitated antigen presentation to T cells and thus to their activation [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114991.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Therapies such as SIT which can reduce allergen-specific IgE production offer the advantage that they modulate the course of allergic disease in addition to the reduction of allergic symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In fact, it has been demonstrated that SIT can prevent the transition from mild (i.e., rhinitis) to severe (i.e., asthma) manifestations [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and that SIT has long-term effects even after discontinuation [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The effects of other frequently used forms of anti-allergic treatment on allergen-specific IgE antibody production have not yet been studied in defined experimental model systems. INCS are a first line of treatment for seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] as well as for other chronic inflammatory diseases of the nose and paranasal sinuses (e.g., nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis) [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. They seem to provide excellent control of local inflammatory conditions and are therefore widely used in adult as well as paediatric patients [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114991.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In asthmatic patients, it has been shown that early and sustained treatment with corticosteroids may even prevent some of the irreversible airway dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Since steroids have mainly an effect on chronic and late phase allergic inflammation but not on acute IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation, it was not unexpected that we did not find statistically significant differences between the symptoms and nasal patency in the placebo-treated and steroid-treated subjects, which was measured shortly after nasal provocation. Steroid-treated subjects recovered significantly more quickly after provocation, indicating an effect of nasal steroids on the late phase response. Furthermore, there was a trend towards less severe reduction of nasal flow after provocation in patients treated with INCS. It may thus be speculated that while the beneficial effect of steroid treatment was not measurable immediately after an acute single provocation, it should be much more obvious during prolonged allergen contact.</p><p>It has been shown earlier in an experimental model of allergic sensitization in rhesus monkeys and in clinical studies in ragweed allergic patients that the application of steroids may prevent boosts of IgE production following allergen contact [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114991.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>We therefore felt that it is important to investigate in a well-controlled clinical study utilizing defined and clinically relevant allergen molecules, whether a frequently used INCS, i.e., nasal fluticasone propionate, has effects on boosts of IgE production induced by nasal allergen contact.</p><p>Although there is considerable evidence for local IgE production in the nasal mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], we found that even a two week pre-treatment before allergen provocation, followed by a two week treatment after provocation with fluticasone propionate compared to placebo had no significant effects on the boosts of allergen-specific IgE production. Similar results were obtained for two different pollen allergens, the highly immunogenic major grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 and the less immunogenic major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1 [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p><p>There are at least two explanations for the discrepancy between our study and earlier studies describing a reduction of allergen-specific IgE levels upon administration of corticosteroids. In the rhesus monkey study [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] triamcinolone acetonide was given systemically and, in the ragweed trial, steroids (i.e., beclomethasone propionate, triamcinolone acetonide) with a high bioavailability of more than 40% and a systemic immunosuppressive effect were used, whereas the bioavailability of nasal fluticasone propionate used in our study is less than 1% [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study we found that boosts of allergen-specific IgE production can only be obtained with intact folded allergen which is capable of interacting with the B cell receptor but not by unfolded allergen derivatives which contain the allergen-specific T cell epitopes but cannot bind to the B cell receptor [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The failure of steroids to suppress allergen-specific IgE production may therefore be explained by their inability to influence secondary IgE production in memory B cells and plasma cells.</p><p>In summary, we found that intranasal application of 200 &#x003bc;g of fluticasone propionate over 4 weeks, a regimen which corresponds to the recommended treatment for allergic patients, had no blunting effect on the boost of systemic allergen-specific IgE production following nasal provocation with 1.6 &#x003bc;g of Phl p 5 or Bet v 1, two major pollen allergens, administered on two consecutive days, and did not affect the production of allergen-specific IgE antibodies. Thus, other effects of intranasal corticosteroids, like a reduction of Th2-cytokine producing cells [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as well as decreased eosinophil and mast cell numbers [<xref rid="pone.0114991.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] may account for the beneficial clinical effect of intranasal corticosteroids.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that nasal provocation exposed patients to relatively high doses of allergen, corresponding to a day&#x000b4;s worth of allergen exposure, in a short time. We cannot exclude that INCS affect systemic IgE levels differently in patients who encounter lower doses of allergens over a more prolonged period of time. Therefore, it will certainly be interesting to study the effects of INCS on allergen-specific IgE production and subsequent allergen sensitivity in large groups of patients exposed to allergen in a pollen chamber or under conditions of natural allergen exposure. Furthermore, it will be interesting to study local allergen-specific antibody production in nasal secretions of allergic patients after allergen contact. However, the results from our trial indicate that unlike SIT, INCS cannot down-modulate allergen-specific IgE production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114991.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114991.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114991.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study protocol submitted to the Ethics committee.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114991.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114991.s003"><label>S1 Study Protocol Amendment</label><caption><title>Amendment 1 and Amendment 2 to the study protocol, submitted to the Ethics committee during the study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114991.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114991.s004"><label>S2 Study Protocol Amendment</label><caption><title>Amendment 1 and Amendment 2 to the study protocol, submitted to the Ethics committee during the study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114991.s004.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114991.s005"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0114991.s005.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the &#x0201c;Allergiezentrum Wien West&#x0201d; for patients&#x000b4; care and Irene Steiner, Msc, Department of Medical Statistics, Medical University of Vienna, Austria, for her help with the statistical analysis of the data.</p><p>This study was supported by grants SFB F4605 and F4613 of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), by the Christian Doppler Research Association, Vienna Austria and by research grants from Biomay, Vienna, Austria and Phadia, Uppsala, Sweden.
