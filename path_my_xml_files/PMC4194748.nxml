Several studies have reported that the use of AWS is associated with faster intubation in cases of difficult airways<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and lower incidence of dental injury<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> than DL. Potential mechanism by which the use of AWS reduces airway trauma is a reduction in applied forces on the oral structures. However, to our knowledge, differences in applied forces during intubation attempts between the AWS and the DL remain unclear.</p><p>To address the knowledge gap, using high-fidelity simulators, we sought to determine whether the use of an AWS decreases applied forces on the maxillary incisors and tongue during intubation attempts compared to those with the use of a DL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and settings</title><p>We conducted a prospective cross-over study to examine the forces applied on the oral structures during intubation attempts according to intubation devices.

We defined a &#x02018;difficult airway scenario&#x02019; as a scenario with a limited mouth opening. Prior to simulations, all participants received a 10&#x02005;min lecture and 5&#x02005;min practice session to ensure that they were familiar with proper DL and AWS techniques. The participants were then randomly assigned to one of the four simulation scenarios, and sequentially underwent the other simulation scenarios.

Other outcomes of interest were time to intubation and glottic view during intubation attempts. Time to intubation was defined as time to successful placement of an endotracheal tube (ie, an appropriate positioning of the endotracheal tube tip and confirmation of ventilation), regardless of the number of attempts. The glottic view at each intubation attempt was scored by the participant using the Cormack-Lehane grades.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To account for the natural pairing of the observations within each participant, and non-normal distribution of the outcome variables, we compared the outcomes between two devices (AWS vs DL) using Wilcoxon signed rank test. In addition, to compare the outcomes with consideration for the intubator's experience, we performed stratified analysis by categorising the intubators into two groups based on the previous study: experienced intubators (n=18) and inexperienced intubators (n=19).<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Experienced intubators were defined as those who had intubated 100 or more cases, while inexperienced intubators were defined as those who had intubated less than 100 cases. p Values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Additionally, in the same scenario, the highest quartile of applied forces on the maxillary incisors with the use of AWS did not exceed 150 N. In agreement with these data, a previous simulation study reported that the use of AWS decreases the number of dental clicks compared with the use of DL.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> These findings collectively suggest that the use of AWS might decrease incidences of dental injuries during intubation attempts.</p><p>To avoid indirect adverse events, such as vasovagal responses and haemodynamic alterations, emergency airway management requires intubation attempts with minimal forces to the oropharyngeal structures.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A previous report suggested that the use of AWS was associated with a decreased haemodynamic alteration during intubation attempts<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; however, the authors did not evaluate the actual forces applied on oral structures. In contrast, in the present study, we found that the forces applied on the tongue were significantly lower with the use of AWS compared to that of DL. Our prospective cross-over study corroborated the previous knowledge and extended prior research by demonstrating the mechanism by which the use of AWS reduces intubation-related adverse events.</p><p>The reasons for the observed difference in the applied forces between the airway devices in the difficult airway are likely multifactorial. A plausible explanation is that the use of AWS enabled intubations without an excessive effort to achieve a direct line of sight. This is supported by the observed improvement in the glottic view with the use of an AWS. When a DL is used during intubation attempt in a difficult airway, maxillary incisors are reportedly used as the pivot point to lever the soft tissues upward, thereby leading to an excessive force to the maxillary incisors and tongue.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, the reason for the finding that the maximum force applied on the maxillary incisors in the normal airway scenario was higher with the use of AWS than that with DL was unclear and also likely multifactorial. In our study, most intubators were familiar with the use of a DL, while they were less familiar with the use of AWS. Indeed, approximately 80% of the participants had performed less than 10 intubations using an AWS. Therefore, one may surmise that the unfamiliarity with AWS led to this finding. However, the sensitivity analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the applied force on the maxillary incisor between the devices in the experienced intubator group. Alternatively, the size of an AWS&#x02014;bigger than that of a DL&#x02014;might have contributed to the finding.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the association between the use of AWS and decreased forces on the oral structures during intubation attempts. Multiple studies have reported the advantages of AWS for intubation, not only in the routine general anaesthesia setting<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Furthermore, our findings support the systematic use of an AWS in the critical settings, such as in patients with hypotension and those who cannot tolerate haemodynamic alterations (eg, intracranial haemorrhage).</p><p>This study has potential limitations. Approximately half of the participants had experienced 100 or fewer intubations in their medical career, and the median number of AWS uses was 4. However, even the less experienced intubator was able to intubate with less applied forces. In addition, as our study used simulators, an extrapolation of the findings to the clinical setting requires caution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this prospective cross-over study, we found that the use of AWS, compared to DL, was associated with lower maximum forces on the oral structures in the difficult airway scenario.
