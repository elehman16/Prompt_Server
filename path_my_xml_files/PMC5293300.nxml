Cleft lip repair was performed in all patients at approximately 3 months of age using 1 of the 2 techniques according to our usual surgical protocol: upper rotation advancement plus double unilimb Z-plasty or triple unilimb Z-plasty. None of the patients underwent alveolar bone grafting, secondary palatoplasties, or orthodontic treatment. All operations were performed by the same plastic surgeon (P.R.P.).</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>This trial included Peruvian infants with nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate who were otherwise healthy. Only children with mild or moderate unilateral cleft lip and palate were included in this study because severe cases require a relaxing incision on the cleft side (according to our usual surgical protocol).<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>Patients with severe unilateral cleft lip and palates were excluded from both groups.

Based on the index, we categorized the cleft palate severity as follows: mild = index less than 0.2, moderate = index of 0.2 to 0.4, and severe = index more than 0.4. The cleft palate index was measured while the patients were receiving general anesthesia at the time of their cleft palate surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment Time</title><p>The patients in both groups were followed longitudinally for 5 years.

After placing the patient in the supine position with the neck extended, the Dingman mouth gag was applied and the proposed incision location was marked with methylene blue. Local anesthetic was infiltrated into the palatal tissues with 2% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 at a dose of 0.5&#x02009;mL/kg. After 5 to 7 minutes, the incisions were made with a number 15 blade after the markings. The unilateral uvuloplasty technique was used, retaining the larger of the 2 hemiuvulae and excising the smaller one.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Mucoperiosteal flaps were devised using cautery on the noncleft side. The incision ran along the edge of the palate, over the gingiva, and just medial to the line of dental eruption, as in the alveolar extension palatoplasty of Carstens.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Mucoperiosteal flap elevation began at the anterior-most portion of the hemipalate and continued up to the palatal pedicle. The neurovascular bundle was then mobilized by blunt dissection to further loosen it from the greater palatine foramen. The palatal mucoperiosteum on the cleft side was elevated through the medial incision to avoid placing the closure under any tension. Muscle repair was performed using the intravelar veloplasty technique as described by Sommerlad.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p><p>After this was completed, the mucosa was carefully closed using absorbable 5-0 suture to achieve border-to-border edge approximation.</p><p>The one-flap palatoplasty differed from the two-flap technique by the use of a relaxing incision on the cleft side only.

This has led to the use of a variety of surgical protocols for cleft lip and palate management at different institutions, but the optimal strategy remains unknown. Since the report published by Gillies and Fry<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> in 1921, various studies have noted that inhibition of maxillary development in patients who have undergone cleft palate repair is an important issue. Because of the small growth disturbance observed in patients with a cleft palate who have not undergone surgery, iatrogenic factors have been considered potentially relevant.</p><p>The prevalence of secondary maxillary hypoplasia associated with cleft lip and palate repair varies among studies, with reports of approximately 25% to 60% of cleft lip/palate patients developing a dentofacial deformity requiring orthognathic correction.<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In the current study, only 6.94% of patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate were noted to have maxillary hypoplasia at the age of assessment (5 years old); however, this percentage may increase as skeletal maturation occurs.</p><p>Various factors have been associated with maxillary hypoplasia, including congenital hypoplasia, primary cheiloplasty, disturbed blood supply, subperiosteal dissection of the mucoperiosteal flaps, minimization of the denuded bone, surgeon&#x02019;s skills, patient age at the time of cleft palate repair, type and severity of the cleft, surgical technique, and use of relaxing incisions.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup></p><p>Some previous studies have noted that the main factors are the primary lip and palate repairs.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> However, the potential role of the various other factors makes it difficult to evaluate the association between types of surgical techniques (such as the use of relaxing incisions) and maxillofacial growth disturbance. These confounding factors are the main limitations of using observational studies to provide valid scientific evidence of associations.</p><p>Primary cheiloplasty and palatoplasty lead to the formation of scar tissue at the surgical site and cause dynamic and static disturbances that can have negative consequences on maxillary growth. This is why some authors suggest that surgery and the resulting incisions and scars are the main reasons for growth disturbances of the maxilla. A study published by Koberg and Koblin<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> observed that Veau&#x02019;s pushback and Langenbeck&#x02019;s techniques with relaxing incisions were the most detrimental to facial growth. A recent study by Odom et al<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> did not observe an association between the development of class III incisal relationship and the type of palatal incisions in patients with isolated cleft palate repair, when evaluated after long-term follow-up.</p><p>To overcome the drawbacks of observational studies, a few clinical trials have been performed during recent years. Fudalej et al<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> compared the outcomes of a group of 25 patients who underwent one-stage repair with those of a control group who underwent the two-flap technique and noted small differences between groups. In the clinical trial by Richard et al<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> of 47 patients who underwent 2 different two-stage techniques, no demonstrable differences in facial growth were observed at 4 to 7 years of age. Wada et al<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> conducted a clinical trial comparing different techniques against a control group who underwent the two-flap method and observed better maxillary growth using two-stage palatoplasty closing the hard palate when the patients were 5 years old.</p><p>In that study, the patients were randomly assigned to 4 experimental groups, but the number of unilateral cleft lip and palate patients was small (14 vs 16 patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively).</p><p>Thus, the statistical power of the study was low, so the validity of the conclusions is limited. A meta-analysis by Nollet et al<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> observed improved dental arch relationships with delayed palate closure compared with early closure. Finally, a multicenter clinical trial study (from Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) known as the SCANDinavian CLEFT study included 3 clinical trials of primary surgery for unilateral cleft lip and palate that compared dental arch relationships at 5 years of age.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The results did not provide any statistical evidence that 1 surgical technique for cleft palate repair was superior to the others.</p><p>To our knowledge, the results presented here represent the first attempt to evaluate prospective data regarding the effect of relaxing incisions on the development of maxillary segments. The one-flap technique is a good model to use to study the association between relaxing incisions and maxillary growth because 1 side of the palate does not require a lateral surgical incision. This differs from the two-flap technique, which includes the use of a relaxing incision on the cleft side. The use of the one-flap technique was compared with the conventional two-flap technique in a previous study that showed no statistically significant differences between the techniques with respect to the development of palatal fistulas or velopharyngeal insufficiency.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>We used the 5-year-olds&#x02019; index described by Atack et al<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> as a growth indicator to assess the relationship between the dental arches around the beginning of mixed teething. This method, based on the Goslon index developed by Mars et al,<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> enables preliminary detection of alterations arising from primary palatoplasty. The 5-year-olds&#x02019; index is not a predictive measure of ultimate maxillary growth in patients with a unilateral cleft lip and palate; therefore, the obtained results should be validated at the time of permanent dentition. Growth cannot be assessed until maturity.</p><p>The current study demonstrated no statistically significant differences between the 2 surgical techniques with respect to dental arch relationships or maxillary arch dimensions. These results are similar to those of most of the reviewed clinical trials. We may, thus, assume that there is no association between the use of relaxing incisions and subsequent disturbance of maxillary growth. If the incisions affect maxillary growth, then, we should observe asymmetry between the cleft and noncleft side when comparing these techniques.</p><p>One of the concerns using the one-flap technique was asymmetric development of the maxillary arch; however, we did not observe this undesirable outcome in our study participants.</p><p>We found symmetrical development of the maxillary arch using both techniques. A good 5-year-olds&#x02019; index score was observed in 86 of the 140 patients (61.42%) in this study. Only 10 of the 140 patients (6.94%) exhibited a group 4 dental arch relationship (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Fig. 5.</label><caption><p>Dental arch relationship evaluated with 5-y-olds&#x02019; index in patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate operated on using 2 different methods.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gox-5-e1201-g009"/></fig><p>In comparison with the U.K. Clinical Standards Advisory Group study (37% of 5-year-old patients had 5-year index scores of 4 or 5) and Sommerlad&#x02019;s consecutive series (reported as 10% scores of 4 or 5 using GOSLON scale), we obtained better outcomes.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p><p>Generalization of our results may be limited because we evaluated only patients with mild or moderate unilateral cleft lip and palate. In our center, the surgical technique for severe disorders requires relaxing incisions on both sides to prevent the development of palatal fistulas. The percentage of patients lost to follow-up was small in this study (8.97%; 14/156), with little difference between groups (8 vs 6; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This minimized the risk of transfer bias. Performance bias (a common problem during surgical research) was avoided in this study because only 1 surgeon performed all operations. Blinding of the patients and surgeon was unfeasible, which was one of the main limitations of this study.</p><p>The utility of the two-flap technique is questionable because it provides similar surgical outcomes to those achieved with the one-flap technique but with additional surgical incisions and dissection.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup></p><p>Based on our findings and the results of previous clinical trials, we may assume that secondary maxillary hypoplasia after unilateral cleft lip and palate repair is the result of the interaction of other factors, not only the use of relaxing incisions. Surgical protocols should, therefore, not be established by considering only a single factor, such as surgical incisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of this clinical trial do not provide evidence that 1 technique for primary palatoplasty allowed us to achieve better dental arch relationships or maxillary arch dimensions than the other at 5 years of age. Thus, there seems to be no relationship between the use of relaxing incisions and maxillary growth impairment when patients are 5 years old. Additional longer term studies are necessary to confirm the results of this preliminary report.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Disclosure:</bold> The authors have no financial interest to declare in relation to the content of this article.
