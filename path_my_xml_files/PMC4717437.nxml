Up to the week 97 data cut-off, there was one case of latent tuberculosis in the TCZ-SC arm and zero in the other arms. In the TCZ-SC arm, there was one case each of serious atypical pneumonia, serious bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, non-serious oropharyngeal candidiasis and serious pharyngeal abscess. In the TCZ-IV arm, events included one case each of non-serious genital herpes zoster and non-serious lepromatous leprosy.

Infections were the most commonly reported AEs (TCZ-SC 63.2%, TCZ-IV 57.8%, TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC 17.7%, TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV 56.3%) and led to withdrawal in 17 patients (2.7%) in the TCZ-SC arm, 12 (1.9%) in the TCZ-IV arm, 8 (4.3%) in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm and 0 in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm.</p><p>SAE rates were generally stable, consistent over 97&#x02005;weeks, and comparable between the TCZ-SC and TCZ-IV arms. Serious infection rates were maintained over time. The rate of serious infections per 100 PY in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm was higher (6.65 (95% CI 3.87 to 10.64)) than in the TCZ-IV arm (3.92 (95% CI 2.68 to 5.53)); however, the 95% CIs overlapped. The most common serious infections occurring in &#x02265;2 patients in the TCZ-SC, TCZ-IV and TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arms were cellulitis and pneumonia. Only one serious infection (diverticulitis) was reported in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm. Opportunistic infection rates were consistent over time and were atypical pneumonia (patient withdrawn), bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, oropharyngeal candidiasis and pharyngeal abscess in the TCZ-SC arm; genital herpes zoster and lepromatous leprosy (patient withdrawn) in the TCZ-IV arm; and genital herpes zoster, oropharyngeal candidiasis and <italic>Burkholderia pseudomallei</italic> infection (occurred in a major endemic region, Thailand) in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm. Ten deaths were reported: four in the TCZ-SC arm (shock, cerebral infarction, thrombosis and unknown cause), four in the TCZ-IV arm (acute respiratory distress, cerebral infarction, sepsis and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and two in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm (pneumonia and sepsis).</p><p>No anaphylaxis cases were identified (according to Sampson criteria). Seven SAEs (five in the TCZ-SC arm and two in the TCZ-IV arm) were observed within 24&#x02005;h of infusion/injection and evaluated as related to study treatment; of these, three were medically consistent with hypersensitivity and led to study withdrawal (two in the TCZ-SC arm and one in the TCZ-IV arm). One patient in the TCZ-SC arm and two in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm experienced medically confirmed gastrointestinal perforations.</p><p>A similar frequency of elevated liver enzymes was observed in all treatment arms; there were no Hy's law cases. Most shifts in aminotransferase levels were from normal at baseline to &#x02264;3&#x000d7; the ULN and occurred at a single time point only. The number of patients who experienced an alanine aminotransferase elevation &#x02265;3&#x000d7; ULN in &#x02265;2 consecutive samples over time was low. One patient experienced consecutive aspartate aminotransferase elevations &#x02265;3&#x000d7; ULN (see online supplementary table S3). Most cases of neutropenia were newly occurring. The majority of events occurred at one or two consecutive visits (see online supplementary table S3). Also, 10 patients (1.9%) in the TCZ-SC arm, 10 (2.7%) in the TCZ-IV arm, 2 (1.1%) in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm and 0 in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm experienced grade 3 or 4 neutropenia on &#x02265;2 consecutive visits. One patient (0.5%) in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm had a serious infection of laryngitis (grade 3) that corresponded with grade 4 neutropenia. Neutropenia AEs leading to withdrawal remained low over time: four patients in the TCZ-SC arm and three in the TCZ-IV withdrew at week 97 versus one patient in each arm at week 24. No withdrawals due to neutropenia AEs occurred in either switch arm. Most patients maintained a platelet count above the lower limit of normal throughout treatment. One patient in the TCZ-IV arm experienced grade 3 thrombocytopenia (no grade 4; see online supplementary table S3<bold>)</bold>. There was no association between grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia and serious bleeding events. The proportion of patients reporting shifts in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides after initiation of TCZ was higher in the TCZ-SC arm than the TCZ-IV arm (total cholesterol 26.1% vs 21.0%; LDL 27.7% vs 23.2%; HDL 3.2% vs 3.9%; and triglycerides 23.8% vs 17.5%) at week 97, consistent with observations made at week 24 <bold>(</bold>see online supplementary table S3<bold>)</bold>.</p><p>With the exception of the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm, patients weighing &#x02265;100&#x02005;kg at baseline had higher rates of AEs/100 PYs compared with patients in the lighter subgroups (see online supplementary table S4). The incidence of SAEs was comparable in the TCZ-SC and TCZ-IV arms across the lower body weight subgroups and higher in the TCZ-SC arm compared with the TCZ-IV arm in the &#x02265;100 kg subgroup. The overall SAE rate in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm was higher than in the TCZ-IV arm in each of the weight subgroups, whereas in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm, it was lower than in the TCZ-SC arm.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Immunogenicity</title><p>The proportions of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies postbaseline were low: 10 patients (1.6%) in the TCZ-SC arm, 7 (1.1%) in the TCZ-IV arm, 0 in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm and 1 (0.5%) in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm. No correlation between anti-TCZ antibody development and clinical response or AEs was observed. Among patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies, two in the TCZ-IV arm experienced ISRs. No patients with serious hypersensitivity events or who withdrew due to efficacy reasons developed anti-TCZ antibodies.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Efficacy, safety and PK/PD profiles were maintained with continuous TCZ dosing through week 97. Efficacy in the TCZ-SC and TCZ-IV arms was comparable from weeks 24 to 97 for ACR20/50/70 response, DAS28 remission and HAQ-DI response rates. The efficacy and safety profile in patients who switched formulations was comparable to that in patients who remained on TCZ-IV or TCZ-SC. Lower ACR20/50/70 and HAQ-DI response rates occurred in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm compared with the TCZ-SC arm; however, these lower values were observed from baseline through week 97. Differences may be due to the lower number of patients in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm or to baseline differentiating factors in this group, such as shorter RA duration, higher number of failed aTNFs, lower rates of ACPA positivity and oral corticosteroid use. No new safety signals were identified, and the safety of TCZ-SC observed at week 24 was maintained with longer PYs. TCZ-SC had a safety profile similar to the known safety profile of TCZ-IV, with the exception of ISRs, which were more common with TCZ-SC.</p><p>In patients who switched formulations, the safety profile was comparable to patients who received the same formulation throughout the study. AE rates in the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm were comparable to those in patients who continued to receive TCZ-SC. In the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm, PY-adjusted AE rates during the OL period were generally comparable to those in the TCZ-IV arm and lower than in the TCZ-SC arm. SAE rates (including serious infections) were consistent over time up to 2&#x02005;years. Serious infection rates were higher in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm compared with the TCZ-IV arm. However, for both arms, SAE rates, including serious and opportunistic infections, had overlapping CIs, indicating no significant differences. Investigation into possible differences suggested that no baseline characteristics for age, weight, origin, prior aTNF treatment failure, baseline corticosteroid use or comorbidities appeared to favour the TCZ-IV arm. Comorbidities, such as diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and tobacco use, which predispose patients to infections, were comparable in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm and the TCZ-IV arm. While there was a higher incidence of concurrent COPD in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm (2.7%) compared with the TCZ-IV arm (1.8%), fewer patients in the TCZ-IV&#x02013;SC arm (5.9%) had concurrent diabetes compared with the TCZ-IV (9.4%) and TCZ-SC arms (7.8%).</p><p>Immunogenicity of biological therapy has been a concern for healthcare providers. However, the proportions of patients who developed anti-TCZ antibodies remained low and were comparable up to week 97 in all treatment arms, including the switch arms. No correlation of anti-TCZ antibody development with clinical response or AEs was observed.</p><p>In all treatment groups and body weight categories, DAS28 response rates were maintained with dose continuation and after switching formulations. The data in the highest and lowest weight categories for the TCZ-SC&#x02013;IV arm should be interpreted with caution due to the low number of patients in these groups. Infection risk factors, such as diabetes and COPD, could explain the numerically higher incidences of AEs in the TCZ-SC and TCZ-IV arms among patients weighing &#x02265;100&#x02005;kg at baseline compared with patients weighing &#x0003c;100&#x02005;kg. A higher proportion of patients in the &#x02265;100 kg category had diabetes or COPD (diabetes: TCZ-SC 22.6%, TCZ-IV 17.5%; COPD: TCZ-SC 4.8%, TCZ-IV 3.2%) compared with the 60 to 100 kg category (diabetes: TCZ-SC 6.6%, TCZ-IV 8.5%; COPD: TCZ-SC 2.8%, TCZ-IV 1.7%) and the &#x0003c;60 kg category (diabetes: TCZ-SC 4.9%, TCZ-IV 2.1%; COPD: TCZ-SC 0%, TCZ-IV 2.7%).</p><p>The long-term efficacy and safety of TCZ-SC was maintained and remained comparable with that of TCZ-IV, with the exception of ISRs. Efficacy in patients who switched between formulations was maintained, and safety profiles were similar to those in patients who remained on TCZ-IV or TCZ-SC. Most AE rates were comparable, with wide and overlapping 95% CIs. TCZ-SC could provide a more convenient administration option for patients with RA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2015-207281-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e800" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all investigators and patients who participated in the study and all members of the WA22762 study team.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> MB and LR designed the study, analysed and interpreted the data.
