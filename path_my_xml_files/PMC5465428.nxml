This analysis evaluated the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients previously treated with loperamide in two phase 3 studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Adults with IBS-D (Rome III criteria) were enrolled and randomized to placebo or eluxadoline (75 or 100&#x02009;mg) twice daily for 26 (IBS-3002) or 52 (IBS-3001) weeks. Patients reported loperamide use over the previous year and recorded their rescue loperamide use during the studies. The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients with a composite response of simultaneous improvement in abdominal pain and reduction in diarrhea.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A total of 2,428 patients were enrolled; 36.0&#x00025; reported prior loperamide use, of whom 61.8&#x00025; reported prior inadequate IBS-D symptom control with loperamide. Among patients with prior loperamide use, a greater proportion treated with eluxadoline (75 and 100&#x02009;mg) were composite responders vs. those treated with placebo with inadequate prior symptom control, over weeks 1&#x02013;12 (26.3&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>=0.001) and 27.0&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) vs. 12.7&#x00025;, respectively); similar results were observed over weeks 1&#x02013;26. When daily rescue loperamide use was imputed as a nonresponse day, the composite responder rate was still higher in patients receiving eluxadoline (75 and 100&#x02009;mg) vs. placebo over weeks 1&#x02013;12 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and weeks 1&#x02013;26 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Adverse events included nausea and abdominal pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Eluxadoline effectively and safely treats IBS-D symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients who self-report either adequate or inadequate control of their symptoms with prior loperamide treatment, with comparable efficacy and safety irrespective of the use of loperamide as a rescue medication during eluxadoline treatment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common functional bowel disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). The global prevalence of IBS is estimated to be 11.2&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). IBS can affect all members of society, irrespective of race, creed, color, or socioeconomic status, although women are more likely to be affected by IBS than men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). IBS is associated with significant impairment in quality of life and high rates of comorbid conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>) that imposes a significant socioeconomic burden to society in terms of reduced work productivity and high health-care costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). As defined in the recent Rome criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), IBS can be subcategorized into three major subtypes based on stool patterns: IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D), IBS with constipation, and IBS with mixed symptoms of constipation and diarrhea. IBS-D is the most common IBS subtype and comprises &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of all cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>).</p><p>Despite intensive study, there is still no well-established treatment algorithm for IBS-D. Dietary and lifestyle modifications are commonly used for initial symptom management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), although many patients continue to suffer from chronic symptoms. Clinicians often recommend the use of the over-the-counter antidiarrheal agent loperamide, a peripheral &#x003bc;-opioid receptor (OR) agonist, to relieve diarrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). The &#x003bc;-OR activity of loperamide decreases gastrointestinal (GI) motility that increases the duration of intestinal transit, thereby promoting fluid absorption and reducing stool frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). However, there is little clinical evidence demonstrating that loperamide is effective at relieving the cardinal symptom of IBS, abdominal pain, nor does loperamide improve bloating, the second most commonly reported symptom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). At approved doses, the use of loperamide in IBS patients can lead to the development of unwanted constipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Other therapeutic options for the treatment of IBS-D include alosetron, a selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist that is restricted by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to women with chronic, severe IBS-D symptoms who have failed to respond to conventional therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). The antibiotic rifaximin, recently approved for the treatment of both men and women with IBS-D, can be effective in some patients, but recurrence of symptoms is common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). There is therefore a large unmet need for new therapeutic agents that provide persistent relief for the multiple symptoms of IBS-D.</p><p>Eluxadoline is a peripherally active, mixed &#x003bc;-OR and &#x003ba;-OR agonist and &#x003b4;-OR antagonist with low systemic absorption and low oral bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) that is approved for the treatment of adults with IBS-D in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). The mixed pharmacological profile of eluxadoline may mitigate the risk of constipation effects through unopposed &#x003bc;-OR agonism as seen with agents such as loperamide, through antagonism of the &#x003b4;-OR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). The efficacy of eluxadoline was demonstrated in two large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials in patients with IBS-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). Eluxadoline met the primary efficacy composite end point in these trials, demonstrating simultaneous relief of the symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea associated with IBS-D. In contrast, loperamide has not been demonstrated to relieve abdominal pain in previous clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). In the phase 3 studies reported by Lembo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), prior use of loperamide and its adequacy in controlling IBS-D symptoms were captured at baseline. This presented the opportunity to determine the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients previously treated with loperamide. It was hypothesized that eluxadoline could provide effective relief of IBS symptoms in patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide.</p><p>The primary aim of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D who reported that they did not experience adequate symptom relief with prior loperamide therapy. This prespecified prospective subgroup analysis evaluated the composite end point response rates in the pooled data from two phase 3 studies of patients who had previously experienced adequate control of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide in the year before randomization, and patients who had not experienced adequate IBS-D symptom control with loperamide. A secondary aim of this analysis was to evaluate loperamide rescue medication use across all treatment arms of the phase 3 studies and its impact on efficacy results.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>IBS-3001 and IBS-3002 were parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind multicenter phase 3 studies in adult patients with IBS-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The studies comprised a pretreatment period followed by 52 (IBS-3001) or 26 (IBS-3002) weeks of treatment, during which patients were randomized to receive eluxadoline 75 or 100&#x02009;mg, or placebo, twice daily. Patients underwent a 2-week posttreatment follow-up period in IBS-3001, or a 4-week single-blind placebo withdrawal in IBS-3002. Patients were included in the studies if they were 18&#x02013;80 years of age, with a diagnosis of IBS-D (Rome III Criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>)), and with an average worst abdominal pain score of &#x0003e;3.0, an average Bristol Stool Scale score for stool consistency of &#x02265;5.5 (on a scale of 1 (hard stool) to 7 (watery diarrhea)) and &#x02265;5 days with a Bristol Stool Scale score of &#x02265;5, and an average IBS-D global symptom score of &#x02265;2.0 (scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (very severe symptoms)). Patients were also required to not have used any loperamide rescue medication within 14 days before randomization. Patients with current or expected use of opioid-containing agents (e.g., antidiarrheals or opioid analgesics) were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary efficacy end point</title><p>The primary efficacy end point of both studies was the proportion of patients who had a composite response on &#x02265;50&#x00025; of days, comprising a simultaneous improvement in abdominal pain and a reduction in diarrhea, evaluated over the initial 12 weeks of double-blind treatment (FDA end point) and over 26 weeks of treatment (European Medicines Agency end point) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Patients were asked during the screening phase of both phase 3 studies whether they had used loperamide for their IBS-D over the past year (yes/no). Patients indicating prior loperamide use were asked whether loperamide was used acutely (defined as use for short-term relief, typically not exceeding 6 days of consecutive daily use), or chronically (defined as continuous use for maintenance therapy, typically exceeding &#x02265;2 weeks of consecutive daily use), and whether loperamide had provided adequate control of their IBS symptoms (yes/no).</p><p>Use of over-the-counter loperamide rescue medication, purchased by the patient and reimbursed by the sponsor, was permitted during the treatment period for the acute treatment of uncontrolled diarrhea. A dose of 2&#x02009;mg of loperamide was permitted once every 6&#x02009;h, with the following guidelines: no more than 4 unit doses over a continuous 24&#x02009;h time period (8&#x02009;mg/day), no more than 7 unit doses over a continuous 48&#x02009;h time period (14&#x02009;mg over 2 days), and no more than 11 unit doses over a continuous 7-day time period (22&#x02009;mg over 7 days). Patients were asked to record their use of loperamide rescue in electronic diaries for 26 weeks (IBS-3001) or 30 weeks (IBS-3002). Use of above the permitted amount of loperamide initiated an automatic alert to the investigator. In the event of excessive loperamide rescue use, the status of the patient was to be evaluated by the investigator as soon as possible. Treatment discontinuation in the event of excessive loperamide rescue use was at the discretion of the investigator.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Safety and tolerability of eluxadoline were monitored throughout the studies through adverse event (AE) reporting, clinical laboratory assessments, 12-lead electrocardiograms, vital signs, concomitant medications, and physical examinations.</p></sec><sec><title>Data pooling and statistical analysis</title><p>Data for patients treated with placebo, or eluxadoline 75 or 100&#x02009;mg, were pooled from IBS-3001 and IBS-3002; overall, 2,428 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive placebo (<italic>n</italic>=809), eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=810), or eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=809) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The intention-to-treat population comprised 2,423 randomized patients from IBS-3001 and IBS-3002, treated with placebo (<italic>n</italic>=809), eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=808), or eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic>=806).</p><p>Frequency distributions were used to summarize categorical variables and descriptive statistics were used to summarize continuous variables across treatment groups. All statistical analyses were performed using a two-sided hypothesis test at the 5&#x00025; level of significance. A subgroup analysis was performed based on patients who reported that they did or did not experience adequate IBS-D symptom control with loperamide. The proportion of composite responders for each subgroup was analyzed using pair-wise Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel tests for active treatments vs. placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). To assess the impact of loperamide rescue use on composite efficacy responder rates over weeks 1&#x02013;12 and weeks 1&#x02013;26, a sensitivity analysis was performed where patients were assumed to be nonresponders for the daily response on any day where rescue loperamide was used.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patient demographics and baseline characteristics</title><p>In total, 2,428 patients were included in the enrolled set. The mean age ranged from 44.4&#x000b1;13.9 to 47.1&#x000b1;13.8 years, and the majority of patients were female in both studies (range across treatment groups, 64.8&#x02013;68.5&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The mean daily worst abdominal pain score was &#x0003e;6 across all treatment groups and the average number of daily bowel movements ranged from 4.7&#x000b1;2.2 to 5.0&#x000b1;3.0.</p></sec><sec><title>Patterns of loperamide usage in the year before randomization</title><p>Loperamide use in the year before randomization was balanced across treatment groups, and 873 (36.0&#x00025;) patients reported prior loperamide use (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Of the patients with prior loperamide use, inadequate control of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide was reported in 538 patients across all treatment groups (placebo: 58.9&#x00025; eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg: 67.1&#x00025; eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg: 58.8&#x00025;). The pattern of loperamide use before randomization tended to be mostly acute across all patients who reported prior loperamide use, ranging from 84.5 to 88.3&#x00025;, whereas chronic use of loperamide before randomization was less common (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Composite response rates according to prior symptom control with loperamide</title><p>Among the patients who reported prior loperamide use with inadequate symptom control, a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with eluxadoline were composite responders over weeks 1&#x02013;12 compared with those treated with placebo (eluxadoline 100&#x02009;mg: 27.0&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 75&#x02009;mg: 26.3&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>=0.001) vs. 12.7&#x00025;, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

There was no clear association between the timing of loperamide rescue medication use and the reporting of GI AEs, with the majority of events reported &#x0003e;14 days after the most recent loperamide dose. In those patients who had used rescue loperamide during the studies, the most common GI AEs reported (occurring in &#x02265;2&#x00025; of patients in any treatment group) included constipation, abdominal pain, and nausea (<xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>).

There is therefore a need for health-care providers to properly evaluate and treat patients with IBS. However, the treatment of IBS-D remains problematic for many providers for a number of reasons, including the lack of validated treatment guidelines, the lack of familiarity with effective therapies, the absence of prospective studies evaluating sequential therapy for IBS-D, the lack of head-to-head comparison studies directly comparing different therapeutic agents, and the inherent heterogeneity of the disease, with the result that a large proportion of patients with IBS-D express dissatisfaction with the treatment received for their IBS symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). The persistence of diarrhea in IBS-D leads many health-care providers to recommend an over-the-counter agent, such as loperamide, that is inexpensive and generally considered safe, although it has little effect on the symptoms of abdominal pain or bloating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>).</p><p>Eluxadoline was approved by the FDA in May 2015 for the treatment of both men and women with IBS-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and represents a treatment option for patients including those with inadequate symptom control with the common over-the-counter antidiarrheal agent loperamide. Eluxadoline significantly improved the overall symptoms of IBS-D in two large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 studies involving &#x0003e;2,400 patients, during 12 and 26 weeks of treatment, respectively, when compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). The results from the present analysis demonstrate that over one-third of the patients enrolled in these two phase 3 trials reported loperamide use in the year before study enrollment; however, inadequate control of IBS-D symptoms with loperamide was reported in 59&#x02013;67&#x00025; of these patients. These phase 3 studies are among the largest to report on prior loperamide use in patients with IBS-D. The authors acknowledge that unanticipated selection bias may have predisposed entry of patients who had previously experienced inadequate symptom control with loperamide use, especially as the initial question only asked for recall of loperamide use within the prior year. Regardless, the cause of inadequate symptom control with loperamide in the third of patients who admitted to using loperamide is likely to be multifactorial. Importantly, the survey instrument did not capture precise reasons for treatment failure (such as persistent abdominal pain or persistent diarrhea).</p><p>The primary efficacy end point in these studies was a composite end point that required patients to achieve &#x02265;30&#x00025; improvement in abdominal pain, with a simultaneous improvement in symptoms of diarrhea (assessed using the Bristol Stool Scale) on &#x02265;50&#x00025; of days during the 12- or 26-week study period, in order to be considered a responder. The proportion of composite responders was generally greater in patients with adequate symptom control with prior loperamide vs. those with inadequate symptom control, suggesting that patients who have previously responded to one drug may be more likely to respond to another. However, a greater proportion of patients with IBS-D who reported inadequate symptom control with loperamide noted a significant improvement in the symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea when treated with eluxadoline compared with placebo; those who reported inadequate control with loperamide were twice as likely to respond to eluxadoline than to placebo (27&#x00025; vs. 12.7&#x00025; <italic>P</italic>=0.001).</p><p>In addition, analysis of the component end points demonstrated that the stool consistency response rate was consistent with that of the composite end point, with patients reporting significant improvements in stool consistency with either dose of eluxadoline compared with placebo during the 12- or 26-week study period. For the end point of abdominal pain, there was a statistically superior pain response with eluxadoline 75&#x02009;mg over placebo, with a treatment effect size of &#x0003e;10&#x00025; over both the 12- and 26-week study periods. However, the 100&#x02009;mg dose showed no significant difference for this end point compared with placebo. In those with prior adequate symptom control with loperamide, the pain results mirrored the full analysis reported by Lembo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), with no significant differences between eluxadoline and placebo at either dose level and a greater proportion of responders with placebo. Eluxadoline is therefore a treatment option in clinical practice for patients with IBS-D who experience inadequate symptom control with loperamide, and may significantly improve abdominal pain in this patient population at the dose of 75&#x02009;mg.</p><p>These studies were not designed for direct comparison of the efficacy of eluxadoline with that of loperamide, especially with respect to long-term therapy, as only &#x0223c;14&#x00025; of patients took loperamide chronically. The extent to which one agent works better than the other for the individual symptoms of diarrhea or abdominal pain, or a composite of both, remains unclear and no conclusions can be drawn with respect to comparison of the two agents. It is notable, however, that the small studies performed previously, evaluating the efficacy of loperamide for the treatment of IBS-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), did not include the combined responder end point now required by the FDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Direct comparison of the efficacy and safety of loperamide with that of eluxadoline in patients with IBS-D using up-to-date end points remains an important area for future investigation.</p><p>During the 12- and 26-week phase 3 studies, loperamide was available for study patients to use as a rescue medication; its use was less common in patients treated with eluxadoline 75 or 100&#x02009;mg compared with those who received placebo (25.6&#x00025; and 26.7&#x00025; vs. 31.3&#x00025;, respectively), and this may suggest superior treatment satisfaction with eluxadoline. Using imputed nonresponse when rescue loperamide was used, these analyses demonstrated that the use of rescue loperamide in the two phase 3 studies did not affect the composite responder rates with eluxadoline compared with placebo, and patients receiving eluxadoline 75 or 100&#x02009;mg showed significantly higher responder rates than the placebo group (25.6&#x00025; and 26.9&#x00025; vs. 16.4&#x00025;, respectively). The exact reasons for rescue loperamide use were not collected in these studies.</p><p>Safety findings with eluxadoline in patients who reported inadequate symptom control with loperamide were consistent with the findings from the overall phase 3 patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and the known safety profile of eluxadoline (B.D. Cash <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data); over half of patients with inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide experienced AEs with eluxadoline, of which GI AEs (nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation) were the most frequent, although overall incidences were low. Of the patients who used rescue loperamide during the studies and reported GI AEs, over half reported &#x02265;1 GI AE with an onset date after loperamide use. However, there was no clear temporal relationship between loperamide use and the occurrence of GI AEs. Constipation was more frequently reported in patients treated with eluxadoline compared with placebo, though the incidence was low and consistent with that from the overall phase 3 patient population (B.D. Cash <italic>et al.</italic>, unpublished data).</p><p>The primary end point of these two large, prospective trials focused on efficacy and safety. Although data collection for the trials was prospective, the present study represents a subgroup of the initial study, with the inherent limitations of such an analysis. That said, the large sample size and the prospective nature of the analyses minimizes these limitations. Furthermore, although many of the study patients had used loperamide during the year before study initiation, over half of the patients had not, and past use of loperamide relied upon patient recollection that may be unreliable and cannot be confirmed. Indeed, the exact dose of loperamide used by patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide remains unknown; therefore, a comparison of patients who reported inadequate symptom control with prior loperamide at one dose compared with another dose is not possible.</p><p>In conclusion, eluxadoline is a therapeutic agent with a unique mechanism of action approved for the treatment of IBS-D in both men and women. A large phase 2 study and two large, prospective phase 3 studies have demonstrated that eluxadoline can effectively treat simultaneous symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea in patients with IBS-D. The current analyses demonstrate that eluxadoline can effectively treat IBS-D symptoms in patients who report inadequate relief with prior loperamide as well as in those who report adequate relief with prior loperamide. In addition, patients who took loperamide as a rescue medication during blinded study participation had nearly identical response rates and did not exhibit a greater number of AEs as compared with the population overall. These findings are clinically relevant as they demonstrate to health-care providers that eluxadoline is an efficacious and safe treatment option for the majority of patients diagnosed with IBS-D, irrespective of prior treatment experience with loperamide.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ajg201772i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors met criteria for authorship as recommended by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors.
