An estimated 422&#x02009;million adults, or 10% of the global population, were living with diabetes in 2014 of whom around 90% had type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Poorly controlled diabetes is associated with premature mortality and a high risk of complications, including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy and retinopathy. The risk of complications can be reduced by good control of glycaemia and cardiovascular risk factors.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> Interventions which improve self-management skills for patients with diabetes can improve health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> and international guidelines support training patients in self-management.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 5</xref> However, it is not clear how best to support patients in developing such skills, and uptake of diabetes self-management education remains low. In England, despite over 90% of eligible patients being referred,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> only 5.3% attended self-management training in 2014&#x02013;2015.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
</p><p>Poor uptake may be related to the dominant model of structured education, which is group-based sessions, lasting a half or whole day or spread over regular sessions over several weeks.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Many patients, such as those who work, those with caring commitments or those who are uncomfortable in groups, may find it difficult to attend.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref>
</p><p>Web-based support for self-management could address some of these barriers, particularly in high-income countries, where levels of web&#x000a0;access are high. In the UK, over 80% of households had internet access in 2015, and internet access among older people continues to grow steadily.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Potential advantages include convenience, anonymity, regular updates and the potential to use video and graphics to present complex information in a format accessible to those with low literacy.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Although systematic reviews have confirmed that computer-based interventions can improve health outcomes in diabetes,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> not all such interventions have a beneficial impact, with meta-analyses showing substantial heterogeneity related to widely differing interventions, including in the use of theory to develop the intervention,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> outcomes<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 16</xref> and the duration of follow-up, with most trials having relatively short follow-up (less than 12 months).<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This is the first UK-based trial of a comprehensive, web-based self-management support programme for people with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>This trial assessed the effects of a web-based self-management programme, called Healthy Living for People with Diabetes (HeLP-Diabetes), on glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and diabetes-related distress over 12 months.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design and participants</title><p>&#x000a0;Multicentre, two-arm individually randomised controlled trial in 21 general practices in England with a mix of urban, suburban and rural practices. Practices were required to have two nurses&#x02014;one to facilitate access to the intervention, and one to collect data.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Standard opt-in recruitment procedures were followed. Each practice had a register of patients with T2DM. The electronic medical record of every patient on this register was reviewed to screen out ineligible patients, and the remainder were sent a letter from their general practitioner (GP), inviting them to participate in the study. Eligible participants were adults, aged 18 or over, with T2DM, registered with participating general practices. Patients were excluded if they were unable to provide informed consent; unable to use a computer due to severe mental or physical impairment; had insufficient spoken or written English to use the intervention (operationalised as unable to consult without an interpreter); were terminally ill with less than 12 months life expectancy; or were currently participating in a trial of an alternative self-management programme. Participants were not required to have home internet access or prior experience of using the internet to participate. Participants with previous or current experience of self-management education were eligible to participate. Recruitment took place between September 2013 and December 2014. The trial protocol was submitted for publication in June 2014.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> There were no changes to the methods after the protocol was agreed and the start of the trial. Ethical approval was obtained from Camden and Islington National Research Ethics Service committee, reference 12/LO/1571.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Patient involvement</title><p>Patients were involved in all stages of the study, including contributing to the original application for funding as coinvestigators; substantive and ongoing contribution to intervention development; contributing to the trial design, including the decision to have two coprimary outcomes; active membership of the Trial Steering Committee and Trial Management Group and contributing to the writing of this paper. This last role is recognised through coauthorship (MK).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>Randomisation marked the point of study entry. It was performed centrally (independently of the trial team), after written informed consent was obtained and all baseline data were completed, using a web-based randomisation system, at the level of the individual participant. Randomisation was conducted in a 1:1 ratio using random permuted blocks of sizes 2, 4 and 6, stratified by recruitment centre. Participants were informed the trial compared two forms of web-based support, and were blinded as to which was the intervention and which the comparator. Nurses who offered facilitation for the intervention could not be blinded, but were asked not to discuss details of allocation with the nurses who gathered follow-up data. The research team obtaining and analysing data from participants were blind to allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention</title><p>The intervention consisted of facilitated access to HeLP-Diabetes. Facilitation consisted of an introductory training session with the practice nurse. In this appointment, patients were were shown how to log on, set a user name and password and introduced to the content of the website. HeLP-Diabetes was a theoretically informed web-based programme whose overall goals were to improve health outcomes and reduce diabetes-related distress.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Overall, content was guided by the Corbin and Strauss model of managing a long-term condition which posits that patients must undertake medical, emotional and role management.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> It was developed using participatory design principles, with substantial input from users, defined as patients with T2DM and health professionals caring for such patients. All content was evidence-based, drawing on evidence on management of diabetes, promoting behaviour change and emotional well-being and maximising usability and engagement. Content was designed to be accessible to people with a wide range of literacy and health literacy skills, with all essential content provided in both video and text. There were information sections on diabetes, how diabetes is treated, possible complications of diabetes, possible impacts of diabetes on relationships at home and at work, dealing with unusual situations like parties, holidays, travelling or shift work and what lifestyle modifications will improve health. There were sections addressing skills and behaviour change, including behaviour change modules on eating healthily, losing weight, being more physically active, smoking cessation, moderating alcohol consumption, managing medicines, glycaemic control and blood pressure control. Users could set the programme to send themselves reminder text messages or emails, and could specify the content and frequency of such reminders. The third strand of components focused on emotional well-being with self-help tools based on cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness. There were multiple personal stories (used with license from health talk online), and a moderated forum. Participants were free to use the programme as much or as little as they chose. Engagement with the programme was promoted through regular newsletters, emails and short message service containing updates on latest diabetes-related research or practice, seasonally&#x000a0;relevant advice (eg, fasting during Ramadan, benefits of &#x02018;influenza&#x02019; vaccinations), and links to specific relevant parts of the programme. Two or three prompts were sent each month, although users could opt-out of receiving them.

However, to improve acceptability to participants and to maintain blinding, all participants had access to a website. Participants in the control arm were given access to a simple information website, based on the information available on the website of the main UK diabetes charity (Diabetes UK) or National Health Service patient information website (NHS Choices). They received the same initial facilitation meeting as participants in the intervention group, in which they were shown how to log on, set a user name and password and how to use the website.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Outcomes and outcome measures</title><sec id="s2g1"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p>The outcomes reflected the dual goals of improving health outcomes and reducing diabetes-related distress.

Blood samples were analysed at the local NHS laboratory used by participating practices for routine clinical analyses. Data on completion of the &#x02018;nine essential processes&#x02019; were collected from the GP record for the 12 months prior to randomisation and the 12 months after randomisation at the 12-month follow-up point to avoid triggering behaviour change among the study nurses.

Additional final outcome data, obtained outside the 10&#x02013;14&#x02009;month predefined window, were available for a further 27 participants for HbA1c and 16 participants for PAID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Data obtained outside the 10&#x02013;14&#x02009;months window were not used directly in the primary analysis, but were entered into the imputation model (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary table 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram showing patient flow through the HeLP-Diabetes randomised controlled trial.&#x000a0;HbA1c, glycated haemoglobin; HeLP-Diabetes, Healthy Living for People with Diabetes; PAID, Problem Areas in Diabetes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016009f01"/></fig><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>.

Duration of diabetes had no effect on change in HbA1c (online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP2">supplementary table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Harms</title><p>There were no reported harms in either group.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this first UK-based trial of a web-based self-management programme for people with T2DM, participants randomised to HeLP-Diabetes demonstrated improved glycaemic control at 12 months compared with those randomised to a simple information website. This improvement appears robust across all prespecified sensitivity analyses, and was not dependent on duration of diabetes, baseline glycaemic levels or level of diabetes-related distress. Each 1% reduction in HbA1c is associated with a risk reduction of 21% for deaths related to diabetes and a 37% risk reduction for microvascular complications.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> A reduction in HbA1c of 0.24% across a population level could translate into considerable population benefit, particularly as this web-based intervention could be delivered at low-cost and at scale across the UK. Moreover, in contrast to group-based education, where the effects appear to wane with time,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> the effects of HeLP-Diabetes were greater at 12 months than at 3 months. There was no overall impact on diabetes-related distress, but some evidence that HeLP-Diabetes appeared to reduce distress in recently diagnosed individuals. However, it is worth noting that baseline PAID scores were exceptionally low in this trial population. In a small pilot study, participants offered supported access to HeLP-Diabetes reduced their PAID scores by six points (p=0.04) over 6 weeks.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p><p>The trial has many strengths. It was a pragmatic trial, open to nearly all patients with T2DM in participating practices. Concealment of allocation was complete, as randomisation occurred after baseline data collection. Baseline prognostic factors were well balanced between groups. Every effort was made to achieve blinding, including requiring practices to have two nurses, so that data collection were undertaken by a nurse blind to participant allocation. Data for the coprimary outcomes at the primary outcome point were available for 78% and 86% of participants for HbA1c and PAID, respectively. All analyses were on an intention-to-treat basis, supplemented by a CACE analysis. Although response rates for the coprimary outcomes were good, some potential for bias existed. Our primary analysis used multiple imputation methods because evidence shows that the assumptions underpinning this method are more defensible than those assumed using other approaches to missing data.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> We also undertook sensitivity analyses including complete cases, non-contaminated cases and a linear model excluding centre; all yielded similar results.</p><p>The two coprimary outcomes reflected the twin aims of the intervention: to improve diabetes control and to reduce diabetes-related distress. Around 40% of patients with diabetes have significant levels of distress, which severely impacts on quality of life,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and diabetes-related distress is an important outcome for patients.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Our patient and public involvement panel were clear that this should be a primary outcome, and a recent meta-ethnography emphasised the importance of empowerment and quality of life in promoting long-term engagement with self-management.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In contrast, many healthcare professionals are more interested in glycaemic control. In line with previous trials in this area,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> we decided to adopt both as coprimary outcomes and to test both at a 5% level of significance.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
</p><p>There are some limitations. Despite maximising the inclusivity of the trial by minimising the exclusion criteria, participants were not representative of the overall population of patients with type 2 diabetes in England. Compared with the overall population, participants had better control of their diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref> and were much less distressed.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This finding mirrors that of a recent systematic review of demographic factors associated with web portal usage among people with diabetes which found that those with well controlled diabetes were more likely to use such portals than those with poor control.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> However, fewer of our participants self-rated their computer skills as excellent (57% of our sample compared with a national average of 73%).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This good control at baseline has two implications&#x02014;first, that there was little room for improvement in this population and second, that this population may have been unusually motivated to self-manage their diabetes. Although every effort was made to maintain blinding, it is possible that some participants may have discussed their use of the intervention with research nurses, making it possible to infer which arm they had been allocated to. This could have affected research nurses&#x02019; measurements of secondary clinical outcomes, such as blood pressure or weight, but could not have affected assessment of HbA1c as this was measured by laboratory staff who were blinded. There appeared to be high potential for contamination between two participants who shared the same surname and address, and a further two participants did not receive their allocated intervention due to an error at practice level; excluding these four made no difference to the results. A further limitation of the trial is that it provides little insight into the mechanism of action of HeLP-Diabetes. This was the result of a deliberate decision to focus on clinically important outcomes and minimise both the response burden and the potential impact of measurement on participants.</p><p>This is the first UK-based trial of a web-based self-management programme for people with type 2 diabetes, and internationally, the first trial of such a comprehensive intervention that aims to address the three main tasks of self-management: emotional, medical and role management.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In the Cochrane review of computer-based self-management interventions for people with T2DM, only four of the included studies had follow-up of 12 months or more.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Of these, three interventions were clinic-based, with participants completing self-assessment tools on a touch screen and receiving tailored advice during their baseline visit to their diabetes clinician<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref> and one was a mobile phone-based intervention which provided tailored messages in response to participant&#x02019;s results of blood glucose self-monitoring data.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> A more recent systematic review of internet delivered diabetes self-management identified 2 trials with 12 or more months follow-up.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> One trial was on a structured intervention based on a peer-led, group-based, diabetes self-management course.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> There were six sessions, with each session available for 1&#x02009;week. Each session required participants to make a specific action plan to address a problem they were experiencing. Peer facilitators encouraged use of the programme. Follow-up was planned at 6 and 12 months; however, HbA1c data were only available at 6 months. The other trial compared two versions of a web-based intervention (with and without additional social support) to enhanced usual care. The web-based intervention was designed using social&#x000a0;cognitive theory and a social&#x000a0;ecological model, with a focus on three main behaviours: dietary intake, physical activity and medication adherence. Users of either web-based intervention received motivational phone calls to encourage adherence and development of action plans. Those randomised to the enhanced intervention (with additional social support) received two additional phone calls and an invitation to attend a group session. There was no difference between groups in HbA1c or other biological outcomes at 12 months.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Thus, the results of this trial add significantly to the available literature.</p><p>On the basis of these results, HeLP-Diabetes may be considered as an addition to the current menu of self-management support for people with type 2 diabetes, and may help increase overall access and uptake. Most commissioned services currently focus on newly diagnosed patients, leaving clear unmet need for people who have had their diabetes for longer, but are looking for ways to improve their health. Many patients are not ready to engage in self-management early in their illness journey,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> but become motivated to do so later, often as a result of a change in medication or development of a complication.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> The intervention is low cost, and as most costs are fixed, irrespective of number of users, is likely to be cost-effective, particularly if widely used. A cost-effectiveness analysis of HeLP-Diabetes will be reported separately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e415" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016009.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e416" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016009.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We gratefully acknowledge the permission to use under license the validated behaviour change modules for weight loss (POWeR), alcohol reduction (DownYour Drink) and smoking cessation (StopAdvisor) and the diabetes module from Healthtalk online in HeLP-Diabetes.
