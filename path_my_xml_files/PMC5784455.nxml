However, no effective interventions are available to target neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with aphasia who have severe language and communication deficits. <italic>Objective.</italic> The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of 2 different methods of speech and language therapy in reducing symptoms of depression in aphasia on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) using secondary analysis (BILAT-1 trial). <italic>Methods.</italic> In a crossover randomized controlled trial, 18 participants with chronic nonfluent aphasia following left-hemispheric brain lesions were assigned to 2 consecutive treatments: (1) intensive language-action therapy (ILAT), emphasizing communicative language use in social interaction, and (2) intensive naming therapy (INT), an utterance-centered standard method. Patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups, receiving both treatments in counterbalanced order. Both interventions were applied for 3.5 hours daily over a period of 6 consecutive working days. Outcome measures included depression scores on the BDI and a clinical language test (Aachen Aphasia Test). <italic>Results.</italic> Patients showed a significant decrease in symptoms of depression after ILAT but not after INT, which paralleled changes on clinical language tests. Treatment-induced decreases in depression scores persisted when controlling for individual changes in language performance. <italic>Conclusions.</italic> Intensive training of behaviorally relevant verbal communication in social interaction might help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>aphasia</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>communication</kwd><kwd>neurological rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>language therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1545968317744275"><funding-source id="funding1-1545968317744275"><institution-wrap><institution>German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG)</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1545968317744275"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aphasia is a common neurological condition usually resulting from focal damage to perisylvian regions in the language-dominant left hemisphere (LH).

Although diagnostic instruments such as the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> cannot be used for all participants with aphasia, alternative methods for diagnosis of affective disorders can be applied.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>To date, treatment of PSD has largely focused on drug treatment with antidepressants (mostly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). In a Cochrane review, including 16 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the effectiveness of pharmacological and psychological interventions in treating patients with PSD was evaluated. The evaluation showed that drug treatment was minimally effective over placebo and that psychological intervention alone was not effective in ameliorating symptoms of PSD.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>Psychological therapies in PSD have used psychoeducative interventions<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> as well as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a highly effective method to treat major depressive disorders.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, none of these methods was effective in PSD patients, and importantly, participants with aphasia were excluded from most previous pharmacological and nonpharmacological studies of PSD. Therefore, it is important and timely to find appropriate treatments for the clinical group of aphasics with PSD.</p><p>The study aimed to test (1) whether speech-language therapy tailored at improving communicative language skills, can help improve language deficits in patients with aphasia. As a secondary aim, we tested (2) whether aphasia therapy can ameliorate symptoms of depression and whether (3) improvements in depressive symptoms are associated with specific treatment methods. Crucially, it was investigated (4) whether changes in depression scores are associated with language improvements after treatment. To our knowledge, the present study is the first RCT (BILAT-1 trial) to address treatment effects on depression specifically in patients with aphasia.</p><p>Individuals with chronic aphasia participated in two types of intensive language therapy: intensive language-action therapy (ILAT),<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr19-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> an extended form of constraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT),<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="bibr21-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr22-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> which emphasizes the training of language as a tool for communication in social-interactive settings, and a more traditional speech and language therapy method, naming therapy,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> which emphasizes utterance production to pictorial stimuli. Both methods made use of standard techniques known from CBT, including positive reinforcement and shaping. A crossover RCT was implemented in which each patient was assigned to one of two groups either receiving ILAT followed by intensive naming therapy (INT) or the reversed order. Several previous RCTs already demonstrated the efficacy of ILAT/CIAT<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and naming<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> in improving language functions in participants with chronic aphasia (see also a recent Cochrane Review<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>).

To assess symptoms of depression, we focused on a standard depression scale, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). We expected to find a reduction in symptoms of depression to be associated with therapy-induced language improvements. Moreover, we entertained the possibility of symptom improvements to be related to the specific type of language intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-1545968317744275"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section3-1545968317744275"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 18 patients (7 females) with chronic nonfluent aphasia participated in this study and were recruited from self-help groups by advertisements on web pages or were referred to us by local speech and language therapists.

The results clearly showed that intensive communicative language therapy has a beneficial effect not only on language but, crucially, on symptoms of depression in chronic aphasia. This is the first RCT in participants with aphasia that demonstrates the efficacy of a specific, nonpharmacological treatment in reducing symptoms of depression in chronic patients. Our results document a statistically significant decrease in symptoms of depression specifically after treatment with a highly effective aphasia therapy regime, ILAT, emphasizing communication in social interactions. The treatment-related changes in BDI scores after ILAT intervals in both groups indicate clinically relevant changes in severity of depressive symptoms specifically for this aphasia therapy. Based on studies assessing the minimally important clinical difference (MCID)<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> on the BDI-II in patients with major depression, it has been suggested that pre-post BDI changes of 5 or higher<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> or a decrease in BDI scores of 17.5% or higher<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> can be interpreted as clinically relevant. In our study, ILAT-related reductions in mean BDI scores (pooled across both groups) were 27%, whereas INT led to a 9.8% reduction, which was statistically nonsignificant. According to Button et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> the decrease in BDI scores after ILAT can be interpreted as a MCID and was independent of clinical improvements in language performance, as assessed by subscales on the AAT. As shown by our previous work,<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> changes in expressive language ability in chronic participants with aphasia are likewise stronger with this intensive communication method (ILAT) than with intensive naming (INT), although the coexisting improvement in symptoms of depression cannot be explained by language restitution.</p><p>All patients in this study were at the chronic stage of the disease; therefore, spontaneous fluctuations in language abilities and mood are unlikely.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Any behavioral changes observed can, therefore, be attributed with some confidence to the short-term intensive therapies. Furthermore, the fact that patients did not significantly benefit from INT suggests that the group setting and nonverbal social interactions per se cannot explain the reduction in depression scores because these aspects were comparable across both treatments. Moreover, treatment effects cannot be attributed to medication because this was not changed during the study. Notably, the number of depressed and nondepressed patients (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-1545968317744275">Table 1</xref>) receiving antidepressant medication did not differ between the two treatment groups.</p><p>It may be a strength of our study that we assessed symptoms of depression in a clinically relatively homogeneous sample of the nonfluent aphasia type, which is commonly associated with depression.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, we note that our results cannot be generalized to patients with fluent aphasia or to subacute or acute patients; this will have to be tested in future studies. Besides the higher prevalence of depression in nonfluent aphasia,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> the advantage of focusing on nonfluent patients is also their relatively good comprehension abilities, making it possible to obtain self-report depression ratings when questions are guided by a clinician.</p><p>The average age of our patient sample was slightly less than that of the general stroke population; nevertheless, it was comparable to previous studies on aphasia rehabilitation.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It should be noted that the average age of ischemic stroke is steadily decreasing because of a significantly higher incidence of stroke in younger individuals (&#x0003c;50 years) in recent years.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The high prevalence rate of poor functional outcome associated with affective and psychosocial problems in this patient group requires optimization of neurorehabilitation treatment. Apart from this trend toward stroke at younger age, on the positive side, younger patients are often more motivated and willing to participate in neurorehabilitation than older patients. This enhanced motivation in younger patients might constitute a selection bias, generally, in all kinds of rehabilitation studies. Moreover, many patients in our study were recruited from aphasia self-help groups, which could also have contributed to a selection bias because these groups are usually frequented by motivated patients. Finally, our sample size was relatively small and the exclusion of the one patient without aphasia according to AAT Token Test criteria slightly reduced our initial statistical power. In future, it would be desirable for further RCTs to include a larger number of patients while keeping the homogeneity of the group with regard to clinical variables.</p><p>Much effort was spent to balance the two treatments for unspecific features, such as attention, training intensity, stimulus materials, or group size and setting (see Methods). It cannot be completely ruled out that unspecific effects associated with the therapeutic process per se (e.g, getting more attention, being more active) have contributed to the improvement in depressive symptoms in our sample; however, this would equally apply to both treatment methods. Therefore, the beneficial effects of ILAT are unlikely to have emerged from unspecific factors but may more realistically be attributable to specific features of the training methods applied.</p><p>Patients in group 2 showed a trend toward reduced BDI scores after the first training interval when INT was applied, but this change was statistically not significant. Group 1 did not show any change in symptom severity after INT during the second therapy interval, which could potentially be attributed to a ceiling effect. However, the significant decrease in BDI scores in group 2 between T2 and T3 and the absence of such a decrease in group 1 during this time interval may indeed indicate that ILAT is more effective than INT.</p><p>Which features of ILAT could make this method effective in reducing symptoms of depression? ILAT is a treatment method derived from neuroscientific principles, including massed practice, focus on verbal expression, and crucially, behavioral relevance, including the use of spoken language in communication and social interaction contexts. Our study isolated the latter property; the distinct feature of ILAT as compared with INT was the behaviorally relevant and action-embedded use of verbal utterances<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1545968317744275" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> in the context of social group interactions. Whereas the practice of naming in the INT context focused on specific target words, whose production was likewise an aim of ILAT, the flexible use and the broader repertoire of speech acts and communicative goals in ILAT may have been relevant features. Accordingly, the action-related and social aspects of communicating about objects to be passed from one player to the other often leads to positive interpersonal interactions, which may have contributed to mood improvements and to a reduction in depressive symptoms. Although future research is necessary to prove a causal link, our present results suggest a treatment-specific positive effect of ILAT, particularly of its behaviorally relevant communicative and social interaction component, on symptoms of depression. This effect was observed when controlling for individual changes in language performance, making it unlikely that reduced BDI scores arise directly from changes in language skills, as assessed by clinical language tests, and the associated positive assessment of own behavior. Still, the possibility exists that, during ILAT, patients may have improved communicative-pragmatic skills not assessed by clinical language tests, which, in turn, could have positively influenced patients&#x02019; symptoms of depression. Alternatively, aspects of the intensive communicative interaction implemented in ILAT may have an effect on symptoms of depression directly, without the mediation of language. Future research will be necessary to investigate any possible role of the specific features of language and communication therapy on symptoms of depression in chronic aphasia patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section13-1545968317744275"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that ILAT, an effective aphasia therapy method, may help reduce symptoms of depression in patients with chronic nonfluent aphasia, a patient group at high risk of developing PSD. ILAT offers a short-term treatment that is suitable for brain-damaged individuals with impaired language and communication abilities, a clinical group that usually does not have access to nonpharmacological treatment of depression. Thus, intervention with intensive, behaviorally relevant communicative therapy and associated social interactions not only helps improve functional recovery of language, but may also enhance psychological well-being. In future, more studies are needed to investigate long-term stability of treatment effects as well as further variables that might be relevant for reducing depressive symptoms, such as the amount and duration of treatment. This will ultimately help improve the quality of life of patients with chronic aphasia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We wish to thank our patients and their carers for participating in this study.
