<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> with some studies reporting comparable, if not higher, burden and distress among their partners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12 R13 R14">12&#x02013;14</xref> This might, in part, be attributed to partners&#x02019; tendency to subjugate their own needs for those of the patient and to protect patients from additional distress, often at the expense of their own emotional well-being. Although it is generally assumed that elevated anxiety and depression are confined to the acute postdiagnosis phase, a few studies have found that patients and partners experience chronic distress well into survivorship.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> This is concerning as high distress has been associated with lower treatment adherence,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> In their seminal book on stress and coping, Lazarus and Folkman<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref> defined coping as &#x0201c;cognitive and behavioural efforts to manage the demands of a situation or condition that is appraised as taxing or exceeding the resources of the person.&#x0201d; Coping is typically characterised either as problem-focused coping (alter the stressful situation using strategies such as information-seeking, planning and problem solving) or emotion-focused coping (regulate situation-related emotions using strategies such as positive reappraisal and behavioural disengagement) and further considered for their adaptive versus maladaptive nature. The assumption is that if individuals use adaptive coping and are able to regain a sense of control over cancer challenges and negative emotions, they are then less likely to experience distress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> In this sense, coping is not only a valuable explanatory concept regarding variability in response to stress, it can also serve as a portal for intervention, that is, if adaptive coping skills are not known, they can then be learnt.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Despite conflicting results, most studies support the notion that increasing patient engagement with the stressor, through both problem-focused and emotion-focused coping, is generally associated with more positive adjustment than when less functional coping responses are used (eg, avoidance and denial).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> A number of studies have also corroborated these findings among partners of individuals with cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref></p><p>Beyond individual approaches to coping, recent studies have further considered how patients and partners interact as they attempt to cope together with cancer-related stressors and challenges (termed dyadic coping).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> The evidence on the impact of different dyadic coping strategies mirrors to a certain extent that of individual coping, whereby adjustment is greater when patients and partners respond to each other's stress, view cancer challenges as a shared problem and engage in joint problem solving that involves the pooling of resources.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> Berg <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> found that the relationship between collaborative coping and illness adjustment for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and their wives was partially moderated by heightened perceptions of coping effectiveness. Conversely, when patients and/or partners use avoidant coping,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> control<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> or protective buffering<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> illness adjustment was compromised.</p><p>On the basis of the aforementioned evidence on individual and dyadic coping, considerable research efforts have focused on the development of coping skills training interventions to maximise the use of adaptive coping by patients and partners and so decrease physical and psychological distress in response to cancer challenges.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Coping skills fostered by these interventions typically include problem solving, symptom management, communication (with family/friends or healthcare professionals) and stress management. A number of reviews and meta-analyses have supported the efficacy of such multicomponent coping skills training interventions in decreasing patient and partner anxiety and increasing quality of life, particularly if these are based on principles of cognitive behaviour therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref> Traditionally, these interventions have mainly focused on how patients cope with cancer-related challenges; however, with the increased recognition of the substantial burden of cancer on partners and the reciprocal relationship between partner's reactions to the cancer diagnosis,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> coping skills training interventions are increasingly targeting both patients and partners as a unit.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> Recent reviews have suggested that, in some contexts, couple-based interventions might be more efficacious in achieving optimal patient and partner adjustment than individual-based interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> This might in part be attributed to the shared learning that occurs in couple-based coping skills training interventions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref></p><p>Although couple-based coping skills interventions seem promising for patients and/or their partners, issues pertaining to their accessibility and delivery linger.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Most coping interventions are labour intensive, requiring access to highly trained healthcare professionals, limiting their long-term sustainability due to high costs and problems with accessibility in rural and regional areas. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that conventional interventions may not be accessed by patients, due to personal preference, geographical barriers and mobility issues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">37</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref> One study found the uptake rate of referrals to psychosocial services by distressed patients to be as low as 14%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R39">39</xref> This suggests that service providers need to consider alternate approaches to ensure that the coping interventions for couples are not only efficacious and cost-effective but also accessible and sustainable. Using a group format instead of an individual format has been proposed to address cost issues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> However, research has been equivocal regarding the suitability of these interventions in comparison to individual ones.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">41</xref> In addition, failure to create and sustain a functioning group is a challenge with some patient populations, which in turn might compromise the efficacy of the intervention.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R40">40</xref> To overcome some of the challenges, while maintaining cost-effectiveness, the use of a self-directed approach has been proposed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">42</xref></p><p>Self-directed (also termed self-help or self-administered) interventions address some of the issues surrounding access to face-to-face interventions and provide couples with greater flexibility regarding when and how they engage with the intervention content. There is a growing body of evidence to suggest that self-directed coping skills training interventions are cost-effective and acceptable to patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42 R43 R44 R45">42&#x02013;45</xref> Furthermore, research supports the efficacy of self-directed interventions for enhancing patient well-being,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42 R43 R44 R45">42&#x02013;45</xref> especially for patients reporting elevated levels of distress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref> or high uncertainty.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">43</xref> Regrettably, all self-directed interventions reviewed to date are mainly developed to directly address patients&#x02019; concern, neglecting those of the partners. To address this gap in the literature our team has recently developed <italic>Coping-Together</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46 R47 R48">46&#x02013;48</xref> a self-directed coping skills training intervention for couples affected by cancer.

The patient's and the partner's consents are required for the couple to participate in this trial.

Study findings will be disseminated not only through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations but also through educational outreach visits and interactive educational meetings, publication of lay research summaries and recommendations for further actions in consumer newsletters and websites and publications targeting clinicians.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s7"><title>Discussion</title><p><italic>Coping-Together</italic> is an innovative coping skills training intervention that translates evidence-based strategies for effective illness self-management and coping into a readily accessible format that couples can use where and when they need to. To the best of our knowledge, <italic>Coping-Together</italic> is the first intervention of its kind for couples adjusting to a recent cancer diagnosis. Over a 12-month period, we will investigate how <italic>Coping-Together</italic> is used by both patients and their partners to address their main cancer-related challenges and examine how it impacts on the psychosocial outcomes of patients and partners, with a focus on anxiety, depression, distress, coping, self-efficacy, dyadic adjustment and quality of life. The findings of this trial will add to the literature arguing for greater psychosocial care in the acute postdiagnostic phase and early survivorship, while simultaneously identifying both individual-level and couple-level factors that contribute to patient and partner outcomes.</p><p>There are several strengths to this study and numerous potential benefits of the <italic>Coping-Together</italic> resource that make it potentially an invaluable addition to the psychosocial care of couples dealing with cancer. First, the projected sample size, recruitment from multiple sites across states and the use of a longitudinal design will address some of the methodological limitations of previous couple-based interventions in cancer care (eg, being under powered).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref> Second, <italic>Coping-Together</italic> covers a broad range of cancer-related challenges recently identified across three reviews as common unmet needs of couples facing cancer. Specifically, the areas identified as requiring greater inclusion in interventions that are covered by <italic>Coping-Together</italic> are strategies for communicating with healthcare professionals,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref> addressing communication difficulties between partners,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref> dealing with emotional reactions such as fear, uncertainty, anxiety and depression in both partners<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref> and learning new skills to overcome a lack of effective coping skills.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R88">88</xref> Third, this trial will directly examine the efficacy of <italic>Coping-Together</italic> in not only reducing negative psychological outcomes but also on a range of outcomes known to impact patients&#x02019; and partners&#x02019; cancer experience (eg, self-efficacy, dyadic coping). Fourth, the self-directed format addresses issues of access to psychosocial support, especially for couples in non-metropolitan areas. The use of multiple formats also potentially increases the appeal of the resource, and therefore may increase utility to a broader population of cancer patients and their partners. Finally, the self-directed nature of <italic>Coping-Together</italic> means that it has the potential to be cost-effective and be integrated into practice without increasing pressures on the oncology workforce. The cost-efficacy of the intervention will be directly assessed in this trial, an important consideration as economic evaluation is an often overlooked element of intervention research.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R89">89</xref></p><p>Despite these strengths, there are also several challenges for the trial. The target population is vulnerable and experiencing an acute stressor, which in turn may impact on both recruitment and retention, a challenge identified by other trials with couples facing cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R90">90</xref> Furthermore, the longitudinal nature of the design increases the likelihood of attrition. An additional challenge is whether the measures employed to assess change over time will be sensitive enough to detect clinically significant improvements experienced by the couples.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R87">87</xref> This challenge is partly mitigated by the integration of the Resource Evaluation Survey, which may help to clarify trends detected in the outcome data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e194" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003337.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study detailed in this protocol is endorsed by the Psycho-oncology Co-operative Research Group (PoCoG), The University of Sydney, Australia.
