Low-cost non-pharmacological treatments are usually the first choice of professionals and parents. The study examined the outcomes of specific strength training for girls with TTH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Forty-nine girls 9-18 years with TTH were randomised to patient education programmes with 10 weeks of strength training compared with counselling by nurse and physiotherapist. Primary outcomes were headache frequency, intensity and duration; secondary were neck-shoulder muscle strength, aerobic power and pericranial tenderness, measured baseline, after intervention and at 12 weeks follow-up. HRQOL questionnaires were assessed at baseline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>For both groups headache frequency decreased significantly, p=0.001 and likewise for duration p=0.022, with no significant between-group differences. The odds of having headache a random day decreased during 22 weeks by 0.65 (0.50-0.84) (OR (95%CI)). For both groups neck extension strength decreased significantly with a decrease in cervicothoracic ratio to 1.7, indicating a change in muscle balance. In the training group shoulder strength increased &#x02265; 10 % in 5/20 girls and estimated VO2 max increased &#x02265; 15% for 4/20 girls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both training and counselling lead to headache reduction. Adjusting muscle-balance seems to precede strength gains. Exercising might lead to important changes in the child&#x02019;s physical capability and health. Restructuring patient education and examining dose-response of exercising is recommended.</p><p>No conflict of interest.</p></sec></body></article>
