In 2005, in the US alone, HF-related costs rose to $27.9 billion, a $4.7 billion increase in three years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jmdh-2-013">3</xref> This rise is likely to continue due to the rapid growth in the aging population along with a longer life expectancy. HF is a final common pathway of various illnesses and conditions and is usually chronic without a cure. HF, therefore, is a condition that greatly impacts the individual and society as a whole.</p><p>One strategy for slowing decline with chronic HF is to improve daily healthy behaviors including reducing and monitoring salt and fat intake, smoking, and alcohol consumption, committing to regular exercise,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jmdh-2-013">1</xref> medication adherence, and maintaining a positive attitude. This strategy takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop and individualize. Although effective, the obstacles for this intervention have been identified: the high cost and the large amount of effort<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jmdh-2-013">4</xref> for providers as well as patients.</p><p>In order to overcome these limitations, Internet use has been suggested as a means to change daily health behavior<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jmdh-2-013">4</xref> by empowering a large number of patients to take more control of their health.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jmdh-2-013">5</xref> An early study with HF patients compared the efficacy of an interactive voice response system and interactive web-based technologies (e-health group) to change health behavior.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jmdh-2-013">6</xref> After one year of intervention, exercise and general activities were similar for both groups, but the e-health group had lower health care costs. A study using a meta-analysis concluded that Internet-based health interventions can improve behavioral outcomes such as increased exercise time, knowledge of nutritional status, knowledge of asthma treatment, body shape perception, and was also effective in weight loss maintenance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jmdh-2-013">7</xref></p><p>Although Internet access is less common among older adults than younger adults, once they use, their use pattern is similar to that of younger adults.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-jmdh-2-013">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-jmdh-2-013">9</xref> As rapid growth of Internet use among older adults advances, theoretically, so do both the opportunity and the tools to improve health practices and improve health outcomes while reducing health costs.</p><p>A conceptual framework, Model Toward Optimal Independence through Technological Adoption (M-TOMITA) was formed for this study based on the Trans-theoretical Model (TTM),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jmdh-2-013">10</xref> social support theory,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jmdh-2-013">11</xref> and a mass communication theory called Uses and Gratifications.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jmdh-2-013">12</xref> The M-TOMITA works best when individuals are already aware of their chronic conditions and are contemplating doing something to manage their illness but are not sure what to do (the contemplation stage). If someone has little knowledge of their illness and is not aware that changing health behavior may help them, this model may not be effective. The model is an empowerment process that progresses through stages from contemplation, preparation, and action, to maintenance. Using the Internet method, four types of support by health care professionals can be provided. Informational support or education of chronic illness and suggested health behaviors is especially important in the initial stage but should continue all the stages. Among the recommended health behaviors, patients will choose an activity to focus on. Once the first activity is successfully implemented, additional activities will be added, one by one. After the decision regarding a particular health behavior is made, Instrumental support should be provided via the Internet. Through the online record-keeping system the participant can track their own vital signs and health behaviors so that they can become aware of a cause (life style) and effect (symptom and general health) relationship. The website also provides participants and nurse monitors the record with alerts for critical measures so that health care providers can be notified. This record is shared with their health care providers at office or home visits for the purpose of monitoring as well as appraisal support to reinforce patient motivation. Internet use, especially in the initial stage, boosts older adults&#x02019; self-esteem. They realize their ability to learn something new and feel they are up to date with their children and their grandchildren. The Internet is so versatile; it provides not only opportunities for education, but also for frequent communication with families and friends, leisure through playing games to stimulate and challenge the mind, and can improve instrumental activity of daily living (IADL) by participating in online shopping on drugs, books, and even groceries. Mastering Internet technology, therefore, improves the quality of life of older adults. Throughout this process, emotional support from health care professionals is important to keep the participants motivated until the time that their illness prevents them from using the computer. Its application to Internet use is described in the intervention section of this study, and is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jmdh-2-013">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to develop and test an e-health intervention using a multidisciplinary approach to improve health behavior and outcomes among older adults with HF. Hypotheses in this study are that the treatment group will: (1) adhere to the intervention program at a high rate (&#x0003e;75%)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-jmdh-2-013">13</xref>; (2) improve in knowledge of HF and related healthy behaviors; (3) reduce specific HF symptoms and sick days, and improve blood pressure (BP), (4) improve in perceived quality of life; and (5) reduce frequency of emergency room visits and length of hospital stays. Participants&#x02019; subjective evaluation of the program was also sought. It included satisfaction/dissatisfaction, reasons for the rating, benefit, improved or not improved HF, the most liked/disliked part of the method, and suggestions for the program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>The study employed a randomized controlled design with a one-year intervention. Three assessments (baseline, and follow-ups at six and 12 months) were conducted in participants&#x02019; homes. The control group received usual care. Usual care for home-based patients in the US is a three-month regular check up with their physicians. If they are hospitalized, they may have nurse visits, physical or occupational therapists&#x02019; home care, and phone calls from their insurance company to report their weight and blood pressure for three months. None of the partisans were receiving nurse visits due to hospitalization. The treatment group received the e-health intervention in addition to usual care, and process measures were collected daily.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Subjects</title><p>Individuals with HF were recruited from three hospitals and two health insurance companies in Western New York using a convenience sampling method.

Publicly accessible and secured websites were created by a multidisciplinary health care team of a health behaviorist, a geriatric physician, a geriatric nurse, an occupational therapist, a physical therapist, and an exercise physiologist. We used the web creation guidelines published by the National Institute on Aging and the National Library of Medicine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-jmdh-2-013">17</xref> Four types of support (informational, instrumental, appraisal, and emotional) at suitable stages of behavioral changes were provided in this e-health intervention.</p><p>Informational support included online information on: HF, drugs used to treat HF, effects of alcohol and smoking, depression, prescribed home exercise, nutrition, weight management, and exercise in general using the Flesch&#x02013;Kincaid Reading Grade level of eight on average. An exercise instruction program (walking, breathing, stretching, range of motion, upper and lower extremity strength training, and stationary biking) was developed and delivered via streaming video. This support was provided in the beginning of the intervention period.</p><p>Instrumental support included availability of a secure, simple, and short online recording system using Lotus Notes Web Server 6.5. This support was provided after participants became comfortable with the use of a computer and Internet. Participants were asked to access the website daily to record their vital signs and health behaviors. The site asks questions about blood pressure, pulse, weight, medication use, type and amount of exercise, levels of fatigue, intake of salt, sugar, alcohol, and tobacco, health changes, and HF-specific questions regarding swelling, fatigue, and dyspnea. Additionally, a webpage containing their past records with an automatic alerting function for sudden weight gain was available. Any overnight gain of 3 lbs or more resulted in a red dot display in the record that signaled participants to contact their physician.</p><p>Appraisal support was provided via email every month from appropriate health care professionals in dealing with subjects for the purpose of feedback for patients&#x02019; records. This support was provided to encourage participant&#x02019;s ongoing actions for changing their health behaviors toward a maintenance stage (beyond six months).</p><p>Emotional support was provided on an as needed basis via email.

Fifty-eight percent had 12 years of education or less, 36.7% had between 13 and 16 years, and 5.4% had 17 years or more. Mean MMSE score was 29 of 30. The mean number of comorbidity was 10 and medication taken was 8.

Furthermore, 84.6% said that they were very satisfied with the system, 15.4% were satisfied, and 92.3% thought that their HF was better than one year before. The most often cited reason for satisfaction was &#x0201c;Monitoring myself for increased awareness.&#x0201d; The second and third reasons were &#x0201c;Better health&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Support from health care providers.&#x0201d; Two participants reported that the most disliked part of the program was &#x0201c;Feel guilty when I have to record that I did not exercise, so I had to do exercise.&#x0201d; Two suggestions were &#x0201c;Expand the program to diabetes&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Create a way to find out how other study participants are doing, so that I know my relative status.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This randomized controlled study tested a e-health method of self-management of HF for one year in home-based older adults. Four types of support were delivered via Internet by a team of multidisciplinary health care professionals. Although this e-health method may not be effective for all HF patients, it was beneficial for HF patients with NYHA Class II or III with respect to increasing knowledge of HF and related health behaviors, exercise time, emotional function, and quality of life, and reducing levels of dyspnea, fatigue, blood pressure, and sick days. The result of exercise was parallel to the finding of the meta analysis by Wantland and colleagues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jmdh-2-013">7</xref> It was also effective in decreasing the number of emergency room visits and length of hospital stays. Limitation of the study was that it did not calculate cost effectiveness of the e-health method, which is necessary for its practical application. Also many between-group comparisons were not statistically significant mainly due to the small sample size. On the other hand, with this small sample size, most of within-group comparisons were significant, which is a strong indicator that the intervention was effective. With a larger sample size, it is expected that many between-group comparisons would be statistically significant. Vigorous studies with geographical and ethnical diversity are also needed in the future. Nevertheless, this study provided evidence that the effective e-health method in changing health behaviors and improving health outcomes takes an interdisciplinary approach since changing one&#x02019;s health behaviors covers various health care disciplines.</p><p>Major e-health strategies that lead to successful health behavior change identified in this study are that: (1) relevant information should be provided using easy-to-understand language in an easy-to-see format; (2) a simple recording system for vital signs and health behaviors should be available to allow patients to be aware of their behaviors; (3) patients should be aware that their health activities are monitored by a health professional; and (4) feedback should be provided for continued health behavior change. The strategy was supported by a conceptual framework, M-TOMITA, which applied a concept of human social support to the Internet use by strategically placing the types of support in the stages of health behavioral change. In this model, a multi disciplinary team is necessary at the initial stage but once the program is in place, a nurse may be able to run the program with input from the team for appraisal. In this study we convened a regular distance team meeting every month for appraisal support, but this frequency should be further investigated for its validity. For a comprehensive self-management program, it is strongly recommended to include a pharmacist to check interactions of multiple medication intake and a nutritionist for better diet.</p><p>In this study, emotional support was not independent of appraisal and instrumental support, but was not provided in a specific manner, such as forming a discussion/chat group. For patients who are not depressed or believe that they have control over their illness, the level of emotional support provided in this study may be sufficient. However, especially for patients who are depressed, the Internet-based method has been utilized and its effectiveness has been reported.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-jmdh-2-013">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jmdh-2-013">25</xref> Subjective evaluation of this program found that some participants wished to know their health behaviors in relation to other participants&#x02019;. Providing an average of aggregated data of all study participants can be easily done via the Internet. TTM describes a process of behavioral change called social liberalization as the person&#x02019;s realization of changes of social norms. E-health may be able to create a social norm among study participants and allow them to see how it is changing.</p><p>Finally, evidenced by a very high adherence to the program, 85% of 355 days (Internet was not available for 10 days), an e-health approach utilizing a multidisciplinary health care team can be accepted as a tool for self-management of HF and other chronic diseases in the near future when technology is more advanced, computer costs are reduced, and older adults become more computer literate.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>This study was funded by the National Institute on Aging, USA.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>Reference</title><ref id="b1-jmdh-2-013"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>American Heart Association</collab></person-group><article-title>Heart Failure.
