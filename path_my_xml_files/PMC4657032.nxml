animalis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic>, BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, on two primary end
points &#x02013; defecation frequency and gastrointestinal (GI) well-being &#x02013; in healthy adults
with low defecation frequency and abdominal discomfort. A total of 1248 subjects were
included in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. After a 2-week run-in
period, subjects were randomised to 1 or 10 billion colony-forming units/d of the
probiotic strain BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> or a matching placebo capsule once daily for 4 weeks.
Subjects completed a diary on bowel habits, relief of abdominal discomfort and symptoms.
GI well-being, defined as global relief of abdominal discomfort, did not show significant
differences. The OR for having a defecation frequency above baseline for &#x02265;50 % of the time
was 1&#x000b7;31 (95 % CI 0&#x000b7;98, 1&#x000b7;75), <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;071, for probiotic treatment overall.
Tightening the criteria for being a responder to an increase of &#x02265;1 d/week for &#x02265;50 % of the
time resulted in an OR of 1&#x000b7;55 (95 % CI 1&#x000b7;22, 1&#x000b7;96), <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;0003, for
treatment overall. A treatment effect on average defecation frequency was found
(<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;0065), with the frequency being significantly higher compared with
placebo at all weeks for probiotic treatment overall (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05).
Effects on defecation frequency were similar for the two doses tested, suggesting that a
ceiling effect was reached with the one billion dose. Overall, 4 weeks&#x02019; supplementation
with the probiotic strain BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> resulted in a clinically relevant benefit on
defecation frequency. The results suggest that consumption of BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> improves
the GI health of individuals whose symptoms are not sufficiently severe to consult a
doctor (ISRCTN18128385).</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd><italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp. <italic>lactis</italic></kwd><kwd>Probiotics</kwd><kwd>Defecation frequency</kwd><kwd>Bowel habits</kwd><kwd>Gastrointestinal well-being</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">AE</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">adverse events</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">GI</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">gastrointestinal</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">IBS</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">irritable bowel syndrome</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">ITT</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">intention-to-treat</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">PP</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">per-protocol</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><p>In recent years, the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota has been suggested to be implicated in

difficult because no biomarkers exist and they rely solely on patient report of symptoms. It
is currently not clear which outcomes are most valid to use, and as the available tools are
not ideal new tools are under development<sup>(</sup>

difficulty of measuring improvements of already low symptom scores or a suboptimal defecation
frequency within the normal range. No guidelines exist for clinical trials in healthy
populations with GI complaints; however, due to the similarities with IBS, it is relevant to
apply guidelines for IBS trials when designing studies in healthy individuals<sup>(</sup>

the probiotic strain BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in different dosages on defecation frequency and global
relief in healthy subjects with low defecation frequency and abdominal discomfort. The
secondary objective was to investigate the effect on abdominal pain and bloating. As little is

calculated using Proc SEQDESIGN in SAS. The interim analyses were performed within a
closed testing hierarchy, where the doses were ranked, testing the high dose first and
the low dose second, and using statistical models identical to the final efficacy
analysis. Both primary end points should be statistically significant to conclude early
efficacy or futility as opposed to the final efficacy analysis where success was

<sup>)</sup>. Initially, we defined a responder as a subject with an increase over baseline
in defecation frequency; however, tightening the criteria for being a responder to an
increase from baseline of at least 1 d/week reduced the placebo effect considerably. This
could indicate that the initial responder definition, although considered relevant, may have
been too easy to reach, resulting in the high placebo effect observed in all the analyses
using this definition, and confirms the relevance of performing the <italic>post
hoc</italic> analysis using the tightened responder definition.</p><p>Although the ITT analysis is essential because it is conservative, reflects clinical
practice and increases generalisability, it introduces heterogeneity because non-compliant
and compliant subjects are analysed together. The PP analysis is a useful supportive
analysis to estimate the non-diluted treatment effect, and especially in nutritional studies
where the expected effect sizes may be smaller than that for a medicinal product this is
important. When the ITT and PP analyses come to essentially the same conclusions, as in the
present study, confidence in the study results are generally high<sup>(</sup>

to a probiotic and require specific treatment with laxatives<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. However, although subjects with a defecation frequency of &#x0003c;3 d/week at
first sight seemed not to benefit from the probiotic treatment in the present study, results
from the <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis showed that when the criteria for being a
responder was tightened the responder rates were more similar across subgroups and were of
the same magnitude as for the whole population. An explanation may be that the placebo
effect in the subgroup with the lowest baseline defecation frequency was initially almost 90
% and was reduced considerably after tightening the criteria, which may have disguised the
benefit of the probiotic treatment. Therefore, our data show that even subjects with a very
low defecation frequency gained benefit from a daily dose of the probiotic strain
BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>Taken together, the results from the ITT and PP analyses, the <italic>post hoc</italic>
results and the analysis of average defecation frequency demonstrate a consistent and
clinically relevant effect of the probiotic strain BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>No difference was observed between the two doses tested. However, it may not be appropriate
to expect probiotics to exhibit the sort of dose&#x02013;response effects seen with pharmacological
agents designed to affect a single target site. Probiotics are living organisms that produce
many different metabolites and interact with many different receptors, molecules and cell
types, and therefore may display an atypical dose&#x02013;response relationship, which can also be
seen with other well-known compounds such as corticosteroids, morphine and vitamins.
Although the role of probiotics in health and disease is a fast-moving research area, the
underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood and need further investigation.
Furthermore, only few studies testing probiotics for different GI indications have
investigated dose&#x02013;response relationships with mixed results<sup>(</sup>

effect with higher dose<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>, whereas a study of discomfort symptoms in IBS patients indicated a missing
dose&#x02013;response relationship of probiotics, as an effect was observed at a medium dose level
and no effects were observed for a lower or a higher dose<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>38</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The results from the present large study suggest that a ceiling effect exists
for defecation frequency and has been reached with the one billion dose of the probiotic
strain BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p><p>The interim analyses resulted in a recommendation to stop first the one billion arm and
next the ten billion arm. These analyses were based on the initial responder definition that
did not show the expected difference in responder rates. Furthermore, as the responder rates
in the two dosage arms proved to be similar, closing the one and ten billion arms at
different interim analyses merely indicates that the test statistics have been close to the
boundary values and not that the doses perform differently.</p><p>In spite of the interim results, we consider the results of this study important. Our study
was powered to detect a 10 % difference in responder rates, which was the exact difference
found when tightening the criteria for being a responder. Furthermore, when studying chronic
conditions, regression towards the mean is generally a challenge<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>30</sup>

<sup>)</sup> and might have led to an underestimation of the true effect of the probiotic
strain. Although the overall, global prevalence of IBS and functional constipation is 10&#x02013;15
%, many more people have undiagnosed functional GI disorders as they do not seek medical
care and a large number of healthy people have similar mild abdominal symptoms<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. Therefore, supplementation of the probiotic strain BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> may
provide an easy, accessible and safe remedy that can benefit a large population for whom no
effective alternatives exist<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Other probiotic studies in healthy subjects with minor digestive symptoms have mainly
focused on GI well-being and symptoms with mixed results<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup>. In the present study, we did not see an effect on GI well-being, which may be
partly explained by the use of global assessment of subjects&#x02019; relief of abdominal
discomfort. In the past few years, it has been debated whether this outcome is the best way
to evaluate treatment effect<sup>(</sup>

rating as the primary end point in treatment trials for IBS<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>31</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>32</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. This may also be evident for a study population with minor GI symptoms.</p><p>At present, neither the aetiology nor the pathophysiology of functional GI disorders is
clear, and many factors such as genetic, immune, inflammatory, neurological and
psychological may play an important role, although none of these are yet completely
understood<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>48</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>49</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. As many pathogenic factors contribute in different combinations, it is
unlikely that one drug, acting on one pathophysiological mechanism, will be able to treat
all the symptoms of IBS. Rather, different products or products acting on multiple
pathophysiological mechanisms may be needed for targeting the different pathophysiological
mechanisms behind various symptoms<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>45</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>48</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. This may also explain the results of the present trial, where the probiotic
product had an effect on defecation frequency, whereas no effect was observed on GI
well-being. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective way to identify different
pathophysiological subgroups in order to select a subpopulation with a higher likelihood of
response to a specific intervention. Conducting clinical studies in IBS patients or
populations with minor GI symptoms as in the present study is not only challenged by an
underlying heterogeneity but also by fluctuations in symptom presentation, which tends to
regress towards the mean during the course of a clinical study. In addition, efficacy
measures still rely on patient-rated outcomes<sup>(</sup>

further investigation in parallel with the elucidation of the underlying pathophysiology of
functional GI disorders.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study strongly support a clinically relevant benefit of
the probiotic strain <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> subsp.
<italic>lactis</italic>, BB-12<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, on defecation frequency in healthy subjects with
low defecation frequency and abdominal discomfort. The efficacy of the two doses was
similar, indicating that there is a ceiling effect &#x02013; the reason for this being unknown at
this point in time. More research is needed to elucidate this further and to understand how
to best assess GI well-being in future studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack1"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all the subjects who volunteered to participate in the study and the
