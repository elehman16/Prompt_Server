This goal might be achieved by combining gemcitabine with other active drugs. This trial evaluated the efficacy and tolerance of such a combination regimen with epirubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in patients with metastatic disease. Seventy patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this multicentre trial. Patients received 4-weekly courses of a combination regimen consisting of epirubicin 60 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> given as intravenous bolus injection on day 1, gemcitabine 1000 mg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup> infused over 30 min on days 1, 8 and 15, and G-CSF administered at 5 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> day<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> subcutaneously from days 2&#x02013;6 during each cycle. The efficacy of treatment was assessed by conventional measures, i.e. objective response, progression-free and overall survival, as well as by analysis of clinical benefit response (defined as &#x02265; 50&#x00025; reduction in pain intensity, &#x02265; 50&#x00025; reduction in daily analgesic consumption, and/or &#x02265; 20-point improvement in Karnofsky performance status that was sustained for &#x02265; 4 consecutive weeks). Of 66 patients evaluable for objective response, one achieved complete and 13 partial remissions, for an overall response rate of 21&#x00025; (95&#x00025; confidence interval (CI), 12&#x02013;33&#x00025;); 27 additional patients (41&#x00025;) had stable and 25 (38&#x00025;) increasing disease. The median time to progression was 3.8 months. Median survival was 7.8 months, and the probability of surviving beyond 12 months was 21.2&#x00025;. Out of 60 patients with tumour-related symptoms, who were considered evaluable for clinical benefit response, 26 (43&#x00025;) experienced significant palliation. The median time to achieve a clinical benefit response was 7 weeks, and its median duration was 22 weeks. Chemotherapy was well-tolerated with leukopenia/granulocytopenia representing the most common and dose-limiting side-effect. Gastrointestinal and other subjective toxicities were infrequent and generally rated minor. We conclude that the combination of gemcitabine, epirubicin and G-CSF seems to be an effective palliative treatment with only moderate toxic effects in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Our results in terms of objective and clinical benefit response, as well as survival seem to suggest an advantage over gemcitabine-monotherapy, though this remains to be confirmed in a randomized trial. &#x000a9; 1999 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>gemcitabine</kwd><kwd>epirubicin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
