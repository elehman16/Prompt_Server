Treatment toxicity and time spent in hospital were secondary end points. One hundred and five patients (of whom 100 were eligible) were randomized to receive either DTIC/IFN or DBCT. The trial was designed to detect a 25&#x00025; absolute difference in response rate or in 1-year survival with 80&#x00025; power. There was no significant difference in response rate: this was 17.3&#x00025; with DTIC/IFN and 26.4&#x00025; with DBCT. Median overall survival was similar at 199 and 202 days respectively. One-year survival rate favoured standard treatment (30.6 vs 22.6&#x00025;), but did not differ significantly between arms. DBCT was associated with significantly greater haematological toxicity, and a greater need for time spent in hospital (5.75 days/treatment cycle vs 2.29 with dacarbazine and interferon). DBCT combination therapy cannot be recommended as standard treatment for advanced melanoma. Dacarbazine remains the standard chemotherapy for this condition. &#x000a9; 2000 Cancer Research Campaign</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>melanoma</kwd><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
