Eight to ten percent of all blood transfusions in the UK are due to TKA and THA surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and patients receiving blood from a matched donor carry a risk of blood transfusion-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, preoperative anaemia in elective TKA and THA is independently associated with transfusion and increased postoperative morbidity, supporting the need for preoperative evaluation and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The National Blood Authority in Australia has released a number of patient blood management initiatives recommending the establishment of a multidisciplinary, multimodal perioperative blood management programme to optimise preoperative red cell mass, minimise perioperative blood loss and tolerate postoperative anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Other blood management programmes are associated with improved patient outcomes and reduced length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In particular, it recommended that patients with preoperative anaemia are identified, and if iron deficient, preoperative iron therapy is advocated. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Preoperative iron supplementation is suggested for orthopaedic procedures where there is a risk of severe postoperative anaemia to reduce the need for transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Approximately 20&#x000a0;% of patients who present for joint reconstructive surgery have coexisting anaemia, with 20&#x000a0;% of anaemic patients having anaemia responsive to iron therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Intraoperative use of the anti-fibrinolytic tranexamic acid has also been shown to effectively reduce transfusion rates in TKR and THR without increasing the rate of other complications, including thromboembolic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the introduction of preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) optimisation programme together with intraoperative tranexamic acid to improve Hb levels postoperatively and reduce the rate of blood transfusion in patients undergoing primary elective THA and TKA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>Data from consecutive adult patients undergoing surgery for primary elective TKA and THA in a university teaching hospital were collected before (Usual Care group) and after (Intervention group) the introduction of a Hb optimisation programme that included the preoperative optimisation and treatment of anaemia (men &#x0003c;130&#x000a0;g/L and women &#x0003c;120&#x000a0;g/L) by a dedicated haematology clinic and the intraoperative use of tranexamic acid (15&#x000a0;mg/kg intravenously) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In the absence of ischaemic heart disease, a transfusion trigger for blood transfusion was a Hb less than or equal to 80&#x000a0;g/L. Adjuncts to minimise intraoperative blood loss included the use of tourniquets in all total knee replacements. Haemostasis was achieved using diathermy without the use of adjunct fibrin sealants. Continuous passive motion and flexed knee approach in the first hour in TKA patients was not used. Standard postoperative care for all patients included a physical therapy-based early mobilisation programme, commencing on the day of surgery; multimodal analgesia led by a 24-h acute pain service; and enoxaparin 40&#x000a0;mg subcutaneous daily for venous thrombosis prophylaxis.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included patients with congenital or acquired coagulopathy, congenital or acquired thrombophilia, history of thromboembolism, allergy to tranexamic acid and revision surgery. Patients were identified using the Department of Orthopaedic audit database and the hospital&#x02019;s health information system. The primary aims were to determine if patients in the blood management optimisation programme had higher Hb levels immediately postoperatively and on hospital discharge and if the rate of blood transfusion was lower compared to the Usual Care group. Secondary aims included measurements of total amount of allogenic blood transfused, transfusion-related complications, postoperative complications, need for inpatient rehabilitation and duration of hospitals stay.</p><p>Other data collected included patient characteristics including comorbidities, ASA status, preoperative incidence of anaemia, preoperative renal function, preoperative medications that impact on coagulation, surgical approach, duration of surgery, type of anaesthetic and amount of intravenous fluid administered. Postoperative complications were identified from patients&#x02019; admission histories, defined on the diagnoses written by the treating doctors in patients&#x02019; progress notes, with cross-checking with laboratory and radiological data. The data was collected by a principal investigator (PK) and with the assistance of a research nurse.</p><p>At our institution, the proportion of patients prior to the study that required a blood transfusion in the general orthopaedic setting was 25&#x000a0;%. A sample size calculation of 194 subjects was based upon an 80&#x000a0;% chance of detecting, as significant at the 5&#x000a0;% level, a decrease in the primary outcome measure from 25&#x000a0;% transfusion rate in the Usual Care group to 10&#x000a0;% in the Intervention group. To allow for dropout and missing data, we collected information from 200 patients. Results were statistically analysed using GraphPad (Prism 6<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Version 6.0b) with independent parametric data analysed with unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests, non-parametric nominal data using chi-square test and Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test for independent ordinal data. Backward multivariate regression modelling was undertaken using SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Macintosh, Version 22.0) to examine for independent factors associated with higher Hb levels in the postoperative period and on hospital discharge. A <italic>p</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.

We found that the introduction of the blood optimisation programme reduced the incidence of preoperative anaemia. In addition, patients undergoing elective THA and TKA who underwent a perioperative blood management programme had a lower incidence of allogenic blood transfusion. Patients who were anaemic preoperatively benefited most from the programme. This has significant pharmacoeconomic and resource considerations for institutions implementing similar blood management strategies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Relationship to previous studies</title><p>Previous studies have aimed to define an optimal strategy for blood conservation in the setting of major orthopaedic joint surgery. Kotze et al. performed a retrospective study of 717 TKA and THA in the UK, analysing the effect of instituting a blood management programme that included the use of preoperative iron transfusions with erythropoietin and intraoperative tranexamic acid with cell salvage devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The programme significantly reduced the rate of allogenic blood transfusion and length of stay. In our study, we observed that there was no difference to length of hospital stay between patients in the blood management programme and the Usual Care groups. Similar findings were reported by Wong et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], who evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive blood conservation algorithm using a cluster randomisation trial design involving 29 hospitals. Their programme consisted of specific blood conservation strategies including recombinant human erythropoietin or autologous blood donation and transfusion guidelines. Similar to our study, they demonstrated that the comprehensive blood conservation was superior to usual care for reducing allogenic transfusion, despite no differences to length of hospital stay.</p><p>Our programme utilised treatment of preoperative anaemia including use of iron supplementation and intraoperative tranexamic acid. Previous studies in orthopaedic procedures have demonstrated that preoperative iron supplementation can reduce the need for transfusion, particularly in the context of expected postoperative anaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Approximately 20&#x000a0;% of patients who are anaemic at presentation for joint reconstructive surgery will have an anaemia that is responsive to iron therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. On regression modelling, we observed that patients who appeared to benefit most from the programme were the patients who were anaemic preoperatively and who underwent the blood management programme. In the patients with preoperative anaemia who are also iron deficient, iron loss due to surgical bleeding can exaggerate a preexisting iron deficiency and may worsen postoperative anaemia. Our findings of a drop in Hb by 30&#x000a0;g/L or more on postoperative day 1 and age greater than 65&#x000a0;years were negative, associated with Hb&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;100&#x000a0;g/L on discharge; are also physiologically plausible, i.e. the greater the intraoperative blood loss, the lower the discharge Hb; and impaired erythropoiesis in older patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Data from meta-analyses have previously supported tranexamic acid in blood conservation in THA and TKA without predisposing to thromboembolic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In our study, similar to these studies, we observed no complications relating to use of tranexamic acid. Interestingly, we found that the use of tranexamic acid was not an independent factor associated with improvements of Hb postoperatively. However, our study aims were to evaluate the effectiveness of the introduction of preoperative Hb optimisation programme together with intraoperative tranexamic acid to improve Hb levels postoperatively and reduce the rate of blood transfusion. Inferences should therefore not be made about the independent effectiveness of tranexamic acid alone, as the study was not designed nor powered for this purpose. The dosing strategy used in our study (15&#x000a0;mg/kg) is considered a &#x02018;low&#x02019; dose regime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and further research is still required to determine the optimal dosing of tranexamic acid in the setting of major arthroplasty surgery.</p><p>In addition to our study, we noted a significant reduction in the operative time in the Intervention group. Reductions in operative times related to intraoperative tranexamic acid use was not reported in three large meta-analyses examining the use of tranexamic acid in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It is plausible that the use of tranexamic acid reduced time to achieve haemostasis, hence reducing the duration of surgery. However, we consider an effect size of 12&#x000a0;min for total duration of surgery to be of little clinical significance. Future studies will need to validate this finding with more robust study design for this particular endpoint with consideration of its clinical and economic importance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study implications</title><p>The clinical implications of our findings suggest that a blood optimisation programme can safely and significantly reduce the rate of allogenic blood transfusion in accordance with recommendations by National Blood Authority Patient Blood Management Guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In addition, our findings provide support for the practice change of deferral of surgery for investigation and treatment of anaemia, with the combined used of tranexamic acid for blood conservation. Importantly, as evident by our findings, the use of tranexamic acid or iron optimisation alone were not associated with lower blood transfusion requirements or higher Hb levels postoperatively, reinforcing the importance of multimodal blood management strategies rather than single interventions. Future studies could explore whether these measures provide any pharmacoeconomic benefits to such an intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>There are several limitations to this quality assurance retrospective before and after study. Firstly, the study design does not establish a causal relationship of the Hb optimisation programme and the reduction in blood transfusion or higher postoperative Hb levels observed between the two groups. These associations may be subject to bias from selection, confounding or random error, although we attempted to control for confounders by using regression analysis. Specific biases regarding surgical decisions during the operation or the need for blood transfusion cannot be excluded. However, the surgical technique, surgeon and Hb transfusion triggers, amongst the other variables outlined above, appeared to be similar in both groups. Our findings only apply to this type of surgery; therefore, they should not be generalised to other orthopaedic or surgical procedures. Furthermore, the external validity or generalisability of our results to other hospitals is limited, since we collected data only from a single institution. Although we report a low incidence of deep vein thrombosis, which was not different between the groups, we did not use ultrasound to identify this complication, as in our institution this non-invasive imaging tool has been shown to have a low sensitivity for detecting deep vein thrombosis. Importantly, our institution does not routinely record blood loss in the drains and was unable to accurately quantify total blood loss. The dose of tranexamic acid used in our programme may be different to other centres, and this may warrant further evaluation. We did not perform any pharmacoeconomic evaluation of the blood optimisation programme; however, this should not detract from the study aims or objectives. Finally, the intervention programme included a combination of both preoperative haemoglobin optimisation and tranexamic acid; the utility of the study is therefore limited in drawing conclusions on each separate component of the programme as eluded above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The introduction of a preoperative blood optimisation programme utilising iron supplementation combined with intraoperative tranexamic acid has effectively reduced the use of allogenic blood transfusion in elective total hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries at our institution. Patients who were anaemic preoperatively benefited most from the programme. Our findings support the use of a multidisciplinary blood optimisation programme in this setting. These results can be used to build hypotheses for further controlled trials.</p><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>This study received prospective Austin Health Research Ethics Committee approval (HREC no H2013/04904).</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PK: principal author, literature review, study design, data collection, data analysis, manuscript writing.
