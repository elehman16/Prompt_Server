The current research aimed to compare folinic acid, fluorouracil with irinotecan (mFOLFIRI) or with oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX7) as first-line treatments in patients with locally advanced GC in an open, randomized, phase II study. Previously untreated metastatic or recurrent GC patients with measurable disease received mFOLFIRI (arm A) or mFOLFOX7 (arm B) every 2 weeks. The defined second-line treatment was mFOLFOX7 for arm A and mFOLFIRI for arm B. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS), disease control rate (DCR) and toxicity. The evaluable population consisted of 128 patients (54 in arm A; 74 in arm B). Median PFS of arm A was 2.9 months (m) (95% confidence interval, <italic>CI</italic>, 1.9 to 4.1 m) versus 4.1 m (95% <italic>CI</italic>, 3.2 to 4.8 m) for arm B (<italic>p</italic> = 0.109). Median OS was 9.9 months (95% <italic>CI</italic>, 6.0 to 13.5 m) for arm A versus 12.0 m for arm B (95% <italic>CI</italic>, 10.3 to 13.7m; <italic>p</italic> = 0.431). DCRs for arm A and arm B were 59.3% and 66.3%, respectively (<italic>p</italic> = 0.850). In subgroup analysis of the patients who completed both treatment lines per protocol, the median first-line PFS was 2.1 m for the mFOLFIRI/mFOLFOX7arm versus 8.0 m for the mFOLFOX7/mFOLFIRI arm (<italic>p</italic> = 0.053), and the median second-line PFS values were 1.2 m versus 5.1 m (<italic>p</italic> = 0.287). Total PFS and OS were 8.1m and 11.0 m for the mFOLFIRI/mFOLFOX7 group compared with 12.2m and 20.2 m for the mFOLFOX7/mFOLFIRI group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008, <italic>p</italic> = 0.030). Both regimens were well-tolerated with acceptable and manageable toxicities. Hence, there was no significant difference in the PFS or DCR. However, mFOLFOX7 followed by mFOLFIRI might have a better OS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>gastric cancer</kwd><kwd>mFOLFIRI</kwd><kwd>mFOLFOX7</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Although the incidence and mortality rates have declined worldwide, as the most common cancer, gastric cancer (GC) still ranks fourth in incidence and second in annual cancer-related deaths [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Approximately 70% of new cases and deaths occur in developing countries, and the number of Chinese GC patients(pts) accounts for 35&#x02013;42% of cases worldwide [<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Generally, most pts have lost the surgery opportunity when first diagnosed. Even after surgery, the recurrence rate is relatively high. Additionally, the prognosis of advanced GC is poor, with a median survival of 3.0 to 5.0 months (m) if managed by best supportive care [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>For pts with advanced GC, palliative chemotherapy plays an important role in prolonging overall survival(OS) and improving the quality of life(QOL); however, until now, no standard chemotherapy has been widely accepted [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In recent years, chemotherapy regimens have been commonly used with a median survival of less than 10.0 months [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A well-recognized standard regimen for advanced or metastatic GC has not been established until now.</p><p>5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), as a primary chemotherapy drug against GC, is combined with leucovorin, resulting in a synergistic anti-tumor effect, which has been confirmed by many <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Currently, CF (cisplatin and 5-FU), widely used in North America, and ECF (epirubicin, cisplatin and 5-FU), commonly used in Europe, have become the basic treatments worldwide, and both regimens are regularly applied in China. Additionally, the prognosis of GC has improved with the new emergence of the third generation of anticancer drugs&#x02014;for example, oxaliplatin and irinotecan.</p><p>In one of the largest clinical trials, REAL2, the new regimen efficacy of EOF (epirubicin, oxaliplatin and 5-FU) was not inferior to the original ECF in which cisplatin was replaced by oxaliplatin. Similarly, the effect of ECX (epirubicin, oxaliplatin and capecitabine), including capecitabine instead of 5-FU, was not inferior to the original ECF. Notably, the OS was significantly prolonged (median survival increasing from 9.9 m to 11.2 m) if cisplatin and 5-FU were substituted by oxaliplatin and capecitabine simultaneously in the so-called EOX regimen [<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Additionally, another phase III clinical study, comparing the efficacy of FLO(5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) and FLP(5-FU, leucovorin, and cisplatin), demonstrated the median PFS of FLO group enjoyed a longer trend but did not statistically meet significance for improvement (5.8 v 3.9 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.077); however, in patients older than 65 years old, FLO was associated with a statistically prolonged PFS (6.0 v 3.1 months, <italic>P</italic> = 0.029) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, oxaliplatin contained regimen have been the most widely option used in the first-line therapy of GC, including FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). FOLFOX is close but not exactly equivalent to FLO regimen, which does not contain bolus FU.</p><p>Irinotecan is a semi-synthetic anti-cancer drug derived from camptothecin. In 2006, a large-scale phase III clinical study named V306 suggested that irinotecan combined with 5-FU (IF) had a better tolerability and reactivity (32% vs 26%) than CF in North America, and the median survivals of IF and CF were 9.0 m and 8.7 m, respectively [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In addition, another phase II clinical study (136 pts) compared the efficacy among LF (fluorouracil and leucovorin), CLF (cisplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin) and FOLFIRI (irinotecan, fluorouracil pyrimidine and leucovorin) in pts with advanced GC, and the total response rates (RRs) were 13%, 27% and 40%, respectively; the time to progression (TTP) values were 3.2 m, 4.9 m and 6.0 m, respectively; the OS were 6.8 m, 9.5 m and 11.0 m, respectively [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Based on available data, FOLFIRI is a promising option for pts with advanced GC [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>This open, randomized, phase II, two-center study was designed to determine whether there is an optimal chemotherapy regimen for advances GC between the FOLFIRI and FOLFOX from the perspective of efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2_1"><title>Baseline patient characteristics</title><p>Because the pt enrollment was slow, recruitment was stopped in September 2012. From April 2008 to September 2012, 145 pts (71 in arm A; 74 in arm B) were included at West China Hospital, Sichuan University, and Sichuan Cancer Hospital. Seventeen pts were considered late dropouts mainly due to refusal of treatment.

made in new therapeutic treatments and development of early diagnosis, and the 5-year survival rate remains less than 20% [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As a result, it is urgent to choose a better treatment combination as well as the best sequence among the available therapeutic strategies and to optimize the OS of advanced GC pts and/or the quality of life.</p><p>What are the future directions in the palliative chemotherapy treatment of advanced gastric cancer? Notably, CF was the basic treatment of gastric cancer. Because of the cisplatin-related adverse events and efficacy of capecitabine, the substitution of FOLFOX has been one of the most widely used regimens in the first-line therapy of GC with a considerable advantage [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, based on the V306 results, FOLFIRI also shows great advantage in the treatment of gastric cancer [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similarly, a recent study published in <italic>Journal of Clinical Oncology</italic> was designed to compare the efficacy of ECX and FOLFIRI in the first-line treatment of GC, and the regimens of second-line were predefined (FOLFIRI for the ECX group and ECX for the FOLFIRI group) [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Additionally, the outcome indicated that FOLFIRI was an acceptable regimen in the first-line treatment of GC. Finally, what about advanced GC treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in the first-line setting?</p><p>In April 2008, we initiated the first randomized study of FOLFIRI versus FOLFOX7 in Chinese pts with advanced GC. Based on the available data, the median PFS of arm A (mFOLFIRI) was 2.9 m (95% CI, 1.9 to 4.1 m) versus 4.1 m (95% CI, 3.2 to 4.8 m) for arm B (mFOLFOX7). Although the differences were not significant, the pts treated with mFOLFOX7 first obtained a PFS benefit trend from the whole treatment. Additionally, the median OS was 9.9 m (95% CI, 6.0 to 13.5 m) for arm A versus 12.0 m for arm B (95% CI, 10.3 to 13.7 m). Notably, pts treated with mFOLFOX7 followed by mFOLFIRI per protocol benefited from a longer OS than those who received mFOLFIRI/ mFOLFOX7. The DCR values were 59.3% and 66.3% for arm A and arm B, respectively, the result of which was not significant (<italic>p</italic> = 0.850).</p><p>Thereafter, in 2010, the preliminary results of a similar study in Korea suggested that the median survival was 11.3 m in 40 pts treated with mFOLFOX4 followed by mFOLFIRI compared with 9.7 m in 37 pts treated with mFOLFIRI followed by mFOLFOX4 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.143); the median second-line time to progression(TTP) was 6.4 m versus 5.7 m (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015). mFOLFOX4 demonstrated a 37.5% RR and a 2.9 m median TTP compared with mFOLFIRI, which demonstrated a RR of 27% and a TTP of 2.9 min the first-line therapy (<italic>P</italic> = 0.154). In the second-line setting, mFOLFOX4 showed a RR of 10.8% and a TTP of 1.7 m, while mFOLFIRI achieved an RR of 15.4% and a TTP of 2.2 months (<italic>p</italic> = 0.036). The conclusion was reached that both sequences had a similar efficacy in OS; however, mFOLFOX4 followed by mFOLFIRI was slightly better in TTP, a result that was consistent with the subgroup analysis of our study [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Using the PP analysis of pts who completed treatment with mFOLFIRI followed by mFOLFOX7 or the reverse sequence in our study, the median PFS for the first-line treatment was 2.1 m for the mFOLFIRI/mFOLFOX7 arm versus 8.0 m for the mFOLFOX7/mFOLFIRI arm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.053). Additionally, the median PFS values for the second-line treatment were 1.2 m for arm A versus 5.1 m for arm B (<italic>P</italic> = 0.287). Total PFS was 8.1m for the mFOLFIRI/mFOLFOX7 group compared with 12.2m for the mFOLFOX7/mFOLFIRI group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.008). Besides, the difference in the median OS between the two groups was statistically significant; the OS for the mFOLFOX7/mFOLFIRI arm was 20.2 m, while that of the mFOLFIRI/mFOLFOX7 arm was 11.0 m (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). Therefore, as a sequential treatment strategy, the higher absolute advantage of mFOLFOX7/mFOLFIRI was significant compared with pts who received other sequences or those without second-line chemotherapy. Until recently, a systematic review showed that second-line therapy largely decreased the death risk by 18%, and chemotherapy could reach a reduction of approximately 27%, particularly with the addition of remucirumab [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Hence, we believe our conclusions about the roles of mFOLFOX7/mFOLFIRI in the palliative treatment of advanced GC pts make sense.</p><p>However, based on the Cox regression analysis, we believe that, regarding the absolute benefit of palliative chemotherapy, a high degree of differentiation, the number of cycles of chemotherapy, and no dose reduction of chemotherapy drugs play important roles in the whole treatment. Additionally, if regimens are well-tolerated with acceptable and manageable toxicities, sufficient drug dose intensity and treatment cycles should be given to the pts.</p><p>However, there were still some limitations in this study. Above all, the final analyzed sample size of this prospective trial was relatively small due to the limited eligible pts. Because the current research was not foundation supported but was launched by investigators, early dropout and lost follow-up of the pts were apparent. Limited sample size, which was much less than the population in the protocol, resulted in a shortage of statistical power. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of pts did not obtain second-line therapy because of lack of money, family disagreement or self-unwilling. Although limited data were available to evaluate the characteristics of these pts, it was a true reflection of the cancer treatment situation in clinical practice. As a result, the choice of first-line therapy is particularly important for the whole treatment. Third, information regarding the QOL was not evaluated, a finding that could be calculated from the treatment adverse events. To accurately evaluate the chemotherapy influence on QOL, large phase III studies are needed.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective trial with full data concerning the choice of an optimal chemotherapy regimen in the first-line treatment of advanced GC with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. With the advantages and disadvantages listed above, our results indicate that both regimens achieve similar efficacy; however, mFOLFOX7 followed by mFOLFIRI seems to have better clinical outcomes. Hence, further phase III studies are warranted to confirm this difference and to develop the standard care for advanced gastric cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4_1"><title>Patient eligibility and exclusion criteria</title><p>Previously untreated pts aged between 18 and 75 years with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0&#x02013;2 and life expectancy &#x0003e; 4 months were eligible if they had histologically proven gastric or gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma with at least one site of unidimensionally measurable disease(RECIST), adequate bone marrow function (hemoglobin, &#x02265; 90 g/L; absolute neutrophil count, &#x02265; 2.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L; platelet count, &#x02265; 100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> cells/L), hepatic function (alkaline phosphatase, &#x02264; 3 upper limits of normal (UNL); total bilirubin, &#x02264; 1.5 UNL; AST and ALT, &#x02264; 3UNL) and renal function (creatinine, &#x02264; 135 mmol/L).
