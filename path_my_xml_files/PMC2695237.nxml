It has a significant impact on affected men and their partners in terms of self-esteem, dissatisfaction with their sexual relationships, personal distress, and interpersonal difficulty. Psychological therapies may achieve short-term improvements, but there are limited data on the long-term success of these methods. Oral therapy with long-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) improves intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT), but these agents are designed to be administered daily and may be associated with unwanted sexual side effects and withdrawal symptoms upon abrupt discontinuation. Dapoxetine is a short-acting SSRI that can be taken as needed (prn) by men with PE. It has been studied in five separate multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials involving more than 6000 men with PE. In four studies that evaluated IELT as an endpoint (N = 4843), dapoxetine 30 and 60 mg prn achieved statistically significant increases in IELT versus placebo. Dapoxetine also showed statistically significant improvements in perceived control over ejaculation, PE-related personal distress, and other patient-reported outcomes in all five trials. Dapoxetine treatment is generally well-tolerated, with low incidences of discontinuation syndrome, sexual dysfunction, and treatment-emergent mood symptoms. The most common adverse events with dapoxetine included nausea, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, and somnolence.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dapoxetine</kwd><kwd>discontinuation syndrome</kwd><kwd>premature ejaculation</kwd><kwd>selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Premature ejaculation (PE) is the most common form of male sexual dysfunction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-5-037">1</xref> Globally, between 20% and 40% of men, at some point in their lives, have reported symptoms of PE or a complaint of PE,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ndt-5-037">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ndt-5-037">3</xref> which may be classified as lifelong or acquired.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ndt-5-037">4</xref> Lifelong PE is characterized by early ejaculation in the majority of intercourse attempts with nearly every partner from the first sexual encounter onwards, whereas acquired PE develops at some point in a man&#x02019;s life after he has previously experienced normal ejaculation and may be linked to urological or psychological problems.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ndt-5-037">4</xref> Some have also suggested that 2 additional forms of PE be considered, including natural-variable PE and premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction. Natural-variable PE is characterized by early ejaculations that occur sporadically and should be regarded as a normal variation in sexual performance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ndt-5-037">4</xref> Premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction is characterized by a false perception of PE even though these men have normal to very long ejaculation times.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ndt-5-037">4</xref></p><p>In clinical practice and for the purposes of clinical trials, the most commonly used definition of PE has been the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</italic>, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR), definition, which describes PE as &#x0201c;persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it&#x0201d; that &#x0201c;causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;is not due exclusively to the direct effects of a substance.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-5-037">5</xref> More recently, the International Society for Sexual Medicine (ISSM) has more precisely defined lifelong PE as &#x0201c;a male sexual dysfunction characterized by ejaculation which always or nearly always occurs prior to or within about 1 minute of vaginal penetration; the inability to delay ejaculation on all or nearly all vaginal penetrations; and negative personal consequences, such as distress, bother, frustration and/or the avoidance of sexual intimacy.&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-5-037">6</xref></p><p>The negative impact of PE on both the man and his female partner can be significant.

Of the men who had sought treatment for their PE, 92% reported little or no improvement in their condition. Further, physicians rarely inquire about sexual health. In a separate international survey of 27,500 men and women aged 40 to 80 years, only 9% of respondents said they had been asked about their sexual health at routine visits within the previous 3 years, but more than 40% felt this should have occurred.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-ndt-5-037">15</xref> These findings emphasize the need for an effective, well-tolerated, and acceptable treatment for PE.</p></sec><sec><title>The physiology of ejaculation and the role of serotonin</title><p>Ejaculation is a biphasic process consisting of emission, which involves the secretion of seminal fluid from the prostate and seminal vesicle, contraction of the smooth muscles of the seminal tract, and deposition of the sperm into the posterior urethra; and expulsion, which occurs when the semen is forced through the urethral meatus.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ndt-5-037">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ndt-5-037">18</xref> Control mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of ejaculation descend from the supraspinal level and involve a number of regulatory neurotransmitters, the most widely studied of which is 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), or serotonin. At least 3 serotonin receptor subtypes have been identified as having a role in ejaculation, including 5-HT<sub>1a</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1b</sub>, and 5HT<sub>2c</sub>. Although activation of the 5-HT<sub>1a</sub> receptor exhibits proejaculatory effects, activation of the 5-HT<sub>1b</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2c</sub> receptors are involved in the process of delaying ejaculation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ndt-5-037">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ndt-5-037">17</xref> It has been hypothesized that altered levels of serotonin or serotonin receptor sensitivity in the ejaculatory modulating centers of the central nervous system are the pathophysiologic basis of ejaculatory disorders.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-ndt-5-037">17</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Current treatments for PE</title><p>Historically, PE was considered a psychosomatic problem.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-5-037">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-ndt-5-037">20</xref> Therefore, behavioral, cognitive, and sex/relationship therapies have been a key component of PE management. Behavioral approaches have generally focused on the physical aspect of PE, including the &#x0201c;squeeze&#x0201d; technique as first described by Masters and Johnson in 1970<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ndt-5-037">21</xref> and the &#x0201c;stop-start&#x0201d; method described by Semans in 1956.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-ndt-5-037">22</xref> These involve engaging in sexual foreplay until just before the point of ejaculation and then either squeezing the head of the penis or stopping sexual activity until the urge to ejaculate subsides, at which point sexual activity may be resumed and the techniques repeated as necessary. Cognitive or sex therapy focuses on perceptions and feelings, improving communication between partners, increasing sexual skills and self-confidence, and reducing anxiety associated with sexual activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ndt-5-037">19</xref> Short-term improvement with these behavioral approaches has been observed; however, there are limited data concerning the efficacy of these methods in the long term.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-ndt-5-037">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ndt-5-037">26</xref></p><p>A number of pharmacologic therapies have been employed in the management of PE. Topical therapies for PE act by desensitizing the penis and do not alter the sensation of ejaculation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ndt-5-037">27</xref> A topical cream containing local anesthetics lidocaine and prilocaine was effective in prolonging mean intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by 6 to 8 minutes (vs 1&#x02013;2 minutes with placebo; p &#x0003c; 0.05), but this must be applied at least 20 minutes (no longer than 45 minutes) prior to sexual contact.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ndt-5-037">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-ndt-5-037">29</xref> A novel aerosol formulation of lidocaine and prilocaine has also shown significant increases in IELT versus placebo (2.4- and 8-fold increases in two separate studies).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-ndt-5-037">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ndt-5-037">31</xref> Korean researchers have developed a topical cream (SS-cream) from natural products, which has local anesthetic properties and is applied to the penis 1 hour before sexual contact.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ndt-5-037">27</xref> In two randomized, double-blind, clinical trials, SS-cream (20-g dose) achieved a mean IELT of approximately 11 minutes, compared with 2.5 minutes for placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-ndt-5-037">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-ndt-5-037">33</xref></p><p>Such topical products can be applied on an as-needed (prn) basis and may be associated with fewer unwanted systemic adverse effects than oral therapies. However, side effects of these treatments may include loss of erection in men, a mild burning sensation within the vagina of the female partner, and numbness of the genitals in both partners.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-ndt-5-037">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-ndt-5-037">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-ndt-5-037">31</xref> In addition, topical treatments can be messy and inconvenient to use because they must be applied and wiped off at specific times before sexual contact.</p><p>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), commonly used in the treatment of depression, are often used to treat PE, based on the observation that delayed ejaculation is a frequent side effect of this drug class. In one prospective study (N = 344) of patients being treated with SSRIs for psychiatric disorders, the incidence of delayed ejaculation ranged from 46% to 59%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ndt-5-037">34</xref> In another study (N = 1022), the incidence of delayed ejaculation ranged from 50% to 64%.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ndt-5-037">35</xref> In both studies, paroxetine therapy was associated with the highest frequency of delayed ejaculation. In a third study of depressed patients (N = 203), the incidence of abnormal ejaculation following paroxetine treatment was 24%, compared with 12% for fluoxetine treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-ndt-5-037">36</xref></p><p>Results from several studies have shown that long-acting SSRIs significantly prolong IELT in men with PE when administered with chronic daily dosing. For example, in a randomized, double-blind study (N = 60), men with PE (defined as an IELT of &#x02264;1 minute) were randomized to receive 6 weeks of treatment with different long-acting SSRIs or placebo. Fluoxetine (20 mg/day), paroxetine (20 mg/day), and sertraline (50 mg/day) achieved statistically significant increases in mean IELT from baseline versus placebo (range of increases, 1.5&#x02013;7 minutes).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-ndt-5-037">37</xref> In a separate, smaller study (N = 34, including 17 men and their female partners), treatment with paroxetine (20&#x02013;40 mg/day) achieved a significant increase in median IELT from 0.5 minutes at baseline to 10 minutes after 6 weeks of treatment, compared with no change from baseline in median IELT with placebo therapy (p = 0.002).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-ndt-5-037">38</xref> Eight weeks of citalopram (20&#x02013;60 mg/day) treatment in men with PE (N = 26) has also been shown to significantly prolong IELT when compared with placebo (from 0.5 minutes at baseline to almost 5 minutes after 8 weeks; p &#x0003c; 0.01).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-ndt-5-037">39</xref> One analysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40-ndt-5-037">40</xref> of two randomized, controlled, crossover studies (N = 26 and 42) compared IELT data among men who received paroxetine 20 mg 3 to 4 hours prior to sexual intercourse either alone or following initial daily treatment with paroxetine 10 mg. The results of this analysis found that IELT was significantly longer among men who were initially treated with paroxetine 10 mg daily.</p><p>A key limitation of therapy for PE with currently available SSRIs is that in addition to delaying ejaculation, this class of drugs has been associated with a number of unwanted sexual side effects. Decreased libido (41%&#x02013;64%, in men and women), anorgasmia (31%&#x02013;53%, in men and women), and impotence/erectile dysfunction (ED; 10%&#x02013;41%) have been observed following treatment with fluoxetine, paroxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and citalopram.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-ndt-5-037">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-ndt-5-037">35</xref> In addition, use of SSRIs may be associated with clinically significant effects on mood, such as reduced ability to cry, express feelings, or care about the feelings of others, in men with and without psychiatric conditions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ndt-5-037">41</xref> Finally, abrupt cessation of SSRI therapy may also be associated with discontinuation syndrome, which includes a cluster of unpleasant physical and psychological symptoms including dizziness, nausea or vomiting, fatigue, headache, and unsteady gait.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-ndt-5-037">42</xref> Discontinuation syndrome is considered to be more common with SSRIs that have shorter half-lives.</p><p>Other systemic treatments that have been evaluated for the management of PE include the phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors, currently licensed for the treatment of ED. The potential mechanism of action of PDE-5 inhibitors in the treatment of PE is unclear, but current proposals include a central effect via the nitric oxide/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway; peripheral effects on smooth muscle in the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate, and urethra; the potential induction of peripheral analgesia; and prolongation of the duration of erection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43-ndt-5-037">43</xref> Despite the success of PDE-5 inhibitors in treating ED, there have been limited data to suggest that these agents are effective in men without ED. For example, a single-dose, home-use study in young, healthy men found that sildenafil did not improve any aspect of erectile function or sexual performance in this population, although sildenafil was associated with a reduction in post-ejaculatory refractory time.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44-ndt-5-037">44</xref> A systematic review of clinical trials assessing sildenafil, tadalafil, and vardenafil concluded that changes in IELT with these agents are variable and difficult to interpret because of inconsistencies in study design.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ndt-5-037">45</xref> In an 8-week double-blind study, sildenafil prn increased mean IELT, but not to a significantly greater degree than placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-ndt-5-037">46</xref> Because of its mechanism of action, sildenafil may be associated with headache, flushing, dyspepsia, rhinitis, and visual disturbances in some subjects. The combination of an SSRI (paroxetine or fluoxetine) and sildenafil or tadalafil may improve IELT significantly more than the SSRI alone, but the incidence of side effects is increased relative to monotherapy with either of these agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-ndt-5-037">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-ndt-5-037">49</xref> Treatment with PDE-5 inhibitors may be effective in men with comorbid ED and PE, and these two conditions commonly occur together.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ndt-5-037">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50-ndt-5-037">50</xref> For example, McMahon and colleagues<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45-ndt-5-037">45</xref> suggested that combination therapy may be particularly effective for men with comorbid PE and ED; however, further study is needed in this area.</p><p>The oral opioid analgesic tramadol has also been assessed as a treatment for PE. Although the potential mechanism of action of tramadol in PE is not well understood, it may relate to the antinociceptive effects associated with &#x003bc;-opioid binding, which may decrease sensitivity, as well as the inhibition of norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake, which may delay ejaculation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ndt-5-037">51</xref> Further investigation is needed to determine the precise effects of tramadol on 5HT<sub>1a</sub> and 5HT<sub>2c</sub>. Two small clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of tramadol in treating PE. In the first study (N = 60), tramadol prn increased mean IELT from 1.2 minutes at baseline to 7.4 minutes at the end of 8 weeks, compared with a change from 1.1 to 2.0 minutes with placebo (p &#x0003c; 0.0001). In addition, 98% of subjects reported that they felt tramadol therapy was associated with a significant increase in their control over ejaculation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51-ndt-5-037">51</xref> In the second study, an 8-week parallel-group study (N = 64),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52-ndt-5-037">52</xref> similar findings were reported.</p><p>In clinical practice, many of these treatment modalities are used in various combinations (eg, behavioral therapy and topical treatments); however, these combinations have rarely been rigorously evaluated in controlled clinical studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Dapoxetine: an emerging pharmacologic treatment for PE</title><p>Presently, no pharmacologic agent is approved by any regulatory agency specifically for the treatment of PE, which may contribute to undertreatment of the condition.

Current treatment options for PE have demonstrated limited long-term efficacy and/or undesirable side effects and have generally not been evaluated in large well-controlled clinical trials for the treatment of PE. Several new treatment options are in development for the treatment of PE, including oral and topical therapies.</p><p>Dapoxetine, a short-acting SSRI, is the most rigorously evaluated new agent being developed for the treatment of PE. Dapoxetine has demonstrated efficacy and safety in five large, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III clinical trials. In addition to significantly prolonging IELT, subjects receiving dapoxetine have reported improvements in all other measures of PE evaluated, including perceived control over ejaculation, satisfaction with sexual intercourse, personal distress related to PE, interpersonal difficulty related to PE, and overall impression of change in PE severity. Dapoxetine is generally well-tolerated, with the most common side effect being nausea; in contrast to long-acting SSRIs, the incidence of undesirable sexual side effects, treatment-emergent anxiety, and discontinuation syndrome was low.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support was provided by Jason McDonough, PhD, of MedErgy.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>The
