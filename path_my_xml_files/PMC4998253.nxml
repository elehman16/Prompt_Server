The next step in the clinical development plan was to evaluate the vaccine in a TB-endemic setting, in order to confirm the above results,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and to test M72/AS01 in an HIV-infected ART-naive population.</p><p>This study evaluated the safety and T-cell-mediated and humoral responses of M72/AS01 in HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults aged 18 to 59 years living in India, which were either <italic>Mtb</italic>-primed or <italic>Mtb</italic>-naive. Three cohorts were enrolled (ART-stable, ART-naive, and HIV-negative [control]), each comprising an M72/AS01 group and a placebo group.

Written or thumb-printed and witnessed informed consent was obtained from all participants before study entry. Overall, Good Clinical Practices and the principles of the Helsinki Declaration were followed, and corrective/preventive actions implemented whenever potential or actual issues regarding the study's conduct were identified or brought to the sponsor's attention.</p><p>HIV-positive participants were recruited from patients registered for follow-up at YRG CARE clinic, and eligible participants were assigned to the ART-stable or ART-naive cohorts. HIV-negative participants were recruited from the general population. In each cohort, eligible subjects were randomized 1:1 using an internet-based block randomization (SASv8.2; SAS Institute Inc.) to receive 2 doses of M72/AS01 or placebo, 1 month apart, and were followed until 1 year postdose 2 (month 13).</p><p>Since this was the 1st time that M72/AS01 was evaluated in ART-naive individuals, vaccination was staggered in the ART-naive cohort: a subset of 20 subjects received dose 1, and blinded safety data (biochemistry/hematology, VL, CD4 count, HIV clinical staging, and adverse events [AEs] collected until 21 days post-dose 1) were reviewed by an independent local safety monitor and a sponsor safety review team. If no safety issues were observed, progression to dose 2 and further vaccination of the rest of the cohort was conducted.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>Participants aged 18 to 59 years had no past or current TB disease, no evidence of pulmonary pathology (active and/or acute or chronic pulmonary disease as confirmed by chest X-ray), no history of extra-pulmonary TB or chemotherapy for TB based on medical history, and clinical laboratory values that were considered acceptable by the investigator.</p><p>At screening, participants were tested by QuantiFERON-TB (QFT) Gold assay (Cellestis Ltd., Australia). HIV-negative volunteers were tested for HIV. CD4 counts and VLs of HIV-positive participants were measured. Nadir CD4 counts prior to ART initiation, previous BCG vaccination, and/or the presence of a BCG scar were documented.</p><p>HIV-positive subjects had been under medical care for at least 6 months. Eligible ART-stable subjects were stable on ART for at least 6 months before screening, and had CD4 counts &#x02265;250&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup> and plasma VLs &#x0003c;400&#x0200a;copies/mL at screening.

Eligible ART-naive subjects had never received ART after HIV diagnosis, were at screening not expected to commence ART within the subsequent year, had CD4 counts &#x0003e;350&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup> (following the then current WHO recommendations for ART initiation<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup>) and VLs within the range of 5000&#x02013;80,000&#x0200a;copies/mL. TB preventive therapy was not administered to HIV-positive (or HIV-negative) subjects, since this was not routinely used in India at the time of the study.</p><p>Key exclusion criteria were acute or chronic pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal abnormalities (as determined by laboratory screening or physical examination), pregnancy, lactation, or any condition/illness (acute/chronic/historical) or medication potentially interfering with immunogenicity or safety evaluations. Additional exclusion criteria for the ART-stable cohort were ART-regimen changes within 12 weeks before screening, and chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study (other than ART or prophylaxis for opportunistic HIV-related infections/symptoms).</p></sec><sec><title>Study Vaccines</title><p>The M72 antigen is a recombinant fusion protein derived from the immunogenic <italic>Mtb</italic> proteins Mtb32A and Mtb39A.

As also reported for ART-stable subjects in Switzerland,<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> M72/AS01 was clinically well tolerated and did not negatively affect the participants&#x02019; ART-regimens, VLs or CD4 counts. In each cohort, M72/AS01 induced persistent responses of M72-specific antibodies and polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus, irrespective of their ART status, HIV-positive subjects can mount an immune response to M72/AS01.</p><p>Previously, we conducted a 3-year safety and immunogenicity follow-up in HIV-negative adults in a TB nonendemic region with a different M72/AS01 formulation.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The current results and those of the next 2 years of follow-up will collectively comprise the 1st long-term data in HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults in a TB-endemic region, for the current M72/AS01 formulation. The 1st year postvaccination results show that M72/AS01 had an acceptable safety profile in ART-naive and ART-stable adults (similar to observations with another AS01-adjuvanted protein vaccine<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup>), as well as in HIV-negative adults. In addition, we demonstrate that 2 doses can provide CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses persisting for up to 1 year in each of the study populations assessed. The next 2 years of follow-up will provide more definite results on the longevity of these responses. It is noteworthy that in a long-term study with the MVA85A vector-based TB candidate vaccine, antigen-specific T-cell responses (in IFN-&#x003b3; ELISpot) persisted for 3 to 5 years after vaccination in ART-stable vaccinees, but were undetectable after this time-frame in ART-naive vaccinees.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>The magnitudes of vaccine-induced M72-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses in the ART-stable cohort surpassed those in the ART-naive cohort up to 1 year postvaccination, and were overall comparable to those obtained with the same vaccine in ART-stable subjects in Switzerland.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The latter is promising, given the potential exposure of the current subjects to environmental mycobacteria and helminths, which could interfere with the CMI responses to mycobacterial antigens.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Given the high ART-adherence rates, and the relatively high CD4 counts of the ART-stable vaccinees (both nadir [Q1&#x02013;Q3: 167&#x02013;269&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>] and at screening [466&#x02013;834&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>]), we assume that these subjects were not severely immunocompromised. This could explain the robust responses to M72/AS01 in this cohort. We have no clear explanation for the fact that after dose 2 (from day 60 onwards), responses in the ART-stable cohort were also higher than in the HIV-negative cohort, but we hypothesize that 2 possible nonexclusive effects may be underlying this result. First, assuming that the same number of CD4<sup>+</sup> precursor memory T cells may be induced upon vaccination in HIV-negative and ART-stable subjects, and that the total number of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was lower in the latter group, vaccination could result in a higher relative proportion of M72-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells per million CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the ART-stable subjects. Alternatively or in addition, since ART can contribute to the specific replenishment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the setting of HIV-induced lymphopenia,<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> this can provide an environment for homeostatic proliferation with associated cytokine induction.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> After vaccination, such environment might have led to higher expansion rates of the newly induced M72-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones in the ART-stable subjects.</p><p>On average, 31% of the HIV-positive participants were QFT-positive, and presumably latently TB-infected. In the HIV-positive cohorts, responses of M72-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were highest in QFT-positive subjects after 1 dose, suggesting that in these individuals, these cells had already been primed by natural <italic>Mtb</italic> infection. However, this difference between QFT subgroups was not observed anymore after the 2nd dose (from day 37 onwards), and, consistent with PBMC-based results from an M72/AS01 trial in HIV-negative adolescents,<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> there was also no significant difference between QFT subgroups after the 2nd vaccination in the HIV-negative cohort.</p><p>No vaccine-induced M72-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were observed. This may be due to either the used technology (PBMC-based ICS assay), since transient M72-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses were previously observed in HIV-negative subjects at 7 days postvaccination using a whole-blood-based ICS assay,<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> or to as-yet-unknown factors. The significance of Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in protection against human TB remains unclear, but preclinical data suggest that these cells contribute to <italic>Mtb</italic> infection control (reviewed in ref.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup>). A protective immune response can only be defined from efficacy trial data.</p><p>Baseline CD4 counts in the ART-naive subjects (median &#x0223c;525&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>) were relatively high compared to the then current WHO-recommended cut-off for ART initiation of &#x02264;350&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, and approximated the presently recommended cut-off of &#x02264;500&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> The safety and immunogenicity of M72/AS01 in ART-naive subjects with CD4 counts below 350&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup> has therefore not been demonstrated, and, given the abovementioned currently recommended cut-off, may be difficult to demonstrate in an interventional trial.</p><p>Recent studies increasingly acknowledge a potential role of <italic>Mtb</italic>-specific antibody responses in the protection against TB.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Our results suggest that ART had a positive influence on the anti-M72 IgG response persistence, since they were more persistent in the ART-stable than in the ART-naive cohort. Because preservation of naive T-cell populations can enhance antigen-specific antibody responses (as observed for influenza vaccines<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>), early commencement of ART is likely essential for humoral responses. Consistently, the CD4 nadirs recorded for the ART-stable vaccinees were relatively high (median 220&#x0200a;cells/mm<sup>3</sup>), suggesting that for these subjects, ART had not commenced at very low CD4 counts.</p><p>Finally, we note that this was a Phase II study, and results will need to be validated in a confirmatory trial in a larger population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>M72/AS01 was immunogenic in ART-stable, ART-naive, and HIV-negative adults in India, and well tolerated.
