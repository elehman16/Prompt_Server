and range of motion in patients with adhesive capsulitis. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty
patients with adhesive capsulitis were divided into an experimental group (n=15) that
would be treated with extracorporeal shock wave therapy and a control group (n=15) that
would be treated only with conservative physical therapy. Both groups were treated three
times a week over a four-week period. [Results] An intra-group comparison before and after
the treatment showed that both groups experienced a decline in pain and an increase in
their range of motion that were statistically significant. An inter-group comparison after
the treatment showed that the experimental group had a lower level of pain and a higher
range of motion than the control group that were statistically significant. [Conclusion]
Extracorporeal shock wave therapy may be an effective intervention for reducing pain and
improving the range of motion in patients with adhesive capsulitis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Extracorporeal shock wave therapy</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Range of motion</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Adhesive capsulitis creates a great deal of discomfort in a patient&#x02019;s daily life caused by
degenerative changes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup> occurring in the
rotator cuff, synovial membrane, articular capsule, biceps brachii, and the surrounding
tissues. Adhesive capsulitis refers to the occurrence of pain and a gradual decline in the
range of motion (ROM) due to slow increases in synovial hypertrophy and the adhesion between
the synovial membrane and articular surface. The disease is characterized by a bending of
the shoulder joint and a decline in external rotation. It leads to the loss of flexibility
and difficulties with the activities of daily living (ADLs) due to chronic inflammation
accompanied by intra-articular fibrosis<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
While the methods for treating adhesive capsulitis include thermotherapy, cryotherapy,
electrotherapy, exercise therapy, and manual therapy<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has recently drawn great
attention as a non-surgical treatment method<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. This therapy assists revascularization through the application of
extracorporeal shock waves to the lesion, and reduces pain and improves function in the
shoulder by stimulating or reactivating the healing process of connective tissues, including
tendons and bones<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. While it is currently
used for musculoskeletal diseases, such as calcific tendinitis and plantar fasciitis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, few studies have focused on its therapeutic
effects on adhesive capsulitis. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the
effects of ESWT on pain and ROM in patients with adhesive capsulitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects were 30 patients, aged 50 to 70, who had been diagnosed by their physicians
with adhesive capsulitis based on clinical findings and data obtained from such medical
devices as x-ray units. The subjects were chosen from among the outpatients at S Orthopedic
Clinic in Daegu Metropolitan City. Patients who had neurological diseases, dislocation,
subluxation, rheumatism, or had received surgery were excluded. On average, the control
group (n=15) members were 59.0 &#x000b1; 4.4&#x02005;years of age, 163.3 &#x000b1; 6.6&#x02005;cm in height, and 61.5 &#x000b1;
10.0&#x02005;kg in weight; the experimental group (n=15) members were 58.4 &#x000b1; 4.0&#x02005;years of age, 163.5
&#x000b1; 8.1&#x02005;cm in height, and 65.1 &#x000b1; 9.6&#x02005;kg in weight. The study was conducted after its entire
process was fully explained to the subjects and their approval was gained. In addition,
ethical approval for the study was granted by the U1 University institutional review
board.</p><p>The control group was treated with a range of conservative physical therapies, including
hot packs (20 minutes), ultrasound (5 minutes), and interference current therapy (100 bps,
15 minutes). The experimental group received conservative physical therapy, then was
additionally treated with a magnetic ESWT unit (REGENWAVE, HNT Med, Korea). Waves of 4&#x02005;Hz
were applied 1,000 times using a focus-type head and while adjusting the intensity of the
energy according to the patients&#x02019; degree of tolerance to the pain resulting from the
treatment. Prior to the treatment, the patient received a physical examination to determine
the target region for the accurate delivery of the shock wave energy. All the subjects were
treated three times a week over a four-week period.</p><p>The visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of pain; the shoulder ROM
was measured using a goniometer while the patients were in the supine position. To increase
consistency, a single rater measured all the subjects&#x02019; order of bending and external
rotation.</p><p>For the statistical processing of the data describing the changes in pain and ROM in the
patients with adhesive capsulitis, the paired t-test was performed for the intra-group
comparison and the independent t-test was performed for the inter-group comparison. The
SPSS/PC Version 13.0 software package was used for statistical processing and the
statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The intra-group comparison showed that both groups experienced statistically significant
declines in their degree of pain as measured by the VAS score and statistically significant
increases in their flexion ROM (FROM) and external rotation ROM (ERROM). The inter-group
comparison after the treatment showed that the experimental group recorded statistically
significant lower VAS scores and higher FROM and ERROM than the control group (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the VAS and ROM within each group</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="2" align="center" rowspan="1">Group</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">VAS (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9 &#x000b1; 0.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3 &#x000b1; 0.9<sup>**</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0 &#x000b1; 0.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.9 &#x000b1; 1.0<sup>**,&#x02020;&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">FROM (degree)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">108.4 &#x000b1; 23.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112.0 &#x000b1; 24.3<sup>**</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">88.3 &#x000b1; 30.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">147.7 &#x000b1; 27.1<sup>**,&#x02020;&#x02020;</sup></td></tr><tr><td colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">ERROM (degree)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.0 &#x000b1; 15.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.2 &#x000b1; 15.6<sup>**</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EG</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">45.7 &#x000b1; 10.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.3 &#x000b1; 5.4<sup>**,&#x02020;&#x02020;</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>VAS: visual analog scale; FROM: flexion ROM; ERROM: external rotation ROM; CG:

follow-up of 20 patients treated with shock waves showed that 70% of the patients
experienced notably reduced pain. Rompe et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> stated that 60% out of the 40 patients with calcific tendinitis of
the shoulder fully recovered after a single ESWT. Moreover, Noh et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the application of ESWT in patients diagnosed
with calcific tendinitis of the shoulder resulted in clinical improvements. In the present
study, the experimental group also exhibited a statistically significant decline in their
VAS scores. This may have resulted because the fine and repetitive stimulations of shock
waves, a type of sound wave that can be transmitted through soft tissues without the loss of
energy, generated the effect of suppressing the nociceptors<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Avancini-Dobrovi&#x00107; et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a
study in which extracorporeal shock waves were applied to 30 patients with calcific
tendinitis of the shoulder and observed the treatment&#x02019;s statistically significant effects on
bending, spreading, and lateral rotation of the shoulder joint. Chen et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that after the application of
extracorporeal shock waves, the measurement of the ROM in 40 patients with adhesive
capsulitis showed statistically significant improvements. In the present study, the
experimental group treated with ESWT also exhibited statistically significant improvements
in their ROM. This result may have occurred because the therapy reduced pain by causing
changes in the metabolism of cells and the penetrability of endothelial tissues<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the ESWT may have stabilized
the tissues by stimulating and reactivating the healing process of the tendons and their
surrounding tissues by creating new muscle fibers through facilitating the secretion of
angiogenic substances around the affected region and increasing blood flow to the
region<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, this study involved
only a small number of subjects who had visited our hospital over a four-week period. The
researcher failed to follow up the degree of recovery of the treated patients beyond four
weeks. Therefore, further follow-up research is needed to evaluate the long-term treatment
of the subjects</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="ths"><person-group><name><surname>Kweon</surname><given-names>OH</given-names></name></person-group>: Randomized clinical trial analysis of effect of electro-acupuncture
