Systemic treatment is usually administered with palliative intent, with the aims of prolonging overall survival (OS), and improving patient symptoms and quality of life (QoL). With recent new breast cancer therapeutic agents, there have been modest but meaningful improvements in OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">Chia et al. 2007</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">Gennari et al. 2005</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">Dafni et al. 2010</xref>). However, improvements in symptoms and QoL remain important goals for this incurable disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">Chung and Carlson 2003</xref>).</p><p>A recent Cochrane review reported that combination chemotherapy resulted in significant prolongation of OS and time to progression and superior tumor response but more toxicity in women with metastatic breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Carrick et al. 2009</xref>). Our previous studies demonstrated that QoL can be improved through chemotherapy despite its treatment-related toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">Coates et al. 1987</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">Stockler et al. 2011</xref>). It has been suggested that further improvement in patient outcomes could be achieved by using treatments of low toxicity with the focus on trade-off between QoL and OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">Tannock 1987</xref>). However, the interpretation of such a clinical trial could be complicated, particularly when a treatment improves one clinical endpoint, such as QoL, but disadvantages the other, such as OS.</p><p>Using data from ANZ 8614 clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Simes et al. 1994</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Bishop et al. 1999</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Carrick et al. 2009</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">Lord et al. 2008</xref>), we evaluate trade-offs between QoL and survival improvement, in terms of quality-adjusted survival outcomes, by comparing patients with advanced breast cancer treated with single-agent mitoxantrone and combination cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-flurouracil, and prednisone (CMFP). Mitoxantrone has some clinical activity in advanced breast cancer, is easy to administer and is relatively low in toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">Cornbleet et al. 1984</xref>). CMFP, on the other hand, is a more complex regimen with established activity and possible greater toxicity than mitoxantrone. In this report, we also provide updated long-term survival outcomes of the ANZ 8614 clinical trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">Simes et al. 1994</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">Bishop et al. 1999</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Carrick et al. 2009</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">Lord et al. 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Key eligibility criteria included histologically confirmed breast carcinoma, with recurrent or metastatic measurable or evaluable disease, adequate bone marrow reserves (white blood cell count of 4.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L or greater and platelet count of 100 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup>/L or greater), adequate hepatic (serum bilirubin less than 20 mol/L) and renal function (creatinine less than 0.15 mmol/L), and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 3. Key exclusion criteria were prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, extensive radiotherapy, past history of other cancer, diabetes mellitus, congestive cardiac failure, and symptomatic coronary artery disease. All patients provided signed written informed consent.</p><p>Random assignment was performed centrally and balanced dynamically for the treating institution, performance status (ECOG PS 0 to 1 vs 2 to 3), and the presence of liver or brain metastases. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either mitoxantrone or CMFP. On treatment failure, crossover to the other treatment regimen was allowed as second-line therapy for all patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Treatments</title><p>Mitoxantrone was given intravenously in a dose of 14 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, repeated every 21 days. CMFP consisted of oral cyclophosphamide 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and oral prednisone 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> daily on days 1 through 14, with methotrexate 40 mg/m<sup>2</sup> and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m<sup>2</sup> administered intravenously on days 1 and 8 and repeated every 4 weeks.</p><p>Doses were based on surface area calculated from the lesser of ideal or actual body weight. Treatment was delayed until toxicities other than alopecia had resolved to grade 1 or lower. Subsequent doses of chemotherapy were routinely adjusted on the basis of pretreatment total white cell count (or, when available, on neutrophil counts at the nadir of each cycle) and platelet count.</p><p>The initial chemotherapy regimen was continued until disease progression, patient intolerance, or unacceptable toxicity. A maximum cumulative dose of 140 mg/m<sup>2</sup> of mitoxantrone or a maximum 12 months of CMFP chemotherapy were recommended. However, beyond these times, further treatment was allowed at the discretion of the responsible clinician, with appropriate monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments</title><p>Patients were assessed before each cycle of chemotherapy: every 3 weeks for those receiving mitoxantrone and 4 weeks for CMFP. Adverse events were rated with the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Miller et al. 1981</xref>) after each cycle of chemotherapy. Computerized axial tomographic scans of the chest and abdomen and skeletal radionucleotide scans were performed at baseline and every 12 weeks until disease progression, or at an earlier time if disease progression was suspected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study design</title><p>The primary aim of this study was to determine whether a chemotherapeutic regimen of established efficacy but more toxicity is associated with an overall net clinical benefit measured in terms of quality-adjusted progression-free survival (PFS) and quality-adjusted OS. The aim of the ANZ 8614 trial was to compare the two randomized regimens in terms of PFS (defined as time from randomization to progression or death), OS (defined as time from randomization to death), objective tumor response (complete plus partial response), and QoL. The objective tumor response was classified according to the WHO criteria as complete response, partial response, no change, or progressive disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">Miller et al. 1981</xref>).</p><p>QoL was assessed before random assignment, before each cycle of chemotherapy up to 12 weeks, then every 12 weeks thereafter until death. Patients were asked to rate their QoL averaged over the period since their last assessment by using a series of linear analog self-assessment scales. We used the five linear analog self-assessment (LASA) scales developed by Priestman and Baum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">Priestman and Baum 1976</xref>): physical wellbeing, mood, pain, nausea and vomiting, and appetite. We also used the general life quality scales (GLQ-8) of Coates and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">Coates et al. 1990</xref>): feeling anxious/depressed, feeling sick, numbness, hair loss, tiredness, appetite/taste, sexual interest, the thought of having treatment, and an overall QoL index uniscale. In addition, at each of these times, the clinician completed the Spitzer QL-index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">Spitzer et al. 1981</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>The planned sample size of 450 patients (225 per arm) accrued over 3 years and observed for an additional 3 years was designed to give 80% power to detect a 35% improvement in 12-month OS from 34% to 45% (hazard ratio (HR), 0.74), comparing the mitoxantrone and CMF groups. The final sample size of 391 patients provided adequate power, owing to longer accrual and follow-up periods.</p><p>We compared response and toxicity using the exact tests for these ordered categorical data. We constructed Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS and OS and compared them by using the log-rank test for the analyses of these time-to-event data. The influence of baseline factors on treatment effects was assessed by testing for interactions with treatment in Cox proportional-hazards models for PFS and OS. Multivariable analyses for the baseline factors were also undertaken. All analyses were by intention to treat. All <italic>P</italic> values and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are two sided.</p><p>Scores on each QoL scale were compared for the two treatment groups from randomization until first disease progression. Missing components of QoL data were replaced with the mean values of the treatment group. Limited data on QoL from progression until death were available; this was calculated as the mean of the available QoL scores regardless of treatment group.</p><p>A global QoL score, derived using a regression function, was a weighted combination of the measured global QoL scale (GLQ-8) and all individual LASA QoL (except sexual interest) items. A subset QoL score was a weighted combination of only individual LASA QoL (except sexual interest) items. A previous publication outlines the detailed methods of derivation of the global and subset QoL scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Lumley et al. 2001</xref>). A utility score was obtained from power transformation of the global QoL score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Lumley et al. 2001</xref>).</p><p>Measures of net clinical benefit were demonstrated by incorporating survival and QoL outcomes into single measures as quality-adjusted PFS and quality-adjusted OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Glasziou et al. 1990</xref>). Quality-adjusted PFS for each group was the product of its mean utility score and the area under its time-to-progression curve truncated at 24 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">Glasziou et al. 1990</xref>). We calculated the mean utility score from randomization to disease progression using generalized estimating equation models for each treatment group. We used an exchangeable correlation structure and robust standard error estimator to account for correlation among repeated measures of QoL. The CIs and <italic>P</italic> values for differences in quality-adjusted PFS between groups were calculated with bootstrap methods. A similar method was adopted for quality-adjusted OS (where QoL after disease progression was calculated as the average of all available QoL scores) and the area under its time-to-death curve truncated at 30 months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Between January 1988 and June 1993, 391 patients from 24 institutions in Australia and New Zealand participated in this study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

However, CMFP was significantly associated with at least one episode of grade 3 or worse toxicity than mitoxantrone. Despite the greater toxicity of CMFP, the result of this study was consistent with our hypothesis that better tumor control achieved with this regimen was still associated with improved quality-adjusted PFS for these patients with advanced breast cancer.</p><p>Despite a longer PFS with CMFP, there was no advantage with initial use of this regimen in terms of OS or quality-adjusted OS. More than half of the patients whose disease progressed on mitoxantrone were subsequently treated with CMFP. Consequently, post-progression therapy might have obscured any potential advantage of CMFP for OS. In this setting of advanced breast cancer, selection of one of these regimens for initial treatment could reasonably be based on improvement in symptoms and QoL. Despite the additional toxicity of CMFP chemotherapy, patients randomly assigned this treatment reported improvement in QoL after 3 months on therapy (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), with significant improvement in mood, nausea and vomiting, and feeling sick. There was a nonstatistical significant advantage in favor of CMFP according to the global QoL score, but the quality-adjusted PFS was also significantly longer with CMFP.</p><p>Since the time this trial was undertaken, a wide range of newer chemotherapeutic agents and molecularly targeted therapies have become available as first-line treatment for advanced breast cancer. Although neither of the regimens investigated in this randomized trial would now be accepted as the most efficacious first-line therapy, this study has tested an important principle of choosing between the more effective but more toxic CMFP and the less effective and less toxic mitoxantrone. Treatments that are less efficacious but also lower in toxicity may result in fewer treatment-related side-effects, but poor tumor control fails to improve cancer-related symptoms, QoL or quality-adjusted survival outcomes. The results of this study are consistent with our earlier finding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">Coates et al. 1987</xref>) that optimal patient benefit in advanced breast cancer comes from the use of a regimen likely to be most effective in controlling the tumor. However, when selecting treatment for individual patients, the advantages and disadvantages of each treatment should be considered. For example, mitoxantrone may have a role for those patients who are relatively asymptomatic or who have more slowly evolving forms of cancer and for patients for whom hair loss is a primary concern.</p><p>Systematic reviews of chemotherapy in advanced breast cancer have shown survival improvement with combination polychemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">Carrick et al. 2009</xref>), and taxane-based chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">Ghersi et al. 2005</xref>), and better tumor response and improved PFS with anthracycline-based chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">Lord et al. 2008</xref>). However, these reviews have reported that gains in survival are modest and these regimens have been associated with additional toxicity. Even with the wide range of modern therapies available, it remains relevant and important that such regimens are assessed for evidence to support a reasonable chance of providing meaningful net clinical benefit through integration of measures of QoL and/or symptom control with survival outcomes as indicators of efficacy in clinical trials.</p><p>There are ongoing concerns about the scientific rigor of QoL outcomes and their influence on clinical decision making. A recent review of metastatic breast cancer trials reported that QoL outcomes provided little information beyond that obtained from survival and toxicity outcomes, leading to no change in recommendations as the result of the additional QoL assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Goodwin et al. 2003</xref>). It has been recommended that QoL assessments would be important when treatments have equivalent tumor-related outcomes and competing toxicities are present or the logistics of treatment administration differ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">Goodwin et al. 2003</xref>). Our trial results, however, are different, as CMFP is superior to mitoxantrone in tumor-related outcomes, but CMFP is also more toxic than mitoxantrone. In this case, the QoL assessment by patients and the integration of individual QoL scores according to patient weightings with survival outcomes provided a more complete picture of the balance of benefit and harm in guiding clinical decision making. We recommend that this approach be adopted in other clinical trials where trade-offs in toxicity with tumor response and survival exist.</p><p>There are several limitations of this study. Both the experimental and control regimens are not the standard choices of first-line therapy in today&#x02019;s context. However, these choices were reasonable at the time of conception of this trial in the 1980s. The improvement of QoL, such as mood, appetite, nausea, vomiting, could be resulted from the use of prednisone as part of CMFP, but not necessary contributing to the overall efficacy of this regimen. Furthermore, as QoL was assessed subjectively by the patients, some placebo effect may have been involved. However, all patients in this trial received active therapy, and the QoL measures used had been validated, so such an effect, if any, could be considered negligible. Although the global QoL score was calculated by incorporating different QoL items according to the weighted importance from the average trial patient&#x02019;s perspective, individual patients in other settings may have different trade-offs for these QoL items that may vary from the average perspective. A previous study did demonstrate some similarity in the weights assigned for the QoL items by patients with advanced breast cancer in different settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">Lumley et al. 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In advanced breast cancer, the main goals of treatment are to improve symptoms and QoL. Many contemporary chemotherapeutic and molecularly targeted agents have different and unique side-effect profiles as compared with the traditional regimens tested in this study. However, the principle used to assess trade-offs between the antitumor efficacy and toxicity remains relevant and applicable for clinical decision making today.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interest</bold></p><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>CKL and RJS wrote the paper, designed the study and analysed and interpreted the data.
