After 9 weeks, soft tissue around the tissue expander was excised and evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively to assess extent of inflammation (CD68 antibodies and interleukin-6 levels), degradation and fibrosis (matrix metalloproteinase-1 and procollagen-1 staining), and mechanical (tensile) strength. <bold>Results:</bold> Histological evaluation of tissue around the tissue expander indicated differences in host response, suggesting capsule presence in the gamma-irradiated matrix group but not the freeze-dried matrix group. The extent of local inflammation was much higher in the gamma-irradiated matrix group which demonstrated mean (standard deviation) localized interleukin-6 concentration of 67.3 (53.6) vs 16.3 (6.7) pg/mg protein in the non-irradiated matrix group. There was robust degradation and fibrotic response in the gamma-irradiated matrix group versus the freeze-dried matrix group. Mechanical testing indicated mean (standard deviation) ultimate tensile strength of 12.0 (7.1) N in the gamma-irradiated matrix group versus 99.3 (48.8) N in the freeze-dried matrix group. <bold>Conclusions:</bold> Enclosure of a tissue expander with human acellular dermal matrix untreated by gamma irradiation led to minimal inflammation and minimal evidence of fibrosis/capsule around the tissue expander compared with robust capsule formation around the tissue expander that was covered by a gamma-irradiated human acellular dermal matrix.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>acellular dermal matrix</kwd><kwd>AlloDerm</kwd><kwd>animals</kwd><kwd>breast implants</kwd><kwd>foreign-body reaction</kwd><kwd>tissue expanders</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Implant-based breast reconstruction following mastectomy is a widely used alternative to autologous reconstruction techniques. In many cases, a 2-stage tissue expander (TE)/implant exchange procedure is employed.

Behavioral Sciences Foundation is accredited with the Canadian Council for Animal Care.</p><p>Nine adult male Caribbean vervets (Chlorocebus aethiops) (3&#x02013;6 kg) were included in the study. Animals were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups to receive a subcutaneous TE implant either on the left or right side of the dorsum. Animals were randomized to receive (1) TE only and TE with an overlay of aseptically processed HADM (TE + AD, with AD being AlloDerm Regenerative Tissue Matrix, LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg, New Jersey); (2) TE only and TE with an overlay of a gamma-irradiated HADM (TE + AM, with AM being AlloMax, Bard-Davol, Warwick, Rhode Island); or (3) TE + AD and TE + AM (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). At 9 weeks following implantation, animals were killed and soft tissue around the TE was harvested. The TE-only group was used as a control (surgery, TE implant, skin flap coverage, no HADM).</p></sec><sec id="S1-2"><title>TE implantation</title><p>Animals were fasted for 24 hours prior to the procedure and anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (10 mg/kg) and xylazine (1.0 mg/kg). Each animal was then placed in ventral recumbency and its upper back shaved and aseptically prepared for surgery. A single 125-mg dose of cefazolin was given intramuscularly before incision. Two horizontal curved incisions (&#x02265;6 cm) were made through the skin and subcutaneous tissues on either side of the back below the shoulder blades. Dorsal, rather than ventral, implantation was performed to prevent host postoperative tampering. A subcutaneous pocket was created above the dorsal musculature and deep fascia on either side of the spine to accommodate a 30-mL, 3-cm diameter circular, smooth silicone shell TE (PMT Corp, Chanhassen, Minnesota). For TE-only treatment, a TE was inserted into the subcutaneous pocket and filled with 25-mL sterile saline solution. The port and tubing were ligated and removed, and the TE anchored to the fascia with 2-0 polypropylene sutures around the port remnant. For the TE + AD and TE + AM groups, a 6 &#x000d7; 6 cm<sup>2</sup> dermal graft sheet (1.04-2.28 mm thick for AD; 0.8-1.8 mm thick for AM) was placed into the subcutaneous pocket and sutured down in a circumferential pattern to the underlying dorsal musculature. A TE was inserted above the muscle and positioned such that it was completely covered by dermal graft. The subcutaneous layer was then closed with polydioxanone sutures in a continuous subcuticular pattern, and skin was closed using nonabsorbable nylon sutures in an interrupted pattern. Animals received a 3-day course of cefazolin (125 mg bid, intramuscularly [IM]) with Banamine (Schering-Plough Animal Health, Kenilworth, New Jersey) 5 mg/kg given as needed. Animals were given flunixin meglumine (2.0&#x02013;5.0 mg/kg, IM) or buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg subcutaneously or IM) immediately after surgery, with additional analgesic permitted twice daily for 3 days or longer for persistent pain. All animals underwent biweekly physical examinations to monitor for complications, particularly at the surgical site.</p></sec><sec id="S1-3"><title>Tissue harvesting</title><p>Animals were euthanized by intravenous injection of pentobarbital 9 weeks postimplantation. TE and surrounding tissues were removed en bloc, inclusive of the implanted dermal graft material, host tissues above the implanted TE, and the thoracic muscle below the TE. The entire explanted surgical pocket was then carefully divided along a sagittal plane into thirds, with the lateral one-third flash frozen in dry ice for later immunochemical analysis and the remaining two-thirds divided for fixation in 10% formalin (lateral segment) pending histologic and immunohistochemical analysis or immediate biomechanical testing (central unfixed segment).</p></sec><sec id="S1-4"><title>Tissue assessments</title><p>Paraffin-embedded tissue samples were sectioned and underwent routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E) staining and Verhoeff-Van Gieson (VVG) staining for elastin. For immunohistochemical labeling, tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and proteinase K applied for antigen retrieval. Monoclonal antibodies to &#x003b1;-SMA, CD68, MMP-1, TIMP-1, and procollagen-1 were applied using the appropriate dilutions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Detection was achieved using an appropriate secondary anti-immunoglobulin G (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and labeling was visualized with diaminobenzidine. Sections were evaluated for localization and intensity of staining for each immunohistochemical marker, scored by 2 independent histopathologists who were blinded to the nature of the individual samples, and the scores for each biopsy averaged. Immunohistochemical detection of the selected markers was used to determine the presence of inflammation (CD68), degradation (MMP-1/TIMP-1), characterization of capsule formation (&#x003b1;-SMA), and fibrosis (procollagen-1). H&#x00026;E- and VVG-stained slides were evaluated for the presence of capsule and graft resorption as indicated by heterogeneous distribution of dermal elastin, respectively. Biopsies were scored for these factors as either present or absent. Relative presence and staining for each individual immunohistochemical marker was compared to the appropriate positive control, with a score of &#x0201c;&#x02212;&#x0201d; indicating 0% staining, &#x0201c;+/&#x02212;&#x0201d; indicating 5% to 20% of positive control, &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; indicating 20% to 40% of positive control, &#x0201c;++&#x0201d; indicating 40% to 60% of positive control, &#x0201c;+++&#x0201d; indicating 60% to 80% of positive control, and &#x0201c;++++&#x0201d; indicating 80% to 100% or equivalent to positive control as indicated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>For biochemical analysis, flash-frozen samples were extracted and analyzed for inflammatory cytokines using a multiplex immunoassay array for biochemical markers of inflammation and fibrosis, including interleukins (ILs) 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, interferon (INF)-&#x003b3;, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;, and vascular endothelial growth factor (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, cat M50-000007A). Briefly, frozen samples were pulverized in a tissue cryohomogenizer, followed by treatment with cell lysis kit solution (Bio-Rad, cat 171-304011) according to manufacturer's instructions. Samples were shaken for 15 minutes followed by centrifugation and the supernatant collected. For total protein content, an aliquot of supernatant was mixed with Bradford protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, cat 500-0006), added to a 96-well plate and read at 595 nm. Additional supernatant aliquots were added to a 96-well plate incubated and rinsed according to manufacturer's instructions.

Scores were averaged to obtain the overall score for each sample, and the qualitative scores were compared across TE + AM and TE + AD groups using a Mann-Whitney test. For immunochemical evaluation, cytokine concentration for each sample was normalized to the total protein concentration and results reported in picogram analyte per milligram total protein. Immunochemical testing results from all evaluable specimens dissected from the overlying subcutaneous tissues were compared between the treatment groups using a 2-way analysis of variance model, following transformation to the normal distribution for biochemical results, with group defined as a factor; significance was defined as <italic>P</italic> &#x02264; .05.

The taut nature of the skin and observed necrotic tissue overlying these 3 extruded TEs early in the experiment indicated pressure necrosis due to overinflation of these particular TEs in correspondingly tight subcutaneous pockets. These surgical sites were not included in the analysis. No other surgical sites were observed to have pressure necrosis-induced complications.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Morphology: Histology and immunohistochemistry of implanted HADM</title><p>H&#x00026;E and VVG staining confirmed the presence of both HADM types in the areas overlying the TE. There were, however, qualitative differences between the 2 groups. The soft tissue in the TE + AD group showed little to no sign of graft resorption, illustrated by an even distribution of elastin. Histology indicated the presence of fibroblasts and neovascularization within the AD graft, infiltrating from the matrix-dermis interface and not yet contacting the matrix-TE interface below, indicated by an asterisk (*) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>I. The immunohistochemistry of the soft tissue in the TE + AD group showed moderate presence of MMP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>L, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), with relatively little evidence of TIMP-1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Few &#x003b1;-SMA&#x02013;labeled myofibroblasts were seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>K), with only 1 of the 4 TE + AD sites exhibiting a single layer of &#x003b1;-SMA&#x02013;positive myofibroblasts at the TE-matrix interface (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Procollagen-1 labeling was observed within the matrix and at the periphery (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). There were few CD68-positive macrophages observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>J, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). On the contrary, the immunohistochemical profile of the soft tissue in the TE + AM group was different with regard to intensity and distribution. In 5 of 6 TE + AM implants evaluated, staining showed the presence of HADM with nonuniform thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>E), marked by thinned areas and a dense elastin fiber concentration, uncharacteristic of dermal tissue and suggesting matrix resorption. Areas of robust MMP-1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>H), coupled with moderate TIMP-1 staining provided strong evidence for a different staining pattern compared to the AD group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The &#x003b1;-SMA&#x02013;positive myofibroblasts at the TE-matrix interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>G, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) suggested the presence of robust capsule formation in the TE + AM group. Procollagen-1 staining was negligible to moderate. Overlying tissue from TE + AM capsules demonstrated areas of significant macrophage presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>F, <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>) exhibiting a synovial-like metaplasia at the TE-matrix interface.

The AM-TE interface was characterized by a localized substantial presence of CD68-positive macrophages adjacent to a continuous layer of &#x003b1;-SMA&#x02013;positive myofibroblasts, suggesting robust inflammatory and fibrotic processes potentially associated with synovial metaplasia. The staining pattern of the non&#x02013;gamma-irradiated HADM (AD) at the TE interface was quite different in that few CD68-positive macrophages were present, typical of normal wound healing, with minimal to no presence of &#x003b1;-SMA&#x02013;positive myofibroblasts. When these morphological data were analyzed in conjunction with a quantitative biochemical test, the contrast between the 2 HADMs was even more evident, with a fourfold increase in IL-6 concentration and a nearly 90% drop in out-of-package mechanical strength of the gamma-irradiated HADM over the study duration.</p><p>Detailed comparisons of ADMs have been performed,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and it is interesting to note that collagenase treatment of a gamma-irradiated scaffold led to a rapid loss in material properties (elastic modulus) compared to a non&#x02013;gamma-irradiated scaffold, despite similar out-of-package mechanical properties. It is well recognized that gamma irradiation of human collagen matrices leads to an altered collagen morphology and decreased mechanical properties<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> as well as altered hydration properties.<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> A recent in vitro study also demonstrated significant differences in the biochemical composition, thermal properties, and biomechanics of gamma-irradiated human dermal matrices in comparison to matrices treated with electron-beam irradiation with the addition of antioxidative agents, or nonirradiated matrices. The e-beam and nonirradiated tissues retained properties similar to native dermis,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> which may be important for regeneration.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Measuring the strength of the soft tissue around the TE following in vivo implantation may be an important variable, as loss of HADM thickness and decrease in mechanical properties with degradation may have led to capsule formation in the case of AM, while clinical data have indicated an increase in stiffness of capsule with contracture severity.<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It has been shown in the literature that gamma irradiation of collagen-based materials without the addition of antioxidative agents leads to collagen fragmentation and generation of free radicals, and that this effect is a function of both the dosage and the state (wet/dry, ambient/frozen) of the material at the time of treatment.<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In this study, the immunohistochemistry showed that the AM group also had robust MMP-1 staining focused around clusters of macrophages, suggesting the association of inflammation with degradation. The soft tissue around the TE + AD samples showed a different and less intense staining pattern, without a band of myofibroblasts, unlike the gamma-irradiated material (TE + AM).</p><p>Our data complement the work from previous studies reporting on the characterization of biological scaffold&#x02013;synthetic material interfaces,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> especially when AD is tested in conjunction with radiation therapy, a condition that predisposes patients to develop capsular contraction. Human acellular dermal matrix is thought to decrease radiation-induced inflammation and pseudoepithelium formation.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The authors note that failure to test HADMs in the presence of irradiation is one of the possible limitations of the current animal study. Additional studies from the literature,<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> which are not complimentary, focus solely on the in situ assessment of vascularization, rather than capsule formation. Another explanation for these differences may be the variation in animal models across studies.</p><p>Regenerative medicine focuses on replacement of dysfunctional organs or tissues with anatomically and physiologically functional tissues. Hence, it is important to assess the qualitative and quantitative features of implanted tissues. Studying the host response to ADMs by assessing markers for inflammation (CD68), fibrosis (&#x003b1;-SMA), and degradation (MMP-1) is an appropriate strategy and has been used previously when evaluating synthetic materials.<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Of the several cytokines that we evaluated in this study, only IL-6 was consistently elevated. We expected a broader cytokine footprint, such as that found in hypertrophic scarring, which has been reported to show increases in IL-1 and TNF-&#x003b1; in addition to IL-6.<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Nevertheless, we observed that HADM, when treated by gamma irradiation, leads to an inflammatory, fibrotic response that may be associated with synovial metaplasia, a feature of capsular contracture.</p><p>It should be noted that this study did not directly study capsular contracture, but rather the presence or absence of capsule at the 9-week time point. We hypothesize that the absence or delayed formation of capsule in that segment of a reconstructed breast pocket containing AD may contribute to a reduction in the rate of capsular contracture, and we believe longer-term study of this phenomenon is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="S4"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Sherrielyn Koye, Marianne Edwards, and Sean Collins for technical assistance and Peloton Advantage, LLC, Parsippany, New Jersey, for editorial assistance.</p></sec><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adams</surname><given-names>WP</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Rios</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Enhancing patient outcomes in aesthetic and reconstructive breast surgery using triple antibiotic breast irrigation: six-year prospective clinical study</article-title><source>Plast Reconstr Surg</source><year>2006</year><volume>117</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>30</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16404244</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>PR</given-names></name><name><surname>Freedman</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicolaou</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Postmastectomy chest wall radiation to a temporary tissue expander or permanent breast implant&#x02014;is there a difference in complication rates?</article-title><source>Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys</source><year>2009</year><volume>74</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>81</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18823714</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moyer</surname><given-names>KE</given-names></name><name><surname>Ehrlich</surname><given-names>HP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Capsular contracture after breast reconstruction: collagen fiber orientation and organization</article-title><source>Plast Reconstr Surg</source><year>2013</year><volume>131</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>680</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23542241</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Alderman</surname><given-names>AK</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkins</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>HM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowery</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Complications in postmastectomy breast reconstruction: two-year results of the Michigan Breast Reconstruction Outcome Study</article-title><source>Plast Reconstr Surg</source><year>2002</year><volume>109</volume><issue>7</issue><fpage>2265</fpage><lpage>74</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12045548</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cordeiro</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name><name><surname>McCarthy</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A single surgeon's 12-year experience with tissue expander/implant breast reconstruction: part I.

groups. Tissues are stained/labeled for hematoxylin and eosin (A, E, I); CD68 epitope for macrophages (B, F, J); &#x003b1;-smooth muscle cell actin (SMA) for myofibroblasts (C, G, K); and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) for matrix collagenase (D, H, I). In the TE-only group, a rim of macrophages can be detected ([, panel B) and presence of myofibroblasts ([, panel C). Tissue around the AM-covered TE had more modest macrophage presence ([, panel F); however, clusters were observed (indicated by arrowhead in F) and myofibroblast staining was strong ([, panel G). The lowest signal for macrophages and myofibroblast was noted in tissues from AD-covered TE. Excessive MMP-1 staining (D, H, L) is suggestive of accelerated ECM degradation in TE-only and clustered activity in AM (not observed in tissue from AD-covered TE).</p></caption><graphic
