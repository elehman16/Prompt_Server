Patients with the disease present with a range of symptoms, including dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). The aim of this analysis was to assess the psychometric properties of the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ), a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of dysphagia associated with EoE. Psychometric properties of the DSQ were assessed using data collected from a 12-week, phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of budesonide oral suspension in adolescents and adults (11&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years old) with EoE.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par2">The study population comprised 93 patients with EoE; 94.6% of whom were white, 68.8% were male and the mean age (standard deviation) was 21.6 (7.7) years. Patients had been diagnosed with EoE for a mean of 37.6&#x000a0;months before study initiation. The DSQ was feasible to implement with few item-level data missing at baseline. Item discrimination was high, with floor and ceiling effects below the predefined threshold (&#x02264;9%). Higher DSQ scores corresponded with presence and increased severity of dysphagia, indicative of strong item discrimination among patients at baseline (threshold &#x0003e;50%). The DSQ was able to detect changes in symptoms over time and produced similar outcomes to those from physician- and other patient-rated measures, supportive of construct validity. The DSQ had strong test&#x02013;retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, <italic>r</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.82); and was also responsive to disease-level changes, with higher DSQ scores corresponding to increased esophageal eosinophilic burden. Lastly, the percentage changes in the minimal clinically important difference and clinically important difference in DSQ score were estimated at &#x02212;27.4% and &#x02212;55.4%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par3">These analyses support the DSQ as a valid and reliable measure of dysphagia in patients with EoE. Changes in DSQ scores suggest a level of agreement between clinician, patient and histologic response. The DSQ should therefore be considered a viable PRO measure of dysphagia for use in future therapeutic studies of EoE.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Budesonide oral suspension</kwd><kwd>Dysphagia</kwd><kwd>Eosinophilic esophagitis</kwd><kwd>Minimal clinically important difference</kwd><kwd>Patient-reported outcome</kwd><kwd>Psychometric properties</kwd><kwd>Responsiveness</kwd><kwd>Validity</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Endpoint Outcomes was funded by Meritage Pharma Inc., now part of the Shire group of companies, to conduct the analysis. </institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par23">Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a relatively newly described disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and is defined as a chronic, allergen- and immune-mediated condition characterized by esophageal dysfunction with unusually high levels of eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa (&#x02265;15 eosinophils/high-power field [eos/hpf]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and food impaction are the most common symptoms in adolescents and adults presenting with EoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In children, other symptoms, such as feeding intolerance, feeding refusal, heartburn and chest pain, are more common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. With increasing EoE disease duration and age, there is a concomitant and significant increase in dysphagia symptoms, esophageal strictures and risk of food impaction requiring interventional measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A recent meta-analysis of North American and European population-based studies of patients with EoE has estimated that the prevalence and incidence of this disease has been steadily increasing over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with the healthcare-related cost of EoE estimated to be as high as $1.36 billion per annum in the USA (data collected from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">The consensus recommendations for EoE advise that topical corticosteroid therapy be considered for children and adults after initial diagnosis and for the long-term maintenance of symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; however, no therapies are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency for this indication. Budesonide oral suspension (BOS), a novel muco-adherent, topical corticosteroid formulation designed specifically for the treatment of EoE, has been shown to induce a histologic response in children with this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A recent phase 2 trial has also shown that treatment with BOS improves dysphagia, histologic and endoscopic features in adolescents and adults with EoE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01642212) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ability to accurately quantify dysphagia symptoms in patients with EoE, using a validated patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure, would aid the development of new pharmacologic agents, such as BOS, for the treatment of EoE.</p><p id="Par25">The aim of this analysis was to assess the psychometric properties of the Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (DSQ), a PRO symptom measure designed to specifically assess dysphagia frequency and severity in patients with EoE, using data from a phase 2 trial of BOS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01642212).

The lower bound of this range was selected as the minimum age at which patients would be able to self-assess dysphagia and use the DSQ. The upper bound of this range was selected because older patients are more likely to develop fibrostenotic disease, which is typically refractory to anti-inflammatory treatment. Patients participated in a 6-week screening period, during which the DSQ was completed daily on an electronic hand-held device for at least 3 out of the 6&#x000a0;weeks. Patients with sufficient dysphagia (a minimum of 4&#x000a0;days with dysphagia and &#x02265;70% compliance with the DSQ within any 2 of the first 3&#x000a0;weeks of screening) entered a 4-week, single-blind placebo run-in (baseline) period during which they received placebo twice daily and completed the DSQ once per day. The baseline period consisted of two visits: visit 1 (start of baseline period); and visit 2 (end of baseline period &#x000b1;2&#x000a0;days). Patients who fulfilled the baseline eligibility criteria were randomized 1:1 to receive BOS (2.0&#x000a0;mg/10&#x000a0;mL) or placebo (10&#x000a0;mL) twice daily for 12&#x000a0;weeks, during which they were asked to complete the DSQ once per day. The inclusion criteria for the randomized phase included histologic evidence of EoE (&#x02265;15 eos/hpf) from at least two levels of the esophagus within 10&#x000a0;weeks of the baseline period; a minimum of 4&#x000a0;days with dysphagia within 2&#x000a0;weeks of randomization; acceptable diary compliance (&#x02265;70% of days within 2&#x000a0;weeks of randomization); and &#x02265;70% compliance with placebo at randomization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire</title><p id="Par27">The DSQ was developed specifically to measure dysphagia associated with EoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The DSQ (version 4.0) uses a daily recall period and comprises three questions on the presence and severity of EoE dysphagia (questions 1&#x02013;3) (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). All patients respond to questions 1 and 2, and are required to have eaten solid foods (&#x02018;Yes&#x02019; to question 1) in order to proceed with the questionnaire. Patients who respond &#x02018;No&#x02019; to question 2 are given a score of zero, and do not go on to answer question 3 (the diary is recorded as completed for that day). Those who respond &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; to questions 1 and 2 move on to question 3, which is scored on a five-point scale that infers severity of dysphagia based on the patient&#x02019;s action to alleviate symptoms, ranging from no action to seeking medical attention. Question 1 was not included in the scoring algorithm on the severity of dysphagia, as the incidence of solid food avoidance is thought to be low in patients with EoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, if a patient answered &#x02018;No&#x02019; to question 1, the remaining items on the DSQ were not scored. Although question 1 was not scored, the proportion of patients who reported avoiding solid foods is captured in the binary response to question 1 (response&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02018;No&#x02019;). A fourth question on pain related to dysphagia was included as a standalone item on the DSQ (Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). From interviews with adolescent and adult patients with EoE, pain was not highlighted as an important symptomatic factor and question 4 was thus considered an exploratory item and not included as part of the psychometric evaluation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire (version 4.0) and score for each response option<sup>a</sup>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Other physician- and patient-rated measures of disease activity</title><p id="Par29">During the phase 2 trial, physicians were asked to complete the Physician Global Assessment (PGA) of disease activity (at the end of the baseline and treatment periods) using a visual analog scale (0&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mm; ranging from no disease activity to worst possible disease activity) to provide a global assessment of EoE activity for each patient. Scores were categorized as follows: no disease to mild disease (0&#x02013;30&#x000a0;mm); moderate disease (&#x0003e;30 to &#x02264;70&#x000a0;mm); and worst possible disease (&#x0003e;70 to &#x02264;100&#x000a0;mm). Patients were asked to complete the EoE Symptom Survey at the end of the baseline and treatment periods. The EoE Symptom Survey comprised a checklist of symptoms associated with EoE, and the options were phrased as follows: &#x02018;heartburn (burning sensation in your chest)&#x02019;; &#x02018;chest pain (not heartburn or reflux related)&#x02019;; &#x02018;regurgitation (food coming back up into your mouth without vomiting/throwing up)&#x02019;; &#x02018;abdominal (stomach) pain&#x02019;; &#x02018;nausea (feeling sick to your stomach)&#x02019;; and &#x02018;vomiting (throwing up)&#x02019;. Patients were asked to indicate, by ticking/checking, which symptoms they had experienced within the past 2&#x000a0;weeks. Patients were asked not to check symptoms that were unrelated to EoE. Patients were also asked to complete the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) survey at the end of the treatment period, in which they were asked to rate the change in their dysphagia symptoms from baseline. Responses were: much better; better; a little better; no change; a little worse; worse; or much worse. EoE is a relatively newly described disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and as such has not yet been formally assigned disease severity classifications. The above analyses are a first attempt to classify EoE disease severity using dysphagia symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Stage 1: Item analysis</title><p id="Par30">This stage of the analysis was used to examine the quality of completion (patient compliance with the DSQ), item distribution (floor and ceiling effects) and item discrimination. The choice of constructs was limited by the data that were collected for this analysis. Quality of completion was monitored to measure patient compliance. Item-level and patient-level missing data are reported; instances of missing data exceeding 10% during each 14-day period during baseline and treatment intervals were investigated for item-wise quality of completion. Item-level missing data were treated as a random effect for each of the measures and an additional pattern analysis conducted, to identify patterns of missing data. Patient-level missing data were used to record the proportion of patients with at least one missing item over the course of the study. Floor and ceiling effects were considered to be acceptable if the upper limit of missing data for randomized patients, for either the lowest or highest possible score for question 3, did not exceed 9%. To evaluate individual item performance on the DSQ, an item discrimination index was calculated by categorizing patient responses during the last 14&#x000a0;days of the baseline period into the lower (25th percentile) and higher (75th percentile) ranges of dysphagia frequency and severity. Based on the 25th and 75th percentile distributions of the DSQ domain score, patients were assigned into three groups: patients who had high (&#x0003e;75th percentile), moderate (25th to 75th percentile) or low (&#x0003c;25th percentile) DSQ scores. Patients&#x02019; actions to alleviate dysphagia symptoms (question 3) were also categorized into three groups: no action taken (answer option 1), moderate action taken (answer options 2&#x02013;4) and extreme action taken (answer option 5). The proportion of patients in each of these three categories who endorsed each item was also recorded. The threshold for acceptability for item discrimination was set at &#x0003e;50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Stage 2: Psychometric evaluation</title><p id="Par31">This stage of the analysis was used to assess the construct validity, reliability and responsiveness of the DSQ. The subsequent results were used to provide recommendations for interpretability thresholds for minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs)/clinically important differences (CIDs).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Construct validity</title><p id="Par32">Construct (concurrent) validity was assessed to determine if items within the DSQ conformed to previous knowledge of relationships between dysphagia severity and other clinical measures. Concurrent validity was measured by assessing the correlation between DSQ score and scores from the PGA of disease activity, a conceptually similar outcome measure. An additional analysis was performed to examine the relationship between DSQ score and esophageal peak eosinophil count (eos/hpf). Correlation coefficient thresholds were set at between 0.4 and 0.7, and below 0.4 for the PGA of disease activity and eosinophil count analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], respectively. The hypothesis was that the correlation between DSQ score and PGA of disease activity response would be moderate (&#x0003e;0.4). In contrast, correlation between DSQ score and peak eosinophil count (histologic response) was expected to be low (&#x0003c;0.4), owing to the potential time delay between histologic response and symptom improvement. These analyses were conducted using data collected from the last 14&#x000a0;days of the baseline period. For the known-groups method, DSQ scores were compared with categorical responses from the PGA of disease activity and from the EoE Symptom Survey. The EoE Symptom Survey was included to assess change in the other, less common symptoms of EoE over the 12-week treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Test&#x02212;retest reliability</title><p id="Par33">The reliability of the DSQ was examined in patients who reported no change or minimal change in dysphagia symptoms on the PGIC survey. Patients were included if they completed the PGIC survey at the end of the treatment period (or earlier for patients who withdrew from the study) and recorded no change/minimal change in dysphagia symptoms. This analysis was performed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), calculated using Shrout&#x02013;Fleiss reliability for a single score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].

During this period, there were 238 instances where patients with dysphagia reported that it got better or cleared up on its own (question 2: &#x02018;Yes&#x02019;; question 3: response option 1); and 401 instances where patients with dysphagia reported that they had to drink liquid to get relief (question 2: &#x02018;Yes&#x02019;; question 3: response option 2).

Lastly, there was only one instance where a patient with dysphagia reported that they had sought medical attention to get relief (question 2: &#x02018;Yes&#x02019;; question 3: response option 5) (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).</p><p id="Par43">The DSQ measured the full range of dysphagia symptoms experienced by patients, with floor and ceiling effects below the pre-defined threshold (&#x02264;9%) at baseline (visit 2) (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). However, by the end of the treatment period (week 12) the proportion of patients selecting the lowest DSQ scores had increased (54.8%); ceiling responses nonetheless remained below the threshold (8.3%). Overall, there was strong item discrimination among patients. Patients with more frequent dysphagia (question 2: &#x02018;Yes&#x02019;) (98.1%) during baseline (visit 2) reported within the highest (worst) range of DSQ scores (upper 25%) exceeding the &#x0003e;60% threshold for acceptability (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Similarly, patients who answered &#x02018;Yes&#x02019; for question 2 were more likely to select the middle range of &#x02018;symptom alleviation methods/moderate action&#x02019; (93.4%) for question 3, with only one patient selecting the highest category for this item (Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>).

This is below the predefined acceptability threshold (0.4&#x02013;0.7). The known-groups method was also used to assess the construct validity of the DSQ, by comparing groups of patients who were categorized based on their EoE Symptom Survey and PGA of disease activity data (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). At baseline (visit 2), patients with heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation, nausea or vomiting had significantly higher (worse) mean DSQ scores than patients without these symptoms (all <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Similarly, at baseline (visit 2), patients who scored lowest (&#x02018;none to mild disease&#x02019;) on the PGA of disease activity also had the lowest mean DSQ scores (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par48">EoE is a chronic disease characterized by eosinophil-induced inflammation and symptoms of esophageal dysfunction, including dysphagia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. EoE is a relatively newly described disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and as such, has not yet been assigned disease severity classifications. There are currently no approved drugs indicated for EoE; however, treatment with a newly developed formulation of budesonide (BOS) has been shown to result in histologic improvements in pediatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and histologic, endoscopic and symptom improvements in adolescents and adults with this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The primary objective of this analysis was to assess the psychometric properties of the DSQ, a PRO measure of dysphagia in patients with EoE, using data collected from a 12-week, phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of BOS in adolescents and adults with EoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">Item characteristics showed that the DSQ measured the full range of dysphagia symptoms experienced by patients at baseline, with floor and ceiling effects below the predefined threshold, reflecting a high level of sensitivity. The proportion of patients with the lowest DSQ scores increased by week 12, indicative of an improvement in symptoms over time for all patients. Results from the DSQ were also consistent with data collected from a range of physician- and other patient-reported outcome measures (PGA of disease activity, EoE Symptom Survey and PGIC), providing evidence of good construct validity. The test&#x02013;retest analysis highlighted that DSQ scores were consistent over time for patients who reported no change or minimal change in dysphagia symptoms. Similarly, patients who had a histologic response (&#x02264;6 eos/hpf) also reported a greater improvement in DSQ score (large SES; &#x02265;0.80), compared with those who had a weaker histologic response (&#x0003e;6 eos/hpf; moderate SES; &#x02265;0.50 to &#x0003c;0.80). These findings support the DSQ as a reliable measure of dysphagia in adolescents and adults with EoE.</p><p id="Par50">A weak but positive association was observed between the change in DSQ score and peak eosinophil counts in the esophageal mucosa at the end of treatment. This was not unexpected; a number of previous studies of EoE have reported a lack of correlation between histologic findings and symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This may be explained by a potential time delay between histologic improvement and symptom improvement after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, the magnitude of improvement in eosinophil density from baseline was not used for this analysis. Instead, the final absolute peak eosinophil count was described using the &#x0003e;6 eos/hpf and &#x02264;6 eos/hpf cut-offs at the end of treatment. This may have also contributed to the weak association observed between change in DSQ score and peak eosinophil counts at the end of the study.</p><p id="Par51">Using distribution-based methods, the absolute and percentage MID in DSQ score were estimated at 7.4 points and 8.9%, respectively. Using anchor-based methods, the MCID and CID in DSQ score (absolute change) were estimated to be &#x02212;6.5 points and &#x02212;13.5 points, respectively. The MCID and CID (percentage change) in DSQ score were estimated to be &#x02212;27.4% and &#x02212;55.4%, respectively. Percentage change in MCID and CID enable the comparison of data from different studies, in which baseline DSQ scores for the study populations may differ. These findings support the use of distribution- and anchor-based methods for the psychometric evaluation of the DSQ.</p><p id="Par52">Despite the increasing prevalence of EoE worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], there have been very few randomized, controlled studies examining this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The development of PRO measures for use in future studies of EoE would assist in the evaluation of new therapies. A number of other Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs) are available or in development, including the Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire-30&#x000a0;Day (MDQ-30) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the Pediatric EoE Symptom Score (PEESS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] with the EoE-specific disease module (PedsQL EoE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the Esophageal Symptom Questionnaire (ESQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and the Adult EoE Quality of Life questionnaire (EoE-QoL-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the MDQ-30, to our knowledge, has not been validated among patients with EoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and the other COAs specifically target either children or adults, respectively, and focus on a range of symptoms. The DSQ (version 4.0) therefore represents the first daily symptom diary to undergo structured psychometric validation specifically for EoE in both adolescents and adults with this disease.</p><p id="Par53">The DSQ (version 4.0) has several strengths over other tools. First, the DSQ was designed and evaluated in accordance with current US FDA guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], with the aim of developing a valid symptom measure for use in clinical trials. The DSQ also uses a daily recall period, allowing patients to remember and record their symptoms more clearly, rather than relying on longer recall periods. This short recall period was previously assessed and considered appropriate for this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A short recall period is particularly useful for diseases in which symptoms can fluctuate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Lastly, the DSQ is a disease-specific symptom measure developed to assess the most common symptom of EoE experienced by adult patients &#x02013; dysphagia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], while other PRO measures attempt to consider a broader range of symptoms for EoE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Dysphagia was selected as the primary symptom measure based on a literature review, previous trials, existing symptom instruments, expert opinion and patient interviews, as part of the conceptual framework development (content validation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. More recently, clinical features (e.g. peak eosinophil counts and eosinophil peroxidase levels) and gene expression profiles associated with EoE have been shown to correlate most strongly with dysphagia, as opposed to other symptoms, such as nausea/vomiting or pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">With regard to limitations, levels of non-compliance with the DSQ (missing data) increased towards the end of the study (week 12); however, attempts were made to limit this by excluding patients who were highly non-compliant during the screening period. In addition, alerts were sent, in a blinded fashion, to center personnel at sites where consecutive non-compliance events were detected. Owing to the high level of patients missing at least one day during the data collection weeks, patient training should be enhanced in order to increase DSQ compliance rates for future studies. The handling of item-level missing data is a focus of statistical consideration in clinical trial analyses; in this study, item-level missing data were treated as a random effect for each of the measures and an additional pattern analysis was conducted, to account for this effect. The lack of reliable, objective clinical anchors for EoE was another limitation, which could have potentially introduced variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]; however, this analysis used recognized patient- and physician-rated measures of disease severity (PGIC and PGA, respectively) as anchors in this study. Lastly, in establishing patient selection and eligibility criteria for this randomized controlled trial, the randomized population may not represent the entire EoE population. Nevertheless, this group had similar demographic characteristics and the principle EoE symptom of dysphagia to those from a natural history study and are therefore representative of those real-life patients who may seek therapeutic treatment for their EoE symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par55">The DSQ was able to reliably discriminate between levels of disease severity in patients with EoE, using dysphagia as the primary symptom measure. The DSQ also offered an acceptable level of agreement between clinician, patient and histologic responses. In summary, the DSQ has been shown to have good construct validity and to reliably measure frequency and severity of dysphagia. The DSQ should therefore be considered as a viable PRO measure for use in future therapeutic studies of EoE.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BOS</term><def><p id="Par4">Budesonide oral suspension</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CID</term><def><p id="Par5">Clinically important difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COA</term><def><p id="Par6">Clinical Outcome Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSQ</term><def><p id="Par7">Dysphagia Symptom Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EoE Symptom Survey</term><def><p id="Par8">Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EoE-QoL-A</term><def><p id="Par9">Adult Eosinophilic Esophagitis Quality of Life questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ESQ</term><def><p id="Par10">Esophageal Symptom Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA</term><def><p id="Par11">Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hpf</term><def><p id="Par12">High-power field</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICC</term><def><p id="Par13">Intra-class correlation coefficient</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCID</term><def><p id="Par14">Minimal clinically important difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDQ-30</term><def><p id="Par15">Mayo Dysphagia Questionnaire-30 Day</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MID</term><def><p id="Par16">Minimally important difference</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PedsQL</term><def><p id="Par17">Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PedsQL EoE</term><def><p id="Par18">Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory with the Eosinophilic Esophagitis-specific disease module</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEESS</term><def><p id="Par19">Pediatric Eosinophilic Esophagitis Symptom Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGA</term><def><p id="Par20">Physician Global Assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PGIC</term><def><p id="Par21">Patient Global Impression of Change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PRO</term><def><p id="Par22">Patient-reported outcome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par223">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p id="Par224">Standardized effect size</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>Medical writing support was provided by Luci Witcomb PhD, of PharmaGenesis London, London, UK, funded by Shire International GmbH.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par56">SH was funded by Endpoint Outcomes to conduct the analysis.
