An effective medical treatment option may reduce hysterectomy associated morbidity. This study was undertaken to evaluate efficacy and safety of low dose mifepristone in medical management of myoma and to compare two doses - 10 vs. 25 mg/day.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized clinical trial, women with symptomatic myoma or myoma&#x0003e;5cm were included. Uterine size &#x0003e;20 wk, fibroids &#x0003e;15 cm were excluded. Pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) score was used to assess menstrual-blood-loss and visual analog scale (VAS) for other symptoms. Haemogram, liver function test, ultrasound with doppler and endometrial histology was performed. Patients were randomized and were given oral mifepristone as 25 mg/day in group 1 and 10 mg/day in group 2 for 3 months. Patients were followed at 1, 3 and 6 months.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Seventy patients in group 1 and 73 in group 2 completed treatment. Mean PBAC score reduced from 253 to 19.8 and from 289.2 to 10.4 at 1 and 3 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively. At 3 months, 67 of 70 (95.7%) patients of group 1 and 66 of 73 (90.4%) of group 2 developed amenorrhoea which reverted after median 34 (range 4-85) days. Mean myoma volume decreased by 35.7 per cent (from 176.8 to 113.7cm<sup>3</sup>) and 22.5 per cent (from 147.6 to 114.4 cm<sup>3</sup>) at 3 months in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Side effects seen were leg cramps in 7 of 70 (10%) and 5 of 73 (6.8%) and hot-flushes in 5 of 70 (7.1%) and 5 of 73 (6.8%) in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Repeat endometrial-histopathology did not reveal any complex hyperplasia or atypia in either group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Interpretation &#x00026; conclusions:</title><p>Mifepristone (10 and 25 mg) caused symptomatic relief with more than 90 per cent reduction in menstrual blood. Greater myoma size reduction occured with 25 mg dose. Amenorrhoea was developed in 90-95 per cent patients which was reversible. It can be a reasonable choice for management of uterine leiomyoma as it is administered orally, cost-effective and has mild side effects.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Amenorrhoea</kwd><kwd>fibroid</kwd><kwd>leiomyoma</kwd><kwd>mifepristone</kwd><kwd>medical management</kwd><kwd>uterine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Uterine leiomyoma are commonest benign gynaecological tumours occurring in up to 25 per cent of women in reproductive age and about 40 per cent have symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>. The definitive treatment for symptomatic myomas has always been surgical and myomas account for up to 40 per cent of all hysterectomies in premenopausal women<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>.</p><p>Non surgical treatment options for symptomatic myomas have limitations. Danazol reduces uterine volume by 18-23 per cent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, but is associated with marked androgenic side-effects and liver dysfunction. Gonadotrophin releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) reduces leiomyoma size to about 50 per cent in three months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref> but is expensive, has to be given parenterally and is also associated with hypoestrogenism leading to hot flushes, vaginal dryness and bone loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>. Cessation of GnRH causes regrowth of myoma and recurrence of symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>. Uterine artery embolization has been shown to decrease leiomyoma size by 35-69 per cent, improve menorrhagia and reduce pain, but there are potential risks of premature ovarian failure and uterine synechia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>.</p><p>Although the traditional concept supports a crucial role of oestrogen in promoting leiomyoma growth, recent evidence suggests that progesterone is essential for maintenance and growth of uterine leiomyoma and that oestrogen is required only for upregulation of progesterone receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>. Hence, there was a surge of studies evaluating effect of antiprogestogens like ulipristal (PEARL Study), asoprisnil, and CDB-2914, a progesterone receptor modulator, in non surgical treatment of uterine myomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>.</p><p>Mifepristone (RU 486) is a progesterone receptor modulator with primarily antagonistic properties. It binds strongly to endometrial progesterone receptors, minimally to estrogen receptors and upregulates androgen receptors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>. In a placebo controlled trial low dose mifepristone (RU 486) has been shown to decrease myoma size as well as symptoms<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>. Reduction in size with mifepristone might be due to the direct effect in reducing number of progesterone receptors. Besides, because of ovarian acyclicity seen with mifepristone, hormonal milieu similar to early follicular phase may also inhibit steroid dependent growth of myoma. Increase in androgen receptors also contributes to antiproliferative effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>. Mifepristone also delays or inhibits ovulation, which may produce amenorrhoea. Direct suppressive effects on endometrial vasculature as well as on reducing stromal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has also been suggested for reducing menstrual blood loss<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>.</p><p>GnRH analogues are a well established option for medical management of myomas, but their use is not widespread. Mifepristone, on the other hand, is administered orally, has a few side effects and is less expensive than GnRH analogues. If proved to be an effective medical treatment option for uterine myoma, it may be a cost-effective substitute for GnRH analogues in low-resource settings. The initial studies with mifepristone suggested lesser efficacy with doses &#x0003c;10 mg and also concluded that an effective dose to cause a clinically significant (50%) decrease in leiomyoma volume was 25 mg daily<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>.</p><p>Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate efficacy and safety of mifepristone in medical management of uterine leiomyoma in Indian women and to compare two doses -10 vs. 25 mg per day.</p><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Material &#x00026; Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 2007 to February 2010, at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India, after obtaining ethical clearance from the Institute's Ethics Committee. The study was registered in Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2012/03/002470). Women between 20-50 yr of age with single or multiple fibroids were included consecutively in the study if they were symptomatic (menorrhagia, dysmenorrhoea, abdominal lump, dull aching lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia) or if the largest fibroid was &#x0003e;5 cm on ultrasound. Ultrasound pelvis was done for all patients to exclude any other obvious causes like adenomyosis, endometriosis, adnexal mass for the above symptoms. Exclusion criteria remained more than 20 wk gravid size uterus, fibroids &#x0003e;15 cm by ultrasound, grade-0 submucosal fibroids, renal or hepatic dysfunction, suspected adenomyosis, current genital infection, endometrial hyperplasia with atypia and hormonal medication (Progestogens/ GnRH) within 3 months and women desiring pregnancy.</p><p>Demographic and baseline clinical profile including details of menstrual cycle, symptoms and their severity was noted. Menstrual blood loss was assessed by pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBAC) scores<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, which is a semiquantitative assessment that takes into account the number of pads soaked, their degree of soakage, passage of clots and episodes of flooding<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>. A score of 100 or more amounts to menorrhagia. Visual analog scale (VAS) score was noted for pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain and pressure symptoms, where patients were asked to describe their pain on a scale of 0 to 10, before and after the treatment, with &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; taken at zero and &#x0201c;worst possible pain&#x0201d; at 10.</p><p>A complete general and gynaecological examination was done. Blood testing was done for haemoglobin, liver and kidney function tests and serum oestradiol levels. Ultrasound was done to confirm the diagnosis of leiomyomas as well as to ascertain number, site, volume of myomas, to measure endometrial thickness and to rule out any other pelvic pathology. Volume of each myoma was calculated and added in cases with multiple myomas. Fibroid volume was calculated by the ellipsoid method and the formula V=0.5233(D1&#x000d7;D2&#x000d7;D3) was used, where D1, D2 and D3 are the longitudinal, transverse and cross-sectional diameters of the fibroid, respectively. In multiple myomas, volumes of all myomas were added. Doppler ultrasound was done and blood flow noted in terms of uterine artery resistive-index (RI) and pulsatility-index (PI). Hysteroscopy was performed when endometrial polyp or submucosal myomas were suspected. Endometrial aspiration was performed to rule out any abnormal histopathology in married women and in unmarried women when required on the basis of increased endometrial thickness on ultrasound.</p><p>To detect a difference of 15 per cent between the two doses, taking P1 as 100 per cent for 25 mg/day dosage and P2 as 85 per cent for 10 mg/day dosage; thus taking Alpha=5 per cent and Beta=10 per cent, the sample size for each group was calculated to be 76 patients. Hence, 150 women meeting the inclusion criteria were recruited in the study after taking informed written consent. Patients were randomized into two groups according to computerized randomization. Mifepristone was given as 25 mg/day in group 1 and as 10 mg/day in group 2, starting initially from day 2-3 of periods. Duration of treatment was 3 months.</p><p>Since mifepristone is available in India for indication of medical abortion as 200 mg tablet, capsules of 10 and 25 mg were prepared from 200 mg tablet in the Pharmacology department by crushing the tablets in powder form, and then filling the capsules according to the weight. Capsules of 10 and 25 mg could be prepared from 200 mg tablet without adding inert substance.</p><p>Patients were followed up at 1 and 3 months while on therapy and then at 6 months <italic>i.e</italic>. 3 months after stopping therapy to look for recurrence of symptoms or regrowth of fibroid. On each visit clinical symptoms including bleeding and spotting, PBAC score, VAS score and any side effects were assessed. Amenorrhoea was defined as the absence of bleeding for two consecutive cycles. Ultrasound was done to determine the number of myoma and endometrial thickness.</p><p>At 3 months follow up; haemoglobin, liver function test (serum bilirubin, serum total proteins/albumin/globulin, serum transaminases) and serum oestradiol were repeated. Ultrasound with uterine artery Doppler was also done to determine volume reduction and change in blood flow. Repeat endometrial aspiration was done after completing 3 months of treatment except in unmarried patients and in patients not giving consent for repeat test.</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc., USA) was used for data analysis. Friedman test was used for assessing overall effect within the groups. Comparisons of various parameters within the group were done with Wilcoxon signed ranks test with Bonferoni correction. Wilcoxon rank sum test or t test was used for comparison between the groups at baseline and various follow ups, as applicable, as per the normality of data. <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05 was taken as significant.

This is also highlighted in other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>.</p><p>Mifepristone is well tolerated drug with no serious adverse effects<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>. Biochemical hypothyroidism has been reported with chronic administration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>. Common side effects reported are mild hot flushes seen in 10-38 per cent patients with no correlation to dose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>, fatigue in 8-12 per cent, and increase in liver transaminases in 4-7 per cent. In our study, only one patient discontinued treatment within one week due to allergic reaction, other side effects seen were mild.</p><p>In all previous studies with low dose mifepristone, there was a concern of endometrial hyperplasia which was documented in 28 per cent cases treated with 5-10 mg mifepristone for six months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>, which decreased to 14 per cent when reviewed, as many of the hyperplasias were actually cystic glandular dilatation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>. The endometrial changes specific to progesterone receptor modulators have been now designated as progesterone receptor modulator- associated endometrial changes (PAEC) which include cystic dilatation of glands with mixed oestrogenic (mitotic) and progestogenic (secretory) features, non-synchronous endometrium, pseudostratification of epithelium, pseudo-decidualized stroma, abnormal, dilated thin blood vessels with no evidence of atypical hyperplasia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>. Despite paucity of mitoses, PAEC may be mistaken for endometrial hyperplasia. In our study, endometrial histology at the end of therapy did not show any complex hyperplasia or atypia.</p><p>None of the patients in the present study had heavy bleeding during therapy. In a one-year study, no severe bleeding was reported during treatment<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>. Bagaria <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> suggested starting mifepristone from day 1-3 in early follicular phase so that it starts acting before the development of dominant follicle otherwise, it leads to collapse of dominant follicle and withdrawl bleeding.</p><p>In a six months study with 2.5 mg daily mifepristone, there was no further reduction in uterine volume or relief in menorrhagia after 3 months. Amenorrhoea rates reduced from 65 per cent at three months to 32 per cent at six months<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>. In another study of 12 months duration, no further volume reduction was seen after six months and increased rates of breakthrough bleeding or spotting was reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>. Besides, intermittent administration has been suggested for long term mifepristone use, with treatment duration of 3-4 months followed by an off-drug interval till menstruation occurred<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>. Though it is now known that endometrial thickening with more than three months treatment is due to cystic dilatation and not due to hyperplasia, yet intermittent therapy would be more reassuring to the treating clinicians.</p><p>The strengths of our study were adequate sample size for statistically valid results and inclusion of Doppler parameters. Limitations of the study were not using PAEC to classify endometrial histopathology.</p><p>In future, studies may be planned to assess effect of preoperative mifepristone on surgical planes and ease of surgery, degeneration of myomas and blood loss.</p><p>In conclusion, our results showed that mifepristone (10 and 25 mg) led to symptomatic relief in patients with myoma with more than 90 per cent reduction in menstrual blood loss. However, 25 mg dose had significantly greater reduction in overall myoma size as well as in multiple myomas. Endometrial changes specific to progesterone receptor modulator occured but there was no evidence of atypia. Amenorrhoea developed in 90-95 per cent patients which was reversible. Mifepristone can be a reasonable choice especially in perimenopausal women in whom myomas would regress after menopause and unmarried patients who want to avoid surgery. Although its use as a primary medical therapy is limited due to recurrence after stopping treatment, it can be used as a preoperative adjunct, especially in patients with pre-operative severe anaemia, large fibroids, where surgery is technically difficult or where leiomyoma are unresectable. In addition, some women undergoing hysterectomy will benefit from a less invasive vaginal rather than an abdominal procedure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Authors acknowledge the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi, for funding this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold><italic>Conflict of interests</italic></bold>: Last author (JT) is presently working as Assistant Editor of IJMR.
