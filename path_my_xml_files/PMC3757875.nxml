The most important goal of periodontal therapy is to reduce or eliminate the sub gingival microorganisms, which cause the periodontal disease to maintain periodontal health and if possible to regenerate the lost tissues. Scaling and root planning (SRP) is considered as a gold standard to attain and maintain periodontal health by elimination of bacterial plaque. As the probing depth increases, the effectiveness of SRP decreases because of limited access to deep pockets, which leads to incomplete removal of periodontopathogens.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Due to the infective nature of periodontal disease, several antimicrobial agents, which are delivered by rinsing, irrigation, systemic administration, and local devices, have been used to overcome the limited efficacy of conventional treatment of periodontitis. The inherent limitations of systemic and topical chemotherapeutics led to the development of local drug delivery systems. Targeting the antimicrobial agent directly to the infected site and maintaining effective levels for a sufficient time are necessary for successful treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] This approach also addresses the critical concerns of unnecessarily exposing the patient to large amounts of systemic antibiotics, which can result in bacterial resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine (CHX) has long been known as an effective antimicrobial agent and has been used as a topical antiseptic for over 30 years. Its efficacy as a topical mouth rinse to inhibit dental plaque and gingivitis has been well established and demonstrated in study periods for two years without evidence of the development of any bacterial resistance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] It is a bisbiguanide antiseptic and antimicrobial agent, which is used as a locally applied slow release drug delivery system available in the form of gel, varnish, chip, etc.</p><p>To enhance the efficacy of non-surgical therapy a chemo-mechanical treatment concept was introduced based on sequential SRP and the adjunctive subgingival administration of 35% CHX varnish[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and subgingival placement of a biodegradable CHX chip,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] which biodegrades and releases CHX within the pocket over 7-10 days maintaining an average concentration in the GCF greater than 12 mg/ml for 8 days.</p><p>The objectives of this study were to clinically evaluate the use of CHX varnish and biodegradable CHX chip when used as an adjunct to SRP (combined therapy) and also to compare the combined therapy with SRP alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Experimental design</title><p>A total of 15 patients (7 males and 8 females) aged 35-55 years reporting to the Department of Periodontics and Implantology, Coorg Institute of Dental Sciences, Virajpet, Coorg were recruited for the study.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

The results obtained between all the three groups were similar.</p><p>The present study indicated that application of CHX varnish and placement of CHX chip as an adjunct to SRP produced a clinically significant reduction in the PPD, BOP and a gain in CAL at 30<sup>th</sup> day and 90<sup>th</sup> day from baseline when compared to SRP alone though the results were not statistically significant. The limitations of this study could be a smaller sample size over a shorter period and single application/insertion of the varnish/chip.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the findings of this study, CHX varnish (EC40) and CHX chip (Periochip) did provide clinically significant benefits beyond that achieved with conventional SRP after a 3 month period, but the difference was not statistically significant. Long-term studies with a larger sample size and multiple application/insertion are required to determine the potential use of these drugs as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil,</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buchanan</surname><given-names>SA</given-names></name><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>PB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Calculus removal by scaling/root planing with and without surgical access</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1987</year><volume>58</volume><fpage>159</fpage><lpage>63</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3550036</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jeffcoat</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Bray</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ciancio</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Dentino</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name><name><surname>Fine</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordon</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Adjunctive use of a subgingival controlled-release chlorhexidine chip reduces probing depth and improves attachment level compared with scaling and root planing alone</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>1998</year><volume>69</volume><fpage>989</fpage><lpage>97</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9776027</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Heasman</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Heasman</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Stacey</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Mc Cracken</surname><given-names>GI</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Local delivery of chlorhexidine gluconate (PerioChip) in periodontal maintenance patients</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>2001</year><volume>28</volume><fpage>90</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11142674</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Seymour</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Heasman</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Textbook of Drugs, Diseases and the Periodontium</article-title><source>A Modern Clinical Picture</source><year>2009</year><edition>1st ed</edition><issue>Ch. 3</issue><fpage>38</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cosyn</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Wyn</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>De Rouck</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabzevar</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Subgingival chlorhexidine varnish administration as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing.
