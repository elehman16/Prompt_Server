The comparators were such that pooling of the data was not considered appropriate. The last pre-randomisation drug blood eosinophil level was used to dichotomise study participants according to blood eosinophil level of &#x0003c;2% vs &#x02265;2%. In an additional preplanned analysis, an absolute eosinophil count of 200/mm<sup>3</sup> was used to dichotomise the data. A post hoc analysis of a 3% cut-off level was also carried out. The main outcome of interest was moderate/severe exacerbation rate (&#x02265;1-year studies only). Time to first moderate/severe exacerbation, change from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub>, rate of decline in FEV<sub>1</sub> (TRISTAN and INSPIRE only), and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score were analysed, data permitting. Weighted mean FEV<sub>1</sub> over the study period was analysed to provide a single on-treatment assessment (post hoc to the analysis plan). The primary treatment comparisons of interest were FP/SAL versus non-ICS comparators (SAL, tiotropium or placebo) and FP versus placebo. SAL versus placebo and FP/SAL versus FP were examined, but were not predefined comparisons of interest.</p><p>Moderate/severe exacerbation rates were analysed, for studies of &#x02265;1&#x02005;year in duration, using a negative binomial model, with number of recorded on-treatment moderate/severe exacerbations per patient as the response variable. Explanatory variables were treatment group, sex, % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> at baseline, frequency of prior exacerbations (0 (SCO30002 only), 1, &#x02265;2) within the past year (data not available for TRISTAN), eosinophil subgroup, and eosinophil subgroup by treatment interaction. Log treatment exposure per patient was included as an offset variable. Point estimates and 95% CI for treatment differences were obtained for treatment comparisons of interest. A post hoc analysis of rate of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids or antibiotics by eosinophil level was carried out.</p><p>Analysis of time to first moderate/severe exacerbation was performed using a Cox's proportional hazards model including covariates for treatment group, sex, % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> at baseline, frequency of prior exacerbations (INSPIRE, SCO30002, SCO100470), eosinophil subgroup, and eosinophil subgroup by treatment interaction. HRs for treatment comparisons of interest were calculated together with associated 95% CI and p values. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival probability estimates were calculated for each treatment and eosinophil subgroup.</p><p>FEV<sub>1</sub> was analysed using data as collected in each study: trough (INSPIRE, SCO100470), pre-bronchodilator (SFCB3024; SCO30002), post-bronchodilator (TRISTAN) and pre-dose (SFCA3006, SFCA3007). Weighted mean FEV<sub>1</sub> over the duration of the study was derived from available data by calculating the area under the curve using the trapezoidal rule. Treatment differences in weighted mean FEV<sub>1</sub> were analysed using an analysis of covariance with covariates of age, sex, baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, treatment group, eosinophil subgroup, and treatment group by eosinophil subgroup interaction. Point estimates and 95% CIs of difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> were obtained for treatment comparisons of interest.</p><p>SGRQ data were analysed using mixed model repeated measures including covariates of age, sex, baseline SGRQ, treatment group, eosinophil group, nominal day, and pairwise interactions of day by baseline, eosinophil group and treatment group, and the three-way interaction of day by treatment by eosinophil. Point estimates and 95% CIs were calculated for treatment comparisons of interest at each nominal day.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using the Harmonisation of Analysis &#x00026; Reporting Program (HARP) system (GSK, Harlow, UK) using SAS V.9.1.3 or later.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patient demographics and baseline characteristics</title><p>COPD patient demographics were generally similar across the three &#x02265;1-year studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015207021TB1">tables 1</xref><xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015207021TB2"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="THORAXJNL2015207021TB3">3</xref>), although patients in INSPIRE had a lower post-bronchodilator % predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>.

Similarly, for the two &#x02265;1-year studies for which change from baseline SGRQ data was analysed, there were no treatment differences for FP/SAL versus any comparator in change from baseline SGRQ score in either eosinophil subgroup (see online supplementary figure S8).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Reversibility</title><p>No relationship between bronchodilator reversibility and eosinophil level was observed (see online supplementary figure S9).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Safety</title><p>The incidence of pneumonia in the six studies did not appear to have any clear relationship with eosinophil level (&#x0003c;2% vs &#x02265;2%) (see online supplementary figure S10).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We examined blood eosinophil levels as a potential biomarker for reduction in exacerbation frequency with ICS/LABA versus LAMA or placebo using data from six randomised, controlled trials of FP/SAL in patients with COPD, including three that followed patients for at least 1&#x02005;year. The 2% threshold for high versus low blood eosinophil level (at baseline) was chosen for consistency with previous studies.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The results of all studies were consistent with the hypothesis that there is a greater reduction in exacerbation rate with ICS/LABA, compared with placebo or LAMA, in individuals with a pretreatment blood eosinophil level &#x02265;2%.</p><p>The proportion of patients with a pretreatment eosinophil level &#x02265;2% was 50&#x02013;75% across all six studies. All studies recruited patients with well-defined COPD with a smoking history averaging approximately 40 pack-years, so the inadvertent inclusion of patients with asthma is unlikely to account for any variation in baseline eosinophil levels. In TRISTAN, which had the highest proportion of patients with elevated eosinophils, the majority of patients (88%) were not atopic in either subgroup. Most clinical characteristics, such as age, sex, smoking history and baseline lung function, showed no discernible differences between those with a pretreatment eosinophil level of &#x0003c;2% vs &#x02265;2%; however, there was a slightly higher proportion of current smokers in the &#x0003c;2% vs &#x02265;2% subgroup across all six studies.</p><p>Analysis of data from the 2-year INSPIRE study was indicative of greater efficacy with twice-daily FP/SAL 500/50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g (vs tiotropium) in reducing the rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in patients with blood eosinophils &#x02265;2% vs &#x0003c;2% (both with and without including prior exacerbations as a covariate (1, &#x02265;2)). In the 1-year TRISTAN study, FP/SAL 500/50&#x02009;&#x003bc;g was more effective (vs placebo) in reducing the rate of moderate/severe exacerbations in patients with blood eosinophils &#x02265;2% vs &#x0003c;2%. In TRISTAN, FP and SAL alone were significantly more effective than placebo in the &#x02265;2% group, but not in the &#x0003c;2% group. Stratification by blood eosinophil level &#x02265;3% vs &#x0003c;3% showed similar trends for TRISTAN. However, for INSPIRE, differences were smaller in magnitude. This result may be due to the imbalance in exacerbation history between the tiotropium and FP/SAL groups, which makes interpretation difficult despite correction for this in the analysis. These findings are consistent with another recent retrospective study in which data from two parallel randomised trials of FF/VI, once-daily ICS/LABA, in 3177 patients with moderate-to-severe COPD and a 1-year history of exacerbation<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> were reanalysed according to eosinophil count, using the same 2% threshold as in the present study.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Across all FF/VI doses, FF/VI reduced exacerbation rates by 29% compared with VI alone (p&#x0003c;0.001) in patients with &#x02265;2% eosinophils, and by 10% (p=0.283) in patients with &#x0003c;2% eosinophils.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The findings with ICS or ICS/LABA across our studies appear to be consistent, the only exception being in the TRISTAN study, in which the observation of reduced exacerbation rates in patients with &#x02265;2% blood eosinophils receiving SAL alone versus placebo was unexpected. Unfortunately, there is no other trial measuring blood eosinophils with a LABA-only group of sufficient size and duration to corroborate this finding.</p><p>When exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids were considered, reductions were seen for FP/SAL versus placebo in patients with low and high eosinophil levels, but the magnitude of reduction was greater in the &#x02265;2% group in TRISTAN. In INSPIRE, reductions in exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids for FP/SAL versus tiotropium were only seen in the &#x02265;2% group. For exacerbations requiring antibiotics in INSPIRE, tiotropium was favoured over FP/SAL in the &#x0003c;2% group (in the &#x02265;2% group there was no evidence of a difference between treatments).</p><p>Analysis of the SCO30002 study did not show any significant relationship between pretreatment blood eosinophil levels and treatment. With a sample size less than one-third that of the other two &#x02265;1-year studies, the study had insufficient power to show treatment differences in the eosinophil subgroups, compared with the other two studies, as the wide 95% CI margins illustrate. Furthermore, this study used local laboratories for measuring eosinophils.</p><p>The interpretation of the time to first moderate/severe exacerbation analysis was limited by lack of power resulting in wide 95% CI margins. While no treatment comparison was statistically significant, numerical trends across all three &#x02265;1-year studies were consistent with the exacerbation rate analysis, and are suggestive of relatively greater efficacy with FP/SAL and its components versus placebo or tiotropium in the &#x02265;2% eosinophil subgroup. No evidence for an effect of eosinophil levels on response to ICS/LABA in terms of lung function or health-related quality of life was found.</p><p>A strength of our analysis is that the studies contributing the majority of patients (INSPIRE and TRISTAN) measured pretreatment blood eosinophil levels using a central laboratory system. Furthermore, the patients were selected in accordance with strict inclusion criteria and had well-characterised COPD. A uniform, consensus definition of COPD exacerbations<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was used in all studies. Although this was a retrospective analysis, the analysis plan was defined prospectively before testing of the new hypotheses. A limitation of the analysis was that in most studies there was only a single measurement of eosinophil levels before study treatment, and intrapatient variability of eosinophil levels in COPD is not known. Post hoc analysis of eosinophil levels in TRISTAN, where repeated measurements were available, showed some variability between measurements for individual patients. We chose to stratify our population by a blood eosinophil count of 2%, as previous publications identified the high sensitivity of this cut-off point for the presence of a raised sputum eosinophil count.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> In addition, our previous analysis demonstrated clear differences in the response to additional ICS using this cut-off point.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Post hoc analysis of this and earlier studies<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> shows a graded response to additional ICS by baseline blood eosinophil count, whether expressed as a differential or absolute count, and supports a cut-off point of 2%. However, we acknowledge that, as with other biomarkers, the optimum cut-off point depends on detailed knowledge of measurement characteristics, the question being asked, and the likely response to that question. We also recognise that data from prospective studies are required to further validate this cut-off point. Our findings are relevant to a population of patients with a history of exacerbations who would be considered for treatment with an ICS-containing regimen. Whether the findings can be extrapolated to a wider population with COPD and whether stratification by blood eosinophil count results in more effective use of ICS than other stratification strategies are important areas for further study.</p><p>In conclusion, our analysis suggests that an informative relationship exists between pretreatment blood eosinophil levels and reduction in the frequency of COPD exacerbations with ICS/LABA treatment. Blood eosinophil levels represent a potentially important biomarker that could aid treatment decision-making in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Prospective studies are required to explore these findings further.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2015-207021-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1286" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support in the form of development of the draft outline and manuscript first draft in consultation with the authors, editorial suggestions to draft versions of this paper, assembling tables and figures, collating author comments, copy editing, fact checking, referencing and graphic services was provided by Ian Grieve and Emma McConnell at Gardiner-Caldwell Communications (Macclesfield, UK) and was funded by GSK.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JAW and PWJ participated in the acquisition and interpretation of the data.
