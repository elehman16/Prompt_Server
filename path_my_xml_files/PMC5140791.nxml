bearing training in sit to stand to sit and limits of stability on stroke patients.
[Subjects and Methods] For subjects of this study, 30 stroke patients were randomly
divided into two groups of 15, a biofeedback weight bearing training group and a
functional weight bearing training group. Biofeedback weight bearing training was
conducted for 30 minutes, five times a week for eight weeks, using Biorescue. Analysis of
sit to stand to sit was done with LUKOtronic while the analysis of limits of stability was
done with Biorescue. [Results] In a comparison of sit to stand to sit and limits of
stability between the two groups before and after intervention, Group I showed significant
difference in sit to stand to sit and limits of stability when compared to Group II.
[Conclusion] This study concludes that biofeedback weight bearing training is more
effective in improving sit to stand to sit and limits of stability in stroke patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Biofeedback</kwd><kwd>Sit to stand to sit</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is one of the high incidence diseases in modern society and is a representative
disease that causes damage in the central nerve system with ischemia or hemorrhage of the
cerebral artery<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It induces motor and
sensory disorders by damaging the motor cortex, premotor cortex, and motor tract of the
cerebrum and is accompanied by various symptoms, in which complex functional disorders occur
depending on the damaged area<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most of the stroke patients exhibit at least a minimum of 27% weight bearing on the
paralyzed leg while sustaining an erect posture<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although lately various weight bearing training intervention
methods have been offered to correct abnormal weight bearing and to improve execution of
everyday movement of hemiplegia patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,
rehabilitation intervention methods based on biofeedback have been suggested due to lack of
motivation and loss of interest in patients from existing weight bearing training
intervention methods<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rehabilitation based on biofeedback is a training method to improve damaged function by
using sensation of physical contactand body movement that creates interest in attendance. It
is more effective than conventional training interventions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The sit to stand to sit is a movement from sitting to standing upright and then sitting
down again, which is a basic everyday movement performed on average four times every
hour<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Standing up from a chair requires
complex movement and stability of knee and ankle joints. Patients with hemiplegia secondary
to stoke show more weight bearing to the un-paralyzed leg than the affected leg when
conducting the sit to stand to sit compared to normal people and required a longer time to
perform. The center of gravity to anterior-posterior and interior-exterior is different from
normal people<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Balance is an ability to maintain the line of gravity of a body within the base of support
to sustain positional stability. Stoke reduces physical activity and leads to left-right
posture imbalance and asymmetry, affectingfactors involved in upright standing and balancing
reaction which creates severe problems in balancing ability. Reduced balancing capability
affects mobility which makes it difficult to carry on independent daily life<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study provides basic reference on rehabilitation of stroke patients by studying the
influence of biofeedback weight bearing training in sit to stand to sit and LOS in stroke
patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was approved by bioethics Committee of Sehan university center (IRB) (Approval
number: 2015-15) on January 1, 2016. The participants&#x02019; rights were protected according to
the guidelines established by the University of Sehan. Thirty in-patients who were diagnosed
and being treated for stroke were included in this study. Detailed criteria for the
selection were hemiplegia patient diagnosed with stroke less than a year, patients who are
able to walk for at least 10&#x02005;m by themselves, patients who are able to communicate and score
K-MMSE 24 or over, and patients without musculoskeletal diseases that might affect the
experiment. The subjects of this study were randomly selected and allocated into 15 patients
in a biofeedback weight bearing group (Group I) and the other 15 patients in a functional
weight bearing group (Group II)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each received standard physical therapy
including CNS development therapy priory to the experiment. For biofeedback weight bearing
training, Biorescue (RM Ingenierie, France) which provides real-time feedback on movement of
force plate and pressure center was used<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Training was conducted for 30 minutes each day, five times a week,
for eight weeks. The LUKOtronic movement analysis system (Lutz-Kovacs Electronic, Austria)
was used to measure execution time of sit to stand to sit. Infrared markers were placed on
C5, PSIS, greater trochanter, lateral epicondyle, lateral malleolus, and heel<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the subjects were asked to stand up
in a comfortable pace from a sitting position at knee height (from ground to lateral femoral
condylar) while hip, knee, and both ankles were flexed at 90&#x000b0; and both feet were apart as
wide as the pelvis on a flat, adjustable chair with no back support and arm rest<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Biorescue (RM Ingenierie, France), which
is capable of measuring migration length and area of center of pressure (COS), was used to
analyze and measure limits of stability (LOS).</p><p>The results of this study were analyzed with Windows SPSS 18.0 program. Characteristics of
the subjects were analyzed with descriptive statistics, and comparison of sit to stand to
sit and LOS between the two groups&#x02019; before and after intervention was done in analysis of
covariance, with statistical reference level of &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Data on the general characteristics of the subjects is summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group I (n=15)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group II (n=15)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (male/female)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8/7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.6 &#x000b1; 2.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.2 &#x000b1; 3.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.2 &#x000b1; 4.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.6 &#x000b1; 3.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">162.3 &#x000b1; 3.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.9 &#x000b1; 2.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stroke duration (month)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.24 &#x000b1; 1.57</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.87 &#x000b1; 1.23</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are show as the mean &#x000b1; SD.

to sit and LOS in stroke patients, shows there was significant improvement in sit-to-stand

differences in range of postural sway, weight bearing rate, and sit-to-stand execution time
in the experiment group when conducting sit to stand to sit and a decrease in fall at
follow-up after six months. The training was conducted five times a week for a three-week
intervention with a total of 54 participants allocated into two groups, an experimental
group of 30 subjects who received intervention program consisting of repetitive sit to stand
to sit and symmetrical weight bearing and control group of 24 subjects who received a
general rehabilitation intervention program.</p><p>Sherrington et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> studied 120
patients with iliac joint fracture who were divided into three groups of weight bearing,
non-weight bearing and control group. The four month follow up shows a significant
difference in LOS and five-times standing up test in the weight bearing group. Group I in
the present study showed significant decrease in sit to stand to sit execution time after
eight weeks of intervention of biofeedback weight bearing training. It is considered that
biofeedback weight bearing training provides motivation and real-time feedback information
to hemiplegia patients with difficulty in moving their weight center to their affected leg
resulting in reduced sit to stand to sit execution time and improved weight bearing
capability<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cheng et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> divided 52 patients with
hemiplegia caused by stroke into experiment groups of 28 who received an intervention of
general rehabilitation training and dynamic visual feedback body weight shift and a control
group of 24 who received general rehabilitation training. Intervention was conducted five
times a week, for three weeks, and the balancing capability of each group was compared. The
result showed the experiment group had a significant difference in dynamic balancing
capability than the control group.</p><p>The study carried out by Morone et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>
divided 50 patients with hemiplegia from subacute stroke into experiment groups of 25 who
conducted game-based balancing training and a control group of 25 who conducted general
balancing training and arranged a four week intervention, three times a week. They reported
that the experimental group showed significant improvement in the Berg balance scale (BBS),
Barthel index, functional movement capability and 10&#x02005;m walk capability compared to control
group.</p><p>Srivatava et at.<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> researched visual
feedback balance training that used sense of pressure on 40 stroke patients for four weeks,
five times a week. The result showed significant improvement in BBS, LOS, gait speed and
Barthel index. Balance capability was still intact at test on balancing capability after
three months.The present study also proved that biofeedback weight bearing training improved
balance capability. It has been found that visual biofeedback weight bearing training on
stroke patients with asymmetrical weight bearing is effective in improving sit to stand to
sit and LOS. Biofeedback weight bearing training paired with present nerve physical therapy
is anticipated to result in a more effective outcome of functional improvement in stroke
patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The research has been conducted by the research grant of Sehan university in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Peurala</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>K&#x000f6;n&#x000f6;nen</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Pitk&#x000e4;nen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Postural instability in patients with chronic
