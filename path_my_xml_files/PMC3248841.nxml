The main advantages of ultrasonic coagulating/dissecting systems compared with a standard electrosurgical device are manifested by minimal lateral thermal tissue damage, less smoke formation, no neuromuscular stimulation, and no electrical energy through the patient[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This new technology is extensively used in laparoscopic surgery and several fields of minimally invasive surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Harmonic Focus has been developed to which allows for precise and simultaneous cutting as well as hemostasis with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. Safe thyroid surgery requires meticulous hemostasis. Hemostasis in thyroid surgery is achieved by means of the conventional clamp-and-tie technique, diathermy, hemostatic clips, and, recently, the Harmonic Focus.</p><p>The aim of this prospective study was to assess the operating time, overall drainage volume, and surgical complications such as hypocalcemia, laryngeal nerve palsy in thyroid surgery with the use of the Harmonic Focus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patient Eligibility and Study Design</title><p>The study involved 13 men and 92 women from January 2010 to September 2010. One hundred and five consecutive patients were preoperatively diagnosed as papillary thyroid microcarcinoma following typically ultrasound identification of nodules and ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration cytology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Exclusion criteria included previous neck operation, a history of neck irradiation. Patients with clinically positive nodes or functional neck dissection were excluded in this study. When level III-IV lymph nodes were positive on frozen section analysis, the dissection was extended to include level IIa and V. The treatment was conducted in accordance with the hospital's ethical standards as set out by its Ethics Committee for Analysis of Research Projects on Human Experimentation. All patients were blinded to the surgical technique used and signed an informed written consent before enrollment to the trial. This prospective randomized trial study was performed on these 105 consecutive patients given total thyroidectomy plus level III-IV and VI dissection (pretracheal, bilateral paratracheal, and prelaryngeal lymph nodes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Patients were randomly assigned to either the Focus group (in which the operation was performed entirely using the Harmonic Focus and no other hemostatic tool; 51 patients) or the classic group (in which the operation was performed using conventional clamp-and-tie technique and mono-polar electric scalpel; 54 patients). The patients all underwent similar treatment following the same protocol, except for the Harmonic Focus used. Total thyroidectomy and level III-IV and VI dissection were performed by the same experienced thyroid surgical team(six adept surgeons) in all cases. The two groups did not display statistically significant differences in term of age, gender, BMI, and pathology classification (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Thyroid microcarcinoma was discovered by screening with ultrasonography</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1477-7819-9-141-1"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Clinical data between two groups</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Variable</th><th align="left">Focus Group<break/>(n = 51)</th><th align="left">Classic Group<break/>(n = 54)</th><th align="left"><italic>P </italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Mean age, y[range]</td><td align="left">48(27-76)</td><td align="left">46.5(23-73)</td><td align="left">&#x0003e; 0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Sex, No. M/F</td><td align="left">6/45</td><td align="left">7/47</td><td align="left">&#x0003e; 0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Diagnosis, No. of patients</td><td align="left">51</td><td align="left">54</td><td align="left">&#x0003e; 0.05</td></tr><tr><td align="left">papillary thyroid microcarcinom<break/>Body mass index(BMI)</td><td align="left">22.8 &#x000b1; 1.6</td><td align="left">22.6 &#x000b1; 1.7</td><td align="left">&#x0003e; 0.05</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>A complete preoperative assessment (serum thyrotropin levels, parathyroid hormone, serum Ca and P, nodule size by ultrasonography) was obtained in all patients.

Total thyroidectomy plus level III-IV and VI dissection was performed in all patients. Under either block anesthesia cervical plexus or general anesthesia and with endotracheal intubation, the patients were placed on the operating table in the supine position with the neck extended. A 5 cm low-collar incision was made above the sternal notch. After skin incision with the conventional scalpel, flaps were raised using the mono-polar electric scalpel. In the Focus group, we used the Harmonic Focus for vascular control of the thyroid gland (Harmonic Focus, Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc, Cincinnati, OH. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). For better hemostasis, the middle vein, the superior and inferior thyroidal arteries and veins were controlled using level 3. Other small vessels and surrounding connective tissues were controlled using level 5 for easy cutting. For patients in the classic group, mono-polar electric scalpel was used to control the small vessels of the gland and conventional "clip, cut and tie" routines was adapted for the superior and inferior thyroidal arteries, as well as the superior, middle and inferior veins. Total thyroidectomy was first performed. In all patients, we identified recurrent laryngeal nerve routinely. The delicate technique was performed by seeking, identifying and exposing the nerve itself with all branches and following its course with care until it entered larynx. Thyroid gland was examined by frozen section examination during surgery. The tumor size was equal to or less than 10 mm. The parathyroid glands were identified macroscopically, and a meticulous dissection from the thyroid gland was performed. Every effort was made to identify and preserve all parathyroid glands. Parathyroid glands were transplanted in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, if the blood supply to the glands was compromised. Outcomes of the study included operating time, fluid content in the suction balloon (drainage volume), and incidence of complications (rate of hypocalcemia and laryngeal nerve injury). The operative time was measured from initiation of the incision to conclusion of the skin closure. The drains were removed if drainage volume was less than 5 mL in 24 hours.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Paratracheal lymph nodes dissection with the Harmonic Focus, and recurrent laryngeal nerve identified</bold>.

Sandostatain and reasonable dietry control were applied in two patients. Chyle leakages stopped within 2 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The thyroid gland has an extensive vascular network, thus meticulous hemostasis is essential to ensure a dry surgical field and avoid inadvertent damage to adjacent vital structure. Although total thyroidectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures, whether it is the safest, most efficient and cost-effective way to achieve hemostasis is debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Means to prevent and control intra- or postoperative bleeding therefore remain a topic of utmost importance. In conventional surgery, electrocoagulation and suture ligation are used for haemostasis. The development of ultrasonic instruments in the early 1990s has provided an alternative to other methods of controlling blood vessels(e.g., Ligasure precise, lasers, clips, and staples)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Despite their safety and effectiveness in thyroid surgery, the previous harmonic scalpel instruments are considered large and cumbersome by some surgeons. The new harmonic scalpel(Focus) has been made available since 2008. Recently, the Harmonic Focus has been used as an alternative to conventional hand-tied ligation for hemostasis in thyroid surgery[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The Harmonic Focus gave surgeons the versatility to perform several important functions(e.g., to dissect, cut, coagulate and grasp) without the need to exchange instruments. The device divides tissue by using 55.5 kHz ultrasonic energy transmitted between the instrument blades. This mechanical action disrupts protein hydrogen bonds within the tissue, and functions at a relatively low temperature (between 50&#x000b0;C and 100&#x000b0;C) to cause a lesser tissue injury compared with electrocautery (the Harmonic Focus causes lateral thermal injury 1.5 mm wide, approximately half of that caused by mono-polar systems).</p><p>Our data show that the Harmonic Focus allow a one third time saving vs classic hemostasis. Furthermore, the use of the Harmonic Focus would allow reduced traction and reduced manipulation of the thyroid, particularly when dividing the upper pedicle and transecting the superior pole, as claimed by Miccoli et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The reduced tissue injury and the better hemostasis are confirmed by the statistically significant reduction of drainage volume for patients in the Focus group. That reduction draws attention to the great sealing capacity of this device. After using the Harmonic Focus, some investigators reached similar conclusions regarding postoperative drainage, whereas others did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The Harmonic Focus proved to be safe, with good control of the blood vessels and no bleeding after surgery. At our institute, we used the Harmonic Focus exclusively for hemostasis in thyroid surgery, scarcely any ties.</p><p>Finally, our data demonstrate that the complication rate in the Focus group might not be significantly reduced. Incidences of definitive hypoparathyroidism, superior laryngeal nerve and recurrent nerve palsy were also not statistically significant. Intraoperative chyle leakage was not found in any patient, although postoperative leakage was detected in two patients. Postoperative lymphatic vessel leak or chylous fistula can be avoided by careful neck dissection in at-risk area during operation. Proper postoperative conservative management is of great help when leakage occurred. Careful dissection techniques using ultrasonic scalpels may be useful for preventing the occurrence of chyle leakage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, a major criticism of the Harmonic Focus is its cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]: the Harmonic Focus is disposable, expensive, yet must be considered an additional cost in the diagnosis related group's Medicare hospital payment system. However, when the reduced operating time and length of stay are considered, the device actually might be cost-effective. The use of the Harmonic Focus in multinodular goiter surgery allows for a significant reduction in the length of the procedure with a comparable cost. This represents a refinement of our current technique, with decreased anesthesia and operating time, and has clear economic impacts. But unfortunately, the Harmonic Focus is very expensive(&#x000a5;7200 in China). The use of the harmonic Focus reduces surgical time, but increases the cost of the surgery. It is our belief that by including in the absolute cost the time saved and the reduction in human resources needed, the use of the Harmonic Focus would prove to be economic.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Harmonic Focus makes it fast and easy to perform a total thyroidectomy plus level III-IV and VI dissection without bleeding. The main advantage of this technique is that it simplifies the surgical procedure and eliminates the need to have repetitive "clip, cut and tie" maneuvers, while achieving efficient hemostasis. We have demonstrated that the Harmonic Focus is a new ultrasonic device in thyroid surgery, and offering great capabilities for delicate tissue grasping and dissection.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
