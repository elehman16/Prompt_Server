Intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) have shown an analgesic effect on LBP in two previous randomized controlled studies. The objective of the study was to verify the efficacy of paravertebral injections of BoNT-A in patients with LBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Patients were included in this phase 3 randomized double-blinded trial comparing the efficacy of BoNT-A versus placebo in a crossover study on LBP. Both groups received 200&#x000a0;units of BoNT-A in paravertebral muscles or a placebo, and vice versa at Day 120. The main judgment criterion was LBP intensity 1&#x000a0;month after the injections, evaluated by using a visual pain scale (VAS). Secondary assessment criteria included: LBP intensity 90 and 120&#x000a0;days after injection day; number of days when an allowed antalgic oral treatment was needed in between each evaluation; functional disability measured by the Quebec Back Pain Disability Scale; quality of life; inability to work; patient satisfaction in relation to the treatment&#x02019;s effect; spinal mobility; and strength of spinal muscles, measured by isokinetic technique.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Nineteen patients completed the study. There was no significant difference between the groups&#x02019; average LBP during the last 8&#x000a0;days at Day30 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97). There was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the secondary assessment criteria (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Injections of BoNT-A in the paravertebral muscles were not found to be effective to relieve chronic LBP. The limits of the study are that the dose of BoNT-A used was lower than in other studies, and that the limited number of patients included may explain the negative results.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registrations</title><p id="Par5">Identifiers: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03181802">NCT03181802</ext-link>.

Many recent arguments purport that paravertebral muscles have a predominant pathogenic role in perpetuating chronic back pain. During spinal movements, paravertebral muscles&#x02019; activity, recorded by electromyography, show abnormalities in subjects with low-back pain compared to subjects without LBP. A decrease in the power ratio between the erector spinae and flexor spinal muscles, measured by isokinetic techniques, is associated with chronic low-back pain. Finally, the significance of lumbar stiffness in relation to the erector spinae muscles contracting is linked to the level of intensity of low-back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Local muscular treatments have already been tried such as physiotherapy, massage, infrared therapy and botulinum toxin A (BoNT-A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">In addition to its muscle-relaxing effect, local intramuscular injections of BoNT-A have also shown an analgesic effect on pain related to dystonia, tension headaches, myofascial pain syndrome and chronic neck pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. This effect is usually reversible after 3&#x000a0;months. Foster et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] used BoNT-A A for its peripheral muscle relaxant action as a local intramuscular treatment of chronic LBP. This double-blinded, placebo, controlled trial in 31 patients showed that paravertebral administration of BoNT-A in patients with chronic LBP relieved pain and improved function at 3 and 8&#x000a0;weeks after treatment. Machado et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] showed also in a randomized controlled trial that BoNT-A injections relieved pain and improved quality of life of 19 patients at 4&#x000a0;weeks. Further open studies have been performed to value the efficacy of BoNT-A in patients with chronic LBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] but all of them aimed to establish predictive factors of pain relief, and the efficacy was limited to 3&#x000a0;months. A Cochrane meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] concluded that &#x0201c;there was low quality evidence in the short term, and very low quality in the intermediate term, that BoNT-A injections reduced pain intensity more effectively than saline injections in participants with LBP&#x0201d; and that &#x0201c;there was very low quality evidence that BoNT-A injections compared to corticosteroid injections could reduce chronic LBP intensity in the short term&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par11">Studying the therapeutic effect of paravertebral injections of BoNT-A requires further studies to confirm the reported short-term therapeutic effect and to determine potential predictive factors of efficacy.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives of this trial</title><p id="Par12">Main objective: To evaluate the analgesic effect 1&#x000a0;month after a single injection of 200&#x000a0;IU of BoNT-A in 10 bilateral paravertebral intramuscular points for treating chronic LBP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p id="Par13">

This superiority trial obtained support from the French Hospital Clinical Research Project (PHRC).</p><p id="Par18">The number of participants included in the study was similar as those included in the previous study (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]), that showed a strong positive effect of BoNT-A injections on LBP. Furthermore, the design of our study (i.e. a crossover) increased the power of the statistical analysis. In this context, 60 inclusions were planned (30 in each group). Nevertheless, regular intermediary analyses were planned by an independent scientific committee, to ensure that the trial did not present any secondary effect, or that we could conclude in an intermediary step that BoNT-A was inefficient in pain relief. After obtaining a similar number of injections than Foster, the study was stopped by the scientific committee, because there was no trend in pain relief.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Ethics, consent and permissions</title><p id="Par19">This trial obtained the approval of a French ethics Committee (2003/02) and all participants received an information note and gave their written informed consent.

Spine infection, tumour or trauma had been specifically excluded by an MRI done by all patients before the inclusion in the present study. Some of risk factors associated with going from acute low-back pain to chronic low-back pain are linked to the socio-professional context, notably with the job dissatisfaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore, 2 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] showed that there was a significant positive association between a damage compensation and chronic incapacity. In general, patients with unconsolidated work accident or ongoing damage compensation have a higher probability to be at risk of chronic disease; they also have a lower probability to positive response to treatment in general. That is why we excluded them from the study. We measured it by asking to each participant: &#x0201c;are you currently in an unconsolidated work accident?&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;are you currently ongoing a damage compensation?&#x0201d;. As a High Authority of Health in France (l&#x02019;Agence Nationale d&#x02019;Accr&#x000e9;ditation et d&#x02019;Evaluation en Sant&#x000e9;, Diagnostic, Prise en charge et suivi des malades atteints de lombalgie chronique, D&#x000e9;cembre 2000) classified the beginning of a LBP after the age of 55 as an &#x000ab; alert sign &#x000bb;, we excluded them from the study.</p><p id="Par23">No patient was allowed to take opiates during the time of the study, and facet joint injections were also not permitted during the study period. Physiotherapy programs offered during the study period were isometric exercises and core muscle strengthening exercises one or twice per week (usual physiotherapy in chronic low-back pain, that patients made before the study, and which was not modified during the study).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Experimental procedure</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Task</title><p id="Par24">The design of this study was a crossover. The subjects were randomized into two groups and successively received the two treatments of the study: patients in group 1 received intramuscular paravertebral injections of BoNT-A during the first sequence of treatment, then a placebo during the second sequence of treatment 120&#x000a0;days later; patients in group 2 received a placebo during the first sequence of treatment, then intramuscular paravertebral injections of BoNT-A during of the second sequence of treatment 120&#x000a0;days later. The crossover was performed 120&#x000a0;days after the inclusion in the study, because most patients with initial improvement induced by BoNT-A injections reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] that the beneficial effect waned at four months.</p><p id="Par25">A paper table of randomization was used by the pharmacist at the University Hospital of Bordeaux (block randomization with block size of 6). The pharmacist who performed the randomization was blinded to the patient&#x02019;s characteristics.</p><p id="Par26">Therapeutic procedure: For each group, the injected solution was prepared by the hospital pharmacist in order that both the patients and the injectors were blinded to the nature of the injected solution. The treatments compared were: 200&#x000a0;IU of BoNT-A diluted in 4&#x000a0;ml of physiological saline injected intramuscularly in the paravertebral lumbar muscles, versus 4&#x000a0;ml of physiological saline injected intramuscularly in the paravertebral lumbar muscles (placebo). The injector administered the solution in 10 intramuscular puncture points (0.4&#x000a0;mL/point) equally distributed from L1 to L5, bilaterally. The site of injection was detected by electromyography using the injection needle. No complementary pain treatment was prescribed after the injections.</p><p id="Par27">Follow-up: patients were examined at inclusion Days 0, 30, 90, 120 (Day of the crossover), 150, 210 and 240, i.e., D0, D30, D90 and D120 after both sessions of injection. The follow-up was done in person. Patients were blinded throughout the entire study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par28">The main judgment criterion was the level of LBP intensity at D30 (when the maximal effect of BoNT-A injections is anticipated). Pain intensity was measured on a horizontal visual analogue scale 100&#x000a0;mm long, with &#x000ab; no pain &#x000bb; written on one end and &#x000ab; maximum pain &#x000bb; on the other (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain; 100&#x02009;=&#x02009;maximal pain). The question asked was: &#x0201c;How was the intensity of your LBP over the last 8 days?&#x0201d; To consider the pain decrease as clinically significant, we used the guidelines of Pham et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], who suggested that a change of 40&#x000a0;mm could be clinically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Secondary judgment criteria</title><p id="Par29">

Indeed, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the main criterion, i.e.<italic>,</italic> average lumbar pain over the last 8&#x000a0;days at D30 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.97), nor was there any significant difference between the two groups regarding secondary judgment criteria (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05, see Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par79">Our results differ largely from those of two previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Since LBP is a complex phenomenon involving heavy lifting, twisting and trauma which is sometimes work-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] psychological factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], smoking, alcoholism, biomechanical and psychosocial professional factors, the difference in results could be due to differences in the populations of the two studies. Indeed, in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], 3 patients had a discectomy compared to none in our study. In addition, no patient had any MRI evidence of acute disc pathology in the two previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], whereas 6 patients in our study had a MODIC 1. Furthermore, in our study, only 3 male patients were included. Nevertheless, there was no difference between groups concerning the gender. Furthermore, the present literature is not uniform about the role of the gender on the chronicity of low-back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par80">In our study, we used 200&#x000a0;units of Botox for bilateral injections. But we assume that the negative results of our study could also be secondary to the lower dose of botulinum toxin A used on each injection point compared to Foster et al.&#x02019;s study. Indeed, we decided to inject bilaterally the paravertebral muscles, because there is usually a bilateral injury in both paravertebral muscles after an acute low back-pain, which leads to chronic low-back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. More precisely, we think that LBP could be secondary to an over-activity of muscles compensating multifidus&#x02019; atrophy. The dose used in Machado et al.&#x02019;s study (1000UI of Dysport in case of bilateral injections) was also superior to ours, which could explain the difference between the results.</p><p id="Par81">Reporting a negative study is still an interesting point, because the efficiency of BoNT-A on chronic low-back pain is still not proved at this time, and because it could make reconsider on one part in researchers&#x02019; further studies about BoNT-A and LBP, and one the other part in clinicians using BoNT-A injections for chronic LBP.</p><p id="Par82">The strength of this trial is its randomized, controlled crossover design. A limitation is the small sample. Nevertheless, the number of patients treated was similar to that in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which showed a strong positive effect of BoNT-A on LBP. While some differences between the groups became apparent before the crossover (hand-ground distance, Schober&#x02019;s test, isokinetic measures), they disappeared when the data were aggregated after the crossover (group A and group B), perhaps owing to variations due to the size of groups 1 and 2. Indeed, group 1 demonstrated more spine stiffness and less strength than group 2, a finding that was unexpected.</p><p id="Par83">The main result of the study is the absence of any significant difference or trend to feel pain relief with injections of BoNT-A A compared to placebo injections. A larger sample of patients now needs to be studied in order to identify those who would benefit most from BoNT-A injections for LBP.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par84">Botulinum toxin injections did not show any efficacy in relieving pain in patients with chronic low-back pain in this randomised controlled trial using a cross-over. Result is in contradiction with the existing literature. With 200UI of Botox injected bilaterally, we did not find any pain relief. But this negative result could also be explained by the lower dose used compared to other studies, and by the low number of patients included. Nevertheless, this negative result could be useful being included in a meta-analysis.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BoNT-A</term><def><p id="Par6">Botulinum Toxin A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBP</term><def><p id="Par7">Low-back pain</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Briane Marie Sheperd, Ray Cooke and Anna Moraitis for helping with the English syntax.
