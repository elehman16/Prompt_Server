Epidemiological studies indicated that dyslipidemia is the major risk factor of CVD. Dyslipidemia can be modified either by proper lifestyle or medical intervention or by the combination of both. Conjugated linoleic acids (CLA) and &#x003c9;3 fatty acids have beneficial effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CLA and omega-3 fatty acids (&#x003c9;-3 fatty acids) supplementation on lipid profile in atherosclerosis patient.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This study was a 2-month clinical randomized trial. Ninety atherosclerotic patients with angiographically diagnosed coronary atherosclerosis who were referred to Emam Reza Heart Clinic of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from February to march 2011 were selected if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The participants were randomly classified into 3 groups receiving 3 g/d CLA or 1 920 mg/d &#x003c9;3 or placebo for 2 months. High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and total cholesterol were measured before and after the intervention.

It has been observed that animals fed an atherogenic diet and supplemented with CLA had significantly less aortic lesions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Kritchevsky has also found 30% regression of atherosclerotic lesions in supplemented rabbits with CLA.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] An early study showed that CLA-fed rabbits had significantly reduced LDL cholesterol, but there was no significant change in the HDL levels.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] There are a few studies conducted on the effect of CLA supplementation on atherosclerosis in human population. On the other hand, &#x003c9;3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that human body need for metabolic function.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] There is considerable evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicating that &#x003c9;3 fatty acids from fish and fish oil are protective against atherosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The results of these studies raised a lot of interest in the role of fish oil andomega-3 fatty acids in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Omega-3 fatty acids play an important role to regulate genes that are critical for controlling lipid homeostasis.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Examples of foods high in &#x003c9;3 fatty acids are certain fish, fish oils, canola oil, flaxseed, and certain vegetables.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] To the best of our knowledge, this paper was the first human study which assessed the effect of CLA supplementation on atherosclerosis patients and due to high prevalence of atherosclerosis in Iranian population, this study was carried out to evaluate the effect of &#x003c9;3 fatty acids and CLA on lipid profile in atherosclerotic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><bold>Patient</bold>: Triglyceride is an important variable in this study, so to determine the sample based on power = 80% and &#x003b1; = 0.05, the results of the Omrani <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] study was used. Ninety atherosclerotic patients (40 males and 50 females) aged 30 to 60 years with angiographically diagnosed coronary atherosclerosis who were referred to Emam Reza Heart Clinic from February to march 2011were recruited for the study. They gave written informed consent. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Volunteers had the following criteria: History of angina, myocardial infarction or bypass surgery, body mass index (BMI) between 18.5-24.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, no pregnancy, and no dietary supplements. Volunteers with acute heart failure, arrhythmia acute, or chronic inflammatory disease were excluded from the study. Most of the patients consumed lipid lowering drugs, so dosage and type of these drugs were kept consistent. Participants followed their regular diet and physical activity during the study. To determine the food intake and macro- and micronutrient consumptions of participants, FFQ questionnaire was fill out for each patient at the beginning of the study.</p><p><bold>Study design</bold>: In this 2-month clinical randomized trial, the volunteers were randomly divided into 3 groups using BBR (Balance Block Randomization) protocol. According to previous population-based studies,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] they were allocated to receive 3g/d CLA (3 &#x000d7; 1 g soft gel, a 50:50 isomer blend of cis9trance11 and trance10cis12), 1920 mg/d &#x003c9;3 fatty acids (3 &#x000d7; 640 mg soft gel blend of 210 mg DHA and 310 mg EPA, Vitamin E, gelatine, and glycerin) and the placebo. CLA soft gel was obtained from Puritan's Pride (USA) and &#x003c9;3 fatty acids soft gel was produced by seven seas Health Care (UK). Placebo was produced by Zahravi Pharmacy Company (Tehran-Iran). Participants asked not to take any vitamin or supplements during the trial. Each group was invited separately to take their supplements every two weeks and researcher supervised ingestion of supplements every week.</p><p><bold>Blood sampling</bold>: At the beginning and the end of the 8-week supplementation trial, 5 cc fasting venous blood samples were collected and immediately centrifuged (3000 &#x000d7; g, 10 min, 4&#x000b0;C); then the plasma was spilled into a tube and stored at -70&#x000b0;C until analysis for lipid profiles.</p><p><bold>Anthropometric assessment</bold>: Body weight was measured by Seca 713 scale, while the subjects were minimally clothed and their height was determined using measuring tape without shoes. Then, BMI (weight (kg)/hight<sup>2</sup> (m)) was calculated.</p><p><bold>Biochemical analysis</bold>: Plasma total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations were measured by using spectrophotometry methods. Total serum cholesterol, TG, and HDL-C was analyzed using a commercial kit supplied by Pars azmoon Co (Tehran, Iran). LDL-C is estimated using the Friedewald equation [Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol = Total cholesterol &#x02013; [High-density lipoprotein cholesterol &#x02013; Trigylcerides/5] (Friedewald <italic>et al</italic>., 1972).</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold>: Data were analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, version19). Normality distributed data were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. Paired-sample t- test was used for within-group effects from baseline. Differences between groups from baseline to 8 weeks were assessed using ANOVA followed by a post hoc analysis. FFQ questionnaire was analyzed using Food Processor Nut4 software by incorporating the Iranian food table.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Three patients were excluded during the study and finally data from 87 patients (39 men and 48 women) were collected and analyzed and with on average over 95% of supplements being apparently consumed by trial participants.

The amount of CLA in the diet has been estimated to be ~152 mg/d in women and 212 mg/d in men.</p><p>To meet therapeutic need levels (3-6g/d), use of CLA supplements and CLA-enriched foods is necessary.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In Nicolosi and Nestel's study, CLA supplementation reduces TG in rats.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] CLA isomers function as PPARs ligands, thereby increasing PPAR activity. PPAR is an important transcription factor in hepatic lipid metabolism. So, the TG-lowering effect of CLA may be related to its effect on PPAR.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] In a report by Mougios <italic>et al</italic>., 0.7 g/d CLA for 4 weeks decreased TG levels. However in this study, CLA supplementation did not have any significant effect on serum TG.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Some studies have demonstrated no effect of CLA on plasma TG.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In most of these studies and present study, patients had normal serum TG; therefore, the non-significant effect of CLA on TG may be partly attributed to this fact.</p><p>On the other hand, in some animal studies, CLA supplementation reduces cholesterol in rats[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] but in most human studies including the present one, CLA did not have any significant effect on total cholesterol and LDL-C.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] As reported by Tholstrup and Riserus, CLA supplementation decreases HDL-C concentration. However in some reports, mixture of CLA isomer did not affect HDL-C concentration.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] We also observed no effect of c9t11 and t10c12 CLA isomers on HDL-C levels.</p><p>In a recent study by Nazara <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] enrichment of yogurt with CLA did not have any significant effect on serum lipids. In most of human studies, CLA supplementation did not affect blood lipids, which are in contrast with those of most animal studies.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The variety of species can account for inconsistent results. Although in the animal model study, animals were fed atrogenic diet and were hyperlipidemic, in most of human studies the participants were normolipidemic.</p><p>Several studies show that &#x003c9;3 fatty acids have hypolipidemic properties.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] &#x003c9;3 fatty acids decrease production of TG in the liver by a direct effect on DGAT (Diacyl Glycerol Acyl Transferase) and consequently decrease VLDL production.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In addition, these fatty acids increase &#x003b2;-oxidation of fatty acids and ultimately decrease the availability of fatty acids to biosynthesis of TG in the liver.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Another possible mechanism is that &#x003c9;3 fatty acids increase LPL activity and TG clearance.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] So &#x003c9;3 fatty acids reduce fasting plasma TG and VLDL in patients with high or normal TG.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In the present study, TG concentration decreased significantly in &#x003c9;3 group relative to control group. The effect of &#x003c9;3 fatty acids on LDL-C and total cholesterol has been controversial.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In this study, &#x003c9;3 fatty acids did not have any significant effect on serum LDL-C and total cholesterol level. Despite the reduced TG and VLDL levels with &#x003c9;3 fatty acids supplementation, the rise in LDL as observed with fish oil supplementation can be due to the increased conversion of VLDL particles into LDL.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] In addition, there is evidence that fish oil down-regulates the receptor in hepatic cells.</p><p>Increased HDL-C in response to &#x003c9;3 fatty acid supplementation was observed in most, but not all, studies. In the present study, HDL-C concentration increased although it was not significant.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Major decreases were observed only when high doses of fish oil were given. The major effect of fish oil on HDL-C is due to reduction in activity of cholesterol ester transfer protein which transfers cholesterol esters from HDLs to VLDLs and LDLs. In the present study, HDL-C concentration increased although it was not significant.</p><p>The strengths of the current study included high follow-up rates, high statistical power, and narrow confidence intervals of the outcomes. Finally, we employed both male and female volunteers.</p><p>However to determine the food intake of participants, FFQ questionnaire was fill out for each patient at the beginning of the study; the limitation of this study was that we did not assess dietary intake and physical activity during the study although the randomized design should have clearly lowered the risk of such bias, and all subjects were instructed to maintain their regular diet and physical activity. On the other hand, in the present study the measured biochemical indices were normal in the beginning of the study and the patients had normal BMI. So, these might have affected our results.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates helpful effects of &#x003c9;3 fatty acids on atherosclerosis risk factors, although results were not significant for most indices. Since a few human studies evaluated CLA effect on atherosclerosis risk factors, more research with large sample size and high dose of supplements is required for CLA supplementation to bring up definite comments in this regard.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>The present study was funded by the grant number 89-5407 and IRCT201103146067N1 from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.
