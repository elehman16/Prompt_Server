Platelet rich plasma (PRP), containing autologous growth factors, has been shown to promote soft tissue healing. The aim of this clinical study was to determine whether the addition of an autologous PRP to a CAF when compared to a CAF alone would improve the clinical outcome for treatment of multiple gingival recessions.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Thirty patients with Miller's class I and class II buccal recession defect were randomly assigned to control (CAF alone) or test (CAF with PRP) groups. Recession depth (RD), recession width (RW), probing depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), width of keratinized tissue, wound healing index, percentage of root coverage was assessed.

However, some data have shown that root coverage associated with CAF used alone is unstable in the long time, where it shrinks from 89% in 1-month postoperatively to 58.8% after 6 months.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The potential limitation of CAF is the limited gain in the apico-coronal direction of the keratinized tissue, which is an important parameter in recurrence of gingival recession.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Therefore, data indicate that the CAF used alone is a less-optimal technique to achieve root coverage despite having advantage of generating low morbidity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Coronally advanced flap resulted in the re-formation of epithelial and connective tissue attachment with minimal bone repair. Thereafter, various adjunctive agents have been applied to promote healing and further enhance clinical outcome. These include root conditioners (e.g., citric acid,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] tetracycline[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]), GTR (Bio-resorbable membrane,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] collagen membrane[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]), enamel matrix proteins,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] subepithelial connective tissue graft,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] recombinant growth factors, and platelet rich plasma (PRP).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] According to Marx <italic>et al</italic>. who first reported applications and clinical benefits of PRP in 1998, it is &#x0201c;a volume of autologous plasma that has a platelet concentration above the baseline&#x0201d;.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] PRP has become a focus of current studies due to its potential to accelerate wound healing.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] It is derived from concentrated platelets, allowing it to deliver a greater concentration of autologous growth factors including platelet derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;, vascular endothelial growth factor, epithelial growth factors, insulin like growth factor.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that PRP enhances early maturation of bone, new bone formation and increases bone density,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] early graft maturation,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] early healing of bone around implants,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] treating periodontal defects,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] maxillary sinus augmentation,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] ridge augmentation procedures,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and repair of peri-implant defects.

The blood was then dispensed into 10 ml sterilized tubes with 1.5 ml 10% tri-sodium citrate, which functioned as anticoagulant. The tubes were placed into the REMI digital centrifuge for PRP preparation (REMI Laboratory centrifuges, Digital Speed Meter and Timer without Head (Model R8C), 8 &#x000d7; 15 ml, swing out head with graduated glass tubes). The technique used in this study followed the guideline proposed by Gonshor (2002).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Briefly, after counter balancing the tubes, the first spin was made at 1300 rpm for 10 min. The result was a separation of the whole blood into blood cells and plasma layer. The plasma layer and upper most part of the cell layer were withdrawn using needle and syringe, and placed into 10 ml sterilized tube that had no anticoagulant. Then, the sediment was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min. The second spin separated PRP at the bottom and clear straw colored serum at the top. The serum was removed. The PRP layer was then expressed into a sterile container and prepared for use. The clot initiator was a mixture of 1.5 ml calcium chloride and autogenous thrombin. The protocol of PRP activation was adding calcium chloride/thrombin in 10:1 ratio. After a few seconds, the activated PRP gel was applied to the test sites as a coating membrane.

When compared to control group, the observed reduction in RD and RW in test group was not statistically significant. These results are in accordance with several studies,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] but they are contradictory to the results reported by Modica <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Both test and control groups resulted in root coverage; however, the slight difference between them may be due to patient selection, defect selection, local anatomical factors such as shallow vestibule, prominent roots and quality of tissue.</p><p>The percentage of root coverage observed within test group (75%) when compared with the control group (73.1%) was not statistically significant. These results are in accordance with Spahr <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and the outcome of our recession coverage procedure was successful from a clinical point of view.</p><p>The difference between the reduction in the PD and gain in CAL within control and test groups were not statistically significant. PD reduction depends on the tissue condition before and after the surgical procedure. Similar results are reported by several studies.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The improvement in CAL suggests that recession coverage by CAF procedure does not result in pocket formation but in tissue attachment on the previously exposed root surface.</p><p>In comparison to control group, increase in WKT in test group was not statistically significant. Similar results were reported by several authors.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This increase in WKT is considered to occur as a result of the proliferation of granulation tissue from the gingival connective tissue and the periodontal ligament. This outcome has been justified due to the genetically determined position of the mucogingival line, which, with time, reaches its original position and consequently causes an increase of WKT. The results from these clinical studies may in part justify the outcomes obtained in this investigation.</p><p>The PRP preparation technique used in the current study was a modification of Gonshor method[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] where autogenous thrombin was added instead of bovine thrombin. Mean platelet recovered from our method was 46.52%. It was comparable with Ghonshor method that could recover 67.5%.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Less percentage of platelet recovery in our study indicates that this procedure is technique sensitive and requires learning skills. In our study, the average increase of platelet concentration in PRP was 17.4 times (4.7 minimum and 30.6 maximum). Recent advances in PRP technology are able to provide more consistent platelet concentration than those observed in this study. However, despite the small sample size, no dose dependent effect of PRP on soft tissue wound healing could be detected.</p><p>Clinical evaluations of healing events are evaluated with recordings of healing index. WHI reached plateau 1-month after surgery in both groups suggesting uneventful healing regardless of PRP application. Recent systematic review and meta analysis reported that platelet concentrate does not benefit significantly in the treatment of root coverage.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Time of application after platelet activation plays an important role in tissue healing and regeneration. Hence, this factor may affect the final root coverage. Thus, preparation, application at the defect site and handling of PRP can be considered technique sensitive and need learning skills.</p><p>The present work has certain limitations that include small sample size and limited study duration (16 weeks). Gingival thickness before and after root coverage procedures is also important for success of root coverage procedure.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In the present study, thickness of the flap was not measured. Therefore, further studies with larger sample size and longer duration are needed to show the histological changes following PRP therapy and growth factors levels in PRP. CAF procedure has proved successful for root coverage in the present study. However, an additional benefit of PRP is not yet known. Comparative study with split mouth design on similar recession defects with or without PRP could provide further knowledge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Soft tissue maintenance is the primary line of defense in protecting the tissue from bacterial infection. On the basis of the results of the present research, the additional use of PRP together with CAF technique for recession coverage showed no difference in the overall clinical outcome. A possible positive tendency of PRP utilization should be better evaluated in the studies involving larger sample size and longer duration. Since no histological evaluation was performed in the present study, the effect of PRP on overall regeneration capacity remains to be determined.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>The authors of this manuscript declare that they have no conflicts of interest, real or perceived, financial or non-financial in this article.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors are especially grateful to Dr. T R Gururaja Rao, Professor and Head, Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology AME's Dental college and Hospital, Raichur, India for guidance and encouragement throughout the research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>PD</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Root coverage grafting for regeneration and aesthetics</article-title><source>Periodontol 2000</source><year>1993</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>118</fpage><lpage>27</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>PD</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Root coverage using the free soft tissue autograft following citric acid application.
