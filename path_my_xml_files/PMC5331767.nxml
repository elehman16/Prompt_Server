Although endothelial capacity responds to physical stimuli such as shear stress, blood vessels are dilated in response to stress.</p><p>Endothelial dysfunction induced by dyslipidemia is the initial step in atherosclerosis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Among patients with normal coronary arteries or minimal coronary artery disease, positive family history of coronary artery disease can be a significant predictor of the risk of a coronary artery low blood flow, reflecting any potential coronary endothelial dysfunction in the microcirculation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Brachial artery ultrasound imaging during reactive hyperemia provides a tool for vascular tone measurement associated with endothelium and may verify vascular endothelial dysfunction.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Measurement of vascular tone impairment (endothelial dysfunction) plays an important role as a screening tool. Vasodilatation through blood flow is technically called flow-mediated dilatation (FMD). FMD measurement is a clinical method to assess endothelial function. This endothelium-dependent response is essentially regulated by the release of nitric oxide from the endothelium.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>In patients with hypercholesterolemia, Vitamin C, folate, 5-methyl tetra-dihydrofolate (active form of folic acid) can improve endothelial function without changes in plasma lipid levels.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Vitamin C can also reverse the microcirculatory coronary response, thus delaying coronary flow damage in smokers with normal coronary arteries.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Vitamin C and folate may reduce oxidative stress and prevent the destruction of nitric oxide.</p><p>Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin and is a nutritional supplement essential for collagen formation and tissue repair. Moreover, it engages in a number of other metabolic reactions such as reductase reactions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Vitamin C is a potent endogenous antioxidant, regulating the intracellular reductase through glutathione, capable of destroying oxygen-derived free radicals.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Vitamin C can reverse damages caused by smoking, including oxidative stress and increased monocyte adhesion to endothelium.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Vitamin C may affect coronary artery disease through curtailing lesion activity.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Observational studies of Vitamin C have yielded mixed results in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). A few have demonstrated the beneficial effects of Vitamin C.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Others identified small benefits.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] However, there has been no consensus about the effects of Vitamin C on improving endothelial function, since the previous studies have been limited. Considering the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in diabetes patients and the role of endothelial dysfunction in this process, this study intended to determine the long-term administration of Vitamin C on vascular endothelial function in children and adolescents with diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The current study was a pilot randomized, double-blind study carried out at Imam Hussein Hospital in Isfahan during 2014&#x02013;2015.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were age range 5&#x02013;18 years, diagnosed with diabetes, at least 5 years of diabetes, absence of any other systemic diseases, no intake of Vitamin C in the 3 months before the start of the study, no smoking, no pregnancy, normal diet regimen (no special diet such vegetarian habit), and no suffering to dietary diseases.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The exclusion criteria were nonintake of Vitamin C or placebo during the study for any reason, failure to attend upcoming sessions, and development of any new disease during the study.</p><p>The smallest sample size was estimated to be twenty patients using the sample size formula taking into account the 95% confidence level, 80% test power, and 10% standard deviation of FMD estimated to be 0.9. The minimum significant difference between the two treatment procedures was 0.8. Moreover, the samples were selected through a convenient procedure.</p><p>After approval of the proposal and obtaining permission from the University Ethics Committee, forty patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were visited in Imam Hussein Hospital where they were diagnosed with diabetes. Having spoken with patients and their parents and having obtained their written consent to participate in the study, the patients were distributed into two twenty-member groups through randomized block design. In fact, the first patient was randomly by lot placed in one of the groups supplemented with Vitamin C or placebo while the patients were in order of inclusion distributed consecutively into the two groups until the sample size was realized.</p><p>The patients were blinded since they were unaware of the type of drug or placebo administered. Moreover, the drug or placebo was similarly supplied by an identical pharmaceutical company and then coded by a third person unaware of the study details while the project researcher was unaware of the drug specifications.</p><p>At baseline, demographic data and patient records were gathered together with heights and weights recorded in the data collection form. Before intervention, all patients were examined through echocardiography in terms of cardiac function. The endothelial function was evaluated through arterial Doppler. FMD, intima-media thickness (IMT), and chemical indices of vascular function were tested through intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAMs) and vascular cell adhesion molecules (VCAM). Before the intervention, the level of hemoglobin A1C was measured to determine glycemic control, where 7 and lower values were considered desirable blood glucose control and 7 and above values were considered undesirable blood glucose control.</p><p>Patients in intervention group were treated with 250 mg of single daily dose of oral Vitamin C. Patients in the control group received a placebo with the same shape and size of Vitamin C tablets and with the same duration.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] At the end of the 6<sup>th</sup>-month period, the tests were repeated for all patients.</p><p>Given that, many factors affect the FMD and IMT (such as medicines, food, sympathetic stimulation, etc.) patients were fast for at least 6 h before doing FMD. Moreover, the test took place in a quiet environment at a constant temperature of 25&#x000b0;C.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, all cardiovascular-effective drugs such as nitrates were cutoff for at least four half-life. Moreover, 24 h before the FMD test, prohibition was imposed on any exercise and consumption of foods containing caffeine and similar substances and high-fat foods and Vitamin K (either natural or supplementary) and folic acid. For women in the first 7 days of menstrual cycle, FMD test was not performed to reduce the impact of hormones on the test.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Patients underwent full echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac chambers, systolic and diastolic functions, valvular dysfunction, and hypertrophy.</p><p>The thickness of the carotid artery intima and media was measured through two-dimensional high-resolution ultrasound images by a 7&#x02013;12 MHz transducer of EKO 7 machine by Samsung Medison Company. The patients rested in the supine position for 10 min at room temperature 24&#x02013;26&#x000b0;C. The right carotid artery was scanned while the patient looked to the left. An artery length where intima can be clearly seen was used to measure the thickness of intima. That was repeated three times until the average thickness value was achieved for thickness of carotid intima and media.</p><p>The right-hand brachial artery located in the extension position was scanned in longitudinal cross-section of approximately 2&#x02013;5 cm above right elbow hole. Transducer was placed at an angle of 70&#x02013;80&#x000b0; to the body. Settings were made for optimum lumen artery wall. Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor was attached to the patient along with ultrasound machine. The size of the lumen was recorded at the end of diastole coincident with R wave in ECG. All images were stored in the hard drive of the echo machine. A pneumatic tourniquet was inflated on the forearm distal to the scanning area, 50 mmHg over the systolic blood pressure of the patient for 5 min. An increase in blood flow was observed by sudden emptying of cuff while the measurements from the anterior to posterior in the midline at the end of diastole were calculated again. The lumen diameter was scanned 60 s after cuff was deflated. The average vascular diameter and dilatation percentage were obtained for each patient. FMD was calculated during hyperemia as percentage increase in diameter compared with the resting period.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Moreover, after 6 months of intervention, FMD, IMT, and echocardiographic indices of heart as well as biochemical markers of endothelial function (ICAM, VCAM) were measured for all subjects.</p><p>After completion of the study, the drug codes were recognized, and the data were analyzed with SPSS 23 (IBM corporation, USA). Statistical tests used for data analysis included Chi-square (comparison of the two groups in terms of qualitative and nominal data), <italic>t</italic>-test (for comparison of continuous data between the two groups), T-paired (to compare continuous data in each group), and repeated measures ANOVA (for examining how variables changed in the two groups).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, forty patients with diabetes were examined in two groups of twenty patients receiving Vitamin C and placebo.

On the other hand, the studies have shown that antioxidants can improve the vascular endothelial function. In this regard, Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant applied in some studies. Hence, this study aimed to determine the effect of long-term Vitamin C intake on vascular endothelial function in pediatric and adolescent patients with diabetes.</p><p>Our results showed that taking Vitamin C for 6 months can affect and improve a number of echocardiographic and sonographic parameters such as EF, SF, LV mass, MPI, and FMD and the significantly higher in case rather than the control group. However, chemical parameters of vascular function including ICAM and VCAM showed no significant difference between the two groups, although changes in the level of ICAM and VCAM was higher in the intervention group than the control group.</p><p>In another study by Sabri <italic>et al</italic>. at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences on 18 patients with type I diabetes and 19 healthy children, IMT was reduced in both groups of patients and healthy subjects after taking Vitamin C for 1 month.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furthermore, FMD increased in both groups, but it was significant only in the control group. The results of this study and the previous one could indicate the fact that the use of Vitamin C may have a protective effect on endothelial dysfunction. At the same time, in another study conducted by Erbs <italic>et al</italic>., administration of Vitamin C on patients with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure was associated with improved vascular endothelial function.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In a review study by Ashor <italic>et al</italic>., evaluation of 14 randomized clinical trials demonstrated a positive effect of Vitamin C on EF, which was evident in three groups of patients with atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, and heart failure.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Moreover, the results of this study had a significant correlation with an increase in EF with the prescribed dose of Vitamin C. In another review in 2015, Ashor <italic>et al</italic>. examined the effect of Vitamins C and E to improve cardiac EF, concluding that the effect of Vitamin C; this parameter was significant and more dependent on the patient's age.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Raitakari <italic>et al</italic>. (1999) administered supplementation of Vitamin K improved vascular endothelial function in smoking patients.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Ceriello <italic>et al</italic>. showed that administration of Vitamin C in diabetic patients improved the endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress in diabetic patients.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In a study conducted by Ling <italic>et al</italic>., the postprandial serum triglyceride concentration increased significantly at 2&#x02013;5 h after the high-fat meal in all groups. The fasting FMD (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) and nitroglycerin-induced dilatation (NID) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) of patients with CHD were impaired compared with those of non-CHD subjects.

The change of NID after a high-fat meal did not reach statistical significance in the four groups. The decrement of postprandial FMD correlated positively with the increment of 2-h serum triglyceride concentration in the patients without Vitamin C (<italic>n</italic> = 62, <italic>r</italic> = 0.545, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The results of the current study showed that long-term use of Vitamin C in diabetic patients can improve certain echocardiographic and sonographic parameters such as EF, fractional shortening, MPI, and FMD, which in turn may show improvement in vascular endothelial function.
