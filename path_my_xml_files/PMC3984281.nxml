However, there is also a high overall yearly incidence (37%) of muscle cramps in the general population <xref rid="pone.0094910-Jansen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Nocturnal cramps and cramps during the day time can substantially reduce the quality of life <xref rid="pone.0094910-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Blyton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Hawke1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Further, exercise induced muscle cramps frequently impede an athlete's ability to train or even compete. Besides the hamstrings, the calf muscles (M. gastrocnemius and M. soleus) rank among the most common affected muscle groups <xref rid="pone.0094910-Jansen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Abdulla1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Leung1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To relieve acute muscle cramps, the affected muscles are usually stretched instinctively by afflicted subjects. Though this can be effective in most cases, on some occasions the muscle cramp returns after stretching, before finally subsiding. Apart from this acute-treatment, there is a lack of evidence regarding the long-term management or prevention of muscle cramps. Blyton et. al <xref rid="pone.0094910-Blyton1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, who recently published a Cochrane review on that issue, came to the conclusion that there is an overwhelming lack of evidence for non-drug therapies for lower limb muscle cramps. Despite a broad range of available therapy approaches (e.g. physical exercise, weight loss, stretching, massage, heat therapy, compression garments, night ankle dorsiflexion splints), the review identified only one randomized trial which assessed the effectiveness of a non-drug treatment on lower limb muscle cramps. This trial, though impaired by serious limitations in design, assessed the effectiveness of daytime calf muscle stretching in preventing nighttime muscle cramps <xref rid="pone.0094910-Coppin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. After publication of the Cochrane review, one additional randomized controlled trial <xref rid="pone.0094910-Hallegraeff1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> published supporting evidence of the effectiveness of calf and hamstring stretching before sleep on nocturnal leg cramps. This approach was the subject of debate in several editor's correspondences published by the Journal of the American Medical Association <xref rid="pone.0094910-Daniell1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Garrison1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Hawke2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Daniell2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In part, the insufficient evidence on effective therapy approaches might be explained by the incomplete information available on the cause.</p><p>Though the exact pathophysiological mechanism underlying the phenomenon of muscle cramps still remains unclear, different theories on this topic have been proposed and are extensively reviewed elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0094910-Minetto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. According to one of the most recent theories in that field of research, increased afferent muscle spindle activity is accompanied by decreased inhibitory activity of the Golgi tendon organ (GTO), resulting in abnormal alpha motoneuron activity <xref rid="pone.0094910-Bergeron1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. The latter is characterized by firing frequencies comparable to those observed during voluntary contractions. The neuromuscular theory is supported by the fact that muscle cramps almost exclusively occur at short muscle lengths and are relieved by muscle stretch <xref rid="pone.0094910-Bertolasi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. In the shortened position it appears that the inhibitory effect of the GTO seems to be largely depressed, while the excitation threshold of motor-endplates are contemporaneously decreased <xref rid="pone.0094910-Bergeron1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>It is well known that cramp susceptibility varies largely among healthy individuals. While some seem to be almost resistant against muscle cramps, others suffer regularly from these involuntary and painful contractions. Interestingly, it has been previously shown that cramp susceptibility is correlated with an individual cramp threshold frequency (CTF), defined as the minimum electrical stimulation frequency required to elicit a muscle cramp <xref rid="pone.0094910-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Miller et al. <xref rid="pone.0094910-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> reported a significant (p&#x0003c;0.001) lower CTF in subjects with a positive cramp history (14.9&#x000b1;1.3 Hz) than in those with a negative (25.5&#x000b1;1.6 Hz). According to previously published literature, the CTF can be increased by muscle fatigue <xref rid="pone.0094910-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> or by ice bag applications <xref rid="pone.0094910-Kawahara1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and the duration of electrically induced muscle cramps can be reduced by pickle juice ingestion <xref rid="pone.0094910-Miller3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. However, these findings are limited to acute effects, measured immediately after the respective treatment. To the best knowledge of the authors, no investigation to date has presented an effective treatment that increases the individual CTF beyond these acute alterations.</p><p>The primary aim of the present investigation was not to induce CTF changes but to examine if structural (hypertrophy) and functional (strength) adaptations differ between calf muscles stimulated either in a neutral or a shortened position (data in preparation), when stimulated above the individual CTF. This induces muscle cramps only in the shortened muscle, while fixating the ankle in a neutral position hinders the cramp development. CTF measurements were added to the testing procedures, to assess if this threshold is somehow affected by the chosen protocol. Even though we did not expect large effects on CTF, we found huge increments in CTF 96 h after the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup> training session in those calf muscles that were stimulated in a shortened position. These data are presented here.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094910.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094910.s002">Protocol S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0094910.s003">S2</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The study has been performed according to the Declaration of Helsinki and the procedures have been approved by the local institutional review board of the German Sport University Cologne.

Cramps were electrically induced unilaterally in calf muscles (CT) of the IG while sitting on an elevated platform, leaving the legs hanging down freely. The opposite leg (nCT) was stimulated with the same settings (frequency, impulse width, and intensity) in a standing upright position, but was hindered from cramping using a custom-built ankle brace, fixating the ankle in a neutral position. The CG did not receive any muscular stimulation during the intervention period, except those associated with testing procedures.</p><p>The protocol, which consisted of three sets of biphasic rectangular-wave pulsed currents at 30 Hz above the individual CTF (see below) and an impulse width of 150 &#x000b5;s, was applied twice a week on the medial and lateral head of the m. gastrocnemius of both legs using a handheld battery-powered myostimulator (Cefar Compex, Compex 3 Professional, Compex M&#x000e9;dical SA, Ecublens VD). Each set consisted of 5 s contractions, separated by a 10 s break - resulting in a duty cycle of 0.33. These 5 s contractions induced muscle cramps only in the shortened calf muscles of the CT. That is, a total of three cramps per training session were induced in CT.</p><p>To apply the stimulus trains to the muscle, a bipolar stimulation setting was used. Four self-adhesive gel electrodes (Dura-Stick plus, Cefar Compex, Compex M&#x000e9;dical SA, Ecublens VD) were placed over of both muscle heads (medial and lateral) &#x02013; one over the motor point (MP) and one over the proximal part of the muscle belly, just below the popliteal cavity. The MPs, defined as the skin area above the muscle belly at which a minimal current is able to elicit a visible muscle contraction, were localized prior to the training intervention by systematically scanning the skin with a small pen electrode (motor point pen, Cefar Compex, Compex M&#x000e9;dical SA, Ecublens VD). This search was performed at low frequency (30 Hz) and low current (2 mA) settings. Only when the MP-search was without results, was the current increased by &#x0223c;1 mA steps. The determined MP positions were marked with permanent ink and participants were instructed to refresh this mark daily.</p><p>The maximal energy (5,760,000 mA<sup>2</sup> &#x02022;&#x000b5;s) of the electrical pulses delivered by the Compex 3 stimulator is defined as the square of the maximal current (120 mA) times the maximum impulse width (400 &#x000b5;s) and each of the 1000 available energy level (EnL) represents 1/1000 of this maximal energy. Increasing the energy level at a selected impulse width of 150 &#x000b5;s is initially (up to 350 EnS) accomplished by increasing the current from 0&#x02013;120 mA. This is then followed by an increase in impulse width from 150&#x02013;400 &#x000b5;s until the maximal energy of the device is reached (from 351 to 1000 EnS). The energy of the applied impulses during training protocols was set to 85% of the maximal stimulation energy tolerated (mSET) in the shortened muscle, which was tested prior to each training day following a standardized warm-up protocol of 3&#x000d7;10 calf raises at moderate velocity. The training days were scheduled so that there was two days rest between each training session. During the mSET tests, participants were seated in the same position on the platform as for the CT. Subsequently, the investigator constantly increased the current applied to the calf of the CT leg until participants reported that their mSET was reached. The stimulation was stopped immediately and the reached current intensity was recorded. To ensure that the calves of the cramping and the non-cramping leg perceived the same amount of electrical stimulation during the study period, calf muscles of both legs were stimulated equally (i.e. the current was increased to the mSET value with the same stimulation settings) in an alternating fashion. However, during stimulation of the non-cramping leg, the ankle was fixed in a neutral position and participants were instructed to stand up and to hold an upright position (i.e. hip and knee angle at 180&#x000b0;) in order to avoid the development of a muscle cramp. The rationale for adjusting stimulation intensity to the mSET in the cramping and not the fixed neutral position was that the perceived pain during stimulation in the former position was consistently higher in all subjects tested in a pre-study (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The individual CTF, defined as the minimal electrical stimulation frequency that elicits a muscle cramp, of the medial head of the m. gastrocnemius was determined in both legs of subjects in the IG and CG as primary endpoint with respect to efficacy in cramp prophylaxis. For that purpose, impulse trains of 5 s were applied to the muscle belly via self-adhesive gel electrodes (Axion GmbH, Germany) using a portable battery-powered myostimulator (Stim-Pro X9, Axion GmbH, Germany). While the impulse width and the current intensity were held constant at 150 &#x000b5;s and 40 mA, respectively, the frequency of stimuli was gradually increased by 2 Hz following 55 s rest periods until a cramp was elicited. If no cramp was induced up to a frequency of 40 Hz, the test was aborted. In addition to the cramp sensation reported by the subject, visual inspection and palpation of the muscle belly by the investigator were used to determine if a cramp was induced at a certain frequency. During the testing procedure, participants lay prone on an examination bench with their ankle joints flexed at 120&#x000b0; and a neutral position in hip and knee joints. The participants were instructed to relax as much as possible to avoid interfering voluntary contractions. CTF tests were performed prior to (pre), midway into (mid), and at the end (post) of the six week intervention. Mid and post tests were performed 96 h after the 6<sup>th</sup> and the 12<sup>th</sup> training session, respectively. This deviates from the study protocol as we initially planned to measure the CTF every two weeks. However, in order to reduce time and effort of participants we decided to reduce the measurement frequency. The interim (midway) analysis was performed to get a closer insight into the temporal evolution of CTF changes. It has been previously shown that the applied method reliably measures the individual CTF and that this method is well tolerated in comparison to previously described neurostimulation methods <xref rid="pone.0094910-Minetto2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample Size</title><p>Due to the novelty of the applied intervention, no data from previous studies were available to estimate valid inputs for sample size calculation. However, based on the assumption that the induced muscle cramps are associated with extraordinary high intramuscular tension, we expected large effects in terms of muscle hypertrophy (data in preparation), which was the root idea of the present study. To detect a large effect (effect size f&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.5) with an alpha error probability of 0.05 and a power (1-&#x003b2; error probability) of 0.8, a required sample size of 15 was calculated.

The dose-response relationship between mSET and CTF changes was assessed by linear regression analysis, after linearity was verified by residual plot examination. In cases of heteroscedasticity of data, heteroscadicity adjusted standard errors were used, according to Hayes and Cai <xref rid="pone.0094910-Hayes1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The strength of association between mSET and CTF was estimated by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. The level of significance was set to &#x0003c;0.05 for all analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The study ended when the length of the 6-week follow-up goal was reached.

After a period of three weeks, the CTF of the calf muscles stimulated in a shortened position (CT) was significantly increased from 23.3&#x000b1;5.7 to 33.3&#x000b1;6.9 (p&#x0003c;0.001) after three weeks and 35.3&#x000b1;6.0 (p&#x0003c;0.001) after six weeks of intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0094910-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

Results after the first half of the intervention period showed that CTF values had already increased significantly only in the calf muscles that were stimulated in the shortened position (CT). It is important to note that either mid- (3 weeks), and post- (6 weeks) tests of CTF were conducted 96 h after the last training session. To the knowledge of the authors, these data are the first of its kind. As denoted introductorily, the few studies available to date reporting CTF increments were limited to acute effects, measured immediately after the respective interventions <xref rid="pone.0094910-Stone1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Kawahara1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Miller3" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>The neural mechanisms underlying these observations remain to be determined. However, according to the aforementioned neuromuscular theory, it might be speculated that set-point changes for GTO and/or muscle spindles are responsible for that observation. Usually, both proprioceptors detect deviations from set-points and thereafter influence the effector system (comprising alpha motor-neurons and extrafusal fibers) via Ia and IIb axons to return the system towards the set-points <xref rid="pone.0094910-Bear1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Against this background, cramp training may have adapted stretch sensors to forceful contractions in the shortened muscle, resulting in an increased inhibitory feedback of the GTO and/or to a decreased muscle spindle activity during contractions at short muscle lengths. This alteration would help prevent the imbalance between the excitatory and inhibitory drive to the alpha-motoneuron from muscle spindles and GTO, respectively, which has been suggested to underlie the development of muscle cramps <xref rid="pone.0094910-Miller4" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Increasing the inhibitory drive of GTOs is also used when trying to relieve an acute muscle cramp by stretching. The increased tendinous tension accompanied with muscle stretch activates the GTO which will, for their part, increase the frequency of inhibitory impulses to the alpha motor neuron <xref rid="pone.0094910-Schwellnus1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Interestingly, this method has been reported to be effective regardless of the cause of muscle cramps <xref rid="pone.0094910-Miller4" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Therefore, it seems possible that an altered GTO and/or muscle spindle set-point would be comparably effective in preventing muscle cramps. In this context it should be noted that evidence on the effectiveness of stretching to prevent cramps is contradictory. While the study from Hallegraef et al. <xref rid="pone.0094910-Hallegraeff1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> found a reduced frequency and severity of nocturnal leg cramps in older adults, Coppin and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0094910-Coppin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> concluded that stretching failed to improve those items.</p><p>Reports on adaptations in terms of altered set-points of muscle tension sensors are sparse. In cat muscles it could be shown that GTOs reliably signal whole muscle active and passive tension, even if a muscle's force production has been disturbed by fatigue or eccentric exercise <xref rid="pone.0094910-Gregory1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. This indicates that there is no set-point change following these acute disturbances. By contrast, the only available study on GTO function in humans has shown that the autogenic inhibition of muscle-force production was decreased during moderate contractions <xref rid="pone.0094910-Chalmers1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This led to the assumption that sensitivity changes of GTOs are part of the neural adaptations induced by resistance training, which results in a disinhibition and therefore, to an increased force expression <xref rid="pone.0094910-Gabriel1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. However, responses to acute and long-term influences may differ substantially. In a comprehensive review from Hutton et al. <xref rid="pone.0094910-Hutton1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> on the acute and chronic adaptations of muscle proprioceptors to an increased use, it was stated that evidence concerning adaptive responses of GTOs to chronic stimuli is non-existent. Unfortunately, at present, over 20 years later, the same statement holds true.</p><p>Changes of afferent information reaching the motor neurons, may not be required to alter the cramp susceptibility. As reported previously, persistent inward currents in motor neurons, as they occur during muscle cramping, seem to affect the relation between synaptic input and motor neuron output in favor of the latter <xref rid="pone.0094910-Minetto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This amplification of afferent input might be dampened by exercise induced adaptations. More precisely, the intra motor neural data processing may be altered as a result of the present cramp training protocol. Alternatively, neurotransmitter release from afferent fibers might be reduced despite an unchanged impulse rate in Ia and Ib axons. Interestingly, analysis of the present data revealed a distinct dose-response relationship between oEnL and &#x00394;CTF in CT legs. That is, the more energy applied to the calf muscles during the intervention, the greater subjects benefit from the stimulation regarding CTF changes. The small sample size at enrollment and the fact that in two subjects no CTF values could be determined at post- or at pre- and posttest, resulted in only eight complete data sets, on which this correlation is based. However, we found a significant difference in spite of the small sample size. Against this background, it can be assumed with reasonable certainty that the applied training energy is, in fact, of central importance to induce the desirable CTF changes. Since increasing applied energy is associated with an increase in perceived discomfort, this may limit the effectiveness of the present investigation and should be considered when balancing the benefits and harms.</p><p>Even though the results of the present study are encouraging, it remains to be determined, if the same effects can be induced in subjects that suffer from increased cramp susceptibility. Furthermore, it needs to be clarified if improvements also hold true for situations in which the muscle cramps occur due to pronounced muscle fatigue, dehydration-electrolyte imbalance, or other reasons. The time it takes to induce the desired effects by cramp training and how long the CTF increments will last remains to be determined. The present data may be limited by the fact that the onset of muscle cramps was assessed using only the sensation of subjects and the visual inspection and palpation of the muscle belly. That is, reliability of cramp detection would have possibly been improved by using electromyographic procedures, as described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0094910-Stone2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, internal consistency between pre- and posttest CTF values in CG calf muscles was found to be excellent in the present study (Cronbach alpha 0.95).</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The cramp training-induced reduction of the individual CTF found 96 h after the 6<sup>th</sup> and after the 12<sup>th</sup> training session is a novel finding. No other study to date presented a non-pharmacological approach that induced CTF increments of that duration. Therefore, the present results may be useful for developing new non-pharmacological strategies to reduce cramp susceptibility. Existing data on approaches to prevent skeletal muscle cramps concentrated on muscle stretching <xref rid="pone.0094910-Coppin1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0094910-Hallegraeff1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> and presented conflicting results. Further, these studies were based solely on questionnaires and lacked an objective measurement of the cramp susceptibility. Due to the fact that drugs, acting on the central nervous system, are frequently prescribed as a treatment for muscle cramps despite a lack of evidence for their efficacy <xref rid="pone.0094910-Minetto1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The present findings may be a meaningful and cost-effective alternative approach. Even though the present results are encouraging, they should be validated in a larger cohort of men and women. Future work in this field of research should focus on the underlying neuronal mechanisms, the durability of effect, and the minimum amount of training needed to induce comparable results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0094910.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
