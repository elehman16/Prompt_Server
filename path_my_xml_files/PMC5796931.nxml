Testing new drugs in spontaneous migraine is cumbersome and it is done outside of the hospital which makes additional study of pharmacokinetic and -dynamics difficult. A valid experimental model could test new drugs under standardized circumstances and in a short period.</p><p id="Par17">Since healthy volunteers are easiest to recruit and tablets are the preferred mode of administration of migraine treatment, we first tried to develop and validate a model in healthy subjects using isosorbide-5-mononitrate (5-ISMN) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and cilostazol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] as the headache inducing substances. In both trials, we used sumatriptan tablets to validate the model. Sumatriptan tablets had no effect on 5-ISMN induced headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and only a trend toward efficacy on cilostazol induced headache in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Consequently, we now try to develop a model in patients with migraine using cilostazol as the headache inducing substance and sumatriptan to validate the model. Previous studies have shown that cilostazol causes migraine-like attacks in 86% of patients without aura [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Cilostazol is an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) which breaks down cyclic adenylate monophosphate (cAMP). When break down is inhibited, cAMP accumulates leading to general vasodilatation. Since cAMP accumulation is the only effect of cilostazol, cAMP must be the cause of headache/migraine-like attacks after cilostazol administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Whether the headache is a consequence of the vasodilatation or due to other effects of cAMP is not known. Whether the cilostazol model in migraine patients can be used to test current and future anti-migraine medications has never been validated. In a previous study we induced migraine-like attacks in MO patients with cilostazol and the patients treated the induced migraine attacks with a triptan in an open and uncontrolled fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Patients responded well but at a late time after the provocation and perhaps due to the placebo effect. It is therefore necessary to test the efficacy of sumatriptan against cilostazol induced headache/migraine in a double-blind, cross-over study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par18">The method has previously been described in two studies on healthy volunteers by the authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p id="Par19">Thirty patients with migraine without aura were included. 23 of the patients were self-reported triptan responders and 7 were triptan-naive. Inclusion criteria were: Patients fulfilling IHS criteria for migraine without aura of both sexes, aged 18&#x02013;60&#x000a0;years and weighing 45&#x02013;95&#x000a0;kg. Females were requested to use effective contraception.</p><p id="Par20">Exclusion criteria were: Patients fulfilling any other type of headache than MO (except episodic tension-type headache &#x0003c;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;day per week), self-reported triptan non-responders, serious somatic or psychiatric disease, pregnancy, and intake of daily medication (except oral contraceptives).</p><p id="Par21">One participant dropped out for personal reasons. She was replaced with a new participant.</p><p id="Par22">After completion of the study and with the knowledge of a partly negative response of sumatriptan to cilostazol headache, we wanted to be sure that the response was not due to lack of efficacy of sumatriptan in the study population. Therefore, we contacted all 30 participants and invited them to treat their spontaneous attacks with sumatriptan in a double-blind fashion. 2 patients did not suffer from migraine anymore, 2 patients were pregnant, 2 patients never responded to our request and 9 patients declined to participate. Fifteen patients accepted to treat their spontaneous attacks, and this post ad-hoc analysis was thus slightly underpowered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par23">We conducted a double-blinded, randomized, balanced, placebo-controlled, cross-over study in which cilostazol 200&#x000a0;mg was given orally on two separate days, five days or more apart. The provocation was both days followed by oral self- administrated placebo or sumatriptan 50&#x000a0;mg. The 15 patients, who subsequently treated their spontaneous attacks in a double-blind fashion, did so at least one month after the provocation study.</p><p id="Par24">The central pharmacy of the Capital Region of Copenhagen performed the randomization of the experimental drug in a balanced fashion. The randomization code did not leave the hospital during the study and was not available to the investigators until after termination of the study. We did not break the code until data management took place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Standard protocol approvals</title><p id="Par25">All participants gave written, informed consent to participate in the study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Copenhagen (H-8-2014-009), the Danish Data Protection Agency, and the Danish Medicines Agency. The study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02486276) and was conducted according to the Helsinki II declaration of 1964, as revised in 2008.</p><p id="Par26">All participants were enrolled via the website fors&#x000f8;gsperson.dk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], through the Danish Headache Center or through patient organizations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study procedure</title><p id="Par27">The patients had to be headache free 48&#x000a0;h prior to the study and not to have taken any type of painkillers 12&#x000a0;h before beginning of the study. A pregnancy test was taken at the beginning of each study day on all fertile female participants. All participants had two separate study days at least five days apart. They arrived non-fasting at the clinic between 8:00&#x000a0;a.m. and 12:00&#x000a0;a.m. Full medical history, physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), vital signs and baseline headache were collected at arrival. All participants received cilostazol 200&#x000a0;mg orally on both study days and went home immediately after. When the participants reached headache intensity 4 on the numerical rating scale (NRS) or six hours after cilostazol, the treatment (placebo or sumatriptan) was taken. All patients were thoroughly instructed about time of medication intake and noted time of intake in a questionnaire so the authors could ensure that treatment was taken appropriately. Time of treatment was chosen as a trade-off between treating early enough (sumatriptan is most effective when taking early in an attack) and not treating before migraine mechanisms were activated. Also, we needed the patients to have a measurable degree of headache before treatment. In case of severe headache not responding to the experimental treatment, the participants were allowed rescue with their usual anti-migraine medication or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) but not before two hours after placebo or sumatriptan. According to the patients&#x02019; report, no one took rescue medication before 2&#x000a0;h after treatment (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) and we have to believe on the patients&#x02019; report.</p><p id="Par28">During the study, an emergency phone was always open where patients could call if they experienced severe headaches or discomfort.</p><p id="Par29">The 15 patients, who treated their spontaneous attacks also took the treatment (sumatriptan or placebo) when headache intensity was 4 on NRS. The participants were also allowed rescue with their usual anti-migraine treatment two hours after the experimental drug, if the headache did not respond to the experimental drug.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Headache parameters</title><p id="Par30">Headache parameters and accompanying symptoms were recorded by the investigator at baseline on a headache questionnaire. Afterward headache intensity, characteristics (unilateral/bilateral, quality and aggravation by physical activity), accompanying symptoms (nausea/vomiting, phono- and photophobia) and side effects were scored on a self-administered questionnaire. The patients had to fill out the questionnaire every 30&#x000a0;min the first six hours after cilostazol and thereafter every hour until 12&#x000a0;h after cilostazol. The intensity was scored on a Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) from 0 to 10, 1 representing a very mild headache (including feeling of pressing or pulsation), 5 a headache of medium severity and 10 the worst possible headache (10). All patients had a thorough instruction for the questionnaire. The rational for a self-administered questionnaire is feasibility of the study. Few patients would accept staying at the hospital for over 12&#x000a0;h and especially not while having a migraine attack. So for the sake of the patients, they were allowed to treat at home.</p><p id="Par31">One patient went to bed at 11&#x000a0;h. To make it possible to plot the 0-12&#x000a0;h curve, the missing data at 12&#x000a0;h were filled in using last observation carried forward.</p><p id="Par32">When the patients treated their spontaneous migraine attacks, they were instructed to fill out the questionnaire when they felt an attack and to keep doing so for at least 6&#x000a0;h after the experimental drug.</p><p id="Par33">The following criterion was used for a migraine-like attack induced 0&#x02013;12&#x000a0;h after administration of cilostazol:</p><p id="Par34">Headache fulfilling criteria C and D for migraine without aura according to the IHS criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>C.</label><p id="Par35">C.

We estimated that placebo had an effect on 20% and sumatriptan had 60% effect. Standard deviation was estimated based on previous data. The correlation between the two days was estimated conservatively at 0.5. We also assumed no carry-over effect. We calculated that at least 18 participants should complete both experimental days. Due to uncertainty regarding these assumptions we decided to include 30 participants. The area under the curve (AUC) for headache score was used as a summary measure for analyzing differences between the groups and was calculated according to the trapezium rule (12). Pain-freedom is the recommended primary outcome parameter in clinical trials, but in experimental studies it is more powerful to score pain on Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) 0&#x02013;10 and use median headache score as outcome parameter. Even though the effect of triptans is higher at 4&#x000a0;h than at 2&#x000a0;h, clinical migraine trials always study the effect of pain relieve after 2&#x000a0;h. Therefore, our primary endpoints were (1) difference in median headache intensity between sumatriptan and placebo at two hours after treatment, and (2) difference in AUC 0-4&#x000a0;h between the two experimental days. Secondary end-points were difference in pain intensity difference (PID) between the sumatriptan day and the placebo day, (PID is the difference in pain intensity at the various time points versus baseline. This will take headache score at treatment time into account (headache score varies from 0 to 6 with a median headache score at 4)), difference in median peak headache score, difference in median headache intensity between the two treatments at 4&#x000a0;h, AUC 0-2&#x000a0;h after sumatriptan/placebo and accompanying symptoms as nausea, photo- and photophobia.</p><p id="Par44">Headache intensity scores are presented as medians (range). Differences in median headache scores and AUC for headache scores were tested using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Difference in pain intensity difference between the sumatriptan day and the placebo day were tested using Mann-Whitney U test. The incidence of headache and associated symptoms were analyzed as binary categorical data with McNemar&#x02019;s test. Age and weigh are presented as means. We did not correct for multiple testing.

Thus, we confirm previous data showing that cilostazol is a very powerful headache inducing substance ideal for human experimental migraine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Unfortunately our study did not show a clear cut effect of sumatriptan on the cilostazol induced headache. Therefore this model is not suitable for the testing of novel drugs, with a mechanism of action similar to sumatriptan.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Was the lack of effect of sumatriptan due to the study population?</title><p id="Par56">Only 15 of the original 30 participants treated their spontaneous attacks. Thus, this study was slightly underpowered. Seven of the original 30 participants were triptan na&#x000ef;ve. Only 2 of the 7 treated their spontaneous attacks in a double blind fashion. These 2 patients responded well to sumatriptan. At 2&#x000a0;h after treatment, sumatriptan showed a trend towards efficacy and 4&#x000a0;h after treatment the effect was highly significant. We explain the missing effect at 2&#x000a0;h with the small sample size as it is well known that the effect of triptans is higher at 4&#x000a0;h than at 2&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The lack of sumatriptan effect on cilostazol headache is therefore unlikely to be due to insensitivity of the study population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Can we use the present model to test new acute migraine drugs?</title><p id="Par57">This study represents the third attempt to validate a pragmatic human migraine model by its response to sumatriptan. Ideally an experimental model should respond to all known specific anti-migraine drugs (triptans (5-HT1B/D agonists), CGRP receptor antagonists and 5-HT1F agonists) in double-blind trials. It is unlikely however that such an ideal model would ever be found since mechanisms of migraine are probably heterogenic. Since triptans are most commonly used and seem to perform slightly better than CGRP antagonists and 5-TH1F agonists, we have used sumatriptan as the validating drug for our model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, sumatriptan did not reduce cilostazol induced headache/migraine-like attacks in MO patients but only prevented the headache from developing in intensity. As discussed below, we suggest several explanations for the lack of response. Regardless of explanations, the model proposed in this study cannot be used to test drug candidates that act on the same level of the migraine cascade as sumatriptan. We have previously tested the effect of sumatriptan on cilostazol and isosorbide-5-mononitrate (5-ISMN) induced headache in healthy volunteers, and the results were similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In a previous study, open and uncontrolled treatment with triptans of cilostazol induced migraine at a later time point showed an apparent positive result. The present study demonstrates the importance of the double-blind design for the validation of drug responds.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Mode of action: Sumatriptan and cilostazol in the migraine cascade</title><p id="Par58">Sumatriptan exerts its effect at several sites in the migraine cascade. It 1) Causes vasoconstriction via smooth muscle 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors, 2) Hyperpolarizes afferent trigeminal fibers via 5-HT<sub>1D</sub> receptors, 3) Inhibits impulse transduction in the trigeminal nucleus via 5-HT<sub>1B/D/F</sub> receptors, 4) Inhibits CGRP release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. All these actions happen via activation of 5-HT<sub>1B/D/F</sub> receptors in the cell membrane. The receptors are coupled to G-proteins which inhibit adenylate cyclase and thereby decrease intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Cilostazol is a selective inhibitor of Phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) which breaks down cAMP and hence it causes intracellular cAMP accumulation. PDE3 is located in the trigeminal ganglion, vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelium of cerebral and extra cerebral arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].<fig id="Fig6"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>The intracellular mechanisms in a smooth muscle cell after sumatriptan, cilostazol and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) administration. Sumatriptan acts on 5HT1B/D receptors coupled to Gi receptors. This leads to an inhibition of adenylate cyclase and consequently a decrease in cAMP. Cilostazol inhibits PDE3 and thus cause intracellular cAMP accumulation. cAMP activates PKA which leads to a number of intracellular changes and in the end a relaxation and dilatation of the vessel</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10194_2018_841_Fig6_HTML" id="MO6"/></fig></p><p id="Par59">The present study showed a trend towards efficacy of sumatriptan on cilostazol induced headache in migraine patients. The same trend was also present in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and thus it seems likely that, although small, the effect is real. But sumatriptan cannot overpower the effect of cilostazol. We suggest three likely explanations for that: 1) Sumatriptan causes intracellular changes via an extracellular receptor on the cell membrane whereas cilostazol diffuses into the cell and acts directly on PDE3. In our previous study we used an NO-donor as the headache inducing substance, which also crosses the cell membrane and exerts its effect directly inside the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sumatriptan did not at all reduce that headache. Thus, it seems like the extracellular effect of sumatriptan cannot overpower compounds that intracellularly cause accumulation of second messengers (cAMP and cGMP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. 2) Since there are several pathways in the body leading to increased cAMP, the production is only partly inhibited by sumatriptan and not enough to reverse the increase caused by cilostazol. 3) The half-life of cilostazol is 11&#x000a0;h and thus the migraine inducing effect of cilostazol continued long after the treatment with sumatriptan/placebo.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>The migraine inducing properties of cilostazol</title><p id="Par60">Eighteen (60%) patients developed a migraine-like attack on the sumatriptan day and 19 (63%) on the placebo day. Fourteen patients experienced a migraine-like attack on both provocation days and thus 9 patients did so on only one of the two days. Accordingly, our migraine-induction rate is less than the 86% previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There are several explanations why the induction in our study was less than previously. 1: We gave the patients treatment on both days. 2: Since our treatment was blinded we could not use the otherwise accepted criteria &#x0201c;Headache described as mimicking the patient&#x02019;s usual migraine attack and treated with acute migraine medication (rescue medication)&#x0201d;. 3: Guo et al. showed that median time to migraine onset after cilostazol was 6&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and Khan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] reported median 5&#x000a0;h until migraine attack. In our study median time to treatment was 4&#x000a0;h and the induction potential may very well be underestimated, as additional patients may have developed migraine if treatment had been postponed. However, the aim of the study was not to investigate the headache inducing potential of cilostazol and the lower induction rate will not change the outcome of our results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p id="Par61">We calculated that 18 participants were needed and since we enrolled 30 participants, our study was well powered. Our study was placebo-controlled and, as discussed above, treatment efficacy can only be obtained by a double-blind study. Another strength is that we excluded triptan non-responders. A weakness was, however, that we included patients who had no experience with triptans. To compensate, we conducted a follow up study to test whether the spontaneous migraine attacks of the included patients responded to sumatriptan. The patients responded well and thus the lack of sumatriptan response in the provocation study could not be explained by insensitivity of the study population.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par62">Cilostazol induced headache responds poorly to oral sumatriptan and hence may not be useful for testing novel drugs acting on membrane receptors. The model is, however, useful in studies of migraine mechanisms and may be useful in the testing of novel drugs acting deeper than sumatriptan in the migraine cascade (e.g. intracellularly or directly on ion channels activated by intracellular signaling).</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par69">
