The greatest drawback of SAB is the postdural puncture headache (PDPH). In an obstetric anesthesiology closed claim study, published in the American Society of Anesthesiology newsletter, 1999, PDPH was the third most common claim, accounting for 15% of the obstetric claims.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>A postdural puncture headache is caused by leakage of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the dural hole formed by the spinal needle. Therefore, decreasing the size of the hole may be a logical solution to decreasing the incidence of PDPH, as suggested by different studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Cruickshank and colleagues have demonstrated that there is little or no dural leak with a 29G spinal needle.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, all the authors have reported both practical and manufacturing difficulties as loss of feel, danger of bending or damage even when using an introducer, and CSF is very slow to appear at the needle hub, unless aspirated.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The 25G Quincke needle, with a medium cutting bevel, is still the most popular and in widespread use, due to the ease of handling. However the incidence of PDPH is 25% with the 25G Quincke needle.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In the 1950s, Hart and Whitacre[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] suggested the use of pencil-point spinal needles, without a cutting edge, to reduce trauma to the dural fibers. Clinical[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and laboratory studies[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] have indicated that pencil-point needles may produce fewer PDPH symptoms, but none of the recent studies clearly state that Whitacre pencil-point spinal needles are better than Quincke needles, in respect to PDPH.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] We decided to compare the incidence of PDPH and find out the difference, if any, in 320 obstetric patients undergoing CS under SAB using 25G Whitacre spinal needle and an equivalent size Quincke needle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Three hundred and twenty ASA I and II parturients, aged 20&#x02013;36 years, weighing 58&#x02013;87 kilograms, with a of height 123&#x02013;174 cm, undergoing CS under SAB were recruited for this randomized double blind study, which was approved by the institutional ethical committee. A patient information sheet was given to patients attending the antenatal clinic at 36 weeks gestation. At the pre-anesthetic visit, the patients were counseled about SAB and PDPH, and written informed consent was obtained.</p><p>Exclusion criteria of the patients included contraindication to neuraxial anesthesia, history of recurrent headache, occipital neuralgia or migraine. In addition patients requiring more than three attempts of lumbar puncture were excluded from the study. Subjects were randomly (computer generated numbers inserted into opaque envelope) and evenly allocated to one of the two groups to receive SAB, either with 25G Whitacre spinal needle (group W, <italic>n</italic>=120) or 25G Quincke spinal needle (group Q, <italic>n</italic>=120). The patients were unaware of the type of spinal needle used to perform the SAB.</p><p>The patients fasted from midnight, for at least eight hours, and received oral ranitidine 150 mg the night before and on the morning of the surgery. In addition they also received 30 ml of non-particulate antacid 30 minutes prior to surgery. The patients were transported to the operation theater (OT) in the left lateral position. Before starting the anesthetic procedure monitors of pulse-oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), echocardiogram (ECG), and non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) were attached and monitored throughout the intraoperative period. An intravenous access was established with an 18G i.v. cannula in the dorsum of the left hand and preloading with Ringer's lactate solution 20 ml/kg was done in all the patients.</p><p>The patients were placed in flexed sitting position, a midline skin wheal was raised with 2 ml 2% lignocaine and SAB was performed in the L2-3 or L3-4 interspace. The bevel of the Quincke needle was inserted parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord and after penetration of the dura, the needle was rotated to make the opening in the cephalad direction. After obtaining free flow of CSF, the patients received 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine 10 mg and fentanyl 25 mcg intrathecally. The patients were then turned supine with a wedge under right hip. Anesthesia was considered adequate for surgery when there was loss of cold sensation at the T4 level, tested with ethyl chloride. In case of failure of the dural puncture or inadequate SAB, the patients were administered general anesthesia. Oxygen was administered via the Hudson mask at 4 l/minute throughout the procedure and 10 units of oxytocin given i.v. after delivery of the fetus. Mean arterial blood pressure was monitored at regular five-minute intervals. If the systolic blood pressure decreased by more than 20% from the baseline, then 300&#x02013;500 ml of colloids and incremental bolus of 5 mg intravenous ephedrine were used.</p><p>Postoperatively, all the patients were questioned for five consecutive days about the onset, characteristics, duration, and associated symptoms of any headache. The replies to the questionnaires were assessed by one of the authors who was blinded to the type of needle used. PDPH is characterized by, (1) postural, aggravated by sitting or standing, relieved by lying supine (2) frontal or occipital (3) may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, diplopia, tinnitus. If the patient's headache did not satisfy the criteria for PDPH, we excluded other serious intracranial causes of headache. PDPH was treated initially with bed rest, hydration, and paracetamol 15 mg per kg orally, four times daily. If PDPH persisted longer than 24 hours with the same severity, the decision to perform an epidural blood patch was taken by a consultant anesthesiologist. The primary objective of the study was to find out any difference in the incidence of PDPH between the two groups. The secondary objective was to find out the incidence of failure of lumbar puncture and the number of attempts required to achieve lumbar puncture.</p><p>Power analysis based on a similar previous study[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] revealed that a sample size of 160 patients per group was sufficient to achieve a power of 80% and an alpha error of 0.05 to detect a 20% reduction in incidence of PDPH (software version 2.1; 30 February, 2003). Results were expressed as a mean (SD), the number of patients or percentage of patients. Unpaired student's two-tailed was used to compare the demographic data between the two groups. The Chi square test and <italic>t</italic> test were used to find out any difference in the incidence of PDPH between the two groups. A <italic>P</italic>-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Three hundred and twenty consecutive patients posted for Cesarean section who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were included in the study.

Bier presumed that the headache was due to loss of CSF.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Later the presence of a CSF leak had been confirmed with radionuclide cisternography,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] radionuclide myelography, manometric studies, epiduroscopy, and direct visualization at laminectomy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The present trend of the anesthetic technique in CS worldwide is SAB, because it is safe to the mother and newborn, easier to perform, and has a high degree of success rate. However, among the side effects of SAB, PDPH is the most distressing one and results in increased morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, increased cost, and patient dissatisfaction. Therefore, PDPH remains a &#x02018;big problem&#x02019; for the anesthesiologist.</p><p>Obstetric patients are at high risk of PDPH because of their sex and young age.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] After delivery of the fetus, the reduced epidural pressure increases the rate of CSF leakage through the dural opening leading to loss of buoyant support of the brain, thereby causing traction on the meninges, a pain-sensitive structure. In addition as a consequence of the decreased CSF volume, there is compensatory vasodilatation and increased intracranial blood volume, according to Monro Kellie hypothesis, leading to a headache.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Obstetric patients with a past history of PDPH[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] or migraine, or requiring more than three attempts to achieve lumbar puncture were excluded from the study as they were at an increased risk of headache in the postoperative period. Therefore, the observed differences in the incidence of PDPH between the groups could be solely attributed to the type of spinal needle used.</p><p>Incidence and severity of PDPH is proportional to the rate of CSF leakage through the dural hole made by the spinal needle, so in high-risk obstetric patients, the use of finer gauge needles is justified. Even as the incidence of PDPH is 0&#x02013;2% with a 29G Quincke needle, failure of SAB is common due to technical difficulties with finer gauge needles.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Therefore, 25G, 26G, and 27G Quincke needles are in widespread use. The incidence of PDPH is 3&#x02013;25%,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] 0.3&#x02013;20%,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and 1.5&#x02013;5.6%[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] with 25G, 26G, and 27G needles, respectively. We chose the 25G spinal needle because of the technical ease of insertion over the finer spinal needles.</p><p>Kang S B and his colleagues noted that some PDPH were severe enough to require an epidural blood patch.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The therapy of epidural blood patch is invasive, cumbersome, and hazardous. Thus, there is no doubt, that prevention is a better option than definitive therapy, in case of PDPH. None of our patients in either group required an epidural blood patch.</p><p>A few authors suggested that Quincke needles, if introduced with the bevel parallel to the longitudinal axis of the dural fibers, as standard technique, could reduce the incidence of PDPH.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] However, Cruickshank and colleagues could not demonstrate any significant difference in CSF leakage by aligning the bevel of the needle either parallel or across the dural fibers, <italic>in vitro</italic>, and their observation was that the CSF leakage rate was related to the needle size.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, we chose to insert the Quincke needle with the bevel parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spinal cord, as per the classical teaching.</p><p>Several studies were carried out worldwide with different types of needle tip designs, to find out any difference in incidence of PDPH. Hart and Whitacre, in the 1950s, designed the first pencil-point needle and claimed a decrease in incidence of PDPH from 5 to 2%, using 20 gauge needles.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Vallejo <italic>et al</italic>., in their study of one thousand and two obstetric patients, undergoing elective Cesarean delivery, studied the difference in incidence of PDPH, using five different types of spinal needles, and found that the 25G Quincke needle had a higher frequency of PDPH compared to the pencil-point needles (which included 25G Whitacre). Nevertheless, they concluded that in addition to PDPH, cost consideration, ease of insertion, rate of CSF flow, and the ease with which the needle bends or breaks when excessive forward force is applied, be taken into consideration when choosing the spinal needle.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hwang <italic>et al</italic>., in their study with 93 Cesarean section patients, using 25G Whitacre and 25G and 26G Quincke needles, found that 25G Whitacre caused a lower incidence of PDPH, but their results were not statistically significant.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Shaikh <italic>et al</italic>., in their study of 480 post Cesarean section patients, used 25G and 27G Quincke needles and 27G Whitacre spinal needles and found that 27G Whitacre spinal needles had better outcomes.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These above-mentioned studies do not clearly state that pencil-point 25G Whitacre was a better option than the 25G Quincke spinal needle in respect to PDPH. We observed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of PDPH by using the 25G Whitacre spinal needle compared to the 25G Quincke needle (5% versus 28.12%, <italic>P</italic> value&#x0003c;0.001). However, there was no difference in the two groups with respect to the number of attempts of lumbar puncture, failure of SAB, and the accompanying symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The 25G Whitacre spinal needle is recommended for SAB in the CS of obstetric patients at high risk of PDPH, to reduce the incidence of PDPH. However, the cost of the Whitacre spinal needle has to be balanced against the risk of PDPH, the associated cost of a longer hospital stay, and the hazardous therapy of an epidural blood patch.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil,</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
