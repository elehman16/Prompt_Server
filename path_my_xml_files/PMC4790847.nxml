This study was an exploratory examination of whether 10 weeks of group drumming could improve depression, anxiety and social resilience among service users compared with a non-music control group (with participants allocated to group by geographical location.) Significant improvements were found in the drumming group but not the control group: by week 6 there were decreases in depression (-2.14 SE 0.50 CI -3.16 to -1.11) and increases in social resilience (7.69 SE 2.00 CI 3.60 to 11.78), and by week 10 these had further improved (depression: -3.41 SE 0.62 CI -4.68 to -2.15; social resilience: 10.59 SE 1.78 CI 6.94 to 14.24) alongside significant improvements in anxiety (-2.21 SE 0.50 CI -3.24 to -1.19) and mental wellbeing (6.14 SE 0.92 CI 4.25 to 8.04). All significant changes were maintained at 3 months follow-up. Furthermore, it is now recognised that many mental health conditions are characterised by underlying inflammatory immune responses. Consequently, participants in the drumming group also provided saliva samples to test for cortisol and the cytokines interleukin (IL) 4, IL6, IL17, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#x003b1;), and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 1. Across the 10 weeks there was a shift away from a pro-inflammatory towards an anti-inflammatory immune profile. Consequently, this study demonstrates the psychological benefits of group drumming and also suggests underlying biological effects, supporting its therapeutic potential for mental health.</p><p><bold><italic>Trial Registration</italic>:</bold> ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01906892">NCT01906892</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was carried out as part of &#x02018;Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery&#x02019;, a Connected Communities project funded by the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council (grant ref.

In the next 20 years, the global lost economic output as a result of mental health conditions will amount to $16 trillion [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>The potential of music within mental health has been recognised for nearly a century [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and there is now a large body of literature that has demonstrated improved symptoms and reduced severity of conditions, from depression to schizophrenia, in response to music [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, the majority of previous studies have taken place within specific institutions and used a music therapy model, led by a professional music therapist with specific psychological aims. A much less researched area is whether <italic>general</italic> music making within community settings, not led by therapists, can still enhance the mental health and wellbeing of service users. This is an important topic to explore, as a growing number of organisations in the UK and abroad are developing community music interventions for mental health, including Youth Music UK and the Mental Health Foundation. Research into their efficacy is needed to ascertain whether they have a therapeutic effect and to support the design and implementation of future interventions.</p><p>One of the community music interventions growing in popularity for mental health is group drumming, perhaps due to the inclusiveness of drumming circles, lack of fine motor skill requirements and strong steadying rhythms. We conducted a preliminary study that explored whether group drumming sessions across six weeks could enhance indicators of mental health [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Our results showed significant improvements in standardized, self-report measures of depression, social resilience and mental wellbeing among participants. However, as the study was uncontrolled, it was not possible to rule out changes due merely to the passing of time or to a Hawthorne effect. The current study, therefore, involved a comparison of weekly 90-minute group drumming sessions with a control group who took part in other weekly social activities but were not actively involved in music interventions. As a midway point before conducting an RCT, in order to confirm previous findings and extend the intervention protocol, we designed this study as a controlled but non-randomised experiment. As such, this is an exploratory investigation into the effects of group drumming on mental health. We lengthened the duration of the drumming intervention from 6 to 10 weeks, with the aim of assessing in more detail the impact of this activity on mental health. We hypothesized that group drumming would lead to reductions in reported anxiety, depression, and stress alongside improvements in mental wellbeing and social resilience, with no systematic changes in the control group. We hypothesized that these changes in the drumming group would be maintained 3 months following the end of the intervention.</p><p>Furthermore, research over the past two decades has demonstrated that many mental health conditions are characterized by an underlying imbalance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (proteins within the immune system), weighted towards a pro-inflammatory response. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can act as neuromodulators, orchestrating behavioural changes associated with depression [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Successful management of mental health conditions, whether through pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy or even psychosocial programmes such as reminiscence session and social activities, has been shown to correspond with decreases in pro-inflammatory cytokines and a rebalancing of the pro- versus anti-inflammatory ratio [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. There is a growing body of evidence that music can lead to immune-modulation [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there are limited data on whether music can exert the same pro- vs anti-inflammatory rebalancing in mental health service users. So, this study also included exploratory analyses of immune function, with the hypothesis that, alongside improvements in wellbeing, drumming would be associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory immune response and a shift towards an anti-inflammatory immune profile across the 10 week intervention and a reduction in the stress hormone cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Design and participants</title><p>This was a parallel group comparison of 10 weeks of drumming versus a control group who engaged in regular community-based (non-musical) social activities, with a 3-month follow-up of the drumming condition. Fifty-nine participants were recruited to the two groups of whom forty-five completed the study: 30 experimental and 15 controls. All participants were adults accessing mental health services and were recruited from hospitals, through psychologists and psychiatrists working in the National Health Service (NHS) or private practice; or through professional mental health support or carer organizations and charities. All participants self-selected to take part and contacted the study team directly. Experimental participants were recruited from West London near to the location of the intervention for ease of access. Control participants were recruited through the same channels in South and North London. To minimise potential bias, they met the same inclusion criteria but were not within the vicinity of the group drumming sessions to take part. The groups were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and employment status, within the constraints of our recruitment channels (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151136.t001">Table 1</xref>). Drumming participants were not blinded as to which study condition they were in. Control participants were told they were participating in a study about music and mental health but were not aware that they could have had access to a drumming group had they lived in West London. Staff collecting saliva samples were not blinded, but laboratory analysis was blind.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0151136.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0151136.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Baseline data.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone.0151136.t001g" xlink:href="pone.0151136.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/><col align="left" valign="middle" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Drumming (n = 30)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control (n = 15)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Difference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Female, <italic>n</italic> (%)</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (77%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (93%)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p = 0.169<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="t001fn002"><sup>a</sup></xref></td></tr><tr><td align="justify" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Age, mean &#x000b1;

Patients continued with their usual care during the intervention, but if there was a change to their care over the 10 weeks, such as commencing a new or different therapy, a change in their medication or a new diagnosis, they were retrospectively excluded from the analysis. Participants were further excluded from biological analyses if they were taking anti-depressants, steroids or anti-anxiety medication or if they had a gum disease that may cause local inflammation in the mouth (n = 3). This, along with some samples falling below the limits of detection during laboratory analysis, accounts for variations in the degrees of freedom reported.

They were split into two groups of 15&#x02013;20, and sessions ran consecutively on weekday mornings in a hired community space in West London, led by a professional drummer with experience leading community music activities and supported by three students from the Royal College of Music. Each participant was provided with a djembe drum and sat in a circle. The professional drummer taught the participants the basics of how to use the drum, led the participants in a series of &#x02018;call-and-response&#x02019; exercises where participants copied the leader, and taught the participants rhythmic patterns that were eventually employed over the six weeks in a larger drumming piece. Participants also had small sections of free improvisatory drumming creating musical accompaniment to different scenarios such as the sound of water. The professional drummer gradually increased the complexity of the drumming as the weeks went on but moved at the pace of the participants, waiting until the group was comfortable before adding more difficult elements. Talking took up an estimated 20% of the session time, as the leader explained new material to the participants, but the general teaching approach was by demonstration rather than didactic. Unlike music therapy, the professional drummer was not told details of participants&#x02019; backgrounds or psychological profiles and did not have specific psychological or therapeutic aims. His brief was rather to lead a community drumming session that suited the abilities of the participants and then teach them new techniques and rhythms to expand their drumming skills. Participants had to attend a minimum of 8 out of 10 sessions to be included in the analysis. Control participants did not take part in any group musical activities during the 10 weeks. However, to reduce the bias of having control subjects who were merely more socially isolated than the experimental group, all control subjects were already regular participants in community group social activities (e.g. quiz nights, women&#x02019;s institute meetings and book clubs) and continued with these activities for the duration of the study. No incentives were given to participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Psychological measures</title><p>Participants&#x02019; socio-demographic and mental health characteristics were obtained by means of a set of self-administered questionnaires. Our primary outcome measure was anxiety and depression, which we measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], ranging from 0&#x02013;21 for each construct with higher scores indicating poorer mental health. For our secondary outcome measures, we assessed wellbeing using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), a questionnaire used extensively as a measure of mental health ranging from 14&#x02013;70 with higher scores indicating better wellbeing [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]; stress with the Perceived Stress Scale [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which ranges from 0&#x02013;40 with higher scores indicating higher stress; and social function with the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRISC) ranging from 0&#x02013;100 with higher scores indicating stronger resilience [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Biological measures</title><p>Given recent research suggesting the promise of saliva as an alternative to blood analysis in biobehavioural research [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], this study used the technique of multiplex saliva assays for the assessment of cortisol and cytokines. As this was an exploratory analysis, biological measures were obtained only from participants in the drumming condition. Saliva was collected via a passive drool method facilitated by polypropylene straws into low-bind polypropylene 2mL cryovials (Eppendorf, UK). Sampling took place for all participants between 10am and 12noon with each participant providing their sample at the same time at each data collection point. Samples were stored at -20&#x000b0;C for a period of 2&#x02013;8 weeks before transfer to -40&#x000b0;C for one month prior to analysis at Aeirtec Laboratories. Samples were vortexed and centrifuged before analysis.

Interleukin 4 is a well-established anti-inflammatory marker [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while TNF&#x003b1; is a pro-inflammatory marker, providing representatives from both groups [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. IL6 and IL17 have both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties and have been shown to be sensitive to change in mental health service users in previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Following incubation for 24 hours, the beads were washed by filtration and then biotin-conjugated antibodies to the analytes were added to the beads for 4 hours. Following incubation with detection antibodies, the beads were washed and incubated with streptavidin-conjugated R-phycoerythrin for 45 minutes to provide a fluorescent detection signal. Following washing, the beads were analysed on a Luminex 100<sub>TM</sub> analyser. The inter-assay coefficient of variation range for all analytes was 1.8&#x02013;5.37%, and the intra-assay coefficient of variation range was 0.8&#x02013;3.58%.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size was calculated using data from the previous six-week study with the primary endpoint of depression (HADSD) which showed an effect size of f = 0.6 [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Using this effect size, an a priori sample size calculation using G*Power 3.1 for a between-factors ANOVA with an alpha of 0.05, power of 0.9 and assuming two-sided tests and a correlation of 0.8 among repeated measures (2 groups, 3 timepoints) was made which showed that an overall total of 28 participants would be required (14 per group). For the control group, to allow for drop-outs of 30% (estimated based on the six-week study), 20 participants were targeted for recruitment. For the experimental group, because of the range of biological markers being tested, we decided to match sample size with our preliminary study [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and so 39 participants were initially recruited. Recruitment was continued until these targets had been reached before being closed one week before the drumming started. Following drop-outs, 15 control and 30 drumming participants remained.</p><p>Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 21.0.1 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). Data were analysed at a group level. For psychological data, baseline scores between the two groups were compared using one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151136.t001">Table 1</xref>). Differences between groups in baseline demographic data were compared using Chi-squared test and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test. For psychological data, we used 3 x 2 repeated measures ANOVAs to examine within-subjects effects of time (baseline, week 6, week 10), between-subjects effects of condition (drumming vs control groups), and their interaction. Based on data from the preliminary study, linear effects were assumed so we used planned simple contrasts (baseline vs week 10, week 6 vs week 10) to assess within-subjects changes. Due to a difference in the baseline scores between the drumming and control groups in depression (HADSD) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0151136.t001">Table 1</xref>), these data were also analyzed with a univariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) comparing the change scores between groups from baseline to week 6 and baseline to week 10, with the baseline values as a covariate in order to confirm whether change across time was significant when controlling for them.</p><p>For the follow-up psychological data, which were collected 3 months after the end of the intervention only for the drumming group, we used two repeated measures ANOVAs with within-subjects effects of time: one ANOVA to assess whether final psychological levels were significantly different from the start of the intervention (baseline vs 3 months follow-up); and one ANOVA to assess whether final psychological levels were significantly different from the end of the intervention (week 10 vs 3 months follow-up).</p><p>For biological data, we again used repeated measures ANOVAs with time (baseline, week 6, week 10) as the within-subjects factor. The distribution of all cytokines was positively skewed, so data were logarithmically transformed prior to analysis. Given that cytokines can show rebound effects across time, we used planned polynomial contrasts to assess whether biomarkers showed linear or quadratic trends. In order to calculate TNF&#x003b1; vs IL4 response as markers of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory profiles respectively, z scores for both biomarkers were created and comparisons between them were made at baseline, week 6, and week 10 using t-tests.</p><p>For all ANOVAs, data were continuous and normally distributed (or log-transformed to achieve a normal distribution for cytokines), with no significant outliers and evidence of sphericity from Mauchley&#x02019;s test.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec008"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred and four participants were screened for eligibility and fifty-nine enrolled into two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0151136.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

(2011) who found significant improvements across 3 months of individualised music therapy with patients with depression [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, both studies found that results returned to near baseline levels (producing non-significant results compared with baseline) at follow-up 3 months after the end of the music intervention. In contrast, this study showed that results were maintained for 3 months after the end of the intervention. It remains unknown whether even longer interventions could further improve outcomes; however, given funding limitations for community interventions [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], it is promising that just 10 weeks have been shown to lead to results being maintained for three months after the end of the intervention.</p><p>A second finding of the study was that exploratory biological analyses revealed that drumming led to increases in anti-inflammatory activity. The intervention led to increases in the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL4, both between baseline and week 6 and continuing to week 10. When levels of TNF&#x003b1; and IL4 were assessed, there was a shift away from a pro-inflammatory profile towards an anti-inflammatory response. The changes noted in these cytokines are relatively small so future research remains to be carried out as to their biological significance. However, they are in line with theories of Dahl et al. (2014) who suggested that measurable improvements in mental health occur alongside shifts towards an anti-inflammatory response. It also supports and extends findings from our preliminary study [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, as TNF&#x003b1; and IL4 are also markers of Th1 and Th2 immune pathways respectively, this study suggests a shift away from Th1 responses in favour of Th2 responses, which is in line with previous studies of patients recovering from depression [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Further indications of a quadratic response from MCP1 remain to be explored further. However, this is promising preliminary evidence that drumming could modulate similar biological pathways to pharmacological, psychological and other psychosocial interventions for mental health service users.</p><p>In our previous study [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], we hypothesized that stress was a key mediator in the improvements in mental health and biological activity found across the drumming intervention. However, no significant changes were found for the Perceived Stress Scale in this study, nor was there a significant decrease in cortisol. These results are in keeping with mindfulness studies for mental health in which changes in cortisol activity have not been consistently demonstrated across longitudinal interventions despite changes in other biomarker levels, including inflammation, being noted [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Further research needs to be undertaken to explore this finding in this drumming study in more detail, as it is possible that an alternative approach to cortisol sampling, such as taking measurements across the day, would have produced different responses. However, an alternative explanation to be tested alongside this is that, given the strong improvements found in social resilience reported here, the social elements of group drumming had more of an influence on biological response than stress reduction. This would be in keeping with more general theories on the strong social interactions involved in music and the possible biological underpinnings of these [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and the influence of social support on immune function [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>This study was quasi-experimental since, due to the practicalities of recruitment, participants were not randomized. Despite recruiting through the same channels with the same inclusion criteria for both the drumming and control groups, control participants had lower depression scores at baseline than the drumming group. Although all other psychological and demographic measures were matched, a future randomized study would be helpful to confirm results. Mental health service users involved were also from a broad demographic: in keeping with the &#x0201c;community&#x0201d; aim of the drumming intervention, they were of different age groups, ethnicities, had a range of mental health diagnoses, and were at varying stages of treatment (although crucially there were no treatment changes during the course of this study). It would be instructive to focus in future work on specific subgroups, such as those with major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder, to assess where drumming interventions have the greatest therapeutic potential. For future studies, a comparison group either instead of or in addition to a control group would also help elucidate the features of the group drumming intervention responsible for change. Finally, as this was an exploratory analysis of biomarkers, saliva samples were only collected from the drumming group, and aside from excluding participants with self-reported gum disease, we did not directly assess the oral health of participants, and this may have contributed to variations in response between them [<xref rid="pone.0151136.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that group drumming can reduce depression and anxiety and improve social resilience in mental health service users over a 6- and 10-week spans. Changes in psychological profiles were found in parallel with reductions in inflammatory response and a shift towards an anti-inflammatory immune profile, in keeping with other successful mental health interventions. The study also demonstrated a longitudinal impact of drumming, both opening new avenues for research and highlighting the practicality and potentially cost-effectiveness of community drumming interventions for mental health patients. Overall, this suggests the therapeutic potential of group drumming interventions with implications for other music-based psychosocial interventions to be explored in future research. Further work will be needed to reveal a more complete picture of the viability of group drumming in clinical practice and ascertain more about the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151136.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study Protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151136.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151136.s002"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Psychological results in the drumming and control groups in weeks 1 (baseline), 6, and 10.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151136.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151136.s003"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Saliva biomarker concentrations in the drumming group in weeks 1 (baseline), 6, and 10.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151136.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0151136.s004"><label>S1 TREND Checklist</label><caption><title>Trend Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0151136.s004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was carried out as part of &#x02018;Creative Practice as Mutual Recovery&#x02019;, a Connected Communities project funded by the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council (grant ref.
