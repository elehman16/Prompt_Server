muscle weakness, loss of proprioceptive awareness, and anomalous motor control<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. These symptoms change the alignment of
axioskeletal parts in space, such as the trunk and the shoulder and pelvic girdles, altering
the distribution of weight loads on affected and unaffected lower limbs, followed by
abnormal walking and movement patterns. In particular, these changes reduce perceptual space
skills during walking and cause difficulties in maintaining an erect posture and segmental
movement of the trunk and limbs, thereby decreasing walking ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Faulty motor control interferes with the awareness of normal
movements during everyday activities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As a result, previous studies were designed to determine the best solution for restoring
postural symmetry and trunk stability, thereby improving walking function in patients with
post-stroke hemiparesis<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Trunk stabilization
training has been commonly recognized as an advantageous option for optimizing postural
trunk control and facilitating stable movement patterns during walking<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, therapeutic suits<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> and adjustable harnesses<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> have been used as main interventions to correct body alignment, and
outcomes supported the benefits of these methods for enhancing walking performance and
balance. However, despite the various benefits of these approaches, they have some
disadvantages for clinical use, including the time-consuming preparation for treatment, the
use of vertical resistance only for correcting postural alignment, and a lack of feedback
information to improve symmetrical weight load during walking.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, clinical interests have focused on selectively performing
individual treatments rather than simultaneously applying them to enhance functional
performance. Often, it might be a specific issue that afferent inputs of proprioceptive and
vestibular receptors cause changes in motor control during functional movement; therefore,
evidence should be cautiously applied to a range of therapies, and should be assessed in
clinical settings. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify the effects on walking function
in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis who underwent a novel walking training program that
provides three-dimensional postural correction and sustained visual feedback on body
alignment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixteen patients with chronic stroke volunteered for this study, and were randomly assigned

time, stride length, and stance and swing phases in the gait cycle) were measured during
treadmill walking using a gait analysis system (Functional Training System, Marpe Co., Ltd.,
Jeonju, South Korea), which consisted of a treadmill, front display monitor, connecting
cable, back camera presenting body alignment in the coronal plane, and the main computer
system. Load cells built into a baseplate under the walking belt of the treadmill system
detected foot position and weight load during a 1-minute treadmill walk, and computed gait
parameters (step length, step time, stride length, and stance and swing phases). The ratio
of the value of the affected side to that of the unaffected side for each parameter was
calculated. In addition, the subjects performed 10-m walk test (10MWT) and thus any clinical
effects of the intervention could be determined. For the 10MWT, subjects walked through a
straight, 13-m course at a comfortable speed. Testing was performed using a stopwatch (AST,
KK-5898, USA) during the middle 10-m, excluding 1.5&#x02005;m each from the first and last segments
of the course. The 10MWT has been shown to be highly reliable for clinical use<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects were randomly assigned to groups based on the blind drawing of a card from an
envelope with two cards marked &#x0201c;EG&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;CG.&#x0201d; Subjects in both groups performed 30-minute
treadmill walking, twice daily for 2 weeks. Walking speed (2&#x02013;4 m/s) was comfortably adjusted
for each subject. Additionally, for EG subjects, postural analysis while standing was
performed using equipment with a camera displaying postural alignment in the coronal plane,
and the symmetry of weight load on the foot was measured. Initial postural measurements were
used as basic information to guide the application of elastic bands for controlling body
alignment in the coronal plane, and for adjusting symmetrical weight bearing on the foot.
The monitor displayed specific information about the correction of body alignment
abnormalities, demonstrating two separate lines at a regular interval from the midline, for
defining postural deviation in the coronal plane. The subjects&#x02019; body alignment was adjusted
to maintain their postures within the lines by anchoring elastic bands into the frame of the
machine from thoracic and lumbar straps. Treadmill walking training was performed after
normal alignment was assured in the coronal plane, and feedback information on foot pressure
distribution and postural alignment were provided by the monitor during treadmill
walking.</p><p>Data analysis was performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version
20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows. Data were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard
deviation (SD). General characteristics (age, height, weight, and onset duration) of
subjects in the EG and CG were compared by using an independent t-test. A 2 &#x000d7; 2 analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with one within-subjects factor (time: pre-test and post-test) and one
between-subjects factor (group: EG and CG) was used to determine the main effects and the
interaction for the 10MWT and gait parameters. Significance level was set at p &#x0003c;
0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Outcome of the 10-m walk test and gait analysis parameters in both groups (N =

functional impairments following stroke. It is therefore important to extend the application
range of various approaches, and to provide evidence of their efficacy to the greatest
extent. Our study focused on offering additional options (postural correction and sustained
visual feedback) to enhance the clinical efficacy of the treadmill walking training program
in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis. Our findings support the clinical efficacy of
walking training with postural correction and visual feedback for patients with post-stroke
hemiparesis.</p><p>The repetitive use of faulty movement patterns during functional activities among stroke
patients has a tendency to recognize these abnormal movements in the motor area of the
brain, consequently hindering the creation of a normal motor program<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. We added two intervention options to increase the efficacy
of the walking training program: One was to modify the postural alignment of the trunk and
the shoulder and pelvic girdles. Another was to offer sustained visual feedback for good
postural alignment on the display monitor during treadmill walking. A three-dimensional
real-time display of body posture in our training system provided improved opportunities for
postural correction, with anchoring elastic bands from thoracic and lumbar straps to
maintain body alignment within a range of correction lines on the monitor. These options
aimed to allow the subjects to experience normal postural control during walking, which may
encourage normal awareness related to functional performance.</p><p>The main results of our study were that incorporating postural correction and visual
feedback into treadmill walking training improved the walking function of patients with
post-stroke hemiparesis by increasing the length of the stance phase on the affected lower
limb during treadmill walking. After stroke, symptoms contribute to changes in movement and
postural control<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and motor learning gives
way to abnormal movement patterns from an asymmetrical postural control strategy<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The creation of a biased engram in the
motor cortex acts as a factor that limits sensorimotor processing in normal movements.
Therefore, clinically, the best functional recovery results from repeated experience of
normal postural control during functional movement. In stroke rehabilitation, the
therapeutic approach is often to achieve normal movement that involves optimal
proprioceptive input and appropriate anticipatory central control while walking. Based on
this previous concept, our results may be understood as therapeutic evidence for maintaining
postural correction and sustained efforts during walking training.</p><p>Postural correction with anchoring elastic bands facilitates symmetrical weight-bearing on
both lower limbs while standing and walking, and the repetitive use of a corrected posture
during treadmill walking may reinforce normal walking patterns, and may also be associated
with increased walking velocity<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the fundamental mechanism
underlying our findings is probably reflected by the improved proprioceptive and vestibular
input resulting from optimal posture during walking, which is considered to have potential
for enhancing central control and executive process of walking movements<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, this mechanism may be
supported by sustained visual feedback related to the symmetrical distribution of foot
pressure and good postural alignment during treadmill walking.</p><p>Notwithstanding the favorable outcomes of our intervention, we acknowledge several
limitations that should be the focus of further studies. First, the small number of subjects
is a major factor that limits the generalizability of our results to the entire population.
Second, the absence of long-term follow-up data may make it difficult to state that our
findings are conclusive. Finally, this study did not provide kinematic data for subjects
during walking. Further robust studies with large sample sizes and long-term follow-up are
needed in this field.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Ryerson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Levit</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group>: Functional Movement: A Practical Model for Treatment, In: Ryerson S,
