Due to high morbidity and mechanical ventilation (MV) nowadays researchers in interested minimizing MV. To determine, in very low birth weight (BW) preterm neonates with RDS, if initial treatment with nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation (early NIMV) compared with early nasal continuous positive airway pressure (early NCPAP) obtains more favorable outcomes in terms of the duration of treatment, and the need for endotracheal tube ventilation.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>In this single-center randomized control trial study, infants (BW &#x02264; 1500 g and/or gestational age &#x02264; 34 weeks) with respiratory distress were considered eligible. Forty-four infants were randomly assigned to receive early-NIMV and 54 comparable infants to early-NCPAP. Surfactants were given, when FIO<sub>2</sub> requirement was of &#x0003e;30%.

Infantile death was similar between the two groups; in both groups, only three neonates died during the study [HR: 0.21 (95% CI: 0.02&#x02013;2.66); <italic>P</italic>: 0.23; <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>According to the data obtained from other studies, the researchers hypothesized that the addition of repeated ventilatory inflations, provided by NIMV, would improve the power of treatment of RDS and oxygenation. In this study, in the 1<sup>st</sup> days after birth, the duration of noninvasive respiratory support, during treatment of RDS, was made shorter in infants who received &#x0201c;early NIMV&#x0201d; than those who were subjected to &#x0201c;early NCPAP.&#x0201d; In spite of that, in the present study, no difference was observed in treatment failure (i.e. need to MV) between the two groups.</p><p>To our knowledge, there are a few previously published studies that have compared the effect of NIMV versus NCPAP on the duration of treatment of RDS. Kishore <italic>et al</italic>. assessed 76 neonates (28-34 weeks gestation) and found that the duration of respiratory support was not statically significant between NIPPV and NCPAP groups (44 [13.5-129] and 60 [23-154] h), respectively; <italic>P</italic>: 0.33].[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Also, Meneses <italic>et al</italic>., who assessed the duration of treatment from another point of view, was reported that total time of need for NCPAP and total time of need for nasal cannula was similar between his two study groups (<italic>P</italic>: 0.65 and <italic>P</italic>: 0.46, respectively).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Several studies have investigated the preventive effect of NIMV on treatment failure (i.e. need for MV). Meneses <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the rate of need for MV was similar between NIPPV (25%) and NCPAP (34%) groups (RR: 0.71 (95% CI: 0.48-1.14)].[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In contrast to our study, Kugelman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Kishore <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] observed that, among infants born &#x0003c; 35 weeks, less endotracheal ventilation was needed in NIMV vs NCPAP groups ([25% vs. 49%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05] and [13.5% vs. 35.9%, <italic>P</italic>: 0.02], respectively). Although, in VLBW infants, the rate of &#x0201c;failed nasal support&#x0201d; did not differ significantly between the two groups (31% vs. 62%, <italic>P</italic>: 0.06) in Kugelman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In the review of other studies, that caught the attention of the researchers was the significantly less requirement for MV in both groups of the present study, compared to others (4.5% in the NIMV group 1.9% in the NCPAP group). Perhaps the cause of greater levels of need for MV (i.e. treatment failure) in other RCTs was the lower GA and BW in those studies (e.g. GA and BW, respectively, in NIMV vs NCPAP groups: (29.0 &#x000b1; 1.4 vs. 28.2 &#x000b1; 1.9 weeks) and (1155 &#x000b1; 193 vs. 1039 &#x000b1; 238 g) in Kugelman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and (29 &#x000b1; 1.6 vs. 30.1 &#x000b1; 2.3 weeks) and (1112 &#x000b1; 252 vs. 1151 &#x000b1; 289 g) in Meneses <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Nevertheless, in some instances the means of GA and BW were similar between ours and other studies (e.g. mean of GA and BW in the control groups between us and Meneses <italic>et al</italic>.).</p><p>Informed of the result of NIMV effect on the duration of oxygen requirement is attractive.</p><p>Bhandari <italic>et al</italic>. found that the total duration of supplemental oxygen was similar between SNIPPV vs. MV groups at RDS treatment (45.5 &#x000b1; 6.1 vs. 46.8 &#x000b1; 6.3 days; <italic>P</italic>: 0.88).[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In Kishore <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to treat RDS, premature infants less than 35 weeks were assigned to two groups of SNIPPV or NCPAP and the results were compared. In NIMV, it was shown that the length of oxygen dependency during hospitalization was not shorter than NCPAP and so did not have statistical significance (72 [15, 156] 72 [36, 240] h; <italic>P</italic>: 0.39).[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Also, no significant difference of total time of need to oxygen was found between NIPPV and NCPAP groups, in Meneses <italic>et al</italic>. (20.4 &#x000b1; 16 and 23.6 &#x000b1; 22.6 days; <italic>P</italic>: 0.97).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, in the present study, the median of duration of need to oxygen in the NIMV group was significantly shorter although no significant difference was observed in the incidence of CLD between two groups (similar to Kishore <italic>et al</italic>. study, i.e. 2.7% and 7.7% in NIPPV and NCPAP group, respectively; <italic>P</italic>: 0.61[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended, to further investigate the issue.</p><p>The effects of NIMV on hospitalization time and time to full enteral feeds have also been investigated. In most of the previous studies, duration of hospital stay was not significantly different between the two study groups; e.g. duration of hospitalization in NIPPV vs NCPAP was 21 (12.5-35) vs. 23.5 (11-40) days; <italic>P</italic>: 0.77, 55.9 &#x000b1; 20.5 vs. 53.9 &#x000b1; 19.15 days; <italic>P</italic>: 0.45 and 63 &#x000b1; 23 vs. 81 &#x000b1; 36 days; <italic>P</italic>: 0.16 in Kishore <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Meneses <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Kugelman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] respectively, while in the present study, perhaps due to significant differences between the two groups in the course of noninvasive respiratory support, hospitalization time was more favorable in the NIMV group (21.59 &#x000b1; 10.57 vs. 28.77 &#x000b1; 15.85 days; <italic>P</italic>: 0.009). Furthermore, Meneses <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Kugelman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] have shown that using NIPPV had no positive effect on &#x0201c;time to full enteral feeds&#x0201d; (<italic>P</italic>: 0.49 and <italic>P</italic>: 0.54, respectively). In in the present experiment and some other studies,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in terms of side effects, such as the incidence of pneumothorax, no difference was found between the two study groups.</p><p>Finally, it appears that, further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to investigate these issues in more detail.</p><p>The major limitation of the study could be the rather small number of the infants included (98 premature neonates), even though the results clearly indicated a significant difference between the NIMV and control groups. The strengths of the study include the RCT design in high-risk neonates (i.e. VLBW infants) and initial treatment of RDS with NIMV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Initial treatment of RDS with NIMV was safe and well tolerated. Furthermore, NIMV had excellent benefits, such as reducing the duration of treatment, oxygen dependency period and length of hospital stay. Therefore, the primary mode with NIMV could be a feasible method of noninvasive ventilation in very premature infants. Although further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended to investigate these issues.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> This paper is derived from a residency thesis No. 392345 in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.
