Additionally, they gave advice on drug selections in view of therapeutic guidelines, the national essential medicine list and national basic insurance medicine catalogs, provided pharmacokinetic consultations and drug information for physicians and nurses, checked prescriptions and communicated with physicians about any medication errors, reviewed the indications, directions for use, and possible adverse effects of each discharge medication and gave discharge education to patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>2.3.2 Control group</title><p>Patients randomized to the control group were treated following the traditional medical model, in which physicians and nurses were responsible for treatment and clinical pharmacists were excluded from pharmacotherapy and discharge education.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>2.4 Primary outcomes</title><sec id="s2d1"><title>2.4.1 Interventions by clinical pharmacists</title><p>Three types of interventions were documented by two clinical pharmacists: 1. answering questions of physicians and nurses; 2. suggestions of treatment; 3. prevention of medication errors. Answering the questions of physicians and nurses meant that clinical pharmacists gave an accepted answer to questions related to drugs by physicians and nurses. Suggestion of treatment referred to advice by clinical pharmacists on patient's treatment which was adopted by physicians. Prevention of medication errors meant that clinical pharmacist checked the prescriptions and noted the medication errors which were corrected by physicians. Of the 109 interventions, 46 were on antibiotics, accounting for 42.2&#x00025;; 21 on drugs for digestive system, 18 on drugs for respiratory system, 13 on drugs for nerve system, 4 on glucocorticoid, 4 on drugs for dermatopathya, 2 on electrolyte and 1 on drug for hematologic system. This measurement was not only the different interventions between experimental group and controlled group but also the crucial factor relative to repeatability and reproducibility of this trial. The clinical pharmacists did not participate in the treatment of patients in controlled group, so we only recored the interventions in patients in experimental group.</p></sec><sec id="s2d2"><title>2.4.2 The number of adverse drug reactions (ADR)</title><p>Clinical pharmacists detected ADRs in the experimental group while the physicians and nurses detected that in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="s2d3"><title>2.4.3 Length of stay</title><p>Length of stay (LOS) refers to the number of days staying in hospital from admission to discharge.</p></sec><sec id="s2d4"><title>2.4.4 Cost of drugs</title><p>Cost of drugs includes total charges of Western medicines and Chinese traditional medicines.</p></sec><sec id="s2d5"><title>2.4.5 Cost of hospitalization</title><p>Cost of hospitalization is defined as total charges in the hospital, including cost of drugs, examining and nursing care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>2.5 Secondary outcomes</title><sec id="s2e1"><title>2.5.1 Compliance rate</title><p>The method by Williford and Johnson <xref rid="pone.0030856-Williford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> was adopted in terms of measurement of compliance rate.

Statistical software SPSS 16.0 was used for all analyses. Continuous parametric length of stay, compliance rate and readmission rate were analyzed by student's t-test. The values, like age of patients, cost of drugs and hospitalization, which were not normal distribution were analyzed by nonparametric test Wilcoxon rank sum test. Discrete data was analyzed with chi-square test. Results with a p value&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant. Subgroup analysis was adopted for LOS according to different types of diseases such as nerve system disease, digestive system disease and respiratory system disease. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between compliance rate and age of patients, number of discharge drugs and time of follow up. Of the seven indexes, interventions of clinical pharmacists were descriptive index, and thus could not be counted in as samples. While it was reported in some literatures that rate of ADR decreased in the group with clinical pharmacists, other studies found that with interventions of clinical pharmacists, the rate increased. Thus, We could not determine whether interventions of clinical pharmacists could decrease the rate of ADR It was the same case for the length of stay; in terms of cost of drugs and hospitalization,which was nonparametric distribution data, they were lack of mean value. Therefore, compliance rate alone was used to power calculation.</p><p>Compliance rate was reported to be 75&#x00025; in the literatures <xref rid="pone.0030856-Williford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030856-Nikolaus1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In our study, clinical pharmacists in pediatric unit were trying to improve the compliance rate to 95&#x00025;.

Inclusion procedures are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0030856-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The 160 patients were randomly allocated to the experimental group and the control group, with 80 in each group. In the experimental group, after two patients gave up treatment and another two were transferred to other department, only 76 patients received clinical pharmacists' intervention. In the control group, after four patients gave up treatment and another two were transferred to other department, only 74 patients received usual care. In the phase of follow-up, 16 experimental patients were discharged without drugs and 2 could not be contacted, so only 58 received an interview. Comparatively, 12 patients from the control group were discharged without drugs and 5 could not be contacted, so 57 received an interview.

This result suggested that interventions of clinical pharmacists in pharmacotherapy could not reduce rate of readmission.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study is the first randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of clinical pharmacists in pediatric hospitalized patients. It showed that on the one hand interventions by clinical pharmacists on pharmacotherapy of pediatric patients were associated with a significantly shorter LOS and a higher compliance rate after hospital discharge. On the other hand, no differences were seen in rate of ADR, cost of drugs and hospitalization or readmission rate. The shorter LOS in patients of the experimental group, especially in the patients with respiratory system disease, may be attributed to suggestions of treatment, and higher compliance rate after discharge was a result of discharge education provided by clinical pharmacists.</p><p>Clinical pharmacists included into our study had fixed work hours. In the morning shift, they became familiar with history of present illness and drugs taken for newly admitted patients. Then they made rounds with the pediatric team, provided suggestions of treatment, checked the prescriptions of physicians, gave consultations to discharged patients. Afterwards, they stood by for calls throughout the day. The schedule of clinical pharmacists in the study was similar to that reported by Leape <xref rid="pone.0030856-Leape2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> which investigated pharmacist participation on physician rounds in the intensive care unit. In their study, Krupicka et al. reported that clinical pharmacists worked for 5 days a week with weekend services provided in a centralized location. The clinical pharmacists attended morning rounds at least twice per week <xref rid="pone.0030856-Krupicka1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, which was less than that in our study.</p><p>Percentage distribution of clinical pharmacists' time in each intervention was not calculated in our study. However, it was estimated that clinical pharmacists spent 80&#x00025; of their working time in providing suggestions, checking the prescriptions, doing rounds of the ward and giving consultations to the patients. Gibson <xref rid="pone.0030856-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> reported on distribution of time use by clinical pharmacists in a pediatric unit: checking doses in patient trays for correctness and new physician's orders covered 17.5&#x00025;, respectively; 12.5&#x00025; time was spent in reconciling pharmacy patient profile with nursing, reference research for drug information, checking unit dose injections and nursing station visits and supplying first doses covered 10&#x00025;, answering questions from nursing staff, reading patient medical records, calculating pediatric doses, and dispersing prescriptions for patient discharge covered 5&#x00025;. Only 2.5&#x00025; time was spent in providing suggestions for doctors.</p><p>109 interventions were documented in 4 months in our study, comparatively less than other studies completed abroad. Kucukarslan et al. <xref rid="pone.0030856-Kucukarslan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> reported that more than 150 interventions were provided by clinical pharmacists in 3 months. Koren et al. <xref rid="pone.0030856-Koren1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> documented 390 interventions conducted within 2 months in her studies while Strong and Tsang <xref rid="pone.0030856-Strong1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> provided 361 interventions within 2 weeks.</p><p>Two factors could be proposed to explain these findings. First, other studies included more patients than our study did. For example, pharmacist: patient ratio was approximately 1&#x02236;15 in Kucukarslan et al.'s study <xref rid="pone.0030856-Kucukarslan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Second, clinical pharmacists in our study spent less time on clinical treatment, Kucukarslan et al. and Krupicka et al. documented all interventions that occurred during the shift from 7:00 am to 3:30 pm <xref rid="pone.0030856-Krupicka1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030856-Kucukarslan1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, while clinical pharmacists in our study were available on call in the afternoon.</p><p>Among the 31 suggestions made by clinical pharmacists, 30 (96.77&#x00025;) were accepted by the treating physicians. Similarly, of the 48 interventions recorded by Virani and Crown <xref rid="pone.0030856-Virani1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, 47 were adopted. Condren et al. <xref rid="pone.0030856-Condren1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> reported that during 12 months 91&#x00025; of 4605 interventions performed for 3978 patients were accepted by the physicians. A lower acceptance rate of 80&#x00025; was reported in a study by Guy et al. <xref rid="pone.0030856-Guy1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These findings demonstrated that reasonable suggestions provided by clinical pharmacists are generally accepted by physicians.</p><p>During the trial, 31 medical errors in 684 prescriptions were detected by clinical pharmacists. The frequency of errors was 4.53&#x00025;, which was higher than other studies. A study conducted by Folli et al. <xref rid="pone.0030856-Folli1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> in two large children's hospitals in the US found the frequency of errors was 4.9 and 4.5 errors per 1000 medication orders. Similar to our study, the frequency of order errors declined as physician training status increased. The frequency of errors in Riley Hospital for Children and Indiana University Hospital was 2.66&#x00025; (1277/48034) and 1.34&#x00025; (1012/75333), respectively. The most common types of errors in our study were prescription and preparation errors while the most common types in other studies were wrong dose and inappropriate dosage schedule <xref rid="pone.0030856-Krupicka1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030856-Strong1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>Of the five ADR, four were detected in the hospital, and one was detected during follow up. The incidence rate of ADR, 3.33&#x00025;, was less than the overall, 6.20&#x00025;, as reported in a systematic review <xref rid="pone.0030856-Impicciatore1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. This suggests that more attentions should be paid to ADRs in children.</p><p>Like the other three studies, our findings demonstrate the significant role of clinical pharmacists in reduction of LOS of patients. The three randomized trials demonstrated that participation by clinical pharmacists in pharmacotherapy could reduce length of stay by 1.3 days (18.05&#x00025;), to 4.4 days (30.35&#x00025;), which was statistically significant <xref rid="pone.0030856-Haig1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030856-Gums1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. One controlled study on a large sample (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;7219) showed that clinical pharmacists could reduce LOS by 2.4 days (18.18&#x00025;), which was statistically different <xref rid="pone.0030856-Gentry1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. A retrospective study showed that clinical pharmacists reduced LOS by 5.99 days (31.39&#x00025;), but in the study only 23 cases were included as interventions <xref rid="pone.0030856-Destache1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Nevertheless, some studies still show that participation of clinical pharmacists in pharmacotherapy does not cause a statistically significant decrease in LOS <xref rid="pone.0030856-Smythe1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030856-Lipton1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Research by Lal, Anassi and McCants <xref rid="pone.0030856-Lal1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> demonstrated that clinical pharmacists participating in pediatric pharmacotherapy conducted 504 interventions, which reduced LOS from 4.38 days to 4.26 days. Through analysis of results in the subgroup, we found that with participation of clinical pharmacists in treatment of patients with respiratory diseases LOS in the two groups was statistically different, while in treatment of patients with neurological and digestive diseases, LOS was not statistically different. The result may be caused by the fact that over 50&#x00025; of the more than 100 interventions were related to drugs on respiratory system and that most treatment suggestions were on the use of antibiotics.</p><p>With different costs of treatment for different diseases, costs of drugs and hospitalization in the study differed from a normal distribution. Results by nonparametric test showed no significant differences. Conversely, research abroad demonstrated that participation of clinical pharmacists in treatment could reduce costs of drugs and hospitalization and that there were significant differences <xref rid="pone.0030856-Clapham2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. A study by Lal, Inassi and McCant <xref rid="pone.0030856-Lal1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> on pediatric clinical pharmacists showed that with clinical pharmacists' participation, the cost of treatment of a pediatric inpatient during 6 months had been reduced by $7227. 83, which significantly demonstrated the economical efficiency of participation of clinical pharmacists in drug treatment of patients.</p><p>Failure to comply with medication instructions commonly led to serious adverse outcomes, and noncompliance after discharge may place patients at risk for suboptimal response and toxic outcomes, including readmission to the hospital <xref rid="pone.0030856-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030856-Col1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Patient education before discharge has been recognized a valuable method to improve compliance of patients <xref rid="pone.0030856-Woroniecki1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030856-Cole1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Our study demonstrated that patient education could increase the compliance rate by 16.02&#x00025;, which was close to the results of the other three randomized controlled trials <xref rid="pone.0030856-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030856-Lipton2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we did not find any linear relationship between compliance rate and the age of patients, time of follow-up and number of discharge drugs. Other studies demonstrated a major factor associated with noncompliance in discharged patients was the complexity of the prescribed regimen <xref rid="pone.0030856-Williford1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030856-Edwards1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Several reasons could be considered. First, the people interviewed in follow-up were families of patients. Secondly, the time of follow-up was fixed, approximately 3 to 4 days after discharge. Thirdly, most patients were prescribed comparatively fewer drugs upon discharge, from one to six.</p><p>Readmission rate in two weeks after discharge in our study was 9.1&#x00025; and 13.2&#x00025; in experimental and control group, respectively. Different readmission rates have been reported in different diseases, from 4.58&#x00025; to 39&#x00025; <xref rid="pone.0030856-Gums1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030856-Bjornson1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0030856-Nazareth2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Different time of follow-up was also associated with readmission rate. Al Rashed <xref rid="pone.0030856-AlRashed1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> reported that readmission rate in two or three weeks after discharge was 11.6&#x00025; in experimental group and 32.5&#x00025; in the control group. There was significant difference between the two groups. No significant difference was showed in the readmission rate at 30 days or 3 months after discharge in both groups <xref rid="pone.0030856-Bjornson1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0030856-Nazareth2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>.</p><p>Seasonal bias was little in our trial. Our trial lasted five months, (December 2010&#x02014;April 2011), from winter to spring. We investigated the diseases of patients in the department for incidence of diseases in summer and autumn. The result showed that there were 374 cases in summer and 363 ones in autumn. Of the cases in summer, 194 were nerve system disease, 112 respiratory system diseases, and 66 digestive system disease. Comparatively, of the cases in autumn, 198 were nerve system diseases, 86 respiratory system diseases and 79 digestive system diseases. Incidences of diseases of nerve system, respiratory system and digestive system in the four seasons were not statistically different. <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.114.</p><p>There are still limitations in our study. First, clinical pharmacists did not participate in treatment of patients in the control group, but in fact, clinical pharmacists also provided suggestions for patients in the control group when the physicians consulted them, which led to contamination and interference of results of the two groups. Second, the clinical pharmacists also participated in treatment of patients with serious disease who were excluded in the trial, but the interventions were not documented. Therefore, the number of interventions was more than what were recorded in this trial. Third, the power of test in patients with nerve system disease and digestive system disease were 0.29 and 0.1 respectively, indicating that the sample size was not enough. Nevertheless, as this trial was only an exploratory study, we will expand the sample size in the subsequent studies to observe whether difference exists</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusion</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The participation of clinical pharmacists in pharmacotherapy of pediatric patients can reduce length of stay of patients with respiratory system disease and improve compliance rate through discharge education.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our study did not find significant effect of clinical pharmacists on prevention of ADR, reduction of cost of drugs and hospitalization or readmission rate in two weeks.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0030856.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
