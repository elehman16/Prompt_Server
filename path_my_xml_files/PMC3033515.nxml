Ecstasy users typically are polydrug users in that they combine the use of ecstasy frequently with that of alcohol or cannabis (Barrett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2005</xref>; Boys et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>; Gouzoulis-Mayfrank and Daumann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2006</xref>; Parrott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2007</xref>).</p><p>MDMA is a psychostimulant that produces euphoria, enhanced sociability and a sense of increased empathy (de la Torre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). Although alcohol has both arousing and sedating effects that are dose-dependent with high inter-individual variability, at high blood alcohol concentrations (BAC&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.5&#x000a0;g/L), alcohol generally causes sedation (Gulick and Gould <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>). Cannabis produces relaxation, feelings of happiness and increased sensory perception, but it may also produce dizziness and feelings of depression (Green et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2003</xref>).</p><p>In the brain, MDMA increases the levels of available serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine (Colado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>; Liechti and Vollenweider <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2001</xref>; Mlinar and Corradetti <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2003</xref>; Pifl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1995</xref>; Sprague et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2004</xref>). MDMA is usually ingested orally and rapidly absorbed. Plasma levels peak at 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;h after drug intake, and maximum behavioural and subjective effects occur around the peak plasma levels (de la Torre et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>; Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009a</xref>).</p><p>Alcohol has direct and indirect effects on multiple neurotransmitter and neuropeptide systems (Little <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1999</xref>; Vengeliene et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2008</xref>), such as the inhibition of glutamate and enhancement of inhibitory GABA neurotransmission. Oral administration of a single dose of alcohol results in a highly variable increase of BAC with maximal plasma concentrations occurring 30&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min after ingestion, after which BAC decline steadily at an average rate of roughly 0.15&#x000a0;g&#x02009;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>The major active compound of cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; Ilan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>). THC is an agonist for cannabinoid receptors (particularly CB1). After inhalation, THC is rapidly distributed from the blood into the brain and other lipophilic tissues, for which it has a high affinity. Consequently, peak plasma levels are reached within several minutes and show a rapid decline reflecting redistribution, whereas subjective and cognitive effects of cannabis inhalation peak around 15&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min and last for several hours (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010c</xref>; Strougo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2008</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the central effects of a high dose of alcohol are generally sedative, and consequently lead to non-specific cognitive impairments, THC and MDMA affect cognition more specifically. The cognitive effects of THC generally include, but are not restricted to, impairment of memory and psychomotor function and subjective relaxation and sedation (Zuurman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>). MDMA stimulates psychomotor speed but not accuracy and impairs memory function (Kuypers and Ramaekers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2007</xref>; Lamers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>). Although many reports addressed the acute cognitive effects of MDMA, a review by our group concluded that effects reported were generally small and inconsistent across studies (Dumont and Verkes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>).</p><p>Since ecstasy (MDMA) is commonly used in combination with cannabis (THC) or alcohol (ethanol), it is important to examine the effects of the co-administration of MDMA and ethanol or MDMA and THC on subjective feelings and cognitive and psychomotor performance. In two separate studies, Dumont et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010c</xref>) addressed this issue. Although co-administration of MDMA with ethanol reversed subjective feelings of reduced alertness caused by alcohol, MDMA did not affect ethanol-induced delays of psychomotor speed (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). Combined intake of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the impairment in memory or psychomotor performance (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). Whereas MDMA stimulates psychomotor speed, co-administration of MDMA with THC could not significantly reverse the drowsiness or the impairments of psychomotor speed produced by THC (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010c</xref>). Similar to the combined intake of MDMA and ethanol, co-administration of MDMA with THC did not appear to exacerbate the impairments of memory (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010c</xref>).</p><p>The current paper will address the effects of these drug combinations on electroencephalogram (EEG), a parameter of brain function. EEG can be used to get more insight into ongoing EEG oscillations, which are a manifestation of neuronal oscillations. EEG oscillations may be related to a variety of factors such as levels of alertness (Oken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2006</xref>) and information processing (e.g., Klimesch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>) and are affected by drug intake. For example, drowsiness during an eyes closed resting condition is associated with increased theta power and decreased alpha and beta power (Oken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2006</xref>). Furthermore, a role of EEG oscillations in human information processing such as attention, active inhibition, memory and integrative functions has been demonstrated (Klimesch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>; Knyazev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>; Sauseng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). For example, a higher memory load in a working memory task has been related to increased theta and alpha power. Based on these and other findings, it has been suggested that theta oscillations play a role in memory functions and alpha oscillations in the active inhibition of visual processing (Jensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>; Jensen and Tesche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2002</xref>). Psychoactive substances also affect EEG oscillations (Mitchell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>).</p><p>Only few studies examined the effects of the administration of MDMA, THC and ethanol on electrocortical activity during a resting state (i.e. ongoing EEG oscillations), and the effects of the co-administration of MDMA with either THC or ethanol have not been addressed so far. To our knowledge, only one published study investigated the acute effects of MDMA on EEG power during a resting condition in MDMA-naive volunteers, revealing decreased theta and alpha power after MDMA administration (Frei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>).</p><p>Regarding THC effects on EEG power, the most consistent finding after acute cannabis administration is decreased theta power (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Ilan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>; Zuurman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2010</xref>). THC effects on alpha power are more variable, varying from increased alpha power (but only during a state in which THC induced feelings of euphoria; Lukas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1995</xref>) or no effects on alpha power (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Ilan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>; Zuurman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2010</xref>) during a resting state. The decrease in theta power after cannabis use was dose-related and correlated with decreased working memory performance (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). It has been speculated that decreased theta power after cannabis administration reflects the desynchronization of ongoing theta oscillations, which interferes with phase resetting of theta that is needed for optimal memory performance (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). Another explanation that has been proposed is that theta power attenuation after cannabis intake may reflect increased activity of the default mode network (DMN), which interferes with information processing (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). The DMN is a group of brain areas that are functionally related, active during rest and deactivated during externally directed behaviour (Greicius et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>). It is hypothesized that activity in the DMN reflects mind wandering or internally oriented attention. However, the relation between theta oscillations and activity in the DMN has not been fully established, and activity in the DMN has also been related to alpha and beta oscillations and alpha synchronization (Jann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>; Laufs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>).</p><p>The effects of acute ethanol intake on EEG power have been investigated more intensively (Little <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1999</xref>). The acute administration of ethanol consistently increases theta and alpha power (particularly within the lower-1 alpha frequency range, 8&#x02013;10&#x000a0;Hz; e.g. Ilan and Gevins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2001</xref>; Lukas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1986</xref>; Stenberg et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1994</xref>; Tran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>), although alpha power returned to normal levels 60&#x000a0;min after ethanol administration (Lukas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1986</xref>). Increased alpha power after alcohol consumption has been shown to correlate positively with feelings of euphoria (Lukas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1986</xref>). Furthermore, a reduction in peak power frequency for theta and lower-2 alpha (Ehlers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1989</xref>) has been demonstrated with alcohol consumption.</p><p>In summary, whereas the administration of MDMA alone or THC alone decreases theta power, intake of ethanol alone increases theta power. Similar patterns have been found for alpha power, which decreases after MDMA and increases after ethanol. The question remains whether combined intake of MDMA and THC or ethanol has an additive effect or an interaction effect on theta and alpha oscillations. In two separate prospective placebo-controlled within-subject studies, we aim to assess the effects of acute administration of MDMA on electrocortical power, alone and in combination with ethanol (study 1) or THC (study 2).</p><p>Based on previous EEG studies, we expect that MDMA decreases theta and alpha power, THC decreases theta but not alpha power, and ethanol increases theta and alpha power. The question remains whether ethanol could counteract the MDMA effects on theta and alpha power and whether MDMA and THC would exacerbate the theta power attenuation after a single drug intake.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>Data were collected in two separate studies that have already been described in detail in recently published papers: (a) study 1: MDMA &#x000d7; ethanol interaction study (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>) and (b) study 2: MDMA &#x000d7; THC interaction study (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010c</xref>).

In both studies, participants arrived in the morning and were offered a light breakfast after a negative urine drug screen (opiates, cocaine, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, methamphetamines and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol) as well as a negative alcohol breath test and recording of signs and symptoms of possible health problems. EEG data were acquired at 1000&#x000a0;hours, 30&#x000a0;min prior to the first drug administration. Drug administration (MDMA or placebo capsule in study 1; MDMA or placebo capsule and THC or placebo inhalation in study 2) was scheduled at 1030&#x000a0;hours. The ethanol or placebo infusion in study 1 was started at 1100&#x000a0;hours for a duration of 3&#x000a0;h. The second THC or placebo inhalation in study 2 was administered at 1200&#x000a0;hours. In both studies, post-assessment of EEG was conducted at 1230&#x000a0;hours, at the time around the peak concentration of MDMA (2&#x000a0;h). Since subjective and cognitive effects of THC have been shown within 15&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min after administration, the second THC inhalation was administered 30&#x000a0;min prior to the EEG data acquisition.

Ethanol (or glucose 5% as its placebo) was administered continuously by intravenous infusion of 10% ethanol in 5% glucose solution, aimed to maintain an ethanol blood concentration of 0.6&#x02030; (0.6&#x000a0;g/L) for 3&#x000a0;h. The alcohol clamp was targeted at 0.6&#x02030;, by which we aimed to provide the equivalent of approximately two to three alcoholic beverages. This concentration is just above the legal limit for traffic participation in many Western countries and commonly used in social settings as it is considered to be a safe and relatively moderate level despite significant CNS effects (Zoethout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2009</xref>). The infusion rate was calculated using frequent breath alcohol concentration measurements, according to a previously designed algorithm (Zoethout et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2008</xref>). Breath alcohol concentration was assessed using a HONAC AlcoSensor IV&#x000ae; Intoximeter. The process was semi-automated using a computer spreadsheet programme which uses changes in the measured breath alcohol concentrations to calculate the infusion rate that is needed to maintain the ethanol level at 0.6&#x02030;. The operator of the breath alcoholmeter and the ethanol infusion pump was unblinded for alcohol treatment, but did not communicate with the study team or the participant about the results at any stage during the trial and was not involved in the analyses.

THC was stored in the dark at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C in 1-mL amber glass vials containing a Teflon screw-cap secured with Parafilm to minimize evaporation. The solvent was used as placebo.</p><p>On each study day, THC (4, 6 and 6&#x000a0;mg) or placebo was administered at 90-min intervals by inhalation using a Volcano&#x000ae; vaporizer (Storz-Bickel GmbH, T&#x000fc;ttlingen, Germany), a validated method of intrapulmonary THC administration (Abrams et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Hazekamp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2006</xref>; Zuurman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>). The same regimen was also used with MDMA administration where 4&#x000a0;mg THC was administered together with MDMA and the two subsequent doses of 6&#x000a0;mg of THC were administered 90 and 180&#x000a0;min after MDMA administration. Within 5&#x000a0;min before administration, THC was vaporized at a temperature of about 225&#x000b0;C and the vapour was stored in a polythene bag equipped with a valved mouthpiece, preventing the loss of THC between inhalations. The transparant bag was covered with a black plastic bag to prevent unblinding. The personnel responsible for drug preparation was not involved in any other part of the study. Participants were not allowed to speak, were instructed to inhale deeply and hold their breath for 10&#x000a0;s after each inhalation. Within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;min, the bag was to be fully emptied. The inhalation procedure was practiced at screening using the solvent only. The inhalation schedule was predicted to cause THC plasma concentrations and effects corresponding to the THC contents in roughly one marijuana cigarette. The decision to proceed to the next higher THC dose was made by a physician based on adverse events and physical signs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Electrophysiological recordings</title><p>The EEG data were recorded using an elastic cap with 27 tin electrodes according to the 10&#x02013;20 electrode international system.

EEG signals were re-referenced off-line to the average of all EEG electrodes, and the sampling rate was changed to 256&#x000a0;Hz with a high-pass filter of 0.04&#x000a0;Hz, low-pass filter of 40&#x000a0;Hz and a notch filter of 50&#x000a0;Hz. The 3-min continuous EEG data were segmented into 2-s epochs. First, a full segment baseline correction was applied. Subsequently, trials with artefacts were rejected from further analysis (absolute amplitude criterion of 120&#x000a0;&#x003bc;V and low activity criterion of 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;V within a 100-ms time window for EEG data). Then, ocular artefact correction was conducted according to the Gratton et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1983</xref>) algorithm. Finally, EEG data were Fourier-transformed (Hanning window length of 20%) and subsequently ln-transformed.

Klimesch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>) suggested adjusting the frequency windows of alpha and theta for each individual by using individual alpha peak frequency (IAF) as an anchor point. More specifically, individual frequency bandwidths for alpha and theta bands are determined as a percentage of IAF (Doppelmayr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>). Moreover, Klimesch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>) suggested dividing alpha oscillations into three frequency bands: lower-1 alpha (i.e. 0.6*IAF&#x02013;0.8*IAF), lower-2 alpha (0.8*IAF&#x02013;1*IAF) and upper alpha (i.e. IAF&#x02013;1.2*IAF). Similar to Klimesch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>), in the present study, the power of individual-defined frequency bands was calculated. Individual frequency bands were calculated based on the mean IAF of each participant. First, for each participant, IAF was defined as the frequency at which alpha power was maximum within 7.5&#x02013;15&#x000a0;Hz over the occipital electrodes (O1, Oz, O2) in the eyes closed condition. Visual inspection was conducted for peak frequencies occurring at the boundaries of the search window. Subsequently, power estimates were derived from the average for the theta (0.4*IAF&#x02013;0.6*IAF), lower-1 alpha (0.6*IAF&#x02013;0.8*IAF), lower-2 alpha (0.8*IAF&#x02013;1*IAF) and upper alpha (1*IAF&#x02013;1.2*IAF) bands (Doppelmayr et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1998</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Since several participants did not complete the whole experiment as described in detail above, multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures MANOVA would limit the sample size. Therefore, mixed model analyses of variance (SPSS 16.0) were conducted to examine the effects of drug administration alone and in combination on logarithmically transformed EEG data, separately for each study (study 1: MDMA in combination with ethanol; study 2: MDMA in combination with THC). First, separately for each drug condition, IAF and theta, lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha and upper alpha power before drug administration were subtracted from IAF and power in the specific frequency band after drug administration, respectively. The difference value of power was then entered in the mixed model analysis of variance, separately for IAF and theta, lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha and upper alpha power. Participant was used as subject variable. Fixed factors were MDMA (MDMA vs. placebo), THC or ethanol (THC or ethanol vs. placebo). For theta, lower-1 alpha, lower-2 alpha and upper alpha power, the fixed factors&#x02014;lead [frontal (Fz, F3, F4) vs. central (Cz, C3, C4) vs. parietal (Pz, P3, P4)] and laterality (left vs. right vs midline)&#x02014;were added to the model. Power values after each drug administration and at each electrode site were treated as repeated measurements. If the interaction between MDMA &#x000d7; THC (or ethanol) was significant, post hoc analyses were conducted to investigate the effects of MDMA alone, THC (or ethanol) alone and combined MDMA+THC (or MDMA+ethanol) relative to placebo.

In contrast, administration of MDMA increased individual alpha peak frequency. These findings indicate that it is very important to use individualized frequency bands to calculate EEG power (Klimesch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>) instead of broad fixed frequency bands, which the majority of previous studies have used.</p><p>As expected from previous literature (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Frei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>; Little <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1999</xref>), theta oscillations and lower-1 alpha oscillations, which overlap the traditional theta frequency band, were attenuated after the administration of MDMA alone and THC alone and increased after the intake of ethanol alone compared to placebo. Alpha oscillations were decreased after MDMA alone intake and increased after the administration of ethanol alone, also replicating previous findings (Frei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>; Little <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1999</xref>). Consistent with the majority of previous studies (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>; Ilan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>; Zuurman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2010</xref>), no significant changes for alpha power after THC administration were found. Note that increases in alpha power after THC intake have been reported, especially during THC-induced feelings of euphoria (Lukas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1995</xref>), leading to the hypothesis that fluctuations in alpha power after THC administration coincide with fluctuations in feelings of euphoria (Lukas et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1995</xref>). Since EEG data and feelings of euphoria were not continuously recorded in the present study, this hypothesis could not be tested.</p><p>This is the first study that investigated the effects of the co-administration of THC or ethanol with MDMA on ongoing EEG oscillations. Ethanol and MDMA did not interact with regard to their effects on EEG power, i.e. the effects of combined intake was similar to the sum of the single drug effects. Regarding the co-administration of THC and MDMA, combined intake of MDMA and THC affected theta and lower-1 alpha power less than the sum of the single drug effects, but exacerbated the reductions in lower-2 alpha power. Although no corrections were made for multiple comparisons, drug effects appeared to be relatively large and main drug effects were consistent with previous literature.</p><p>What could be the functional interpretation of the present findings? Based on the suggestion that EEG oscillations are related to alertness (Oken et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2006</xref>), MDMA, THC and alcohol may generally affect alertness and consequently change theta and alpha power. However, single drug effects on alertness (i.e. decreased feelings of alertness by THC and alcohol, but not by MDMA; Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010c</xref>) do not match the drug effects on EEG oscillations (i.e. decreased power by MDMA and THC and increased power by ethanol).</p><p>Recent animal and human studies investigating task-induced EEG oscillations indicate that EEG oscillations are related to specific cognitive processes rather than general alertness. More specifically, it has been suggested that task-induced increases in theta power and the phase relationship between theta and gamma oscillations are important for memory processes (Duzel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2010</xref>; Kahana <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2006</xref>; Klimesch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>; Knyazev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>). Recently, it has also been argued that theta oscillations reflect a &#x0201c;more general brain integrative mechanism&#x0201d; rather than an integrative mechanism specific for memory processes (Sauseng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). Task-induced alpha oscillations have been related to top-down inhibitory control processes of visual information (Jensen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2002</xref>; Knyazev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2007</xref>; Sauseng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2009</xref>), necessary for optimal task performance. Ongoing background EEG oscillations may also be closely related to specific cognitive processes. For example, a significant association between decreased theta power at rest and impaired working memory performance after cannabis use has been reported (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). The present finding that co-administration of MDMA with either THC or alcohol did not exacerbate single drug-induced effects on theta and lower-1 alpha power corresponds to the previous findings of Dumont et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010c</xref>) that the co-administration of MDMA with either THC or alcohol did not exacerbate single drug-induced impairments in memory and psychomotor performance. In contrast, the co-administration of MDMA with THC did exacerbate the reductions in lower-2 alpha power, which may be viewed as a contrasting finding at first glance. However, lower-2 alpha power has been specifically related to general attentional processes, whereas upper alpha power seems to be associated with semantic memory processes (Klimesch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1999</xref>). Therefore, the co-administration of MDMA with THC may not exacerbate the impairment in memory and psychomotor performance, but it may enhance attentional impairment.</p><p>How could changes in ongoing EEG oscillations be associated with cognitive impaired performance? It has been speculated that decreased theta power at rest after cannabis administration reflects desynchronization of ongoing theta oscillations, which interferes with phase resetting of theta that is needed for optimal memory performance (B&#x000f6;cker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>). Following this reasoning, one may predict that the increased theta power after alcohol intake leads to improved working memory performance. However, impaired memory has been reported after alcohol intake (Dumont et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). It may be speculated that the phase reset of oscillations and the phase relationship between different oscillations (i.e. cross-spectrum frequency coupling) are important for human information processing rather than the general increase/decrease in power. Subsequently, it could be speculated that both an increase and decrease of ongoing theta oscillations during a resting condition interfere with phase resetting of theta oscillations, necessary for correct behavioural performance. Therefore, decreased as well as increased ongoing theta oscillations may lead to incorrect phase reset of theta oscillations after a task-relevant stimulus, resulting in reduced task-induced theta and impaired performance. Correspondingly, it has recently been demonstrated that ethanol reduces the normally observed task-induced theta oscillations in healthy volunteers (Boha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>). The same mechanism may apply to alpha oscillations. Ongoing alpha oscillations in the present study were decreased after administration of MDMA alone and combined administration of THC and MDMA, but increased after ethanol intake. It may be speculated that decreased and increased ongoing alpha oscillations lead to incorrect phase reset of alpha oscillations during task performance, resulting in reduced task-induced alpha oscillations and impaired performance. Future studies should test this hypothesis and investigate how decreased as well as increased synchronization of ongoing EEG oscillations might hamper phase resetting.</p><p>Since MDMA, ethanol and THC influence multiple neurotransmitter systems (e.g. (Vengeliene et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2008</xref>), it is difficult to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the drug effects on ongoing EEG oscillations. The effects of ethanol have been suggested to be mediated by increasing the action of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (Mitchell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>), whereas the modulation of EEG after MDMA is suggested to be predominantly mediated by the 5-HT and NA system (Frei et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2001</xref>). The literature offers no clear explanation on whether or how cannabinoids affect EEG oscillations. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how the EEG would be affected by interactions of these neurotransmitter changes following different drug combinations. The results may suggest that the cannabinoid system has additive effects on the GABAergic system, where CB1 receptors are located on GABAergic neurons, but is infra-additive with respect to the blockade of presynaptic transporters, which might by and in itself create maximal reverse CB1 transmission, preventing additive effects of THC.</p><p>In conclusion, administration of MDMA, THC and ethanol change ongoing EEG oscillations, as reflected, in this study, in changes in theta and alpha power. Moreover, combined intake of MDMA and THC, but not of MDMA and alcohol, affects ongoing EEG oscillations differently than the sum of either one drug alone. Future studies may examine whether these changes are related to the impaired cognitive performance that has previously been found after acute drug administration.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by a grant from ZonMW (31000062), the Netherlands, and complies with current laws.
