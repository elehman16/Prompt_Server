In Germany, a national policy agenda has reinforced policies to restrain antibiotic prescribing in medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Despite decades of scientific research on rational use of antibiotics, and subsequent development of evidence-based practice guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], there remains a substantial room for improvement. For instance, data on patients with lower respiratory tract infections in German general practice showed that antibiotics were prescribed in 41% of consultations, of which 52% were congruent with guideline recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Strategies to optimise antibiotic prescribing can be effective. A cluster randomised trial in 259 practices in six European countries found that continuing education for physicians reduced their antibiotic prescribing by about 50% (from about 80 to 40%) in patients with respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether these impacts can also be achieved in large scale programs. The focus in the study described here is on scaling up existing implementation strategies to achieve sustainable and large-scale uptake of recommended use of antibiotics in ambulatory care in Germany.</p><p id="Par26">In order to address a wide range of barriers for implementation, the increased rational use of antibiotics requires a complex implementation strategy&#x02013;&#x02013;an intervention with multiple components interacting with each other. Based on relevant published research, which was identified through a literature review, and experience in quality improvement programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], comprehensive implementation programs were developed in close collaboration with participating practice networks as key stakeholders. These programs address physician knowledge and attitudes about the use of antibiotics as well as the ambulatory care team, patient experiences and reimbursement. In the planned study, the effectiveness of these implementation programs will be examined.</p><p id="Par27">A process evaluation will be conducted to understand the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness and to ensure generalizability of intervention effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Therefore, the process evaluation will explore which components of the programs and which contextual factors contribute to the effects. This knowledge is essential for building an evidence base that informs policy and practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The process evaluation will focus on the role of networks of ambulatory practices in Germany (&#x02018;Arztnetze/Praxisnetze&#x02019;), in which the ARena project is embedded. These practice networks organise quality improvement and additional reimbursement for specific activities for participating ambulatory practices. Exploring the impact of those networks on antibiotic prescribing is of particular interest. The networks may enhance the contagion of new ideas and practices through various mechanisms of social influence between participating healthcare providers and thus enhance the contagion of knowledge and practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Reducing antimicrobial resistance is only possible if the large majority of physicians join efforts to reduce antibiotic prescribing. The context of a sustained network may influence physicians&#x02019; willingness to cooperate with programs such as ARena because the repeated interaction in the network enhances mutual trust and facilitates the exclusion of non-cooperators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">The planned study has three central aims: (a) to determine and compare the effectiveness of three implementation programs to optimise antibiotic prescribing in ambulatory care, (b) to compare the outcomes of the three implementation programs with standard care and (c) to provide insight into the fidelity of the implementation programs, their potential working mechanisms and the impact of health system-related factors on outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par29">This three-armed (non-blinded) cluster randomised trial consists of different components which aim to achieve sustainable and large-scale uptake of recommended use of antibiotics in ambulatory care in Germany.

Compared to patients insured by other German health insurances, AOK-insured patients have somewhat lower income, less education, higher probability of migration background and lower self-reported health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. On average, 35% of the population within the geographic reach of the participating practice networks in Bavaria are insured by AOK health insurance. At baseline, approximately 40,000 patients with AOK health insurance are registered in 193 participating ambulatory care practices in these 14 networks. In total, there are 304 eligible ambulatory care practices in these 14 networks. The patient population for the intervention arms will comprise patients who attended ambulatory practices for the following reasons: acute non-complicated infections of the respiratory tract (bronchitis, sinusitis, tonsillitis, otitis media), non-complicated cystitis and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

The impact of participation in a practice network on implementation of new ideas and practices regarding antibiotic prescribing is of particular interest. Various social mechanisms influence the spread of new attitudes and behaviours, as well as the motivation to change the behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the exploration, some emphasis will be put on the potential impact of the networks in which the physicians are embedded. Therefore, tailored questions for interviews and surveys are phrased, which cover (a) the uptake and perceived impact of intervention components by participants with a focus on handling patients with acute non-complicated infections, (b) the perceived impact of contextual factors, particularly those related to practice networks, and (c) perceptions of patients&#x02019; expectations regarding antibiotic prescribing. The construction of the survey is based on Ajzen&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] theory of planned behaviour. The survey items are conform with this theoretical framework of Ajzen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and are used to gain specific information about the impact of (a) each intervention component received, (b) contextual factors including structural conditions and organisation of patient care, legal terms and conditions (e.g. legal quality requirements, reimbursement of patient care by statutory health insurance) and participation in a practice network, and (c) perceptions of patients expectation regarding antibiotic prescribing on the behaviour of participating physicians and medical assistants. Items are scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Interviews will add in-depth understanding of mechanism of action, particularly those related to practice networks, and explore uptake and possible adaption to daily practice of intervention components in more detail. Both surveys and semi-structured interviews include written questions concerning socio-demographic aspects like age, gender, years of working experience and characteristics of the working environment.</p><p id="Par76">Focus group interviews will aim to discuss barriers in implementation of intervention components and to develop possibilities to overcome these barriers.</p><p id="Par77">Patient survey will be used to gain feedback from patients concerning their knowledge and views on antibiotics and antibiotic prescribing, as well as their perception of different intervention components targeting patients. Therefore, a questionnaire will be used covering reason for consultation (complaints/illness), whether antibiotics are expected, requested and received (yes/no questions), as well as (with 4-point Likert scale) patient education and shared decision making on antibiotic prescribing, views on delayed antibiotic prescription, perceived study components, the role of non-physician health professionals of the practice team, general view on antibiotic prescribing in and general satisfaction with the practice.

In the first stage, differences regarding the primary endpoint (prescription of antibiotics) before and after the intervention in intervention groups B and C are tested. To assure a significance level of 5% within the first level, the hypotheses for the pre- and post comparison will be tested at a local significance level of 5/2%. The second step includes the pre-and post comparison in intervention group A. The significance level of the rejected hypotheses from step one is taken (2.5% if only one hypothesis can be rejected, 5% if both hypotheses can be rejected). If significance is reached in intervention groups A and B, differences between groups A and B will be tested at a local significance level of 5/2%. Similarly, difference between groups A and C will be only tested if significance is reached for groups A and C in the steps 1 and 2. If the hypotheses in step 1 or 2 cannot be rejected, the group comparison will not be tested primarily.</p><p id="Par88">In all stages described above, a logistic mixed effects model will be applied to assess the respective hypotheses regarding the primary endpoint. In the first and second stage, the time (before/after the intervention) is included as fixed effect. A random intercept will be included for patients and for practices. For the comparisons in the third stage, the intervention group will be included as fixed effect additionally. Furthermore, age and gender will be included as covariates. Finally, sensitivity analyses will be conducted using different populations (per protocol population where patients with major protocol violations are excluded and appropriate subgroups). Since all these analyses are based on claims data, missing values cannot be tracked.</p><p id="Par89">Descriptive methods will be used for the analysis of the secondary outcomes, including the calculation of appropriate summary measures of the empirical distribution (mean, standard deviation, median, IQR, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and frequency in percentages for categorical variables).

Thus, the effect is expected to be 5% higher in the enriched intervention groups B and C compared to intervention group A.</p><p id="Par98">To control the overall type I error rate at 0.05 (two-sided), a hierarchical 3-step testing procedure will be applied. In the first step, the hypotheses of no difference between the pre- and post prescription rate in group B and C will be tested. If at least one of these hypotheses can be rejected, the hypothesis of no difference in the pre- and post rate in group A will be tested. If, additionally, this hypothesis can be rejected, the hypotheses of no difference between the post rates of groups A and B as well as groups B and C will be tested. The sample size is calculated based on chi-squared tests assuring a (global) power of 80% for the rejection of all the above described, hierarchically ordered hypotheses. Furthermore, to take the clustered structure into account, an intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) for patients in practices of 0.05 and of 0.7 for cases clustered in patients is assumed. Together with the above described expected pre- and post prescription rates in the three groups, this results in a sample size of 23,933 patients in group A, 11,967 patients in group B and 11,967 patients in group C. With an average practice size of 80 patients per quarter this leads to 75 practices in group A, 38 practices in group B and 38 practices in group C.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par99">The evidence base of large scale programs to reduce antibiotic prescribing in acute non-complicated infections in primary care is limited, so this project can provide an important contribution. Nevertheless, a number of limitations of the study should be acknowledged. The study is randomised, but the number of units for allocation (i.e. networks) is small, leaving room for bias. Primary and secondary outcomes are based on claims data, which have inherent limitations and strengths. Given the multifaceted programs, it will be difficult to separate out the impact of various program components. On the other hand, strong aspects of the program are its large scale and closeness to daily practice. The focus on practice networks and implementation outcomes, which will be explored in the process evaluation, adds value to the study. The analysis of components of the complex implementation programs, using the TIDier checklist, contributes to the transparency of the implementation programs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
