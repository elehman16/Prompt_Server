We previously demonstrated that TFV delivered vaginally by gel protected macaques from vaginal infection with SHIV. Here we investigated efficacy of the TFV gel against vaginal transmission of a TFV-resistant SHIV containing the K65R mutation (SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub>) and its relationship to drug levels in vaginal tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> shows approximately a 5-fold reduction in susceptibility to TFV compared to wild-type SHIV. Efficacy was evaluated in pig-tailed macaques exposed vaginally twice-weekly (up to 10&#x000a0;weeks) to SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> 30&#x000a0;min after receiving placebo (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) or 1% TFV (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) gel. Four of the six controls were infected after a median of 5 exposures. In contrast, five of six macaques that received TFV gel remained uninfected after 20 vaginal SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> exposures, resulting in an estimated efficacy of 75%. The mean intracellular TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentrations in vaginal lymphocytes 4&#x000a0;h after a single gel dose were found to be high (1,631&#x000a0;fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells, range 492&#x02013;3,847) and within the in vitro IC<sub>75</sub> range (1,206&#x000a0;fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells) for SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both the modest resistance conferred by K65R and the high TFV-DP exposure in vaginal lymphocytes, likely explain the observed protection.

These data will facilitate the development of TFV delivery platforms that have high activity on both wild-type and TFV-resistant viruses.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pre-exposure prophylaxis</kwd><kwd>HIV-1 drug resistance</kwd><kwd>Tenofovir</kwd><kwd>Microbicides</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>As treatment programs for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) expand, access to antiretroviral therapies continue to benefit persons infected with HIV, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Research on HIV prevention through the use of oral or topical antiretroviral drugs has also accelerated to provide promising prevention options for uninfected persons to protect themselves from acquiring HIV. Oral emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir (TFV) disoproxil fumarate (TDF) administered daily has now been demonstrated to effectively prevent HIV in men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is now an approved HIV prevention medication in the USA. Likewise, various topical products that dose vaginal tissues with tenofovir are under development. These include vaginal gels or tablets, as well as intravaginal rings formulated with TFV or its oral pro-drug TDF. A phase IIb clinical trial in South Africa (CAPRISA 004) demonstrated that a vaginal 1% TFV gel reduced acquisition of HIV by an average of 39% and approximately 54% in women who used the gel more than 80% of the time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, recent data released from a similar phase III trial in South Africa (FACTS 001) was unable to show efficacy by TFV gel, likely due to low adherence by study participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. While sub-analysis of this study demonstrated an ~55% protective effect amongst women identified as highly adherent, it is unclear if these data will support regulatory approval of this TFV-releasing product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Implications of these results however, may include advancing the clinical development of other TFV-releasing topical products such as vaginal tablets or intravaginal rings that share the high biological efficacy of TFV gels but may be more desirable by women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Previous pharmacokinetic studies have shown that 1% TFV gels, vaginal TFV tablets containing 10&#x000a0;mg of TFV, and intravaginal rings with either TFV or TDF all dose vaginal tissues with high concentrations of TFV-diphosphate, the pharmacologically active drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Furthermore, efficacy studies in macaques exposed vaginally to wild-type SHIV demonstrated high protection by both 1% TFV gel and TDF intravaginal rings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>As in treatment, the use of topical TFV for prevention raises drug resistance concerns for its potential to impact the efficacy of antiretroviral prophylaxis as TFV is a main component of first-line regimens used globally to treat persons infected with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A K65R mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV-1, which confers low-level (~2&#x02013;5 fold) resistance to TFV, has been documented in patients failing TFV-containing regimens and may increase exposure of uninfected persons to TFV-resistant HIV-1<sub>K65R</sub> viruses. The K65R mutation is also observed in persons virologically failing while on stavudine (d4T)-containing therapy, a first-line regimen extensively implemented in early treatment programs in the developing world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Clinical studies can help define the impact of TFV-resistant virus on the efficacy of topical TFV products. However, prevention failures due to infection with a TFV-resistant virus are difficult to ascertain in humans because of the uncertainty on adherence to product at the time of infection and the inability to exclude acquired resistance post-infection, which requires early testing and is often not feasible. Furthermore, the K65R mutation is known to have a high fitness cost to viral replication, and thus is often rapidly outgrown by the more fit wild-type virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The reversion of K65R can be facilitated by insufficient drug pressure through inconsistent product use and low systemic TFV exposures, which could underestimate clinical K65R-related TFV failures.</p><p>Animal models conducted under well-controlled conditions including consistent product dosing and challenge viruses with defined drug resistance profiles, can be utilized for assessing the impact of TFV-resistant viruses on the efficacy of topical TFV. The repeat low-dose (RLD) SHIV exposure macaque model is an established model of vaginal and rectal HIV transmission which predicted the prophylactic efficacy of oral FTC/TDF combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This model was further used to evaluate the efficacy of FTC/TDF against drug-resistant SHIV containing either K65R or the emtricitabine-associated M184V mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Likewise, the vaginal transmission model demonstrated complete protection against wild-type SHIV by vaginal 1% TFV gel when applied 30&#x000a0;min before challenge and ~74% protection when administered 3&#x000a0;days prior to challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. By linking efficacy to tissue drug levels following gel dosing, this model was the first to document the intracellular drug concentrations required for vaginal protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Analysis of TFV-diphosphate (TFV-DP) in vaginal lymphocytes, pointed to TFV-DP concentrations above the 95% inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>95</sub>) as a good predictor for protection. This pharmacologic correlate of protection was further validated by the demonstration of high efficacy of TDF intravaginal rings against vaginal SHIV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Here, we expand the use of the macaque model to evaluate the efficacy of topically delivered TFV from a gel against a TFV-resistant SHIV containing the K65R mutation that recapitulates the resistance and fitness profile of HIV-1 with the K65R mutation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Efficacy of TFV gel against SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub></title><p>Vaginal 1% TFV gel provided complete protection against wild-type SHIV162P3 when applied 30&#x000a0;min before virus challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].

Four of six macaques in the placebo group became infected after a median of 5 challenges (at exposure 3, 5, 5, and 17). In contrast, five of six macaques in the TFV group remained SHIV negative as measured by both PCR and serology throughout the challenge period and 10-week washout. The breakthrough infection in the TFV treatment group occurred at challenge 8. The efficacy of TFV gel was estimated at 75% based upon 4/6 infections in the control group compared to 1/6 in the TFV treated group. However, due to small group numbers and low transmissibility of SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> (67% infection rate), the protective effect in animals treated with TFV gel and risk of infection between the two groups was not statistically significantly (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.24, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Efficacy of TFV gel against SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub>. <bold>a</bold> Survival curves representing the cumulative percentage of uninfected macaques as a function of the number of challenges.

Likewise, the proportion of measureable TFV in plasma over the 10&#x000a0;week challenge period was relatively low, with only 41 of a total of 120 measurements (34%) above the limit of detection (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b). Both the low systemic exposure and infrequent detection of TFV likely reflects the temporal changes in vaginal drug absorption associated with the menstrual cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the mean TFV concentrations in the breakthrough infection macaque PLk (52&#x000a0;ng/ml) was higher than the levels seen in uninfected animals (4.6&#x000a0;ng/ml). However, we note that the TFV exposures in this macaque at and prior to the estimated time of infection (challenge 8) was within the range of the protected animals, and thus the continued twice-weekly TFV dosing post-infection greatly contributed to the overall high TFV levels detected in this animal (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Systemic drug exposure following vaginal TFV gel dosing. <bold>a</bold> Cumulative plasma TFV levels in macaques following twice-weekly dosing over the 10&#x000a0;week challenge period. <bold>b</bold> Longitudinal assessment of individual plasma TFV levels in macaques at time of each SHIV challenge (30&#x000a0;min post gel dosing).

Similar analysis were performed to determine if the relationship between efficacy and tissue drug levels following TFV dosing also applies to protection against SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub>. We assessed the intracellular TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal lymphocytes purified from vaginal tissues 4&#x000a0;h after dosing macaques with 1% TFV gel and compared them to concentrations achieved in lymphocytes dosed in vitro at TFV concentrations corresponding to the inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50&#x02013;95</sub>) for SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub>. Data from seven macaques (4 current and 3 historical from a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]) showed that the median TFV-DP concentration in vaginal lymphocytes at 4&#x000a0;h was 1,631&#x000a0;fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells (range&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;492&#x02013;3,847&#x000a0;fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells). In vitro dosing of PBMCs at TFV concentrations in range of the IC<sub>50</sub> (12&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M), IC<sub>75</sub> (60&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M), and IC<sub>95</sub> (300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M) values for SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> resulted in mean (&#x000b1;std dev) intracellular TFV-DP levels of 320&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;141, 1,206&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;235 and 4,559&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2,867 fmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells, respectively. These data show that in vivo TFV-DP levels were closest to the IC<sub>75</sub> concentrations which is consistent with the observed 75% protection found in this study. These data are in agreement with previous findings against wild-type SHIV162P3 and provide drug target levels needed for protection against SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>HIV treatment programs with regimens containing either TDF or d4T have the potential to enrich for TFV-resistant HIV-1 containing the K65R mutation among persons experiencing virologic failure on these regimen, thus raising questions about efficacy of topical TFV products for prevention among uninfected persons exposed to such viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Here, we show in a macaque model that TFV delivered by vaginal gel maintained protection against a SHIV isolate with the K65R mutation that shares the same TFV resistance and replicative fitness profile with HIV-1<sub>K65R</sub>. We provide pharmacokinetic evidence in support of efficacy by showing inhibitory intracellular TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal lymphocytes within the in vitro IC<sub>75</sub>. Both the modest 5-fold resistance to TFV conferred by K65R and the high levels of TFV-DP in vaginal lymphocytes likely explain the observed protection in this model. These findings suggest other topical delivery platforms including intravaginal rings, tablets, or films that are capable of delivering TFV concentrations that exceed those achieved by vaginal gels will equally protect against both wild-type and TFV-resistant viruses.</p><p>We demonstrate that five of six macaques treated with vaginal TFV gel were uninfected compared to only two of six placebo gel controls. However, the inability to infect two controls together with the small group numbers (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), resulted in insufficient power to draw statistically significant conclusions. The low in vivo transmissibility of SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> at virus doses that efficiently infect macaques with wild-type SHIV162P3 is consistent with the high fitness cost conferred by K65R and lower transmission rate observed previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The virus infectivity to virion particle ratio of SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> was found to be ~17-fold lower than that of wild-type SHIV162P3, and increasing the challenge dose ten times in this study was helpful but not sufficient to achieve 100% infection rate in the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Although K65R has been previously shown to rapidly revert to wild-type post-infection, we document persistence of K65R in all infected animals, likely the result of introducing two mutations (<underline>AA</underline>A) in the K65 codon versus the single nucleotide mutation often found in naturally emerging K65R mutations. These findings further support the use of this K65R isolate as a tool for executing TFV resistant transmission and prevention studies under well-controlled conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>We further showed that TFV was detected in plasma samples collected shortly after gel dosing, confirming rapid absorption through vaginal tissues. The low and infrequent systemic exposure of TFV in macaques following twice-weekly intravaginal dosing were similar to those detected in women who applied vaginal TFV gel twice-daily for 2&#x000a0;weeks (5.5&#x000a0;ng/ml) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. We also found no reduction in the acute viremia of the breakthrough infection compared to controls, reflecting insignificant antiviral activity due to nominal systemic TFV exposure by the continued twice-weekly gel dosing post infection.</p><p>The single-dose PK data were instrumental in linking TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal lymphocytes to in vitro activity and in vivo protection against SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub>. It is plausible that the tissue concentrations may have slightly increased during the challenge period due to accumulation of TFV-DP by repeat twice-weekly gel dosing, underscoring the need to achieve high mucosal tissue levels to fully protect against TFV-resistant viruses. As interest increases in exploring alternative delivery platforms capable of administering TFV prodrugs that achieve even higher vaginal tissue concentrations of TFV-DP because of sustained release or more efficient dosing, it is expected that such products may further enhance protection against TFV-resistant virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The protective tissue drug levels defined in this study will help inform these studies. We also note that while our results address the efficacy against low-level TFV resistance mediated by K65R, our findings may have broader implications on mutant viruses with a similar level of TFV resistance conferred by other mutations as seen clinically with multiple thymidine analog mutations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We show in a repeat challenge model that 1% TFV gel maintained protection against vaginal infection with a TFV-resistant SHIV and provide pharmacokinetic support for this protection.

Supernatant containing the drug from precipitation was evaporated to near dryness under vacuum and then re-suspended in HPLC buffer containing 9.9&#x000a0;mM of acetic acid, 5.9&#x000a0;mM of ammonium hydroxide, and 9.4&#x000a0;mM of formic acid (pH ~3).

To expand these data, we additionally measured TFV-DP levels in vaginal lymphocytes in SHIV-infected macaques (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) sacrificed 4&#x000a0;h after receiving a single vaginal dose of 1% TFV gel. All tissue collection and processing procedures were conducted by the same veterinarian pathologists, laboratory technicians, and using the same tissue digestion and mononuclear cell enrichment protocols as described in the previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Briefly, vaginal tissue collected at time of necropsy was dissociated using enzyme cocktails and lymphocyte purification procedures. Total cell populations were gated and counted for mononuclear cells using a Muse Cell counter with CytoSoft Data Acquisition and Analysis Software (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Intracellular TFV-DP concentrations in vaginal lymphocytes were measured with an automated online weak anion exchange solid-phase extraction method coupled with ion-pair chromatography&#x02013;MS/MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. TFV-DP levels were expressed as femtomoles (fmol) per million cells with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 2.5&#x000a0;fmol/sample.</p><p>To compare TFV-DP concentrations observed in vivo with those achieved in vitro, macaque PBMCs were incubated with varying concentrations of TFV and intracellular TFV-DP concentrations were measured at each dose.

The challenge dose was increased ~10 times higher than wild type SHIV162P3 (from 50 to 500 TCID<sub>50</sub>) to adjust for the lower transmissibility SHIV162P3<sub>K65R</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Blood was collected 30&#x000a0;min after each gel application to monitor for SHIV infection and plasma drug levels. SHIV infection was determined by monitoring SHIV RNA in plasma by RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The estimated time of infection was defined as 7&#x000a0;days (two challenges) prior to SHIV positive to account for the eclipse period between virus inoculation and detection of SHIV RNA in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Animals were considered protected if they tested negative for SHIV plasma RNA and SHIV DNA in PBMCs and remained seronegative during the course of the study and the following 10&#x000a0;weeks of washout in the absence of challenge and gel application.
