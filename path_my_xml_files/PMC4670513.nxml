Recovery of function to a pre-fracture level, particularly mobility, is the ultimate aim for rehabilitation following a hip-fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A decline in function is however common and substantial, where a three times larger decline in function during a year has been reported for those who experienced a hip fracture as compared to those who did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Effects of interventions have typically been shown for physical performance or self-reported function, giving an indication of what patients are capable of doing. Activity monitoring can provide information of what older people actually do during daily life following a hip fracture. One prospective study using activity monitoring did report very low levels of activity two months following the hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no studies reporting treatment effects from randomized clinical trials on patients&#x02019; free-living physical behavior, defined as what a person actually does during daily life.</p><p>Hip-fracture patients are characterized by pre-existing comorbidity and physical impairments and are often regarded as frail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This emphasizes that treatment should be holistic and target not only the fracture itself, but also underlying health problems and disease to avoid an unnecessary decline in physical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Early mobilization is important for regaining of function and previous activity level, regardless of the level of physical frailty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The medical treatment and the hospital care can also optimize rehabilitation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and enable patients to be mobilized early [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>This study is part of the Trondheim Hip Fracture Trial conducted to investigate the effect of comprehensive geriatric care (CGC) in a geriatric ward for hip-fracture patients as compared with orthopedic care (OC) in an orthopedic ward in the acute phase during hospital stay primarily on mobility, and secondary on other aspects of function and physical behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We found that mobility and activities of daily living 4 and 12&#x000a0;months following surgery was better in the CGC group as compared to OC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. CGC was also superior to OC for physical behavior, assessed as upright time and number of upright events early after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, the long-term effects of hospital interventions on free-living physical behavior are unknown.</p><p>Measures of free-living physical behavior can provide information about the success of the intervention in terms of the impact on the patients&#x02019; daily life. The present study evaluates the impact of CGC on free-living physical behavior four and 12&#x000a0;months after the hip fracture, for patients randomized in the emergency room at admission to hospital to either CGC or OC. We hypothesized that CGC during the hospital stay results in greater long-term improvements in free-living physical behavior as compared with OC. The primary outcome is daily upright time 4&#x000a0;months after the fracture. Secondary outcomes are number of upright events and mean, maximum, median and variability in length of upright events at 4&#x000a0;months, and all physical behavior variables at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>The study was a single center, prospective, randomized controlled trial. The study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the content of the intervention, and results on the primary outcome from the study have been published previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Activity monitoring data were secondary outcomes and were preplanned for a separate publication. Randomization to either CGC or OC was performed in the Emergency Department using a web-based computer program by block randomization with equal block sizes unknown to the investigators. Participants were included from April 2008 to December 2010. Further details of the study design are described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were included in the trial if they were admitted to the hospital because of a hip fracture, were at least 70&#x000a0;years of age, previously living in their own homes, able to walk 10 m, and able to give informed consent. Exclusion criteria included pathological fractures, multitrauma injuries, and short life expectancy. Short life expectancy was defined as terminal illness where people were not expected to live longer than three months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Interventions</title><p>The intervention was performed in the acute hospital setting. Randomized patients were moved from the emergency room to receive pre- and post-operative CGC in a geriatric ward or OC in an orthopedic ward. Both groups received the same perioperative treatment by the same group of surgeons. CGC was performed by an interdisciplinary team of specialized health professionals, developing and executing integrated and individualized treatment plans for the hip fracture patients with the emphasis on comprehensive medical assessment and treatment, special focus on mobilization, and early discharge planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. OC included conventional care with traditional in-hospital treatment procedures. The geriatric ward was somewhat better staffed than the orthopedic ward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The primary health-care services were responsible for follow-up of patients in both groups after the hospital stay, where the Orthopedic surgeons followed-up patients in both groups if needed. The intervention has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There were no significant group differences in type of surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Demographic data</title><p>Pre-fracture function was assessed retrospectively by the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale (NEADL) (0&#x02013;66) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], the Barthel Index (BI) (0&#x02013;20) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and all participants were asked if they lived alone prior to the fracture. Other background variables included age, gender, fracture type (intracapsular or extracapsular) and surgery method.</p><p>Data collected at 1, 4 and 12&#x000a0;months after surgery included NEADL, BI, cognitive function assessed by the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], mobility measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and registrations of dead/alive at 4 and 12&#x000a0;months. Data from the single item &#x0201c;Walk around outside&#x0201d; from the NEADL was used to describe independence in outdoor mobility the past 14&#x000a0;days at 4 and 12&#x000a0;months, classifying those responding &#x0201c;on your own with difficulty&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;on your own&#x0201d; as independent outdoors walkers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Outcomes</title><p>All participants attending the 4 and 12&#x000a0;month examination were asked to wear activity monitors for the following four days. The activity monitors were body-worn, single-axis accelerometer-based devices (activPAL PAL Technologies Ltd., Glasgow, United Kingdom) attached by a waterproof tape to the front of participants&#x02019; non-affected lower thigh. Only data where there was 24&#x000a0;h of continuous recordings from one or more days was included in the analyses.</p><p>In this study, the primary outcome was upright time 4&#x000a0;months after surgery, defined as the mean time per day spent in an upright posture. Secondary outcomes from the same activity recordings included number of upright events 4&#x000a0;months after surgery defined as the mean number of transitions from sitting to standing per day, length of upright events defined as the mean, maximum, median and variation (interquartile range, IQR) in length of all upright events during the recording period, and upright time, number of upright events, and the four measures of length of upright events 12&#x000a0;months after surgery.</p><p>The manufacturers&#x02019; software gives the number and duration of upright (standing and walking) events. Upright time and number of upright events have previously been validated on a similar population of older persons with impaired mobility showing accurate recordings from an in-lab setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample size</title><p>Sample size calculation was performed for the primary outcome in the Trondheim Hip Fracture Trial, which was lower limb function measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] 4&#x000a0;months after the hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A total of 380 participants needed to be included at the 4&#x000a0;months examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].

The final data analyzes were performed unblinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Activity monitoring data was analyzed using the software version 6.4.1 from PAL Technologies Ltd. The activPAL classifies body postures and provides information about start and end time of sitting/lying, standing and walking events. A single Excel (Office Excel version 11.0, Windows XP Professional, Microsoft, 2003) spreadsheet for each participant was created, using the activPAL software, containing detailed information about event data for all recording days per participants. A custom written MATLAB (MATLAB version 7.1. The MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, 2005) program derived event information about upright time (time in standing and walking posture), number of upright events (number of changes from sit/lie to standing posture), and length of all upright events from all days with complete 24&#x000a0;h of recordings. Mean upright time (minutes), upright events (numbers), mean event length (minutes), maximum event length (minutes), median event length (minutes), and variation measured as interquartile range (IQR) of event length (minutes) per day were included in the statistical analysis performed in SPSS (SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 19.0. Chicago: SPSS Inc.). Upright time and upright events for each hour during the day were used to illustrate activity profiles for the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>In total 143 participants in the CGC, and 140 in the OC, completed the activity monitoring at 4&#x000a0;months.

The potential long-term effects of CGC treatment during the hospital stay was compared with traditional OC. We found that patients treated with CGC were upright for longer time periods at both 4 and 12&#x000a0;months after hip-fracture surgery, with the estimated group difference of 35&#x000a0;min per day at 4&#x000a0;months and 28&#x000a0;min at 12&#x000a0;months, representing 17 and 14&#x000a0;%, of mean upright time in the OC group, respectively.</p><p>This is, to our knowledge, the first study to monitor free-living physical behavior the first year following a hip fracture and to evaluate effects of hospital treatment on an objectively measured outcome directly related to participants&#x02019; daily life. Results presented in this paper confirm the positive effect of hospital intervention on functional outcomes presented in the main paper from the study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>We have previously shown that CGC patients, as compared to OC patients, did spend more time in upright on the 4<sup>th</sup> day post-surgery, indicating a different treatment approach in the geriatric ward compared to the orthopedic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The CGC delivered by an interdisciplinary team of specialized health professionals had particular emphasis on comprehensive medical assessment and treatment, mobilization and early discharge planning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Together this approach was important for the hip-fracture patients&#x02019; long-term recovery after the surgery. As described by Clegg and colleagues (2013) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], some older persons are more vulnerable, and this could perhaps explain why a stressor like a hip fracture may cause more serious changes in function and activity levels if the treatment approach is not optimal in the early phase after the fracture. Our study has demonstrated that treatment with CGC during the hospital stay is beneficial for older persons after hip fracture, in line with recommendations for treatment for other acutely sick, hospitalized geriatric patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>The group difference in upright time was not shown for number of upright events, indicating that the length of upright events increased and not the number of these events in the CGC relative to the OC group. The diurnal variation of upright time was similar for both groups. A similar diurnal variation for upright time was also shown for the community-dwelling older persons in the study from Grant and co-workers (2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], with a peak around noon followed by a decline the following hours. During the hospital stay, on day four post-surgery, both upright time and number of upright was greater in CGC as compared to OC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], indicating that when patients&#x02019; activity levels are really low, differences are seen for both these measures as well as the diurnal variation. The group difference shown at 4 and 12&#x000a0;months, that more upright time was not followed by an increase in upright events, indicating that the length of upright events increased with no change in the pattern itself. In this study we included four measures of length of upright events, and found that it was the average and maximum length of the upright events that was larger for CGC, indicating that CGC participants recovered more freedom of movement and elasticity in their behavior as compared to the OC participants.</p><p>Rehabilitation following hip fracture should aim to regain sufficient function so that people can live as they did prior to the fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Better physical function for the CGC group was shown by Prestmo et al. (2015) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and in the present study we found longer upright time. However, we cannot conclude with a causal explanation for the relation between improved physical function and free-living physical behavior in the CGC group. From other research we do know that a carry-over effect of improved function into physical behavior could be a challenge. One study on patients following a total hip or knee arthroplasty, showed that participants did not adopt a more active behavior although the other variables of functioning improved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In our study, the CGC had more upright time early after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and better free-living physical behavior at 4 and 12&#x000a0;months, confirming the importance of optimal hospital treatment including mobilization to be able to be physically active long term after a hip fracture.</p><p>One of the strengths of the present study is that we have objective information about free-living physical behavior in this sample of frail people on 71.3&#x000a0;% of participants at 4&#x000a0;months and 63.5&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months. The unsuccessful blinding of assessors is a limitation for the performance-based tests in this study, whereas the activity monitoring is believed to be relatively unaffected. Free-living physical behavior represents what persons actually do during their daily life, providing effects highly relevant for the participants. Most missing data are related to the health status of the participants, like deaths, declined participation, not assessable and removed monitors. There were however somewhat more missing data in the OC arm at the 12&#x000a0;months assessment, mainly due to more deaths in this group (36 versus 27 in the CGC arm) and more people who declined to participate (22 versus 13 in the CGC arm), which may also be related to the better effect of the intervention in the CGC arm. The high number of missing data is the most important limitation with the study, where those not completing the activity monitoring had lower function. The statistical method used in this study strengthens however the results. Data were not missing completely at random, and the complete case analyses are expected to give biased results, while the MI analyses are expected to give less bias.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients treated with comprehensive geriatric care in a geriatric ward during hospital stay spent more time upright both 4 and 12&#x000a0;months after surgery, confirming a beneficial long term impact of acute CGC on participants&#x02019; free-living physical behavior. This study confirms that hip-fracture patients can benefit from CGC in the acute phase, with impacts on patients&#x02019; daily life up to one year after surgery, as compared to traditional OC in an orthopedic ward. The group difference was shown only for length rather than number of upright events. Although the diurnal patterns of upright time were similar, the CGC spent longer periods being upright with longer average and maximum length of the upright periods as compared to OC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Availability of data</title><p>The activity monitoring data files for the single participants are not shared due to participant confidentiality.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BI</term><def><p>the Barthel Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CGC</term><def><p>comprehensive geriatric care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IQR</term><def><p>interquartile range</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p>the Mini Mental Status Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NEADL</term><def><p>the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OC</term><def><p>orthopedic care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPPB</term><def><p>the Short Physical Performance Battery</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>MHG is a co-inventor of the activPAL physical activity monitor and a director of PAL Technologies Ltd.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PT, IS, OS, SL, JLH: Substantial contributions to conception and design.
