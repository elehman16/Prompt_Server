Following 48&#x02005;hours of successful weaning, 70 participants (mechanically ventilated &#x02265;7&#x02005;days) were randomised to receive inspiratory muscle training once daily 5&#x02005;days/week for 2&#x02005;weeks in addition to usual care, or usual care (control).

Threshold-based IMT is performed using a handheld device, which provides carefully titrated constant resistance on inspiration only. A preset threshold level of pressure is required to open a one-way valve and allow inspiratory flow, which is important in ensuring accurate titration of resistance as some other IMT devices are flow-dependent, which means that the resistance varies with patient effort. Using a threshold IMT device the level of inspiratory pressure required to open the valve is increased over time to provide an ongoing training load as the patient's inspiratory muscles become stronger. IMT improves respiratory muscle strength in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;11</xref> and a recent systematic review suggested that IMT performed prior to extubation enhances weaning success, although it does not appear to reduce rates of reintubation or likelihood of survival.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>However, participation in threshold-based IMT while mechanically ventilated requires patients to be alert and cooperative with training.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> For many reasons, ICU patients may not be suitable candidates for IMT while ventilator-dependent (eg, due to sedation or delirium) and may only have sufficient cognitive capacity to participate in training once weaned from mechanical ventilation. Although case studies have shown improvements in inspiratory muscle strength with IMT,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> there have been no randomised trials of IMT in ICU patients in the postextubation period.</p><p>As residual inspiratory muscle impairment has been demonstrated in intensive care survivors ventilated for 7&#x02005;days or longer,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> we conducted a randomised trial to establish the effects of postextubation IMT in a heterogeneous sample of ICU patients who had been invasively ventilated for at least 7&#x02005;days. Primary endpoints included inspiratory muscle strength and endurance following 2&#x02005;weeks of training. This 2&#x02005;week time frame was selected pragmatically, as pilot data indicated that most intensive care survivors remained inpatients during this 2&#x02005;week period and would receive supervised physiotherapy. To date, no studies of IMT in ICU patients have included patient-centred outcomes or rates of readmission to ICU. Therefore, secondary endpoints included health-related quality of life, dyspnoea and functional levels after 2&#x02005;weeks of training. Post-intensive care length of stay, rate of intensive care readmission and in-hospital mortality were also explored. We hypothesised that in the IMT group, improvements in inspiratory muscle strength and fatigue resistance would lead to reduced dyspnoea, improved quality of life and physical function, and lower rates of intensive care readmission and in-hospital mortality compared with the control group.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>We conducted a single-centre randomised trial with concealed allocation (computer-generated random-number sequence, managed by off-site administrative staff and obtained via telephone by the chief investigator following enrolment), assessor-blinding and intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The study was approved by the Australian Capital Territory Health Human Research Ethics Committee and the University of Queensland Medical Research Ethics Committee, and the published study protocol<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> (trial registration ACTRN12610001089022) complied with the CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants, therapists, centre</title><p>All patients invasively mechanically ventilated for 7&#x02005;days or longer were screened for eligibility. Patients were deemed eligible if they had been successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation (&#x0003e;48&#x02005;hours), and within the 7&#x02005;days following successful weaning they met the inclusion criteria (aged &#x02265;16&#x02005;years, able to provide informed consent, and alert and able to participate in training with a Riker<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> score of 4). Patients were excluded if they had participated in IMT while mechanically ventilated, declined to participate, were pregnant, were not alert or able to participate with training, were experiencing significant pain or distress that interfered with breathing capacity and were deemed medically unstable or for palliation (ie, death likely in the next few weeks). Based on a priori power calculations, a total of 70 participants were required to detect a 0.10 change in the primary outcome measures with a power of 0.80 (inflating group size by 15% to allow for known mortality of 12.8%<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Although the minimal clinically important difference in maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) scores has not been established in this patient group, the 0.10 change level was selected based on previous studies of inspiratory muscle strength and fatigue resistance in intensive care survivors<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

The study was conducted in an Australian tertiary hospital (Canberra Hospital) where usual intensive care practice includes minimal sedation and early proactive mobilisation.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> A second site was also included (Calvary Hospital); however, no patients were recruited from this site due to failure to meet eligibility requirements.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants were randomised to receive either usual care (control group) or IMT in addition to usual care (IMT group) for 2&#x02005;weeks following enrolment. Usual care physiotherapy included an individually tailored and supervised programme of interventions, which included any of the following: assisted mobilisation, secretion clearance treatments including positive expiratory pressure techniques, deep breathing exercises without a resistance device and upper and lower limb exercises.</p><p>IMT was performed using the threshold IMT inspiratory muscle trainer (threshold IMT device HS730, Respironics, New Jersey, USA). This device was used with the mouthpiece, or a flexible connector if required to attach to a tracheostomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2016208279F1">figure 1</xref>). Where a tracheostomy remained in situ, IMT was always performed with the cuff inflated to ensure accurate loading. The physiotherapist prescribed an intensity of 50% of MIP for the first training set, but then quickly increased this to the highest tolerable intensity that allowed the participant to just complete the sixth breath in a set of six breaths, with five sets of six breaths completed each session. Patients were allowed to rest between sets until they felt ready to commence the next set, which was typically less than 1&#x02005;min of resting. The intensity was increased daily by the physiotherapist across the training period to provide an adequate training stimulus. This was achieved by manually increasing the threshold resistance by 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O until the participant could only just open the poppet valve on the sixth breath in each set. Training commenced on the day of enrolment and continued once daily (weekdays only) for 2&#x02005;weeks. A sham device was not used for comparison as previous studies of IMT have found that the sham device may provide a training effect in participants with very low baseline strength.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><fig id="THORAXJNL2016208279F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Inspiratory muscle training via a tracheostomy.

<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and with the rapid strength gains within 2&#x02005;weeks of commencing IMT previously described in healthy cyclists (eg, increased MIP scores by 8.4%<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is possible that some of the apparent strength gains could be attributable to a learning effect, given the similarity between the IMT technique and the MIP testing manoeuvre. However, in ICU patients rapid atrophy has been observed in both skeletal<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and respiratory muscles<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> within the first few days of admission. With an adequate training stimulus, some of these changes could be reversible within a relatively short time frame, although it appears that some individuals respond to training more than others (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary figure</xref> E1). Regardless of the underlying mechanism of improvement, the apparent strength gains in this cohort translated into benefits in quality of life, which is arguably a more important patient-centred outcome than inspiratory muscle strength.</p><p>Our inability to demonstrate an improvement in inspiratory muscle endurance in the IMT group is somewhat surprising, as IMT has been shown to increase proliferation of both type 1 and type 2 inspiratory muscle fibres<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and endurance benefits of IMT have been reported after 8&#x02005;weeks of training in patients with COPD,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> after 11&#x02005;weeks of training in athletes<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and after 4&#x02005;weeks of training in recreationally active people.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> While it is possible that the specific training regime employed in our study translates into strength benefits alone, it is more likely that the duration of training was insufficient to affect a measurable improvement in endurance, or that the FRI is insufficiently sensitive to detect subtle changes in endurance over such a short time frame. A more sustained constant loading test may have better elucidated changes in inspiratory muscle endurance; however, our experience with these participants resonated with that of Chang and colleagues<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> who found a limited tolerance for even the basic 2&#x02005;min FRI test. Thus, measuring inspiratory muscle endurance in this patient group remains a challenge.</p><p>The statistically significant improvements in quality of life in the IMT group, as measured with the EQ5D tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="THORAXJNL2016208279F4">figure 4</xref>A), warrant further exploration. The magnitude of change in EQ5D scores (14 in the IMT group compared with two in the control) is likely to be clinically important in this group, which struggles with poor quality of life following weaning. While the IMT group commenced from a lower baseline EQ5D score (41 in the IMT group compared with 51 in the control) (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table</xref> E1) we believe that it is unlikely that there was a ceiling effect in this cohort, as scores at 2&#x02005;weeks remained well below maximal values (ie, mean 54% across both groups). We would expect quality of life to continue a slow trajectory of improvement beyond the ICU stay<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> but it is possible that IMT provides an advantage early in this trajectory.</p><p>Although the IMT group expressed improved quality of life using the EQ5D tool, the effect was less marked when assessed by the SF36. This may reflect difficulty in completing all components of the longer SF36 questionnaire. One of the challenges in ICU outcomes research is the effect of residual cognitive impairment<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and fatigue on a participant's ability to complete lengthy quality-of-life assessment tools. The reasons for improved quality of life in the absence of a demonstrated effect on respiratory endurance, dyspnoea or functional level remain unclear.</p><p>Improvements in inspiratory muscle strength did not have a clinically or statistically significant impact on the other patient-centred outcomes in this study. While physical function improved similarly in both groups, it is likely that other aspects of treatment (eg, whole body exercise and gait retraining) had a stronger influence on recovery of physical function than IMT. The fact that both groups improved in terms of physical function may reflect the high standard of usual care in this unit, which includes early rehabilitation and mobilisation. Thus, the findings of this study may only be generalisable to acute settings where early mobilisation and rehabilitation are the norm. Furthermore, the failure of IMT to significantly affect reintubation rates or length of stay may be attributable to the small sample size, as the effect size of IMT may be very small in relation to the many other variables that impact on these clinically significant outcomes. Future studies of IMT in the postweaning period should be adequately powered to further clarify these relationships.</p><p>The difference in in-hospital mortality between groups was unexpected, although the mortality in the IMT group (12%) was close to that anticipated in the trial design (12.8%). To our knowledge, no increase in mortality has been reported with IMT in any population to date, including ventilated ICU patients, or patients with COPD or heart failure. As summarised in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">supplementary table</xref> E2, none of the deaths appeared to be related directly to IMT or respiratory complications. Given the small number of study participants and heterogeneity of diagnoses, further study of the impact of IMT on in-hospital mortality is indicated before robust conclusions about mortality can be drawn.</p><p>Limitations of this study include a loss to follow-up of 17%, which should have been partly offset by the planned sample size augmentation of 15% to account for anticipated mortality. A lack of follow-up of primary outcomes beyond 2&#x02005;weeks is another limitation. Moreover, some patients may benefit from ongoing IMT beyond a 2&#x02005;week training period, particularly as most did not return to 100% of predicted MIP values during this study. In patients with COPD, IMT has longer-term benefits including lower rates of hospitalisation over a 12&#x02005;month period.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> It is possible therefore that IMT in the postextubation period has ongoing effects, which should be assessed further.</p><p>With regard to the training device, a ceiling effect was problematic in two participants whose MIP exceeded 82 at baseline. As the maximum resistance setting on the device is 41&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O, it was impossible to provide training at greater than 50% of MIP in these two participants. While all other participants commenced at 50% MIP intensity during the training period, 16 participants (47%) achieved the 41&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O maximal setting on the device at some point during the 2&#x02005;week period, limiting further incremental training. Thus, our study may have underestimated the potential impact of IMT. In future studies of IMT we recommend using a device with the capacity to provide higher training intensities, such as an electronic device.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Furthermore, future studies may target those with identifiable strength deficits, as these may constitute a subgroup, which is most likely to benefit from training, while those with high baseline values have probably diluted the potential benefits of training in our cohort.</p><p>This study is the first to demonstrate the value of IMT for patients in the postextubation period. IMT can be considered an effective strategy to reverse some of the residual inspiratory muscle weakness, which is common following prolonged mechanical ventilation, and may enhance quality of life in these patients with just 2&#x02005;weeks of training. Future studies of ICU patients in the postextubation period should further explore the impact of IMT on quality of life, as well as the longer term effects of IMT in this group, including effects on mortality.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the physiotherapists of the Acute Support Physiotherapy Department at Canberra Hospital who provided the intervention, and the Canberra Hospital ICU research nurses (led by Ms Helen Rodgers).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Bernie Bissett at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/BernieBissett">@BernieBissett</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> BMB had full access to all of the data in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the accuracy of the analysis.
