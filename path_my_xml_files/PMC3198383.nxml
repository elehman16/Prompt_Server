To inhibit viral replication locally, an adequate concentration in the genital tract is critical.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Forty-nine participants entered a two-phase study: single-dose (SD) and multi-dose (MD), were randomized to collection of genital tract samples (endocervical cells [ECC], cervicovaginal aspirate and vaginal biopsies) at one of seven time points [0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 24 hr(s)] post-dose following SD exposure of 4 mL 1&#x00025; TFV gel and received a single dose. Forty-seven were randomized to once (QD) or twice daily (BID) dosing for 2 weeks and to collection of genital tract samples at 4, 8 or 24 hrs after the final dose, but two discontinued prior to gel application. Blood was collected during both phases at the seven times post-dose. TFV exposure was low in blood plasma for SD and MD; median C<sub>max</sub> was 4.0 and 3.4 ng/mL, respectively (C&#x02264;29 ng/mL). TFV concentrations were high in aspirates and tissue after SD and MD, ranging from 1.2&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> to 9.9&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> ng/mL and 2.1&#x000d7;10<sup>2</sup> to 1.4&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> ng/mL, respectively, and did not noticeably differ between proximal and distal tissue. TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP), the intracellular active metabolite, was high in ECC, ranging from 7.1&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> to 8.8&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> ng/mL. TFV-DP was detectable in approximately 40&#x00025; of the tissue samples, ranging from 1.8&#x000d7;10<sup>2</sup> to 3.5&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> ng/mL. AUC for tissue TFV-DP was two logs higher after MD compared to SD, with no noticeable differences when comparing QD and BID.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Single-dose and multiple-dose TFV gel exposure resulted in high genital tract concentrations for at least 24 hours post-dose with minimal systemic absorption. These results support further study of TFV gel for HIV prevention.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00561496">NCT00561496</ext-link>

Approximately 33 million people were living with HIV at the end of 2009 <xref rid="pone.0025974-UNAIDS1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. To date, the only available strategies for female users for prevention of sexual transmission are condoms and abstinence. New prevention methods such as user-controlled topical microbicides that can be applied to the vagina (or rectum) are urgently needed.</p><p>Tenofovir (TFV) is a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI) that prevents transcription of HIV RNA to DNA when converted to its active form, TFV diphosphate (TFV-DP) <xref rid="pone.0025974-Robbins1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. TFV disoproxil fumarate (TDF, or Viread&#x000ae;), an orally bioavailable form of TFV, received marketing approval for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the United States in 2001. The cumulative worldwide patient exposure to TDF is estimated to be 3.5 million patient-years of treatment. In December 2006, Gilead granted co-exclusive rights to CONRAD and the International Partnership for Microbicides (IPM) to develop, manufacture and distribute TFV gel as a topical microbicide in resource-limited countries.</p><p>Multiple nonclinical studies have demonstrated the <italic>in vitro</italic> efficacy of TFV for preventing HIV transmission <xref rid="pone.0025974-Rohan1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>.

In that study, women followed a regimen in which dosing could take place up to 12 hours before and up to 12 hours after intercourse, with no more than two doses administered in a 24-hour period. The HIV incidence rates in the TFV gel and placebo arms were 5.6 (confidence interval [CI]: 4.0, 7.7) and 9.1 (CI: 6.9, 11.7) per 100 women-years, respectively (incidence rate ratio&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.61; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017). Several other safety and effectiveness studies of 1&#x00025; TFV gel as an HIV prevention strategy are ongoing or in development, including a daily dosing strategy (VOICE: clinicaltrials.gov NCT00705679).</p><p>The objectives of the pharmacokinetic (PK) study described here were to assess the local and systemic exposure of extracellular TFV and intracellular TFV-DP after a single dose and after 14 days of once- or twice-daily dosing.

Due to its long intracellular half-life, TFV disoproxil fumarate can be taken once daily for oral treatment with tolerable side effects. Extracellular and intracellular measurements of this compound can be utilized to better assess required drug concentrations for safety, efficacy, and the prevention of resistance through pharmacokinetic studies. Measurements of extracellular TFV have been performed in a number of matrices after oral exposure and in blood after vaginal exposure <xref rid="pone.0025974-Mayer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Measurements of intracellular concentrations of the active metabolite TFV-DP have been performed in PBMCs <xref rid="pone.0025974-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. We evaluated TFV concentrations in blood plasma, vaginal fluid and vaginal tissue with single-dose administration as well as use over 14 consecutive days. However, this is the first study to measure female genital tissue and cell concentrations of TFV-DP, the active metabolite of TFV gel. With topical microbicides, since the gel is administered vaginally, it is important to measure intracellular concentrations in addition to extracellular concentrations to be certain that TFV has been absorbed.</p><p>With comparable sampling times (4, 8 and 24 hours), there was a trend toward higher concentrations of both TFV and TFV-DP in the vaginal tissue after multiple doses compared to a single dose, and the AUC for vaginal tissue TFV-DP was two logs higher in multiple-dose compared to single-dose users. Conversely, lower concentrations of TFV-DP were observed in the endocervical cells after multiple doses compared to a single dose. These and other inconsistent patterns might be a result of variability within this somewhat small sample and sparse data, making it hard to come to definitive conclusions. However, the formation of more TFV-DP after multiple doses is logical and would indicate that increased exposure time and exposure to more TFV allows for greater phosphorylation to occur within tissue mononuclear cells. Of importance for either daily or pericoital dosing is the fact that TFV tissue concentrations after both single and multiple doses were above the range of <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-HIV-1 EC<sub>50</sub>s (0.4&#x02013;8.5 &#x000b5;M) and remained so for at least 24 hours post-dose <xref rid="pone.0025974-Balzarini1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025974-Wainberg1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Tenofovir tissue concentrations were also above those required to inhibit K65R-bearing viruses, a mutation that confers resistance to the drug (EC<sub>50</sub>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;25.3 &#x000b5;M) <xref rid="pone.0025974-BorrotoEsoda1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. It is noteworthy, however, that complete inhibition of HIV-1 replication in cervicovaginal tissues may require tenofovir concentrations close to the median levels achieved in mucosal tissues after gel administration. Given the range of concentrations obtained after single and multiple doses of tenofovir gel, it is conceivable that some women might not be fully protected. Furthermore, environmental factors such as vaginal infections or inflammation, which facilitate HIV infection, as well as intercourse itself, may modify the required effective dose <xref rid="pone.0025974-Thurman1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>With multiple dosing, plasma TFV concentrations were about twice as high after twice-daily compared to once-daily dosing. There were no noticeable differences in TFV concentrations between once- and twice-daily dosing in the cervicovaginal aspirate. While the median concentration of TFV in vaginal tissue was somewhat lower for the once-daily compared to the twice-daily group, there were no noticeable increases in the concentrations of the active metabolite (TFV-DP) in vaginal tissue or endocervical cells when comparing once-daily to twice-daily use.</p><p>As expected with intravaginal dosing, the systemic exposure after a single application was lower compared to that of oral dosing. The AUC in plasma was 36.4 compared to approximately 10<sup>3</sup> ng &#x0002a; h/mL after an oral dose of TFV disoproxil fumarate as reported by Hoetelmans, et al. <xref rid="pone.0025974-Hoetelmans1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In comparison, the concentrations of TFV-DP in the genital tract were high at exposures similar to, or up to 2 logs greater than what is seen in PBMCs after oral administration <xref rid="pone.0025974-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0025974-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. Ideally, a topical microbicide should have exactly these properties of low systemic exposure and high local concentration in order to minimize side effects and the development of resistance. The low tenofovir plasma concentrations (1&#x02013;30 nM) attained after intravaginal gel administration are below its average <italic>in vitro</italic> EC<sub>50</sub> (&#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;M), making the possibility of inducing resistant virus unlikely. This assumption is further supported by the high genetic barrier to resistance demonstrated by tenofovir, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0025974-Wainberg1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0025974-Brenner1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Although high concentrations of intracellular TFV-DP were detected in a subset of participants for at least 24 hours post-dose, the window of protection afforded by vaginal application and the target concentration of protection in tissue remains unknown. However, concentrations in the cervicovaginal fluid were greater than 10<sup>4</sup> ng/ml which has been suggested to be the required threshold to prevent HIV infection based on Phase IIb data <xref rid="pone.0025974-Karim2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Without further study there is no way to know the ideal dosing interval for pericoital application, as shorter or longer intervals may be clinically effective.</p><p>Although our study is critical to the understanding of how TFV gel is absorbed and metabolized in genital tissue, several limitations must be acknowledged. Each participant only contributed to one time point for the vaginal biopsy due to feasibility issues and the concern that conducting multiple biopsies in individuals might affect plasma PK results. Because it did not appear that biopsies led to increased systemic absorption, future studies may consider conducting multiple biopsies in individuals to obtain more complete PK profiles. Another limitation is that TFV-DP was detectable in about 40&#x00025; of the vaginal tissue biopsy samples, and was detected less frequently at the Dominican Republic site. The inability to detect TFV-DP in specimens was likely due to the instability of the metabolite in tissue samples. This issue was identified during the development of the analytical method for TFV-DP whereby manipulation of the tissue quickly degraded the TFV-DP to TFV. This phenomenon was verified by two other laboratories, and has been subsequently overcome by adding solvents such as methanol to inactivate the enzymes responsible for this degradation. Finally, there is some evidence that epithelial cells are able to phosphorylate TFV <xref rid="pone.0025974-Parikh2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and so the tissue concentrations may be a reflection of phosphorylation by both immune and epithelial cell populations. If so, the concentrations of TFV-DP reported in the cytobrush samples might be artificially high because they were calculated from counts of mononuclear cells in the sample, when a proportion of epithelial cells were clearly present and potentially contributing to the concentration measured. Similarly, the concentrations of TFV-DP in the vaginal tissue might be falsely low, reflecting a dilution of the sparse mononuclear cell population (&#x0223c;50,000 CD4&#x0002b; cells/biopsy) with epithelial cell concentrations. Epithelial cells may produce TFV-DP at a different rate than immune cells, confounding the interpretation of pharmacokinetic profiles. Nonetheless, the concentrations of TFV-DP in genital tissue after vaginal dosing appear to be higher than intracellular concentrations obtained in PBMCs <xref rid="pone.0025974-Hawkins1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and extracellular concentrations in vaginal fluid <xref rid="pone.0025974-Dumond1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> after oral dosing.</p><p>Our results show that single-dose and multiple-dose TFV gel exposure leads to high genital tract concentrations for at least 24 hours post-dose and support further study of pericoital and once-daily dosing of TFV gel as potential strategies for the prevention of HIV transmission. The accurate determination of the phosphorylated form of TFV in genital tissues adds to our understanding of transmission pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. These data also offer an understanding of the genital tissue concentrations after single and multiple dosing that may correlate with the reduction of HIV transmission that was demonstrated in the recent Phase IIb study <xref rid="pone.0025974-Karim1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025974.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>The median PK parameters for single and multiple dosing by once- or twice-daily dosing (equivalent sampling time points only for genital compartments).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0025974.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025974.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0025974.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0025974.s003"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0025974.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Nicole White and Eric Kraft from the UNC CFAR Clinical Pharmacology and Analytical Chemistry Laboratory for generating plasma, cervicovaginal, and tissue data; Susan Ju for the clinical study monitoring; and Leila Coch&#x000f3;n, Robin Alaniz, Linda Miller, and Lynn Reid for the clinical site coordination.
