The primary end points were area under the plasma raltitrexed concentration-time curve from the start of the infusion to the last determined concentration (AUC(0-tldc)) and AUC to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)); secondary end points were peak concentrations of raltitrexed (Cmax) and elimination half-life (t(1/2gamma)). The groups were compared statistically using analysis of covariance. The AUCs were greater for patients with renal impairment than for patients with normal renal function (2452.2 compared with 1247.3 ng h ml(-1) for AUC(0-tldc) (ratio 1.97; 95% CI 1.36-2.84); 2961.5 compared with 1457.0 ng h ml(-1) for AUC(0-infinity) (ratio 2.03; 1.25-3.29). These differences were statistically significant (P = 0.002 and P = 0.008 for AUC(0-tldc) and AUC(0-infinity) respectively. Terminal half-life was longer for the renally impaired patients (271.2 compared with 143.3; P = 0.030). There was no significant statistical difference between the groups for Cmax (652.9 compared with 564.7 ng ml(-1) for patients with impaired and normal renal function respectively: ratio 1.16; 0.91-1.46; P = 0.204). There was a clear relationship between raltitrexed clearance and creatinine clearance. Adverse events, severe (WHO grade 3 or 4) toxicity and hospitalization due to adverse events were more frequent in the group with renal impairment. Therefore, a reduction in raltitrexed dose and increased interval between doses is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00013-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1188" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00013-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1189" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00013-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1190" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00013-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1191" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00013-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1192" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00013-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1193" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
