Thirty-two per cent of the patients discontinued treatment due to GI-toxicity, while 26% required dose reductions due to leukopenia. Radiation pneumonitis was more frequent after the combination of postoperative radiotherapy with chemotherapy. There was a better relapse-free survival in the groups receiving chemotherapy compared to radiotherapy alone (P = 0.05), which was highly significant in a multivariate Cox analysis (P = 0.004). No significant survival differences were seen. Tamoxifen had no clear overall effect but there were better relapse-free (P = 0.04) and overall (P = 0.004) survival with tamoxifen in estrogen receptor positive patients, while estrogen receptor negative patients had a somewhat poorer survival (P = 0.07) after tamoxifen. Local control was better (NS) after the combination (93%) radiotherapy and chemotherapy compared to either treatment alone (76% with radiotherapy and 74% with chemotherapy at 5 years).</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00064-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1171" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00064-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1172" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00064-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1173" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00064-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1174" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00064-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1175" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00064-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1176" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
