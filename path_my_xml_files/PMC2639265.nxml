The current management of recurrent UTI involves either repeated courses of antibiotics or low-dose long-term antibiotic prophylaxis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C1">1</xref></sup> The evidence in support of antibiotic prophylaxis is strong, with 11 placebo controlled trials of which 10 show a significant treatment benefit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C1">1</xref></sup> In these trials, antibiotic prophylaxis was highly effective: number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one recurrence was 1.85, but side effects severe enough to stop treatment were equally common (NNT for severe side effects was 1.58). The main side effects measured in the trial were fungal super-infection (oral or vaginal thrush) and gastrointestinal infections. However, a growing reluctance to prescribe antibiotics is emerging because of concerns about antimicrobial resistance and other adverse effects on the normal bacterial flora, such as super-infection with <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>. At the same time, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of cranberry products, stimulated by the conclusion of a Cochrane review that &#x02018;there is some evidence from two good quality RCTs that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period in younger women&#x02019; (mean ages 32 and 43 years).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C2">2</xref></sup></p><p>The Cochrane review of antibiotic prophylaxis and SIGN guideline 88 stated that a head-to-head trial of cranberry versus low-dose antibiotic in the prevention of recurrent UTI was required because previous placebo controlled trials had demonstrated effectiveness for both, with the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy being considerably superior.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C3">3</xref></sup> While cranberry juice has been studied in an underpowered trial of UTI prevention in 376 hospitalized older people,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C4">4</xref></sup> there is a dearth of evidence concerning its effectiveness in recurrent urinary infections in old age. This is a surprising gap in the literature, given that UTI occurs more frequently in old age than at any other time of life. In contrast, the literature on antibiotic prophylaxis does suggest that this is likely to be effective in older women. Of the 11 trials identified in the Cochrane review of antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent UTI, eight included post-menopausal women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C1">1</xref></sup> We therefore designed a trial to compare the effectiveness and acceptability of low-dose trimethoprim with cranberry products in the prevention of recurrent UTI in older women. Trial registration: ISRCTN80031108.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study population</title><p>Inclusions: community dwelling women aged &#x02265;45 years with at least two antibiotic-treated UTIs or episodes of cystitis in the previous 12 months confirmed by their general practitioner (GP) but not necessarily confirmed by microbiological culture.

The remaining withdrawals were because of side effects, which was one of the secondary outcomes for the trial. The participants represented 29% of the 470 people who were screened and met the inclusion criteria. Most participants were recruited by screening patient records from 16 GP practices, which is 20% of all the practices in Tayside. The primary outcome was objective (first recurrence of clinical UTI treated by the GP) and could not be influenced by the investigators. Moreover, participants and investigators were unaware of the participants' treatment group until the statistical analysis had been completed. Adherence to treatment in our study was very good in both groups, which together with the modest withdrawal rate lends further support to the acceptability of encapsulated cranberry extracts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C2">2</xref></sup></p><p>The internal validity of the trial therefore seems good and we also believe that the results should be applicable to other primary care populations. Nonetheless, the trial result was not what we expected. The literature had led us to predict that trimethoprim would prove considerably more effective, but only at the expense of more adverse events. Withdrawals were indeed higher in the trimethoprim group, but other adverse event rates turned out to be low and remarkably similar between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Possible explanations</title><p>We have considered the possibility that neither treatment was effective. At the design stage, we considered the inclusion of a placebo group but rejected this option because Cochrane systematic reviews have concluded that both antibiotics and cranberry products are effective in preventing UTIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C2">2</xref></sup> There is uncertainty about how effective both treatments are in older women, especially for cranberry but we did not consider that this was sufficient justification for inclusion of a placebo group. Moreover our eligibility criteria required two or more antibiotic-treated UTIs in the previous 12 months so it was reasonable to expect that without prophylaxis most women would experience a recurrence within 6 months. It is therefore unlikely that totally ineffective prophylaxis would have allowed 81 (59%) of the 137 participants to have completed 6 months of treatment free of UTI recurrence.</p><p>We selected trimethoprim for antibiotic prophylaxis because it is as effective as co-trimoxazole for treatment of UTI but has fewer side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C7">7</xref></sup> Trimethoprim was included in one of the placebo controlled clinical trials of antibiotic prophylaxis for UTI and proved as effective as co-trimoxazole and nitrofurantoin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C6">6</xref></sup> Resistance to trimethoprim in bacteria causing UTIs has increased in Northern European and American countries from 10% to 15% in the 1970s to 15% to 20% in the 1980s.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C8">8</xref></sup> The prevalence of trimethoprim resistance in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> isolates from our patients was 29%, which is only slightly higher than the average resistance for all primary care isolates from midstream urines in our laboratory (excluding catheter urine samples) of 24% in 2004. Resistance has yet to reach a level that should markedly reduce the effectiveness of trimethoprim in lower UTI. The recurrence rate after treatment of symptomatic lower UTI has been estimated for different levels of resistance to co-trimoxazole.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C9">9</xref></sup> At a resistance rate of zero, the recurrence rate was estimated to be 5%, rising to 12% at 20% resistance and 15% at 30% resistance.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C9">9</xref></sup> These calculations assumed that 60% of women would respond to co-trimoxazole if their infection was caused by a resistant organism. In a recent UK study, 61% of women with lower UTI caused by trimethoprim-resistant bacteria were symptom-free 1 week after trimethoprim treatment and 58% were free of bacteriuria 1 month after treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C10">10</xref></sup> We believe that trimethoprim prophylaxis should be effective at the levels of resistance observed in our study and in the Tayside population. It is possible that nitrofurantoin might have proved more effective as resistance is less common; however, the evidence suggests that it has more side effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C1">1</xref></sup></p><p>We selected cranberry extract in preference to juice for our study because previous work has shown equivalent efficacy between cranberry capsules (containing at least 1:30 parts concentrated juice) and cranberry juice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C11">11</xref></sup> Furthermore, cranberry capsules have potential advantages over juice; capsules are more convenient, cheaper (costs for 1 year of treatment are from &#x000a3;42 to &#x000a3;125 for cranberry tablets or capsules versus &#x000a3;175 to &#x000a3;257 for cranberry juice) and may overcome compliance issues for some individuals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C12">12</xref></sup> The high rates of withdrawal from some previous studies suggest that cranberry juice may not be an acceptable therapy over a long period of time.</p><p>Our power calculation estimated the difference in effect size to be 15%. In our trial, the difference in effect size was 15% (40% for cranberry versus 25% for trimethoprim), which was not statistically significant because the efficacy of both treatments was lower than we had predicted. We estimated that recurrence with cranberry would be 16% to 20% and 1% to 5% with antibiotics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C11">11</xref></sup> Our data regarding time to first recurrence suggest that the added benefit to patients from antibiotics is likely to be modest (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DKN489F2">2</xref>) and therefore that the value of information from a larger trial in older women is unlikely to justify the cost.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DKN489C13">13</xref></sup></p><fig id="DKN489F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Time to first recurrence of UTI.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="dkn48902"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our trial is the first to evaluate cranberry in the prevention of recurrent UTIs specifically in older women, and the first head-to-head double-blind comparison of cranberry versus antibiotic prophylaxis.</p><p>Trimethoprim had a very limited advantage over cranberry extract in the prevention of recurrent UTIs in older women and had more adverse effects.
