While nalidixic acid is no longer considered as a therapeutic agent for shigellosis, the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is the current recommendation of the World Health Organization.

The study was designed as a superiority trial and children with dysentery meeting the inclusion criteria were invited to participate. Participants received either gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) in a single daily dose for 3 days or ciprofloxacin (30 mg/kg/day) in two divided doses for 3 days. The primary outcome measure was treatment failure; secondary outcome measures were time to the cessation of individual symptoms. Four hundred and ninety four patients were randomized to receive either gatifloxacin (n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 249) or ciprofloxacin (n &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; 245), of which 107 had a positive <italic>Shigella</italic> stool culture.

Children are most at risk of infection and frequently require hospitalization and antimicrobial therapy. The WHO currently recommends the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, for the treatment of childhood <italic>Shigella</italic> infections. In recent years there has been a sharp increase in the number of organisms that exhibit resistance to nalidixic acid (an antimicrobial related to ciprofloxacin), corresponding with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. We hypothesized that infections with <italic>Shigella</italic> strains that demonstrate resistance to nalidixic acid may prevent effective treatment with ciprofloxacin. We performed a randomized controlled trial to compare 3 day ciprofloxacin therapy with 3 days of gatifloxacin, a newer generation fluoroquinolone with greater activity than ciprofloxacin. We measured treatment failure and time to the cessation of individual disease symptoms in 249 children with dysentery treated with gatifloxacin and 245 treated with ciprofloxacin. We could identify no significant differences in treatment failure between the two groups or in time to the cessation of individual symptoms. We conclude that, in Vietnam, ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin are similarly effective for the treatment of acute dysentery.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dysentery is an infection of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by diarrhea containing blood and/or mucous, abdominal cramping and tenesmus. The major cause of dysentery is the bacterial genus <italic>Shigella</italic>. Humans are the only known reservoir of <italic>Shigella</italic>, which are transmitted from person to person by the fecal-oral route, the infectious dose is low <xref rid="pntd.0001264-DuPont1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and children under five years of age are at the greatest risk of infection <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Shears1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. The precise burden of Shigellosis is difficult to estimate, particularly in developing countries, as many cases go unreported and accurate diagnosis relies on bacterial culture, which is not always feasible or reliable. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates in 1999 put the number of cases at 164.7 million per year worldwide, with 99&#x00025; of these infections occurring in developing countries <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Kotloff1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. The WHO also estimated that Shigellosis was responsible for over a million deaths per year <xref rid="pntd.0001264-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. <italic>Shigella</italic> are endemic in Vietnam <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Isenbarger1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and in Nha Trang, in central Vietnam, an incidence of 490/100,000 in children under five has been estimated <xref rid="pntd.0001264-vonSeidlein1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Antimicrobials are routinely administered to Shigellosis patients and correspond with clinical improvement <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Kabir1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Rodriguez1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, however, many infecting organisms from various regions are now resistant to multiple antimicrobials <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Isenbarger2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0001264-Nguyen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In southern Vietnam we have recently documented a transition from <italic>S. flexneri</italic> to <italic>S. sonnei</italic> which has been concurrent with a dramatic shift in antimicrobial resistance patterns <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Vinh1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The majority (&#x0003e; 90&#x00025;) of <italic>Shigella</italic> strains we now isolate demonstrate resistance to nalidixic acid <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Vinh1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Whilst nalidixic acid is no longer considered as an effective therapeutic agent for shigellosis, the fluoroquinolone, ciprofloxacin, is the current recommendation of the WHO <xref rid="pntd.0001264-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Ciprofloxacin is considered to be efficacious, cost effective and generally safe for use in a pediatric population. However, resistance to nalidixic acid generally correlates with a decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and other older generation fluoroquinolones <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Parry1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Mutations within the DNA gyrase gene (<italic>gyrA</italic>), the topoisomerase gene (<italic>parC</italic>) and multiple plasmid mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) determinants can elevate the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) to ciprofloxacin, and may hinder effective treatment <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Chau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. In fact, some <italic>Shigella</italic> strains that have been isolated from patients with dysentery have already been reported as being resistant to ciprofloxacin, with an MIC &#x0003e; 0.25 &#x000b5;g/mL <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Rahman1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Alternative regimens are obviously needed for those patients infection with organisms that may exhibit resistance to ciprofloxacin.</p><p>Gatifloxacin is a fourth generation fluoroquinolone. It has a broad spectrum of activity, with potent activity against many gram-positive and gram-negative organisms <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Fish1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Gatifloxacin has been shown to be able be distributed extensively throughout human tissues and can actively penetrate phagocytic cells <italic>in vitro</italic>
<xref rid="pntd.0001264-Grasela1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Significant intracellular accumulation means that gatifloxacin demonstrates bactericidal activity against susceptible intracellular pathogens, such as <italic>Shigella</italic>
<xref rid="pntd.0001264-Dubois1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Gatifloxacin has been demonstrated to be highly efficacious in the treatment of enteric fever caused by nalidixic acid resistant organisms in trials performed in Nepal and Vietnam <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Dolecek1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Pandit1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. A differential binding motif of gatifloxacin to the DNA gyrase (<italic>gyrA</italic>) with respect to ciprofloxacin, means that this agent is less prone to the inhibition induced by the common resistance associated mutations <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Chau1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>To date there very few published trials studying the efficacy of fluoroquinolones in the treatment of shigellosis in children <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Salam1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0001264-Vinh2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and we hypothesized that a therapy with gatifloxacin would be effective in treating shigellosis, particularly in an area with a high level of nalidixic acid resistance. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the efficacy of gatifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin in pediatric patients with uncomplicated dysentery in two locations in southern Vietnam where nalidixic acid resistant <italic>Shigella</italic> predominate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial registration</title><p>Controlled trials number ISRCTN55945881.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Time from initial investigation in hospital to the cessation of bloody/mucoid and watery diarrhea (in hours) was recorded. Duration of hospital stay was recorded in days post admission; patients were only discharged when all clinical symptoms had resolved completely.</p><p>Enrolled patients were additionally required to attend a follow up visit, which was scheduled at seven days after discharge.

The secondary endpoints were fever clearance time (FCT), i.e. time until the temperature was for the first time &#x02264;37.8&#x000b0;C and subsequently remained &#x02264;37.8&#x000b0;C for at least 48 hours; bloody diarrhea clearance time (BDCT), i.e. time until the first non-bloody stool recorded; diarrhea clearance time (DCT), i.e. time until the first non-diarrheal stool was recorded; and total duration of illness, i.e. the time till cessation of all symptoms. The follow-up visit was scheduled to occur 7 days after hospital discharge and information at this time point was not deemed to be as quantifiable as outcomes during hospitalization and, therefore, was not included in the primary outcome but the proportion of patients with failure at the follow-up visit (overall combined failure, diarrhea and other symptoms of shigellosis) was reported as a secondary endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Sample size</title><p>This trial was designed as a superiority trial of gatifloxacin versus ciprofloxacin with the hypothesis that in patients with <italic>Shigella</italic> positive stool culture, gatifloxacin reduces the proportion of patients failing treatment from 25&#x00025; to 5&#x00025;. To detect such a reduction with 80&#x00025; power at the two-sided 5&#x00025; significance level, each group required 58 culture confirmed enrollees. We estimated the rate of <italic>Shigella</italic> positive stool culture to be approximately 33&#x00025; of all children with bloody of mucoid diarrhea and the dropout rate to be approximately 5&#x00025; and thus aimed to enroll a total of 366 cases with acute dysenteric syndrome. However, when 366 cases had been enrolled, only 80 culture positive patients with <italic>Shigella</italic> were identified (culture rate 22&#x00025;), and the study was extended to enroll 134 more cases (500 in total). When 500 patients had been enrolled, 107 cases were stool culture positive for <italic>Shigella</italic>. Because of time and budget limitations, recruitment was terminated at 500. Of note, the original sample size calculation was based on a conservative sample size formula; a more precise power estimate based on simulation revealed that the power to detect the target effect with the recruited number of <italic>Shigella</italic> patients was 81&#x00025;.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatments. An administrator otherwise not involved in the trial performed randomization in blocks of 10. The random allocations were placed in sealed opaque envelopes, which were opened once the patient was enrolled into the trial after meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consecutive patients who presented to the clinic and were eligible to be enrolled were randomized and enrolled in the same sequence as they presented.

In the pediatric proportion of the population that suffers shigellosis an effective antimicrobial remains important for the management of infection. Despite shigellosis being self-limiting, antimicrobials are generally considered to be associated with clinical improvement and a shortened duration of disease. The findings of a recent Cochrane review support antimicrobial use in <italic>Shigella</italic> infections, although the overall strength of data on antimicrobial therapy for shigellosis is weak and requires further consideration <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Christopher1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. One potential effect of a suitable antimicrobial therapy for all <italic>Shigella</italic> patients is reducing fecal carriage of the organisms after infection, thus reducing transmission to close contacts, such as household members or children attending the same day-care setting <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Kabir1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Traa1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Vinh2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>A three day course of ciprofloxacin is the treatment currently recommended by the WHO for shigellosis, including <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic> type 1 infections <xref rid="pntd.0001264-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In the study presented here, 494 children hospitalized for acute dysentery (in which 107 cases had a <italic>Shigella</italic> positive stool culture) were treated by either current WHO recommendations, or three days of one daily dose of oral gatifloxacin. Our study could not demonstrate the superiority of gatifloxacin. Rather, it showed a similar efficacy of both drugs in the treatment of childhood dysentery, including those with a stool culture confirmed <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. However, gatifloxacin has a longer half-life than ciprofloxacin and the once-a-day administration may be considered a little more convenient than twice-a-day regime of ciprofloxacin. In total, 67.3&#x00025; of <italic>Shigella</italic> strains isolated were nalidixic acid resistant, but both antimicrobials appeared to clear <italic>Shigella</italic> from stools equally effectively (as tested by microbiological culture).</p><p>Our work has some caveats, firstly, blinding was not performed due to financial limitations and differing regimens, thus there was the potential of introducing investigator bias, yet, this was minimal due as result of the randomization process. Secondly, the primary endpoint was a composite endpoint of both clinical symptoms and microbiological failure, which was deemed more appropriate due to the nature of the infection. Furthermore, it was not possible to identify an infecting agent in the majority of cases, and we know from our currently unpublished work that more than one etiological agent may cause the infection. Therefore, whilst cessation of symptoms is the most relevant clinical end point (for the treating clinician and the patient) for shigellosis, it may be difficult to assess accurately and consistently. We cannot rule out that the persistence of symptoms may be caused by an additional infecting pathogen. Finally, it would be difficult to conduct such a trial in the community in this setting, etiological diagnostics for diarrheal disease are not routinely performed in this location and we are uncertain of the burden of shigellosis in the community. Our study may represent the most severe end of the disease spectrum for shigellosis, yet it is these individuals that may require the most apposite antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>Our data show similar overall risks of treatment failure in the two treatment groups (11&#x00025; in the ciprofloxacin group versus 12&#x00025; in gatifloxacin group). The overall risk of treatment failure rate of 8.4&#x00025; in culture confirmed shigellosis cases is considerably lower than the 31&#x00025; to 35&#x00025; reported in the treatment of dysentery in a 2002 study <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Multicenter1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. This disparity in failure rate may be reflected by a difference in the principal <italic>Shigella</italic> serotype isolated. The most commonly isolated <italic>Shigella</italic> species here was <italic>S. sonnei,</italic> whilst <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic> was the most common isolated in the aforementioned 2002 study. <italic>S. dysenteriae</italic> causes a considerably more severe syndrome than <italic>S. sonnei</italic>, which is largely associated with the secretion of shiga toxin <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Acheson1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In an additional shigellosis treatment trial, the failure rate in adults treated with ciprofloxacin was 18&#x00025; <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Khan1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In dysentery treatment trial conducted in Ho Chi Minh City, <italic>S. flexneri</italic> was the dominant serogroup and the failure rate with the fluoroquinolone, ofloxacin, was comparable to our current data, at 10&#x00025; <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Vinh2" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. A possible explanation for a reduced treatment failure rate, despite a pattern of reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, is that shigellosis caused by <italic>S. sonnei</italic> is gradually becoming a more benign infection, an opinion that is shared by others <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Sansonetti1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Alternatively, due to improvements in education and healthcare, patients are now admitted to hospital earlier. Therefore, case management has improved and children receive therapy more rapidly after the onset of symptoms. Here, we observed similar failure rates in both treatment groups, despite a relationship between nalidixic acid resistance and reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin. These data suggest that whilst there has been a notable increase in MIC to nalidixic acid in <italic>Shigella</italic> in Vietnam over the last ten years, it may not yet be substantial enough to hinder the bactericidal effect of ciprofloxacin <italic>in vivo</italic>. A similar effect of both antimicrobial agents, despite gatifloxacin having greater <italic>in vivo</italic> activity supports the theory of a less severe infection, which may not, in all cases, require an antimicrobial for the cessation of symptoms. Alternatively, <italic>Shigella</italic> may respond in atypical manner to gatifloxacin, which respect to other Gram-negative organisms, and mutations in the <italic>gyrA</italic> and <italic>parC</italic> gene may have a greater effect on reducing the potency of the antimicrobial agent.</p><p>The use of fluoroquinolones in children has been contraindicated for many years because of the fear of arthropathy, however there is limited evidence to support this theory. A two year of follow-up of children treated with a short course ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin for typhoid fever in Vietnam did not find any adverse effects on growth and there was no evidence or arthropathy <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Bethell1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. A more recent study conducted in a sheep model showed that neither ciprofloxacin nor gatifloxacin affected growth velocity when administered with using dosing regimen suitable for children <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Sansone1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The WHO, after considering the risks and the benefits, has recommended ciprofloxacin as the primary treatment of shigellosis in adults and children <xref rid="pntd.0001264-WHO2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, our data suggests that this choice remains effective and we consider fluoroquinolones safe for use in the pediatric population. Gatifloxacin is an effective treatment against many Gram-negative infections, yet was voluntarily withdrawn from the US and Canadian drug market in May 2006 because of concerns about severe glucose disturbances. Reports of gatifloxacin related hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in clinical trials are rare, yet severe dysglycemic events (mainly involved elderly patients with diabetes) were reported and discussed in the medical literature during the post-marketing period <xref rid="pntd.0001264-ParkWyllie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Yadav1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Ittner1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. To date, clinically relevant dysglycemia has not been reported in young adults or in children treated with gatifloxacin <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Arjyal1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0001264-Pichichero1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, we found no evidence of dysglycemia in the gatifloxacin treatment group. Treatment options for many Gram-negative infections in developing countries, including <italic>Shigella</italic> are clearly becoming increasingly limited. Gatifloxacin is a highly efficacious antimicrobial for the treatment of many gastrointestinal infections in the young and otherwise healthy patients and should be available for such indications in locations (i.e. in industrializing countries) where these diseases are endemic. However, in view of the potential risk of dysglycemia, it may be prudent to not treat patients over 50 years of age or with additional co-morbidities with such infections with gatifloxacin.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that despite a substantial increase in the number of organisms demonstrating resistance to nalidixic acid in the preceding years, ciprofloxacin remains an effective therapy for acute bacterial dysentery. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gatifloxacin is similarly effective as ciprofloxacin in the cessation of symptoms of shigellosis. Our current knowledge of the mechanisms and the global distribution of <italic>Shigella</italic> with reduced susceptibility to older fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) remain limited and require further investigation. We conclude that in locations where nalidixic acid resistant <italic>Shigellae</italic> are highly prevalent, ciprofloxacin and gatifloxacin are similarly effective for the treatment of acute shigellosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0001264.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist</p><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0001264.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0001264.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0001264.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the directors and the clinical and microbiology staff of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Ho Chi Minh City and Dong Thap Provincial Hospital for their support with this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>This work was supported by The Wellcome Trust of Great Britain, Euston Road, London, United Kingdom.
