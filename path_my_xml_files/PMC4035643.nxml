A total of 129 patients underwent laparoscopic pyeloplasty. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon with &#x0003e;3 years of prior laparoscopic suturing experience.</p><p>Twenty-two patients were excluded from the study: 8 patients who underwent transperitoneal but nondismembered pyeloplasty (which included 3 redo nondismembered pyeloplasties), 9 patients who underwent retroperitoneoscopy, 2 patients who underwent redo dismembered pyeloplasty, and 3 infants who underwent laparoscopy-assisted pyeloplasty (pelvis and ureter brought out through a 10-mm flank port for extracorporeal anastomosis). Hence, 107 patients were included in the study.</p><p>The initial 65 patients (until December 2007) underwent anastomosis using interrupted sutures, and the latter 42 patients had continuous sutures. All patients had a preoperative ultrasonogram, intravenous urogram or computed tomography urogram, and diuretic renogram; a sterile urine culture before surgery; and an indwelling ureteric stent placed during surgery. Postoperatively, the stent was removed after 6 weeks. Patients were followed up with a urine culture and diuretic renogram at 6 months and then annually for 5 years. Data on the operation time, suturing time, drain quantity, hospital stay, success rate (based on renogram done at 6 months), complications, and the overall cost of the procedures were analyzed. The cost analysis was done using the methodology of converting historic cost into present values and applying average rates of inflation in India obtained from the Consumer Price Index. The cost included the combined costs of hospital stay, operation charges, and drug charges. We compiled the data using a spreadsheet and the formula &#x0201c;FVschedule,&#x0201d; which is designed to calculate future values as they relate to current values. The statistical analysis using Student <italic>t</italic> test to assess the level of significance was done with SPSS 20.0 software (SPSS, Inc./IBM, Armonk, New York).</p><sec><title>Operative Technique</title><p>While under general anesthesia, the patient was placed in the lithotomy position and a retrograde pyelogram was done to assess the length of the adynamic segment of the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) and ureter. A guidewire was placed to aid identification of the ureter and to facilitate suturing. A stent was not placed at the same time because it would have been a hindrance for spatulation.</p><p>The patient was then placed in 70&#x000b0; lateral position. Four ports were used (10-mm port 3 cm above and lateral to the umbilicus for the camera; two 5-mm ports in the midclavicular line in the subcostal region and iliac fossa, and the fourth port in the anterior axillary line for suction or irrigation) <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>)</bold>. For the transperitoneal approach, the colon was reflected medially and the renal pelvis was mobilized. The proximal ureter was mobilized, with care taken to preserve the vascularity and crossing vessels if present. In patients with left UPJ obstruction, if the vascular pattern of the mesocolon was conducive<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and if the fat in the mesentery was minimal, the UPJ was dissected using the transmesocolic approach. The UPJ was dismembered and the ureter spatulated laterally using scissors without using diathermy. All ureteropelvic anastomoses were performed by intracorporeal suturing.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Port positions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jls0041332200001"/></fig><p>The size of the suture used depended on the age of the patient: 4-0/5-0 polyglactin and 4-0/5-0 polydioxanone sutures were used for interrupted and continuous sutures, respectively.

Pyeloplasty comprises most of the laparoscopic procedures done at our center (22% of all the laparoscopic urological procedures performed at our center).</p><p>Suturing is the most time-consuming step of any laparoscopic reconstructive procedure. Continuous and interrupted suturing techniques are used for laparoscopic pyeloplasty.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> We use freehand suturing for laparoscopic pyeloplasty. For the initial 65 patients (60%), interrupted sutures with intracorporeal knotting were used (interrupted suturing group), and for the subsequent 42 patients (40%), continuous sutures using polydioxanone (nonbraided suture) were used (continuous suturing group).</p><p>The effect of continuous and interrupted sutures with regards to tissue vascularity and collagen damage is controversial.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Most of the experimental studies were done in laboratory animals and mainly involved bowel anastomoses. Sarin et al concluded that there was no significant increase in the incidence of leak or tissue damage with continuous sutures, although previous reports suggest that there can be vascular compromise with continuous suturing.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Continuous sutures may also cause deficiencies in collagen regeneration.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Margo et al compared continuous and interrupted suturing techniques for ureteroneocystostomy in cats and inferred that continuous suturing causes more tissue ischemia and necrosis.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Kass et al have suggested using interrupted sutures, especially for pyeloplasty in infants, to prevent the purse-string effect.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Another difficulty with using continuous sutures in laparoscopy is maintaining appropriate tension during the procedure. When the continuous sutures are not tight enough, leakage may occur. When braided polyglactin sutures are used for continuous suturing, tightening of the suture after 3 or 4 continuous sutures may become difficult. The memory of nonbraided sutures can sometimes be a hindrance, but the advantage is that the sutures could be appropriately tightened at any stage.</p><p>Haudart et al studied continuous and interrupted sutures in bowel anastomosis and concluded that there is no difference in the leak rate between the 2 types of anastomosis.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Bruch et al reported that single-layer continuous suturing could be accomplished in bowels in less time and at a lower cost.<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>In a study on porcine models, Leiber et al concluded that interrupted sutures were more often associated with extensive muscular fibrosis compared with continuous suturing.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The improvement in GFR among patients in the interrupted suturing group was 4.6 mL/min and in the continuous suturing group was 4.7 mL/min. The difference was not statistically significant.</p><p>However, reports of large studies of laparoscopic pyeloplasty by Rassweiler et al<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and Teber et al,<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> wherein continuous sutures have been used, show comparable outcomes and complication rates.</p><p>Recently, barbed sutures have been used for pyeloplasty. In vivo studies indicate that the suturing time is not significantly different between standard suturing and self-retaining barbed sutures.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Self-retaining barbed sutures are more frequently used for vesicourethral anastomosis during laparoscopic radical prostatectomy.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>The mean suturing time was considerably reduced using continuous sutures, from 64 minutes (range, 55&#x02013;80) to 55 minutes (range, 50&#x02013;65) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Papalia et al and Shao et al have also mentioned similar findings in a study comparing interrupted and continuous sutures.<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> However, Papalia et al mentioned that the reduction in operative time was related to the combined use of continuous suture and retrograde stenting. Drain volume and its relation to the continuous or interrupted suture were not studied. In our study, all patients had antegrade stenting.</p><p>There are fallacies when we estimate the time taken for the procedure and suturing. If a large redundant pelvis needs to be sutured, the time taken would be longer. The presence of secondary calculi may also prolong the procedure. The time taken for stenting may also vary from patient to patient. The transmesocolic approach to the UPJ would also reduce the overall operative time.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Recently, a few reports of robot-assisted pyeloplasty have been published and show no difference in all the parameters, even though suturing may be easier.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>The volume of drainage was significantly less in the continuous suturing group, and hence the drain tube was retained for a shorter period (mean, 2.8 days for the continuous suturing group vs 4.2 days for the interrupted suturing group, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). This may be caused by less leakage from the suture line with the use of continuous sutures. Reduced drain output also had an impact on the duration of hospitalization (2.7 days vs 4.6 days in favor of continuous sutures; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), because many of the patients preferred to be discharged after the drain was removed. The overall cost of the procedure was less among the continuous suturing group patients (mean, 59 530 Indian rupees or 1101 USD vs 55 760 Indian rupees or 1031 USD; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). The reduced overall cost of the surgery for the continuous suturing group patients may be attributed to the reduced duration of surgery and hospitalization and fewer complications.</p><p>Shao et al<sup><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> mention that the incidence of urine leak was negligible in the continuous suturing group. However, the mean hospital stay was 6 days in their study vs a mean stay of 2.7 days in the continuous suturing group in our study. Similarly, Papalia et al<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> mention that one patient had a significant leak in the continuous suturing group. However, no comparison was made between the volume of drainage output and its impact on the hospital stay, as in our study. The urinary leak and drain output are more relevant to the transperitoneal approach than the retroperitoneal approach. In the study by Shao et al, all of the patients were operated by the retroperitoneoscopic route.</p><p>There may be bias in this study related to the learning curve. However, all of the procedures were done by a single surgeon with 3 years of laparoscopic suturing experience. Thus, the influence of the learning curve may not be significant. Another consideration is that it is a retrospective study, with its own limitations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Ureteropelvic anastomosis using the continuous suturing technique has a comparable success rate with that using interrupted suturing. The time taken for suturing, postoperative drain output, and duration of drainage were lower, hence the duration of hospitalization was significantly less with continuous suturing. This reduced the overall cost of the procedure. Continuous suturing may be preferred to interrupted suturing for ureteropelvic anastomosis in patients undergoing laparoscopic pyeloplasty.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References:</title><ref id="B1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
