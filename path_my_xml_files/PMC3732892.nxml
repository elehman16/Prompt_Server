This study has been registered under Iranian Registry for Clinical Trials (IRCT: 201201258821N1).</p><p>Thirty children (10 boys, 20 girls), aged between 6 and 9 years, were selected among patients who attended the pediatric department of dental school in 2011 by convenient sampling according to the following criteria. The inclusion criteria used for selecting the patients were: children aged 6&#x02013;9 years, who had two permanent molars which needed fissure-sealant therapy and were Frankle + in cooperation (children who accept treatment with cautious behavior at times; willing to comply with the dentist, at times with reservation, but follow the dentist's direction cooperatively are Frankle +),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] with the absence of any systemic problems, physical and mental disabilities, and those who did not have any previous dental visit. Children with common cold and allergy were excluded from this study. Prior to the session, an informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians and they completed a form containing children's medical information.</p><p>In this crossover design study, participants were assigned into two groups by even&#x02013;odd method by a dental practice secretary who was blind to the aim and design of study. Half of the children were treated without any odor (control) initially and received orange aroma in the second session (intervention). Another 15 children received treatment under orange aroma in the first encounter (intervention) and treated without any aroma at the second visit (control). [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]</p><p>The natural essential oil of orange (<italic>Citrus sinensis</italic>) supplied by Giah essence corporation (Gorgan, Iran) was used.

Considering the size of the operating room which was 10 m<sup>2</sup>, based on the clinical experience and in order to receive orange odor with constant intermediate concentration, 2 ml of orange essence was stored in an identical glass bottle that was placed under a small fan in a dispenser and the timer was set so that it was activated for 2 min every 10 min. All the actions were performed half an hour before the first patient's arrival in aromatherapy days. The control groups were scheduled on different days and water was stored in the diffuser instead of aromatic oil.</p><p>Every child needed two treatment appointments and all children were treated between 8 and 9 a.m. and the second visit was in the following week at the same time. During each visit, first the child was separated from his/her parents by a nurse and carried to a room. After 5 min, a nurse who was trained and calibrated for sampling recorded the pulse rate by a finger type pulse oximeter (Nonin, Chicago, USA) and also collected unstimulated saliva by placing an absorbent cotton pellet (Salivette, Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC, Chicago, USA) sublingually. After 5 min, it was taken out and placed in a polypropylene coated tube and was numbered as the first sample of that child. Then, the child was taken to the operating room. We used the same dental procedure in both appointments, which was a routine fissure-sealant therapy performed by a senior postgraduate student of pediatric dentistry, consisting of the tooth being cleaned with a low-speed dental hand piece and a rotary bristle brush and then performing fissure-sealant therapy for one of the permanent first molars. After the completion of treatment, the nurse sampled saliva and recorded pulse rate and labeled it as the second sample. Two samplings of each visit took place in different locations and there was about 20 m distance between them in order to omit the effect of ambient odor on the first sampling. In the other visit, dental treatment was done and sample was taken following the same procedure, and third and fourth samples were collected. By collecting four samples of each child, a total of 120 samples were obtained. At the end of each appointment, the samples were sent to the laboratory. Saliva samples were centrifuged and stored frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until adequate samples were ready for analysis.

Also, patients with different diagnosis and treatment histories were included in this study. Nord and Belew reported that the children's comfort in a perianesthesia setting was enhanced by using lavender and ginger essential oils, which was not statistically significant. The samples in this study included children with and without developmental disabilities. Faces, Legs, Arms, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale was used in this study, which was performed by parents. As a strategy for blinding, parents were not trained for this scale. Thus, their reports were not reliable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] Holm and Fitzmaurice stated that anxiety of adults who accompanied children to a pediatric emergency department decreased by music compared with aromatherapy.

Assessing the influence of aromatherapy on more complex and fearful dental procedures including injection of local anesthesia and drilling is recommended in future studies. Water was used in the present study as control; using a control odor without therapeutic properties as placebo can be more useful and precise in future researches.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was approved by Chancellor for Research, School of Dentistry, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, and has no conflict with Helsinki Declaration (Grant #390146).
