For patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) virologically suppressed on a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) + 3TC/ABC regimen, the merits of switching to FTC/TDF as the NRTI backbone are unknown.</p><p><bold><italic>Methods.</italic></bold>&#x02003;SWIFT was a prospective, randomized, open-label 48-week study to evaluate efficacy and safety of switching to FTC/TDF. Subjects receiving 3TC/ABC + PI + ritonavir (RTV) with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 200 c/mL &#x02265;3 months were randomized to continue 3TC/ABC or switch to FTC/TDF. The primary endpoint was time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) with noninferiority measured by delta of 12%. Virologic failure (VF) was defined as confirmed rebound or the last HIV-1 RNA measurement on study drug &#x02265;200 c/mL.</p><p><bold><italic>Results.</italic></bold>&#x02003;In total, 311 subjects were treated in this study (155 to PI + RTV + FTC/TDF, 156 to PI + RTV + 3TC/ABC). Baseline characteristics were similar between the arms: 85% male, 28% black, median age, 46 years; and median CD4 532 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>. By TLOVR through week 48, switching to FTC/TDF was noninferior compared to continued 3TC/ABC (86.4% vs 83.3%, treatment difference 3.0% (95% confidence interval, &#x02212;5.1% to 11.2%). Fewer subjects on FTC/TDF experienced VF (3 vs 11; <italic>P</italic> = .034). FTC/TDF showed greater declines in fasting low-density lipoproteins (LDL), total cholesterol (TC), and triglycerides (TG) with significant declines in LDL and TC beginning at week 12 with no TC/HDL ratio change. Switching to FTC/TDF showed improved NCEP thresholds for TC and TG and improved 10-year Framingham TC calculated scores. Decreased epidermal growth factor receptor (eGFR) was observed in both arms with a larger decrease in the FTC/TDF arm.</p><p><bold><italic>Conclusions.</italic></bold>&#x02003;Switching to FTC/TDF from 3TC/ABC maintained virologic suppression, had fewer VFs, improved lipid parameters and Framingham scores but decreased eGFR.</p><p><bold><italic>ClinicalTrials.gov identifier.</italic></bold>&#x02003;NCT00724711.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>FTC/TDF</kwd><kwd>3TC/ABC</kwd><kwd>virologic failure</kwd><kwd>switch</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Fixed-dose combination (FDC) antiretrovirals such as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC/TDF) and lamivudine/abacavir (3TC/ABC) allow simplification of regimens to potentially improve outcomes by augmenting adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C1">1</xref>].

In light of this, we undertook a prospective, randomized, open-label trial (SWIFT) to evaluate the virologic efficacy and safety potentials and risks of a nucleos(t)ide backbone switch from 3TC/ABC to FTC/TDF in virologically suppressed subjects receiving a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor (PI) based regimen.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><p>The SWIFT study was a 48 week prospective, randomized, open&#x02013;label, multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of switching FDCs from 3TC/ABC to FTC/TDF in virologically suppressed, HIV-1 infected patients maintained on their boosted PI. Eligible subjects were &#x02265;18 years old, males and nonpregnant females, receiving 3TC/ABC plus a boosted PI with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 200 copies/mL for at least 3 months prior to study entry and &#x0003c; 200 copies/mL at screening by the COBAS TaqMan version 1.0 assay (TaqMan). Subjects had to have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &#x02265; 50 mL/minutes by the Cockcroft-Gault (CG) method, AST and ALT &#x02264; 5 times the upper limit of normal, and, if receiving lipid-lowering agents, the drug and dose had to be stable for &#x02265;3 months. Subjects were excluded if they were receiving antiretroviral agents in addition to 3TC/ABC plus a boosted PI, had known historical resistance to any of the study agents including resistance mutations to FTC/TDF (including K65R, M184V/I, or multiple thymidine analogs) or PIs. Subjects were stratified by LPV/r versus other PIs, and by co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease). Antiviral efficacy was assessed by serial measurements of plasma HIV-1 RNA at baseline, and weeks 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48, and at early study discontinuation, if it occurred. Subjects with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003e;200 copies/mL had the test repeated at the investigator's discretion.</p><p>The primary objective was to assess non-inferiority of FTC/TDF relative to 3TC/ABC measured by the proportion of subjects who maintained HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 200 c/mL through week 48 (intent-to-treat, missing = failure). Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety and tolerability, changes in CD4 cell count, assessment of eGFR using the CG, and the abbreviated modified diet in renal disease (MDRD) methods, and evaluation of change in fasting lipid parameters (TG, TC, LDL, HDL, TC: HDL). In a subset, certain cardiovascular biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP], interleukin 6 [IL-6], interleukin 10 [IL-10], tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; [TNF-&#x003b1;], and fibrinogen) were explored over the 48 weeks. Changes in the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes were determined by 10-year Framingham risk scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</title><p>The treated analysis set, used for safety and outcome summaries, includes subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of study drug. The intent to treat (ITT) analysis set, used for efficacy analysis, excludes those with major protocol violations from the treated analysis set.</p><p>The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 200 c/mL through week 48 by time to loss of virologic response (TLOVR) algorithm. TLOVR responders were those who completed the study and maintained HIV-1 RNA &#x0003c; 200 c/mL through week 48 without intervening VF. VF was defined as confirmed on-study HIV-1 RNA &#x02265; 200 c/mL on 2 successive occasions or the last on-study HIV-1 RNA &#x02265; 200 c/mL. Subjects were considered failures in the TLOVR analysis if they experienced VF, discontinued study medication before week 48, or changed to a new antiretroviral (ARV) regimen. A 2-sided exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in treatment group response rate (FTC/TDF minus 3TC/ABC) was constructed using inverted 2 one-sided tests with the standardized statistics. The FTC/TDF group was considered noninferior to the 3TC/ABC group if the lower confidence bound of the responder difference was greater than &#x02013;12%.</p><p>Descriptive statistics summarize secondary efficacy endpoints. Confidence intervals (95%) and tests of significance, all 2-sided were also used for measure of interest of secondary efficacy endpoints. Observed values and changes from baseline in the risk of CHD outcomes for the 10-year Framingham risk score were analyzed. The Framingham risk score was calculated based on using both the fasting TC score and also based on the fasting LDL score approaches. Framingham risk scores were summarized using descriptive statistics and differences between treatment groups and were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test.</p><p>The HIV-1 RNA threshold for VF was amended in the protocol 1 year into the study from 50 c/mL to 200 c/mL based on data regarding discordance between the COBAS Amplicor and the TaqMan HIV-1 test. The data showed an increased rate of samples with &#x0003e;50 c/mL in the TaqMan assay that were &#x0003c; 50 c/mL in the COBAS Amplicor assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C17">17</xref>]. This protocol change was consistent with the ACTG standard of &#x0003c; 200 c/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C18">18</xref>].

Efficacy and virologic failure rates in subjects on FTC/TDF compared to 3TC/ABC arm were comparable to results seen with this FDC seen in the BICOMBO and ASSERT trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C19">19</xref>].</p><p>We did observe slightly higher rates of discontinuation due to AEs and mild AEs considered study drug-related in the FTC/TDF vs 3TC/ABC arms. This finding is not unexpected as previous studies demonstrate an increase in certain adverse events when stable subjects are switched to a new therapy. Modest declines in eGFR occurred in both arms with the degree of decline significantly greater in FTC/TDF-treated subjects; however, values remained in the normal range. Long-term studies have shown that the use of TDF may be associated with initial declines in GFR within the first few months of starting TDF, which then stabilize [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C22">22</xref>]. Importantly, there were no differences between arms in emergent proteinuria and or normoglycemic glycosuria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="CIS1203TB4">4</xref>).</p><p>Comorbidities (FTC/TDF vs 3TC/ABC) were common in our study population, including diabetes (10% vs11%), hyperlipidemia (52% vs 62%), and hypertension (33% vs 33%). Additionally, 3.2% in both arms had a history of MI. As with previous studies, we demonstrated lipid benefits when switching to FTC/TDF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C6">6</xref>]. Significant declines in LDL and TC were observed by week 12 in the FTC/TDF arm and significant reductions in TC, LDL, and TG were seen at week 48. By NCEP category criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C16">16</xref>], higher percentages showed improvements in TC and LDL, as well as improvement (shift from a higher risk to a lower risk category) in the predicted risk for CHD outcomes with FTC/TDF as seen in other comparative studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C5">5</xref>]. In an ad hoc analysis, we found that the predicted Framingham 10-yr Risk Score was more favorable when switching FTC/TDF; particularly, for those with comorbidities, whites, and regimens with a PI other than LPV/r. Such an improvement in Framingham scores is perhaps one of the most novel benefits of switching from an 3TC/ABC to FTC/TDF-containing regimen. It is however, worthwhile to note that the small number of subjects on LPV/r and other confounding factors at baseline may make this a weaker correlation and may limit these results from being generalized. Finally, the changes from baseline in commonly used surrogate cardiovascular biomarkers (hsCRP, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, and fibrinogen) between the FTC/TDF and 3TC/ABC arm in a subset of 159 subjects were not significant except a trend toward significance with fibrinogen (<italic>P</italic> = .062) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="CIS1203TB5">5</xref>), perhaps with a larger sample size it may have achieved significance.</p><p>The SWIFT study showed that high rates of virologic suppression were well maintained through 48 weeks with fewer virologic failures in subjects who switched to FTC/TDF, and also this regimen is well tolerated. Decreases in creatinine clearance did occur with both treatments and were greater in the FTC/TDF arm. In the FTC/TDF arm, improvements in certain lipid parameters and in other measures including in NCEP categories and Framingham predicted risk for CHD outcomes were noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIS1203C16">16</xref>]. In summary, switching patients on a boosted PI regimen to FTC/TDF from 3TC/ABC is associated with important metabolic benefits without loss of virologic control.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/cid/cis1203/-/DC1">Supplementary materials</ext-link> are available at <italic>Clinical Infectious Diseases</italic> online (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/</uri>).
