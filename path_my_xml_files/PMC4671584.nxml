Since studies began in the 1990s, nearly all foxes examined were found to be infected with ear mites, and ceruminous gland tumors (carcinomas and adenomas) were detected in approximately half of all foxes &#x02265; 4 years of age. We hypothesized that reduction of ear mite infection would reduce otitis externa and ceruminous gland hyperplasia, a risk factor for tumor development. In this study, we conducted a randomized field trial to assess the impact of acaricide treatment on ear mite prevalence and intensity of infection, otitis externa, ceruminous gland hyperplasia, and mite-specific IgG and IgE antibody levels. Treatment was highly effective at eliminating mites and reducing otitis externa and ceruminous gland hyperplasia, and mite-specific IgG antibody levels were significantly lower among uninfected foxes. Ceruminous gland hyperplasia increased in the chronically infected, untreated foxes during the six month study. Our results provide compelling evidence that acaricide treatment is an effective means of reducing ear mites, and that mite removal in turn reduces ear lesions and mite-specific IgG antibody levels in Santa Catalina Island foxes. This study has advanced our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis which results in ceruminous gland tumors, and has helped inform management decisions that impact species conservation.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by Morris Animal Foundation (TWV; grant number D08ZO-043; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org">http://www.morrisanimalfoundation.org</ext-link>), Institute for Wildlife Studies (TWV, MEM; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iws.org">http://www.iws.org</ext-link>), Catalina Island Conservancy (JLK, CLD; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.catalinaconservancy.org">https://www.catalinaconservancy.org</ext-link>), Greer Laboratories, Inc.

The Santa Catalina Island (SCA) fox (<italic>Urocyon littoralis catalinae</italic>) is one of six distinct subspecies [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] native to the Channel Islands off the coast of Southern California (SCA: 33&#x000b0;24&#x02019; N, 118&#x000b0;24&#x02019; W). In 1999, a suspected distemper epidemic decimated 85&#x02013;90% of this population, and the remaining ~100 foxes in this subspecies were listed as federally endangered [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Intensive management actions including translocation, captive breeding, and vaccination successfully averted extinction and contributed to rapid population growth to an estimated population of 1,114 in 2012 [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144271.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although the population is now increasing, disease epidemics remain a primary threat to the continued existence of the SCA foxes [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144271.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Ceruminous gland tumors (carcinomas and adenomas) were first observed in SCA foxes in 2001 [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In our companion study conducted from 2001&#x02013;2008, Vickers et al. found that approximately half of SCA foxes &#x02265; 4 years of age had ceruminous gland tumors, and that ear mites were present in &#x0003e; 98% of SCA foxes [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Ear mites have been detected in two other subspecies of Channel Island foxes in the Southern islands, but never in the three subspecies in the Northern islands; however, SCA foxes are the only subspecies that have ear canal tumors (<xref rid="pone.0144271.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It remains unclear why some subspecies of island foxes have ear mites and others do not, but potential hypotheses include historical introduction of ear mites by feral cats to the Southern islands [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], as well as possible differences in immune response or genetic susceptibility. Quantitative risk assessment showed that tumors are associated with ceruminous gland hyperplasia (CGH), which is in turn strongly correlated with otitis externa caused by ear mites (<italic>Otodectes cynotis</italic>) [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SCA foxes are uniquely predisposed to severe ear canal lesions, and that ear mites incite an inflammatory response and ceruminous gland hyperplasia that precede and may promote tumor formation and carcinogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0144271.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0144271.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Map of the Channel Islands (California, USA).</title><p>Distribution of foxes that are uninfected or infected with ear mites, and foxes that have ear canal tumors.

This thickened ceruminous exudate can be carcinogenic [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and a study in dogs and cats demonstrated a strong association between chronic otitis externa and the development of ceruminuous gland hyperplasia and neoplasia [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In SCA foxes, mite infection has been seen in association with marked otitis externa, peri-aural wounds, cellulitis, localized secondary bacterial infections and septicemia, as well as ceruminous gland carcinomas with local invasion and distant metastasis [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although mites appear to initiate a cascade of events that may predispose to ceruminous gland tumors, no previous studies have examined what effect mite removal could have on disease progression.</p><p>The objective of this randomized six month field trial was to assess the effect of acaricide treatment on ear mites, ear canal lesions, and levels of mite-specific antibodies (IgG and IgE) in free-ranging SCA foxes. In addition, we compared levels of mite-specific antibodies from SCA foxes with Santa Cruz Island (SCZ) foxes (<italic>Urocyon littoralis santacruzae</italic>), a closely related subspecies with no evidence of ear mites, otitis, or ceruminous tumors. We hypothesized that (1) mite prevalence and intensity of infection would be significantly reduced by treating foxes with acaricide; (2) mite removal would be associated with reduced otitis and ceruminous gland hyperplasia; and (3) mite removal would be associated with reduced levels of mite-specific IgG and IgE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Animal capture and biological sampling of SCA foxes was authorized under a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Federal 10(a)1(A) permit (No. TE744878-9) and a Memorandum of Understanding with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).

Traps were placed along transects near roads and trails, at 250&#x02013;300 meter intervals. One to two traps were set at each site, with 15&#x02013;44 sites used each day. All traps were checked each morning, and foxes were examined, sampled, treated, and released at the site of capture. Foxes were blindfolded and manually restrained while the project veterinarian (TWV) performed a physical examination and otoscopic assessment of both ear canals. Baseline data were collected, including passive integrated transponder tag number, sex, age, weight, physical condition, and ear canal observations. Foxes 1&#x02013;3 years old were classified as young and foxes &#x02265; 4 years old were classified as mature. If exact age could not be determined from previous capture history, foxes were assigned to age groups using tooth wear patterns [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and foxes were categorized as young if they had Class 1 dentin exposure patterns or mature if they had Class 2&#x02013;4 dentin exposure patterns.</p><p>Ear mite infection intensity was assessed by two methods: mite score and mite count. A subjective mite severity score was determined otoscopically by the project veterinarian (<xref rid="pone.0144271.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). After scoring, a cotton swab was inserted into each ear canal to collect mites, then placed in a glass tube and kept in an insulated container with ice packs until being stored at 4&#x02013;8&#x000b0;C. Within a week of collection, samples were shipped on dry ice to the laboratory at the University of California, Davis, and the number of mites was determined using a dissecting microscope (MEM).

A nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (Ketoprofen, 2 mg/kg, Zoetis Inc., Kalamazoo, MI, USA) and systemic antibiotic (Enrofloxacin, 10 mg/kg, Bayer, West Haven, CT, USA) were given subcutaneously.</p><p>A 10 ml blood sample was collected by jugular venipuncture into a serum collection tube and kept in an insulated container with ice packs. After clotting, blood samples were refrigerated and centrifuged at 1176 x g (Fischer Scientific Centrific Model 225) within 24 hours of capture; sera were dispensed into aliqots and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until used for testing mite-specific IgG and IgE. Foxes in the treated group received fipronil (Frontline Top Spot, 30 mg/kg, Merial, Ltd., Duluth, GA, USA) topically between the shoulder blades and ivermectin (Acarexx, 0.5 ml of 0.01% solution, Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., St. Joseph, MO, USA) in each ear.

This is an off-label use, but was justified to reduce the likelihood of immediate re-infestation from contact with other foxes (longer half-life than ivermectin), and to prevent reintroduction of mites from one ear to the other via the skin surface.

Following overnight incubation at -20&#x000b0;C, the mite suspension was centrifuged at 12,857 x g and the supernatant was collected and used as mite-specific antigen. The protein content was determined colorimetrically with a BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Immulon 4HBH flat bottom strip assemblies (Thermo Electron Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) were used throughout and served as the solid phase for all direct bind enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

Biotinylated monoclonal anti-IgG antibodies were used as the primary probe reagent, streptavidin alkaline phosphatase as the enzyme containing secondary tracer, and p-nitrophenylphosphatase as the chromogenic substrate [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>To standardize the results of the assay and enable consistent comparisons of assay results, across multiple assay runs and variable serum dilutions, all results were normalized to a four point calibration [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The relative quantity of mite-specific IgG was interpolated from a four point regression curve created by plotting the background-corrected optical density observed with each of the calibrators versus an arbitrarily assigned concentration value based upon the dilution schema used for preparing the calibrator solutions. The relative IgG level present in the original serum sample is the product of the interpolated value and the serum dilution factor that was tested. Sera collected from Santa Cruz Island (SCZ) foxes (n = 43) served as ear mite uninfected comparisons.

Mite removal appears to decrease chronic ear canal irritation and excessive cerumen production, likely diminishing pathologic changes in the ear that might lead to tumor formation. The fact that CGH actually increased in such a short period of time within persistently infected foxes provides strong evidence that the long-term presence of mites is likely associated with epithelial hyperplasia. Rapid cell division over time increases the chance of acquiring an oncogenic mutation, leading to uncontrolled growth and the development of epithelial tumors like ceruminous adenomas and carcinomas [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Without intervention, hyperplasia in the ear canal will continue to advance in mite-infected foxes, likely increasing the risk of tumor development.</p><p>The decrease in mite prevalence and intensity of infection supports the continued use of ivermectin or other acaricides aurally to reduce ear mite infections in SCA foxes. A small number of foxes in the treated group were infected with mites at t<sub>3</sub>; this may be attributable to incomplete elimination of initial infection, or reinfection. Mite count decreased in both treated and untreated groups over the six month study, and although the decrease was much more substantial in the treated group, the mite reduction within the untreated group was unexpected. We suspect that mechanical removal of mites and alteration of the aural environment during sampling and biopsy procedures might have contributed to this overall decline. Administration of lidocaine and application of styptic powder to the biopsy sites, as well as exudate or serum produced by the healing process, may have contributed to a temporary reduction in mite burdens in both groups immediately after biopsy. Any process that increases inflammation and exudate in the ear canal can create an inhospitable environment for ear mites, often causing mites to abandon the ear canal or die, thus decreasing overall mite burden [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This &#x0201c;washout effect&#x0201d; of serum or exudate has also been suggested in SCA foxes with severely diseased ear canals where few mites are present [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. It is also possible that by reducing the mite burden in a proportion of the population, we decreased the rate of reinfection, which occurs almost exclusively through direct contact with infected foxes [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Seasonal change in mite burden is unlikely because SCA island&#x02019;s climate is dry and warm, with only mild fluctuations in temperature and rainfall [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], <italic>O</italic>. <italic>cynotis</italic> is an obligatory ectoparasite that completes all life stages on its host [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], high mite prevalence has been detected in SCA foxes throughout the year, and overall fox body condition does not appear to change with the seasons (JKL, personal communication).</p><p>Currently, Island foxes are an intensively managed species, and will be for the foreseeable future. During annual island-wide census trapping on SCA island, a substantial number of foxes are examined, identified with a passive integrated transponder tag, and vaccinated against canine distemper and rabies. If acaricide administration is included in annual trapping efforts, a proportion of the population could be treated regularly, which could result in lower mite prevalence in the population over time. Future longitudinal studies are needed to provide follow-up on individual foxes and their offspring, as well as population-level effects of treatment.</p><p>The lack of demonstrable mite-specific IgE in SCA foxes included in this study makes it highly unlikely that an IgE mediated hypersensitivity to mite allergens is involved in the ear pathology observed in mite infected foxes. In contrast, mite-specific IgG was readily demonstrable in the sera of all foxes tested. Although the IgG ELISA results were not significantly different between treated and untreated foxes, both groups demonstrated a decrease in IgG levels between t<sub>0</sub> and t<sub>3</sub>. This decline in IgG antibodies is likely attributable to the overall decrease in mite count in both groups. Consistent with this observation, we found that uninfected foxes had significantly lower IgG levels than infected foxes. In fact, the levels of IgG in SCA treated and uninfected foxes were similar to that of SCZ foxes that have never been infected with ear mites. While SCZ foxes do not have ear mites, they are expected to have low levels of demonstrable IgG because of potential cross-reactivity with other ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks, internal parasites, or similar environmental antigens. It appears that mite specific IgG antibodies are induced following mite infection and the level of IgG is related to the mite burden within the ear canal. Because IgG can be associated with immune-complex formation and type III hypersensitivity reactions, it is possible that these types of inflammatory responses may exacerbate otitis and CGH [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further investigations to characterize the immunomodulatory effect of mites [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144271.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] should reveal any link between IgG antibodies and ear pathology evident in SCA foxes.</p><p>The prevalence of tumors at the beginning of the study was 51% among mature foxes. This prevalence is similar to the 52% prevalence of tumors detected from 2007&#x02013;2008 in Vickers et al. 2015 [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The incidence of new tumors during the six month trial was quite high: 33% among mature foxes and 9% across both young and mature age groups. The high tumor incidence emphasizes the need to continue studying this unusual disease process in this endangered population, and developing and testing treatment strategies.</p><p>These results advance our understanding of the underlying pathogenesis which results in ceruminous gland tumors. In this trial, we treated ear mites with acaricide and documented its effect on ear canal lesions, including tumor presence. Our findings have helped inform management decisions and now all SCA foxes caught during annual trapping efforts are treated aurally with ivermectin. As a consequence, prevalence of ear mites in the fox population appears to have decreased to approximately 19% (65/340 foxes examined) as of 2014, and treated adults appear to raise uninfected pups more often than untreated adults (JLK, personal communication).</p><p>This field trial is novel in that a treatment strategy that may reduce the incidence of cancer was successfully tested in an endangered free-ranging population. The disease threat that ear canal tumors pose in this conservation-dependent species warranted such an intervention, and additional studies, especially those focusing on genetic susceptibility [<xref rid="pone.0144271.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], should be conducted to determine why SCA foxes appear to be uniquely susceptible to tumor formation.

She was deeply committed to the investigation of diseases in Channel Island foxes and was a pioneer of health surveillance in many wildlife populations. She was a brilliant, dedicated, and caring mentor and colleague. She remains an inspiration to conservationists and pathologists throughout the world.</p><p>The authors thank M. Puzzo, R. Shea, L.
