Continuing medical education (CME), therefore, is widely acknowledged as an indispensable part of the working life of physicians. With the introduction of the Internet, e-learning, i.e. the use of Internet technologies that enhance knowledge and performance, can be integrated into CME programmes. Compared to conventional learning, e-learning has the advantage that participants can choose the place and time of education themselves. Within a clinical context, the effect of Internet-based CME programmes is comparable to traditional approaches of CME [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>]. Although there are some initiatives among undergraduate occupational physicians (OPs) in using e-learning, until now the effect of postgraduate e-learning among OPs has not been evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>].</p><p>The occupational health context differs from the clinical context or primary health care because OPs must, next to medical issues, consider the working situations of their patients, management priorities and legislation. Another barrier for e-learning in CME in occupational health care could be that OPs are not frequently using the Internet for obtaining information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]. The aim of this study, therefore, was to evaluate the effect of e-learning on knowledge gain as compared to regular lecture-based learning in a CME programme on mental health care for OPs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was a randomized controlled trial and was conducted in December 2006 during a meeting on mental health care within a series of four postgraduate meetings for OPs. OPs were randomly assigned to four different groups in order of arrival at the meeting, by means of a four-block randomization system. The OPs were unaware that two teaching approaches were compared during the meeting. Two groups received lecture-based teaching while the other two groups received individual e-learning in a classroom, both with the same content. The duration of both lessons was 30 min. Immediately before and immediately after the lesson, the OPs completed a knowledge test.</p><p>Since employees with mental health problems constitute a large part of the working population that visits the OP, we developed the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mentalhealthandwork.com">http://mentalhealthandwork.com</ext-link> (psychischenwerk.nl), covering three main topics: diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. The website includes an e-learning module which was designed as a self-directed teaching tool for occupational health care professionals. The module provides participants with information, invites to search for information on the website and asks to solve cases or answer multiple-choice questions using this information.</p><p>Each knowledge test consisted of 30 true/false questions and three open-ended ones. Two experts in mental health care and one expert in occupational health care education developed a pool of 66 questions. Two versions of the test, version X and Y, each containing different questions from the pool were generated. The use of the knowledge tests was counterbalanced: one e-learning group completed test X before finishing the e-learning module and test Y after finishing. The other e-learning group completed test Y before the e-learning module and test X after finishing it. The same procedure was used in the two lecture-based learning groups. For each correct answer, the score was &#x02018;1&#x02019; and for each incorrect answer the score was &#x02018;0&#x02019;. Sum scores were converted to a percentage of the possible total score.</p><p>Differences in baseline characteristics were tested with <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. To determine whether &#x02018;test version&#x02019; needed to be included as a covariate in the analyses, score differences at baseline between version X and Y were tested using a <italic>t</italic>-test. The effect of both learning approaches on knowledge was evaluated by comparing the change in knowledge between the two groups. Analyses were performed using the general linear model for repeated measures. Next, subgroup analyses were conducted within both learning approaches to investigate age and experience as an OP as potential predictors for change in knowledge. Data were analysed using SPSS version 13.0.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 74 OPs attended the meeting. Randomization assigned half of them to the e-learning and half to the lecture-based groups. Two OPs in the lecture-based group were excluded because they arrived too late.

This is especially of interest since the study was conducted in a group of OPs with a high mean age and assumed fewer computer skills. Earlier, a lack of computer skills has been identified as a major barrier preventing doctors to use computer-based learning methods, rather than a lack of preference for new technologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]. Since computer skills are part of the current vocational training and education, e-learning may play an even more important role in the CME of OPs in the near future. We did not include the participants' preference for, or satisfaction with, the tested learning approaches. Nevertheless, the meeting itself was rated 7.1 (0&#x02013;10), which was in line with the rating of the other three meetings that year.</p><p>This study is the first to demonstrate that e-learning can be useful for CME in the occupational health care setting. It will enable OPs to choose the place and time to educate themselves. Recently, Fordis <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>] found that web-based CME can lead to behaviour change as well as sustained knowledge gains that are superior to traditional approaches. A next step within occupational health care may be to study the effectiveness of different forms of e-learning and also the persistence of obtained knowledge over time. Even more important is to study the impact of e-learning on professional practice.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>Funding to pay the Open Access publication charges for this article was
