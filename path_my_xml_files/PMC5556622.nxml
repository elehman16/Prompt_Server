Given the high prevalence of syphilis during pregnancy in Zambia and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Preventive Congenital Syphilis Trial (PCS Trial), a cluster randomized trial, was&#x000a0;proposed to increase same-day&#x000a0;screening and treatment of syphilis during&#x000a0;antenatal care visits. To design an accepted and feasible intervention, we conducted a qualitative&#x000a0; formative research.

Nearly 1.5 million pregnant women are infected with syphilis each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and in Africa it was estimated that the prevalence of syphilis among antenatal care (ANC) attendees was 2.2% in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the prevalence of syphilis among ANC attendees was 3.3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] whereas it was 4% in Zambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. It is estimated that half of all pregnant women with untreated syphilis will experience adverse birth outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal death, and neonatal infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">In order to prevent these outcomes, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal syphilis screening, and treatment of pregnant women testing positive, as routine practice during ANC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Administering a single dose of long-acting penicillin prevents congenital syphilis. Either one (primary or secondary disease) or three (latent disease) penicillin doses are effective to treat maternal syphilis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">However, several of key barriers to implementation of universal prevention of congenital syphilis screening have been identified. These barriers range from patient-level factors (e.g., late entry into ANC, costs borne by patients, and the need to return at a later time for results) to facility-level constraints (e.g., health worker absence or insufficient training; provider fears around side effects of benzathine penicillin treatment despite their rarity; and use of a diagnostic procedure that requires infrastructure that facilities may not have consistent access to such as laboratory capacity, cold storage, and electricity) and system-level issues (e.g., low prioritization of syphilis screening and treatment by health policy makers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">In accordance with theories of implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], the intervention proposed by the Preventing Congenital Syphilis Trial (PCS Trial) (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix S1) was developed specifically to target barriers to implementing best practices identified in the literature, including those mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. As such, the intervention consists of the use of point-of-care rapid syphilis diagnostic tests (RDTs) in pregnant women and same-day treatment of those who screen positive with one dose of benzathine penicillin 2.4 MU, plus a behavioral intervention based on theories of health behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Specifically, the behavioral intervention consists of (1) identification and training of opinion leaders among ANC providers and (2) packaging the RDTs and pre-measured dosages of benzathine penicillin, erythromicine, anaphylaxis treatment together into ready-to-use syphilis diagnosis and treatment kits. The opinion leaders will be tasked with disseminating, implementing, and maintaining best practices among their peers using reminders, routine monitoring and feedback (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Appendix S1).</p><p id="Par10">In addition, to ensure that the trial strategy would be effective, culturally appropriate, and acceptable to women and ANC providers, we conducted qualitative formative research to assess women&#x02019;s and providers&#x02019; perspectives. The formative research aimed to identify factors that may hinder (barriers) or enable (facilitators) the syphilis screening at first ANC visit and to provide treatment to positive women at the same visit in order to identify additional, context-specific factors that may influence the implementation of PCS Trial intervention. Based on those findings we analyzed the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed intervention. In this paper, we present the results of the qualitative research and recommendations to tailor the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par11">The study used inductive inquiry consistent with the grounded theory approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and was conducted in accordance with qualitative research guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Several interviewees complained of a <italic>&#x0201c;proliferation of unsustainable private centers,&#x0201d;</italic> given that many private clinics only exist for a short period of time before being shuttered. More generally, these private clinics raise questions about the quality and consistency of care, particularly given that some do not provide all essential components of the ANC package, including PMTCT and syphilis screening, and are not included in government-led quality improvement initiatives.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>National, NGO policies on ANC and syphilis exist, but conflict with proposed intervention</title><p id="Par31">Interview participants noted that the Ministries of Health in both countries have implemented ANC programs based on the World Health Organization&#x02019;s best practice recommendations, and health providers are accustomed to following guidelines or protocols to provide care. In addition, they reported that the national guidelines for ANC in both countries included evidence-based approaches for preventing congenital syphilis. In Zambia, all PCCs providing ANC receive guidelines and protocols directly from the Ministry of Health (MOH). Yet in the DRC, the existence of parallel public and private systems has rendered quality control of ANC care complex. Although national ANC guidelines exist, they are not widely distributed to private sector clinics, making it difficult to ensure those providers are kept up to date about best practices.</p><p id="Par32">Interviewees commented that the same-day screening and treatment regimen of the PCS Trial would be a significant departure from established practice, potentially constituting an important barrier to implementation. Current practice and national recommendation in both countries is to provide treatment for syphilis-positive women in a subsequent visit, to which women are encouraged to bring their husband or partner. Moreover, protocols and guidelines promoted by organizations such as International Centre For Aids Care And Treatment Program (ICAP), Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), and Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF) may conflict with the PCS Trial recommendation to screen and treat at first visit.</p><p id="Par33">That said, providers indicated that they follow protocols for same-day screening and treatment for malaria, worms and anaemia.<disp-quote><p id="Par34">

However, interviewees in Zambia noted that cost is not a barrier to care there since all test, treatment, and procedures are delivered free of cost to the population.</p><p id="Par38">Another functional barrier is the length of the clinic visit:<disp-quote><p id="Par39">

In particular, while some PCCs already used &#x0201c;point-of-care rapid test&#x0201d; (the type test to be provided by the PCS Trial), others did not have access to this test and so used Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR), which does not provide immediate results.<disp-quote><p id="Par45">

Barriers for the successful implementation of same-day screening and treatment for syphilis at first ANC visit exist at system-, facility- provider- and patient-levels. Findings are similar than the reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. System-level barriers include poor geographical and functional accessibility, lack of human resources and supplies, and established norms that need to be changed in order to implement the new practice, as well as the broader economic situation in these countries. Products and supplies are provided by national programs, NGOs, or international initiatives, but they are frequently depleted. The frequent stock-outs may be due to poor managerial capacities of health workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par95">Among ANC providers, we identified barriers such as low awareness regarding the evidence of effectiveness of single-dose benzathine penicillin to prevent congenital syphilis, and reservations towards treating women on the first visit. Lack of training of health providers was identified as a barrier to the screening and treatment of pregnant women during ANC, confirming the findings of other authors, such as Watson et al. in Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par96">From the woman&#x02019;s perspective, we identified barriers such as late enrollment in ANC due to transportation or cost, and lack of knowledge and information about syphilis and its treatment. As highlighted by other researchers, cost of treatment can be a critical barrier for syphilis screening and treatment, especially for those women who are totally financially-dependent on their male partner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Other studies have also reported that long distances to screening facilities and lack of supplies for syphilis screening and treatment are associated with delay or failure to screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par97">Given these barriers, promotion of evidence-based practices around syphilis screening and treatment presents a real challenge. However, facilitators of change exist as well. These include the existence of national guidelines currently used at clinics, which recomend syphilis screening at the first ANC visit. Overall, providers seem to have a positive attitude towards improving current practices. In addition, pregnant women understand the importance of being tested, and accept being tested and treated during the same visit if positive.</p><p id="Par98">Findings confirmed that the evidence-based practice of testing for syphilis at the first ANC visit and treating with benzathine penicillin was acceptable to both providers and patients. Regarding the implementation of the PCS Trial intervention strategy, we found that the components included in the intervention were considered acceptable and feasible for implementation at the PCCs. However, the intervention was tailored to better fit the context based on the findings of this study. Specific modifications were proposed in the light of the findings of this formative research. The most substantial change was the addition of a supportive supervision component that consisted of formal support to the opinion leaders from the local intervention coordinator on a monthly basis. Other changes included use of an HISS questionnaire to select the opinion leaders by peer nomination, design of the opinion leader training, and type of reminders. Finally, the formative research indicated how to best pack the products and supplies to fit local needs.</p><p id="Par99">Each of these changes was made to tailor the intervention to the local context, given that &#x02013; per principles of implementation science &#x02013; interventions must be right-sized for their implementation contexts in order to be effectively operationalized. Most importantly, in this study, the researchers and implementers worked in close collaboration, making joint decisions about the design of the research intervention, so that the final intervention was informed by implementers&#x02019; understanding of what would work in the field.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Study limitations</title><p id="Par100">As with all qualitative research, findings helped researchers discover and explore themes, generate illuminating and illustrative personal narratives, but they may not be generalizable to the larger population of practitioners or pregnant women in these countries. We were aware about the possibility about obtaining social desirability responses (the wish to appear as a morally-worthy person to the interviewer). In order to minimize this bias in sensitive questions, as for example when asking pregnant women about the influence of their sexual partners regarding the acceptance of treatment if they test positive, we used indirect questioning &#x02013; asking about what pregnant women in general feels and how they will behave &#x02013; allowing respondents to project their own feelings onto others.</p><p id="Par101">The study was conducted in urban settings in the capital cities of the countries participating in the study, so the findings may not be relevant for other urban or rural clinics. Findings were based on opinions and self-report rather than observation of actual practices.</p><p id="Par102">Although the sample size in one country was smaller than in the other, findings are consistent across sites and we cover all type of clinics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par103">This formative research allowed us to identify factors that may hinder (barriers) or enable (facilitators) the same-day syphilis screening and treatment, and to identify additional, context-specific factors that may influence the implementation of the PCS Trial intervention. Based on those findings we tailored the intervention in order to be feasible.</p><p id="Par104">Interventions that work well in controlled settings may fail during broader roll-out, in part because the controlled settings do not mimic real-world contexts. It is imperative, then, to design interventions from the start with an eye towards the constraints and assets of the context in which they will be implemented. Thus, formative research &#x02013; research that occurs before an intervention designed and implemented &#x02013; such as that conducted in this study, is a critical step in designing appropriate and effective interventions. In addition, including implementers and other end-users in intervention design is essential to developing interventions that will be both effective and feasible.
