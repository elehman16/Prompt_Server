Lower tidal volume ventilation appears to be beneficial,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> but optimal management of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) remains unclear. Higher levels of PEEP have been shown to be protective in numerous animal experiments but have only shown equivocal benefit in human clinical trials.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Recently, however, an individual patient meta-analysis combining data from these trials suggested that higher PEEP, when added to use of lower tidal volumes, results in an adjusted risk ratio of 0.90 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; p=0.049) in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Thus, incremental improvements offer the potential for additional mortality reduction, and the central question remains how best to optimise PEEP for an individual patient.</p><p>Lung inflation reflects transpulmonary pressure (P<sub>TP</sub>), the difference between pressures at the airway opening and the pleural space (P<sub>TP</sub>=airway pressure&#x02212;pleural pressure). Clinicians routinely manage mechanical ventilation by controlling pressures measured at the airway. This would be a satisfactory strategy if pleural pressure values were predictable or restricted to a narrow range. However, there is evidence that pleural pressure varies widely and unpredictably among patients with ARDS, likely due to factors such as obesity, abdominal fluid accumulation and oedema, which influence the mechanical behaviour of the chest wall and diaphragm.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This wide range of pleural pressure among individuals could significantly affect lung inflation produced by mechanical ventilation. For example, a relatively high level of PEEP of 18&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O could be too low in a patient with a pleural pressure of 20&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O, allowing collapse of some airspaces with each expiration and leading to atelectrauma,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> or too high in a patient with a pleural pressure of 5&#x02005;cm&#x02005;H<sub>2</sub>O, causing haemodynamic compromise, increased dead space ventilation and overdistension of the lungs at end-inflation. It is possible that the inconsistency in the results of clinical trials of PEEP<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> reflects a failure to individualise ventilator settings for pleural pressure in each patient.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>In a single centre, phase I randomised controlled trial, mechanical ventilation directed by esophageal pressure was compared with ventilation using the ARDSNet protocol. In this study, nearly all patients who were managed using the esophageal pressure measurements required adjustment upwards of their set PEEP level to maintain a transpulmonary pressure of greater than zero. The ratio of blood oxygen tension to inspired oxygen fraction (PaO<sub>2</sub>, partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood/FiO<sub>2</sub>, fraction of inspired oxygen; PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub>) at 72&#x02005;h was higher in the intervention (EPVent) group than controls, and respiratory system compliance was significantly improved. This trial showed a trend towards reduced mortality that was maintained at 6&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>To further explore the use of P<sub>TP</sub> values to guide ventilation in patients with ARDS, our group, with the support of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI), has designed the EPVent2 study, a randomised clinical trial that aims to examine the impact of mechanical ventilation directed at maintaining a positive P<sub>TP</sub> in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. This paper describes the study procedures and planned analyses for this clinical trial. The trial is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under number NCT01681225.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Administrative structure</title><p>This study is under the auspices of the NHLBI (Grant Number U01-HL108724).

In the current trial, we limit enrolment to patients with moderate or severe ARDS (P/F of 200 or below). We also have changed the control group protocol to a higher PEEP approach. The duration of our intervention has been extended from 3 to 28&#x02005;days for the EPVent2 trial. Finally, our primary end point for the current trial is a novel composite measure that combines ventilator-free days and mortality at 28&#x02005;days, whereas in the EPVent1 trial with fewer participants we studied the improvement in oxygenation at 72&#x02005;h. <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2014006356TB1">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> summarises the main differences between the two protocols.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2014006356TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Comparison of EPVent1 phase 1 and EPVent2 phase 2 trials</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Factor</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EPVent1</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">EPVent2</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of participants</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">61 actual</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">200 planned</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of centres</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 planned</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group strategy</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARDSNet study (low tidal volume)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">OSCILLATE study control group (high-PEEP)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Funding</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Institutional</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">NIH/NHLBI</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">ARDS severity</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">P/F &#x0003c;300</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">P/F &#x0003c;200</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcomes</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> at 72&#x02005;h</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Composite measure of mortality and ventilator-free days at 28&#x02005;days</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Duration of intervention</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3&#x02005;days</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">28&#x02005;days</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Additional studies</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Biomarker analysis</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Biomarker analysis</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Echocardiography</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">CT</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome; EPVent, Esophageal Pressure-Guided Ventilation; FiO<sub>2</sub>, fraction of inspired oxygen; NHLBI, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute; NIH, National Institutes of Health; PaO<sub>2</sub>, partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Restriction of enrolled patients to moderate-to-severe ARDS</title><p>In this trial we elected to restrict enrolment to patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS with P/F &#x0003c;200. This decision was primarily based on a meta-analysis published by Briel <italic>et al</italic>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> which showed higher levels of PEEP to be associated with increased survival among the subset of patients with what is now defined as moderate-to-severe ARDS (P/F &#x0003c;200). Given that the P<sub>TP</sub>-guided strategy typically leads to ventilation using higher levels of PEEP, we felt limitation to patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS to be both clinically and scientifically appropriate. Additionally, this restriction may enhance the difference between the EPVent group and the control group insofar as sicker patients stand to gain the most from individualised treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Control arm strategy</title><p>In this trial we opted to use a high-PEEP control arm as opposed to the ARDSNet ventilation guidelines used in our pilot study. The rationale for this modification is based on three key points. First, given our enrolment restriction to patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, we did not feel comfortable utilising a low-PEEP strategy for the control arm based on the findings by Briel <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> discussed previously. Additionally, our phase I study had already shown benefit of a P<sub>TP</sub>-guided strategy over a low-PEEP strategy.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Finally, we wanted to ensure that the appropriate comparison was being made between ventilation strategies to determine whether empirically raising PEEP (through a high-PEEP control arm) will result in the same outcomes as those achieved using a P<sub>TP</sub>-guided ventilation strategy. We therefore adopted a high-PEEP algorithm previously used in the OSCILLATE trial for the control group arm.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study population</title><p>Adult patients aged 16&#x02005;years and older, admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with moderate-to-severe ARDS, will be enrolled.

Second, the remaining values were assigned normal values with mean equal to 13.0 and 15.0&#x02005;days in the conventional and EPVent groups, respectively (SD 6.5&#x02005;days in both groups).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="s2h1"><title>Primary analyses</title><p>Primary analyses will use the set of all randomised participants (intention-to-treat (ITT) sample).

In addition, patients who die in the first 24&#x02005;h might be too sick to gain from the presumed benefit of EPVent-based ventilation. Therefore, a second analysis set, per protocol (PP sample) will use participants who (A) survived 24&#x02005;h from randomisation; (B) underwent the assigned intervention (ie, the control or intervention ventilation protocol was initiated and successfully implemented for at least 24&#x02005;h) and (C) have data on day 28 assessment available.

The MCC will prepare summaries of all reports and provide them to the DSMB at least every 6&#x02005;months. The DSMB will convene by teleconferencing or in person at 25%, 50% and 75% of enrolment to review adverse events or earlier if so needed. The NHLBI will be invited to all DSMB meetings and kept apprised of any safety concerns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Ethics approval</title><p>Approvals of the protocol and informed consent forms were obtained from the DSMB and the NHLBI prior to enrolling the first study participant. In addition, approvals of the protocol and informed consent documents were required and obtained from the IRB of each participating institution prior to enrolling study participants at the respective study site. To ensure that each participating institution's informed consent documentation complied with NHLBI requirements and the code of federal regulations (CFRs) Title 21 Part 50 Section 50.25, all informed consent forms were reviewed and approved by the MCC. Official documentation of all IRB approvals and all finalised informed consent forms have been collected and stored by the MCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Considerations for continuation to a phase III clinical trial</title><p>The decision to proceed with a phase III trial is formally outlined as follows:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Initiate phase III study: demonstrated efficacy signal in addition to adequate safety profile.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Criteria: primary end point of the trial achieves statistical significance.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Further development potentially required: weak efficacy signal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Criteria: primary end point did not achieve a priori level of significance but is in the right direction and there was a general consistency of secondary end points, indicating propensity for efficacy and no increased mortality in the treatment arm.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Abandon treatment platform: harm (in efficacy or safety end points).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Criteria: study terminated early per recommendation by DSMB for safety and/or risk/benefit ratio concerns (ie, stop for harm, unacceptable risk profile, etc).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Ancillary study</title><p>At the primary centre, all patients enrolled in the study will be invited to join an ancillary study with CT imaging. This substudy will apply established and accepted CT imaging techniques, as well as serial measurement of non-invasive oscillatory impedance of the lung, to seek insights into the mechanism of clinical benefit of the primary trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present the study protocol and data analysis plans for a phase II, multicentre randomised clinical trial that will assess the impact of mechanical ventilation directed at maintaining a positive P<sub>TP</sub> in patients with ARDS. Specifically, we have hypothesised that adjusting ventilator pressure to achieve positive P<sub>TP</sub> values will lead to improvement in a composite outcome of mortality and time off the ventilator at 28&#x02005;days. Secondarily, this investigation will garner important mechanistic data on P<sub>TP</sub> and its correlation with other surrogate physiological measurements, as well as the potential value of using relevant biomarkers as biochemical surrogate outcome markers for mortality in ARDS. Finally, the results of this study will provide essential information on the scientific merit and feasibility of a larger, phase III trial testing the role of P<sub>TP</sub> to guide ventilation in ARDS.</p><p>This trial builds on our previous phase I study by increasing the number of enrolled patients and by increasing the number of participating centres, thereby making the results of the current study more generalisable to the adult acute care hospital population. This strategy will also allow us to demonstrate feasibility of implementing our esophageal pressure management technique across multiple centres.</p><p>Another notable strength of the current protocol is a more clinically relevant primary end point as compared with our previous study. Studies of patients admitted to the ICU frequently report ventilator-free days as an outcome. Unfortunately, this measure does not distinguish between patients who have died and those who remained on the ventilator for 28&#x02005;days. A more clinically useful outcome measure is one that takes mortality into account when calculating VFD. Therefore, we propose a primary hierarchical end point that incorporates death and VFD at 28&#x02005;days in such a manner that death constitutes a more serious outcome.</p><p>Several important limitations with the planned investigation are worth being noted. The first limitation relates to the learning curve among centres in achieving accurate measurements of esophageal pressure. Several of the centres involved in the study routinely use esophageal pressure measurements in clinical practice and are familiar with the technique. Training is provided for all sites, but is particularly important for those sites less familiar with the techniques of esophageal pressure measurement and interpretation. Training includes both didactic lectures in basic respiratory physiology (needed to interpret the physiological waveforms) and hands-on experience. The MCC developed training materials for this purpose. Recurrent training and technical assistance will be available throughout the study. All waveforms will be reviewed by the PCL as a measure of quality assurance as well as to gauge the effectiveness of our educational tools.</p><p>A second limitation relates to the time frame of intervention. In the proposed study, the experimental intervention will take place until the patient is weaned from controlled mechanical ventilation or 28&#x02005;days, after which the clinicians caring for the patient will dictate care. An extended intervention period carries a higher data collection burden, an increased potential for missing data points and a higher difficulty of protocol adherence. However, choosing an extended intervention period allows for a potentially greater separation in mortality curves. Additionally, in clinical practice, most patients are ventilated for less than 28&#x02005;days. Thus, we anticipate the actual study intervention period to be shorter than 28&#x02005;days.</p><p>A third and final limitation relates to a potential lack of efficacy. The null hypothesis may prove to be correct and there is no benefit to the strategy of maintaining a positive P<sub>TP</sub> during mechanical ventilation. While disappointing, a &#x02018;negative&#x02019; result is an important result. A negative result would be important in informing the community of critical care physicians and suggest a shift of focus to more fruitful therapeutic interventions. A lack of efficacy in the primary outcome may be offset by new findings in the analysis of secondary outcomes, which could guide future research. In addition, the physiological and biochemical data generated during the exploration of mechanistic outcomes should lead to important insights into the reasons behind the negative result and generation of important new knowledge.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This manuscript describes the study protocol and analysis plans for the first phase II randomised clinical trial of the use of P<sub>TP</sub> to guide ventilation in patients with ARDS. This protocol represents important improvements from our phase I study by increasing the number of enrolled patients and participating centres, as well as an improved primary end point. In addition to providing important information on the safety and efficacy of the use of esophageal pressure in managing ventilation in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, the results of this clinical trial will also inform the scientific community regarding the merit and feasibility of a more definitive phase III clinical trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> EF was involved in protocol design, manuscript drafting and revision, and final approval of the submitted version.
