Daptomycin and vancomycin were compared with respect to time to resolution or improvement of symptoms and signs of infection, with no significant differences detected between treatments.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against many gram-positive organisms, including strains of staphylococci and enterococci that are not susceptible to other commonly used antibiotics, such as penicillinase-resistant penicillins, vancomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Daptomycin is rapidly bactericidal, more so than other antibacterial agents in <italic>in vitro</italic> time-kill studies and <italic>in vivo</italic> animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>Unlike vancomycin or &#x003b2;-lactam agents, the bactericidal activity of daptomycin does not result in immediate cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). As bacterial cell lysis may result in the release of pro-inflammatory bacterial components, lack of bacteriolysis may be associated with attenuated host inflammatory responses. In an <italic>in vitro</italic> model, exposure of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> to daptomycin led to an attenuated macrophage inflammatory response compared with vancomycin or oxacillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Similarly, in an animal model of pneumococcal meningitis, daptomycin caused less cerebrospinal fluid inflammation and resulting cortical brain damage than ceftriaxone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>Daptomycin is safe and effective for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). <italic>Post hoc</italic> and subset analyses of data from two phase 3 trials suggest that daptomycin may result in faster clinical improvement and a shorter duration of therapy compared with treatment with penicillinase-resistant penicillins or vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). A subsequent study of patients with cSSSI also found that daptomycin resulted in faster clinical improvement, shorter duration of intravenous (i.v.) antibiotic therapy, shorter antibiotic-associated length of hospital stay and decreased total hospital costs compared with matched controls treated with vancomycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Based on these findings and the unique mechanism of action of daptomycin, an exploratory clinical trial was conducted to evaluate whether the treatment of cellulitis or erysipelas with daptomycin would result in faster resolution of symptoms and signs compared with treatment with vancomycin among hospitalised patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Study DAP-4CELL-05-02 was a prospective, randomised, evaluator-blinded, multi-centre trial designed to explore differences in the speed and degree of symptom and sign resolution between daptomycin- and vancomycin-treated patients with cellulitis or erysipelas. The study was conducted at 15 sites in the United States, South Africa and Serbia, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and guidelines for studies involving human subjects. Local ethics committees or institutional review boards approved the study protocol, and all subjects provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Patient eligibility</title><p>Patients &#x02265; 18 years of age who had a primary diagnosis of cellulitis or erysipelas requiring hospitalisation and i.v. antibiotic therapy were eligible for enrolment. The onset of symptoms and signs must have occurred within 3 days of the first dose of study medication, and a temperature &#x0003e; 37.5 &#x000b0;C orally or &#x0003e; 38.0 &#x000b0;C rectally had to be recorded within 48 h before enrolment. The infection had to be at an anatomical location that allowed for clear assessment of the erythema margin.</p><p>Patients were excluded from the study if they required emergent surgical intervention, if surgery constituted curative treatment, or if the cellulitis was associated with a wound or ulcer that required incision, drainage or debridement. Other excluding conditions included perirectal abscess; hidradenitis suppurativa; third-degree burn infections; buccal, facial, periorbital or perianal cellulitis; known or suspected osteomyelitis or bacteremia; absolute neutrophil count &#x02264; 500 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>; creatinine clearance &#x0003c; 30 ml/min; rhabdomyolysis; or known allergy or intolerance to study medications. Patients were also excluded if they required systemic corticosteroids or antibiotics other than the study drugs or if they had received systemic antimicrobial therapy for &#x0003e; 24 h during the 72 h before the first dose of study drug, unless they had been on the antimicrobial for &#x02265; 72 h without clinical improvement. Pregnant or lactating women were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Patients were randomised to receive daptomycin or vancomycin for 7&#x02013;14 days. Randomisation was stratified by the presence or absence of four complicating factors [diabetes mellitus, age &#x02265; 65 years, peripheral vascular disease (PVD), or an immunocompromising condition such as HIV]. Daptomycin was administered at 4 mg/kg i.v. once daily, and vancomycin was administered i.v. according to standard of care. At the discretion of the investigator, aztreonam and metronidazole could have been added for confirmed or probable infections with gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens, respectively. Administration of anti-inflammatory or antipyretic agents, excluding systemic corticosteroids, was permitted.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical assessments</title><p>The following efficacy end-points were assessed: (i) time to stabilisation of cellulitis (when the erythema margin stopped advancing, temperature normalised and patient was ready for discharge); (ii) time to cessation of erythema margin advancement; (iii) Time to defervescence (temperature &#x02264; 37.2 &#x000b0;C); (iv) time to readiness for hospital discharge (if the patient remained hospitalised for reasons unrelated to the cellulitis, the patient was considered ready for discharge); (v) investigator assessment of symptoms and signs (based on a composite score of three symptoms &#x02013; tenderness, chills and warmth &#x02013; and the presence of one of the following signs &#x02013; lymphangitis, regional lymphadenopathy or lymphedema; the maximum possible score was 13 points); (vi) patient-reported cellulitis-related pain (assessed on an analogue scale) and (vii) patient-reported swelling/tightness (assessed on an analogue scale). Erythema margin size, as well as symptoms and signs, were assessed by an evaluator who was unaware of the study drug assignment. Patients were also evaluated for adverse events. Baseline assessments were conducted within 3 days before the start of treatment. Evaluations were conducted three times per day, while patients were receiving study medication and then 7&#x02013;14 days after the last dose of study drug. Clinical success was defined as a patient cured or improved.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All patients who received at least one dose of study medication were included in the analyses. Data from patients who discontinued from the study prematurely were censored as of the last available evaluation. A physician blinded to study drug assignment reviewed concomitant medications and procedures received by each patient; if these were believed to have influenced the clinical outcome, the outcome was censored from the date of the procedure or medication administration.</p><p>This was a non-powered exploratory study. Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves were generated for describing the distribution of time to each end-point. Log-rank tests were used to compare the curves. For success rates, 95% confidence intervals for the differences in rates were calculated between the daptomycin and vancomycin arms, using normal approximations to the binomial distribution.</p></sec><sec><title>Supporting data</title><p>A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was also conducted using pooled data from two previously reported phase 3 cSSSI trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). These were randomised, evaluator-blinded trials that compared the efficacy and safety of daptomycin with that of conventional therapy (penicillinase-resistant penicillins or vancomycin). In these trials, infections were classified into five categories: wound infection, major abscess, infected diabetic ulcer, infected non-diabetic ulcer and other infection. From the other infection category, cases of cellulitis were identified based on the description provided by the study investigator. Clinical and microbiological success rates were calculated, with clinical success defined as clinical cure or improvement, and microbiological success defined as pathogen eradication or presumed eradication based on cultures of the infected site and blood.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 103 patients were randomised in the cellulitis/erysipelas study. One patient in each group did not receive study drug; thus, the evaluation population included 101 patients, 50 treated with daptomycin and 51 with vancomycin. An additional 50 cellulitis patients were identified from the previous phase 3 cSSSI trials, 28 treated with daptomycin and 22 with comparator.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> summarises the demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients. In the cellulitis/erysipelas study, 68.3% of patients had at least one of the four complicating factors. In the two cSSSI studies, 56.0% of patients had at least one of these four complicating factors. However, all patients in the cSSSI studies had complicated infections, defined as the presence of these or other complicating factors or based upon the severity and extent of the infection. In contrast, not all patients in the cellulitis study had complicated infections, although all were hospitalised. Daptomycin-treated patients in both the cellulitis and cSSSI studies tended to have a higher incidence of diabetes and PVD, and a greater number were &#x02265; 65 years old.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic and baseline patient characteristics in the cellulitis/erysipelas and cellulitis subset of the cSSSI studies</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Cellulitis/erysipelas study<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">cSSSI studies (cellulitis subset)<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Daptomycin (<italic>n</italic>=50), <italic>n</italic> (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vancomycin (<italic>n</italic>=51), <italic>n</italic> (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Daptomycin (<italic>n</italic>=28), <italic>n</italic> (%)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Comparator (<italic>n</italic>=22), <italic>n</italic> (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Gender</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33 (66.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (51.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (42.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (50.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17 (34.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25 (49.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (57.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (50.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, median years (range)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57 (22&#x02013;79)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55 (21&#x02013;86)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">54 (25&#x02013;79)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48 (18&#x02013;86)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Race</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">White</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40 (80.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36 (70.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14 (50.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (36.4)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Black</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (14.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12 (23.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (14.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (40.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (6.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (5.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (35.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (22.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass index, median kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32 (20&#x02013;82)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31 (18&#x02013;55)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 (18&#x02013;62)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-1">*</xref></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26 (18&#x02013;51)<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-2">&#x02020;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Site of infection</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Leg</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40 (80.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38 (74.5)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23 (82.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18 (81.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Arm</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (10.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (7.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (10.7)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (9.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Other</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (10.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (17.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (7.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (9.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Presence of specific complicating factors<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tf1-3">&#x02021;</xref></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Diabetes</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (30.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (21.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8 (28.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (22.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age &#x02265;

Hospitalisations in the USA because of <italic>S. aureus</italic>-related infections, including cellulitis, as well as the proportion of these infections caused by methicillin-resistant strains have increased dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). In addition, one study has found that community-associated methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA) was the most common organism isolated from patients with purulent skin and skin structure infections presenting to emergency departments in the USA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The increasing incidence of infections caused by MRSA has significant implications for treatment. Inadequate therapy for MRSA has been shown to be common in community hospitals and has been associated with increased mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>However, MRSA susceptibility to vancomycin is decreasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), and infections caused by vancomycin-susceptible MRSA strains with MIC values &#x02265; 1 &#x003bc;g/ml appear to respond less well to vancomycin therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>), even after controlling for patient variables and comorbidities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In addition, clinical cases of antibiotic-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> have been reported for newer drugs such as linezolid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), and one study suggests linezolid MIC values are increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Although there have been reports of resistance to daptomycin, recent surveillance studies in Europe and North America have demonstrated &#x02265; 99.9% susceptibility among 20,047 isolates of <italic>S. aureus</italic> as well as no increases in MIC values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>In the prospective cellulitis/erysipelas trial presented here, the clinical success rate for daptomycin was 94.0% vs. 90.2% for vancomycin. Among patients with cellulitis in the two phase 3 cSSSI studies, the rates were 78.6% and 72.7% for daptomycin- and comparator-treated patients, respectively. Although success rates were lower in the two cSSSI studies, this is most likely because of the entry criteria for the cSSSI studies, which selected for complicated infections. In both the cellulitis/erysipelas study and the cSSSI studies, the efficacy of daptomycin was similar to and actually slightly better than that of the comparators, although the differences were not statistically significant. This is despite daptomycin-treated patients in the cellulitis/erysipelas study having slightly more complicating underlying diseases.</p><p>For patients with cellulitis in the cSSSI studies, daptomycin achieved good eradication rates against both <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pyogenes</italic>. The microbiological success rate was higher for daptomycin-treated patients than for those treated with the comparator agents, although the difference was not statistically significant. The observed clinical and microbiological efficacies support the recommendation that daptomycin is an appropriate option for severe skin infections, such as cellulitis, that require hospitalisation or do not respond to other treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>As the rapid bactericidal activity of daptomycin does not result in immediate cell lysis and because earlier clinical data suggested that daptomycin may result in faster resolution of complicated skin infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), it was anticipated that daptomycin might result in faster resolution of symptoms and signs than vancomycin. However, this study was unable to detect a difference in the time to resolution of various cellulitis-associated symptoms and signs or readiness for hospital discharge. It is possible that the cellulitis/erysipelas trial was inadequately powered to detect differences in the speed of symptom resolution. Alternatively, the methods used to evaluate the end-points may have been too insensitive to detect differences between treatments.</p><p>Daptomycin was well tolerated. The incidence and distribution of adverse events were similar between daptomycin- and comparator-treated patients. Headache and nausea were the most common adverse events among daptomycin-treated patients. This safety profile for daptomycin is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). In conclusion, daptomycin 4 mg/kg once daily is effective and safe for treating cellulitis or erysipelas.</p></sec><sec><title>Participating investigators and institutions for DAP-4CELL-05-02</title><sec><title>Serbia</title><p>B.
