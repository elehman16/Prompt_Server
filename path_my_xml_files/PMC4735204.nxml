Non-adherence to medication and relapse may lead to poorer patient function. This randomised controlled study, under the acronym LEAN (Lay health supporter, e-platform, award, and iNtegration), is designed to improve medication adherence and high relapse among people with schizophrenia in resource poor settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/analysis</title><p>The community-based LEAN has four parts: (1) <underline>L</underline>ay health supporters (LHSs), mostly family members who will help supervise patient medication, monitor relapse and side effects, and facilitate access to care, (2) an <bold><underline>E</underline></bold>-platform to support two-way mobile text and voice messaging to remind patients to take medication; and alert LHSs when patients are non-adherent, (3) an <bold><underline>A</underline></bold>ward system to motivate patients and strengthen LHS support, and (4) iNtegration of the efforts of patients and LHSs with those of village doctors, township mental health administrators and psychiatrists via the e-platform. A random sample of 258 villagers with schizophrenia will be drawn from the schizophrenic &#x02018;686&#x02019; Program registry for the 9 Xiang dialect towns of the Liuyang municipality in China. The sample will be further randomised into a control group and a treatment group of equal sizes, and each group will be followed for 6&#x02005;months after launch of the intervention. The primary outcome will be medication adherence as measured by pill counts and supplemented by pharmacy records. Other outcomes include symptoms and level of function. Outcomes will be assessed primarily when patients present for medication refill visits scheduled every 2&#x02005;months over the 6-month follow-up period. Data from the study will be analysed using analysis of covariance for the programme effect and an intent-to-treat approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>University of Washington: 49464 G; Central South University: CTXY-150002-6.

Liuyang has developed a three-tier &#x02018;686&#x02019; model extending from Liuyang Mental Health Hospital (MHH) to township health centres to village clinics that consist of five components: (1) patient screening by village doctors (VDs) and mental health administrators (MHAs); (2) MHAs registering the confirmed cases to the &#x0201c;686&#x0201d; programme; (3) Psychiatrists touring townships to provide free consultation and medication every 2&#x02005;months (&#x02018;bi-monthly visits&#x02019;); (4) case management by MHA; and (5) regular monitoring by VDs<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010120F1">figure 1</xref>).

Failure to send a confirmation will trigger up to two text alerts to the patient's LHS, prompting the LHS to check in with the patient and text back the result. The e-monitor assists LHSs and patients in detecting signs of relapse and monitoring medication side effects using relevant checklists texted to the patient and LHS at regular intervals (see relapse checklist in the online supplementary appendix). Finally, the e-educator will send periodic SMS messages to the patient, LHS, MHA and VD to educate them on schizophrenia symptoms, medication, adherence strategies, relapse, rehabilitation and social resources.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Award system</title><p>Patients and LHSs will accumulate points for responding to SMS messages.

With this integration, non-adherence and relapses detected can then be actually handled with LHSs, VDs, MHAs and psychiatrists taking concerted effort for prompt treatment adjustments or referrals for emergent hospitalisation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Mechanism of LEAN</title><p>The mechanism of LEAN medication adherence is based on an adapted health belief model (HBM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010120F3">figure 3</xref>).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> According to this theory, people with schizophrenia make their medication adherence decisions based on push (patients&#x02019; self-motivation in improving health) and pull factors that include three elements: (1) patients&#x02019; perception of the threat posed by schizophrenia; (2) patients&#x02019; perceived net benefit of adhering to therapy, a calculation involving the benefits of therapy minus costs; and (3) action cues such as the aforementioned e-reminders or mass media health promotion campaigns. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010120F3">Figure&#x000a0;3</xref> illustrates the interface of various LEAN elements with the components of the HBM.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010120F3" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3</label><caption><p>Mechanism for lean medication adherence.

Much of the literature in HRH suggests that &#x02018;task shifting&#x02019;&#x02014;cascading appropriate tasks from more skilled psychiatrists to less specialised MHAs/VDs and to LHSs&#x02014;improves access and efficacy when HRH are lacking or deficient<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>

To that end, a statistician otherwise not associated with the project will first create a recruitment list of 400 people drawn at random from the sampling frame. Assuming that 15% of those selected will prove ineligible and that a further 20% will elect not to participate, an initial list of 400 should ensure a final recruitment of no less than 258 participants. MHAs will provide an initial screening by cross-checking the recruitment list against their own records in order to verify eligibility. Recruitment by project staff will occur during patients&#x02019; bimonthly medication refill visits, when psychiatrists will reconfirm the diagnoses of those on the list. Project staff will conduct home visits within 1&#x02005;month of their expected bimonthly visit to recruit those not contacted at the refill visits. At the end of the recruitment, the LEAN sample will be randomly divided by the same statistician into a treatment group and a control group of equal sizes by a statistician not otherwise involved in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010120F5">figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010120F5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>the lean population, sample and assignment.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010120f05"/></fig></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Though the distribution of our primary outcome (adherence, scored as the percentage of drugs taken of those prescribed) is unlikely to be normally distributed, the sample calculation follows standard procedures for the hypothesis of equal population means based on t test and the comparison of sample means. Since our sample size is large, the central limit theorem ensures that our sample means will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the underlying distribution of the data.</p><p>Assuming a 5% type I error and a 10% dropout ratio for a total sample size of 258 (129 for each of the two comparison groups), the study of 232 participants (after 10% dropping out of 258) will have 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.13 (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010120/-/DC1">supplementary material</ext-link> appendices). This means that if the adherence score for the control group is 0.72 (SD=0.33), the study will have sufficient power to detect a programme effect if adherence for the treatment group is equal to or greater than 0.85.

Given the ratio of non-adherence to full adherence (0.55:0.45) of the population reported in the registry, the study will include at least 140 baseline non-adherent participants available for the subgroup analysis. Again, assuming 5% type I error and a 10% dropout rate, the study will have 85% power to detect an effect size of 0.18 among the subgroup: if the adherence rate for the control is 0.42 (SD=0.35), the study will be powered to detect a programme effect if the adherence of the treatment group is equal to or greater than 0.6 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010120TB2">table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015010120TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>sample size calculation scenarios</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="(" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Adherence score<hr/></th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Sample size needed*<hr/></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treat</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Treat</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">LEAN Sample</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.72 (0.33)&#x02020;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.85 (0.33)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">129</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">129</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">258&#x02021;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-adherent subgroup&#x000a7;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.42 (0.35)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.60 (0.35)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">70</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">70</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">140</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>*Sample calculation assuming power of 0.85, significance level of 0.05 and a 10% dropout rate.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02020;SD in parentheses.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x02021;See the STATA codes for the sample calculation in the online supplementary appendix.</p></fn><fn><p>&#x000a7;Sample size of the baseline non-adherent subgroup achieved with a LEAN total sample of 258.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Metrics and measurement</title><sec id="s6a"><title>Primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>The primary outcome will be a continuous medication adherence score from 0 (no adherence) to 1 (complete adherence), calculated as the percentage of drugs taken out of those prescribed over a designated time period (the preceding month).

The wait-list control design is increasingly used in psychotherapy studies, primarily to address the ethical dilemma involved in withholding a potentially beneficial treatment from the control group. Participants recruited into the study are randomised into a treatment group and a &#x02018;wait-listed&#x02019; control group. In stage 1 (the 6-month period following programme initiation), the intervention will be applied to the intervention group only, while the wait-list group will receive usual care per the regular &#x02018;686&#x02019; protocol; in stage 2 (a subsequent 6-month period), the wait-list group will receive the intervention, having &#x02018;waited&#x02019; through stage one. Analysis of the intervention will be conducted on the basis of the baseline and end point data collected on both groups during stage one only due to our budget constraints on data collection. Consequently, the only difference between a wait-list design and a traditional two-arm randomised control trial (RCT) is that the control group is also able to benefit from the treatment once the formal study is complete.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Model and analysis</title><sec id="s8a"><title>Unadjusted analysis, analysis of covariance and difference-in-difference</title><p>We mainly considered the issue of efficiency (precision of the estimator) and bias in our choice of analytical methods.

Critically, the large sample size and the central limit theorem ensure that this approach will yield valid inferences of the risk difference despite non-normal adherence outcomes.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010120F7" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;7</label><caption><p>Three approaches to RCT analysis. <italic>Source</italic>: adapted from Siyuan Zhang's paper.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> ANCOVA, analysis of covariance; DiD, difference-in-difference; RCT, randomised controlled trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010120f07"/></fig></sec><sec id="s8b"><title>Intent-to-treat</title><p>An intent-to-treat (IIT) analysis will be used to analyse all participants regardless of the treatment actually received.

First, the application of mHealth is designed not as a standalone technological solution but as a health system strengthening tool that serves to integrate the patient care provided by lay health supporters (LHS), VDs, MHAs and psychiatrists.</p><p>Second, the active engagement of LHS augments case supervision. Third, the study, evaluating the real-world effectiveness of LEAN, emphasises the implementation parts so as to increase the likelihood of adopting the potentially effective solution. Fourth, the trial is intent on having global implications, especially insofar as the intervention is designed to exclude elements peculiar to China's socioeconomic and/or political situation.</p><p>The study is faced with several limitations. First, its short duration may not allow sufficient assessment of functional changes and limit analysis of the long-term effect on adherence. Second, our choice of relatively simple assessment tools (pill counts vs urinalysis) may create challenges of obtaining accurate adherence levels. Third, assuming that improved medication adherence will lead to better patient life functioning may be problematic. There is concern that psychiatrists with limited training from Liuyang MHH may deliver inappropriate treatments, adherence to which will be of insufficient benefit. Finally, despite efforts to ensure the generalisability of LEAN, the existing &#x02018;686&#x02019; infrastructure (particularly the availability of free basic antipsychotics and the bimonthly physiatrists&#x02019; visit) may make Liuyang a unique location even within China. We hope that the spirit of LEAN will provide useful information for other LMCs. For instance, LEAN may be adapted to manage patients discharged from mental facilities who continue to take free or paid medications.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank our team members for their critical contribution to the implementation of this project including our project managers Juan Nie at SYSU and Yunfang Wang at CSU, who contributed critically to the IRB reviews.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors contributed to the conceptualisation and the design of the study.
