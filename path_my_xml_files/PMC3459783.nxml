Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has been demonstrated to improve the outcome in stage III colon cancer and is internationally accepted as standard treatment. On the other hand, no consensus has been reached on the usefulness of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer.</p><p>A meta-analysis using the studies C-01 to C-04 of the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast &#x00026; Bowel Project (NSABP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] showed that adjuvant chemotherapy significantly decreased the risk of recurrence/death in both Dukes&#x02019; B and C. However, other pooled analysis or large population database review revealed no statistically significant additive survival benefit of adjuvant therapy including 5-FU&#x02009;+&#x02009;leucovorin exclusively in stage II colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>In Japan, Sakamoto et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] reported the results of the meta-analysis that adjuvant therapy with oral 5-FU drugs (without concomitant use of leucovorin) contributed to significant improvement in recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) in stage II colon cancer. UFT (Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is one of the most widely used oral 5-FU agent as adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer in Japan. UFT is a combination drug of tegafur and uracil at a molar ratio of 1:4 and is characterized by long maintenance of a high 5-FU concentration level converted from tegafur in blood/tumors due to inhibition of degeneration of 5-FU by uracil. In the randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing 2-year adjuvant therapy using UFT (400&#x02009;mg/body) with observation without adjuvant therapy in 289 patients after surgery for stage II/III colon and rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the 5-year RFS was significantly better in the UFT group. However, the analysis exclusively for colon cancer (160 patients) revealed no significant difference (77.4% in the UFT group, 74.0% in the observation group, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.71). In the RCT comparing 1-year adjuvant therapy using UFT (400&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day) with observation without adjuvant therapy in 610 patients after surgery for stage III colon and rectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], 1-year treatment with UFT was well tolerated and significantly improved the RFS and OS in rectal cancer, while the analysis for 332 patients with colon cancer showed no significant difference in both the 5-year RFS (71.3% in the UFT group, 69.6% in the observation group, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.56) and OS.</p><p>Although both of the abovementioned two RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] failed to demonstrate an additive effect, 1- or 2-year postoperative adjuvant therapy with UFT alone has often been used for stage II colon cancer in clinical practice in Japan, because of its good feasibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and low-cost. The Japanese Study Group for Postoperative Follow-up of Colorectal Cancer reported that the 5-year survival rate of 1,262 patients with stage II colon cancer who underwent surgery between 1977 and 2000 was 82.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Given such a good outcome, it is necessary to clarify in a larger population whether postoperative adjuvant treatment with UFT alone has an additive effect on stage II colon cancer compared with observation only.</p><p>On the other hand, the reports using a large-scale database disclosed that stage II colon cancer included subpopulations with different prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The major Western guidelines recommended to select the &#x0201c;high-risk group of recurrence&#x0201d; in stage II colon cancer and to give postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN guidelines of 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] lists T4 lesions, number of lymph-nodes examined &#x0003c;12, perforation, lymphovascular involvement, poorly differentiated histopathology, and perineural invasion as high-risk factors, while the ASCO guidelines of 2004 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] lists inadequately sampled nodes, T4 lesions, perforation, and poorly differentiated histology as factors for considering for adjuvant chemotherapy in stage II colon cancer. In addition to these, high CEA is listed as high-risk factor in the ESMO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Recently, the biomarker studies have proposed new risk factors for recurrence/prognosis.</p><p>It seems appropriate to use adjuvant chemotherapy for a subgroup with poor prognosis in stage II colon cancer. However, the definition of &#x0201c;high-risk stage II&#x0201d; is not clear yet, and the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for those patients has not been demonstrated. We therefore conducted the SACURA trial (Surgical Adjuvant Chemotherapy with UFT for Curatively Resected Stage II Colon Cancer), a multicenter phase III RCT to verify the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for curatively resected stage II colon cancer in a large population through evaluating the superiority of 1-year adjuvant treatment with UFT to observation without any adjuvant treatment, and to identify &#x0201c;high-risk factors of recurrence&#x0201d; in stage II colon cancer and predictors of efficacy and adverse events (AEs) of the chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>The design of study</title><p>This study is a multicenter randomized phase III trial, in which patients with curatively resected stage II colon cancer are randomly assigned to either the observation group or UFT adjuvant therapy group (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The primary endpoint is disease-free survival (DFS), and the secondary endpoints are OS, RFS, and incidence and severity of AEs. Superiority of adjuvant therapy with UFT compared to observation without any adjuvant therapy is evaluated.

With an expected 5-year DFS rate of 85% (hazard ratio: 0.729) in the study treatment group (UFT adjuvant therapy group), a two-sided significance level of 5%, and a power of 90%, the necessary sample size was calculated to be 970 patients per group according to the method described by Shoenfeld et al.

No definite conclusion has been reached on this clinically important issue, probably for the following reasons: 1) large number of patients would be required to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II colon cancer because of good surgical outcome; and 2) no high-quality RCT for stage II colon cancer alone has been conducted.</p><p>The SACURA trial is a RCT in patients with curatively resected stage II colon cancer, evaluating whether 1-year adjuvant treatment with UFT improves the DFS and OS compared with observation without adjuvant treatment (superiority study). Between October 2006 and July 2010, a total of 2,024 patients were enrolled from the 270 institutes. In Japan, complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation (D3 dissection) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] is the standard surgery for colon cancer. The institutions which met the conditions that the member of the JSCCR, more than 80 colorectal cancer surgery each year and D3 dissection as routine surgery were selected for the study to insure the quality of the study.</p><p>In the present study, the observation group is used to investigate the clinicopathological high-risk factors for recurrence, and the UFT adjuvant therapy group is used to evaluate the effect of adjuvant therapy on the patients with those &#x0201c;high-risk factors&#x0201d;. These assessments will provide useful information to determine the indication of adjuvant therapy for patients with stage II colon cancer.</p><p>New reliable risk factors of recurrence other than routine items in histopathological examination are expected. The present study evaluates the following histopathological markers as promising prognostic factors for stage II colorectal cancer: tumor budding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], extent of the poorly differentiated component [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], Crohn&#x02019;s-like lymphoid reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and fibrotic cancer stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This is the first study to evaluate those new possible prognostic histopathological markers prospectively using a large sample size.</p><p>In recent years, risk classification for recurrence/prognosis and prediction of efficacy to chemotherapy based on the biomolecular profiles are intensively studied. The meta-analysis reported that MSI-high stage II colorectal cancer was characterized by a lower recurrence rate and better prognosis, compared with MSI-low and microsatellite-stable stage II colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the other hand, the pooled analysis disclosed that adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU drugs for MSI-high colorectal cancer resulted in poorer OS than those of patients without the chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], indicating that MSI may be interesting as a predictor of efficacy to 5-FU based chemotherapy. Deletion or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q) is considered as an indicator of chromosomal instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], which can be related to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In the PETACC-3 molecular study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], both the univariate and multivariate analyses in 420 patients without adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery for stage II colon cancer revealed that 18qLOH was a significant factor for poor prognosis and that MSI-high was a significant factor for good prognosis. In the present study, MSI and 18qLOH are evaluated in more patients collected prospectively than those in the PETACC-3 study.</p><p>The efficacy and AEs of 5-FU drugs may be related to 5-FU-related enzymes in blood or tumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In Japan, several oral 5-FU drugs with differing mechanisms of action have been frequently used, but few prospective studies with a large sample size about this issue have been conducted. In the present study, the tumor mRNA expression levels of enzymes related to nucleic acid metabolism, folic acid metabolism, and tumor progression are measured to evaluate the correlation with the prognosis and AEs to identify predictors of efficacy and safety. In the future, it is expected that oral 5-FU drugs can be used in personalized ways based on differences in the appearance of these enzymes.</p><p>In conclusion, the SACURA trial is a large, multicenter phase III RCT intended to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant therapy in patients with stage II colon cancer by showing the superiority of 1-year adjuvant treatment with UFT to observation without any adjuvant treatment. The results will identify 1) &#x0201c;high-risk stage II&#x0201d; colon cancer, 2) predictors of efficacy and AEs of adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-FU drugs and 3) subgroup benefited from adjuvant chemotherapy, and will contribute to establish an improved therapeutic strategy for stage II colon cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AEs, Adverse events; MSI, Microsatellite instability; OS, Overall survival; RCTs, Randomized controlled trials; RFS, Recurrence-free survival; DFS, Disease-free survival; AST, Aspartate aminotransferase; ALT, Alanine aminotransferase; JSCCR, Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum; LOH, Loss of heterozygosity.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interest</title><p>SACURA trial (BRI_CC0501, BRI_CC0502) was conducted by &#x0201c;Foundation for Biomedical Research and Innovation, Translational Research Informatics Center&#x0201d; with funding from Taiho Pharmaceutical Co.
