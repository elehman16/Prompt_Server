The allergological study demonstrated positive skin prick tests (SPT) to nuts, legumes, cereals, spices, several fresh fruits including peach, and other groups of vegetable foods however, it was negative to common aeroallergens. Serum specific IgE levels were negative (&#x0003c;0.35 kU/L) to profilin and carbohydrate determinants, but positive to Pru p 3 (3.5 kU/L). Positive double-blind placebo-controlled food challenge to peach confirmed the allergic disease. She received specific sublingual immunotherapy with native Pru p 3 at a concentration of 40 &#x003bc;g/ml with 5 administrations per week and a cumulative dose of 200 &#x003bc;g of nPru p 3 per month. After an ultra-rush build-up phase concluded in one day she continued therapy during a year with 5 administrations per week. The clinical evolution and laboratory studies demonstrated an early reduction on SPT reactions with no relevant changes on serum specific IgE, IgG, IgG<sub>1</sub> and IgG<sub>4</sub> to Pru p 3 during the immunotherapy period. The challenge test was negative 4 months after the beginning of the SLIT.

In adult population the prevalence of food allergy varies among geographical areas, possibly in relation to local dietary habits and pollen exposures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-002">2</xref>]. In Mediterranean region and Southern Europe fruits from Rosaceae family, including apple, peach and pear are frequently linked to clinical allergic reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-003">3</xref>]. In addition to the specific allergens identified from each food other proteins are able to induce sensitization and specific IgE response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-002">2</xref>].</p><p>Lipid transfer proteins (LTP) form a broad and widespread group of proteins, particularly of plant origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-004">4</xref>]. They represent a class of ubiquitous allergens specific for foods such as fresh fruits and cereals, and responsible for allergy reactions favours because of its stable and resistant structure to harsh physicochemical conditions with several well-conserved domains which may condition a high degree of cross-reactivity among botanically unrelated foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-004">4</xref>]. In addition to these proteins commonly involved in food allergy, profilins from pollens and plant foods as well as carbohydrate determinants (CCDs) can induce IgE cross-reactive responses in pollen-allergic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-006">6</xref>].</p><p>In spite of the enormous advances in the knowledge of IgE food allergy the treatment is still based on the avoidance of the offending food. In fact there is not an effective treatment yet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-007">7</xref>]. However, in cases of the most common food allergens avoidance is difficult to accomplish, and severe reactions from accidental exposures occur too often [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-008">8</xref>]. The first attempts of specific immunotherapy were performed with peanut extract by subcutaneous route, but with a high ratio of adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-009">9</xref>]. Oral and sublingual desensitization strategies were more recently tried for milk, egg, peanut and hazelnut allergies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-008">8</xref>]. Despite the encouraging results, these therapies were attempted in patients allergic to a specific group of food allergens. However many patients suffering from food allergy are sensitised to panallergens which cross-react within an extensive group of different foods.</p><p>Polysensitization to a wide range of food allergens is common in some patients, particularly in those reacting to vegetables. Avoidance is extremely difficult and can induce severe dietary restrictions with consequent metabolic imbalance. These patients usually have a higher risk of increasing severity of symptoms and, potentially enhance the range of vegetable food sensitizations.</p></sec><sec id="s02"><title>Case presentation</title><p>During pregnancy a 36-year-old portuguese caucasian female patient started recurrent crisis of urticaria/angioedema, and three months after the delivery she underwent an allergological study. She referred a wide range of symptoms 15-20 minutes after ingestion of the majority of vegetable foods: oral allergy syndrome (OAS), urticaria/angioedemea, skin flush or rhinoconjuntivitis requiring high doses of systemic H1 antihistamines, so a severe dietary restriction was established. The allergological evaluation including commercial skin prick tests (SPT, Bial/Aristegui-Spain), prick-prick with fresh foods, and serum specific IgE (Phadia-Sweden) demonstrated a polysensitization to almost all vegetables food (fresh fruits, nuts, legumes, cereals, spices in others). Interestingly, the intensity of SPT reactivity and the serum specific IgE levels showed changes along the time of each 6 months clinical evaluation. They increased or decreased according to the specific food intake. The strictly restriction of a group of foods resulted on a decrease of sensitization to them however a progressive increasing sensitization was observed to those other vegetables foods better tolerated on the moment of setting up the diet and as a consequences not withdrawn from it. This oscillating clinical profile during a period of 4 years was implicated on metabolic disorder (hypertension, hypoalbumin and hypercholesterol serum levels). At the age of 40 years old she was submitted to a study that results on a specific treatment.</p><sec id="s02_01"><label>1</label><title>Allergological study</title><p>Skin prick tests confirmed the sensitization to a wide range of vegetable foods and no sensitization to most common aeroallergens. Total IgE was 70 UI/mL, and serum specific IgE levels confirmed the SPT reactivity.

We stress that the clinical symptoms improved steadily after the first month of SLIT, and by the 3rd month she had no major vegetables dietary restrictions, except for nuts, fruits and pepper. The antihistamines consumption markedly reduced. She was advised to avoid any nuts and pepper. Nevertheless when accidental intake occurred she only reported slight SAO symptoms, the majority with no need for medication.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s03" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This case report describes a patient with clinical sensitization to a wide range of vegetables food with tremendous consequences on the diet and metabolic imbalance, and not efficiently controlled with high doses of antihistamines.</p><p>The severity of the allergic symptomatology increases since the first symptoms appeared so our goal was to develop a specific immunotherapy for this case. Specific immunotherapy to foods have been tried using protein extracts obtained from the culprit raw sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-007">7</xref>]. We decided to design an immunotherapy treatment with the purified cross reactive allergen present in all the allergenic vegetables food.</p><p>SPT reactivity to various concentrations of nPru p 3 was carried out to look for the suitable immunotherapy allergen concentration. 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of nPru p 3 was the allergen concentration needed to induce a mean wheal similar in size to the one induced by histamine at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml. Taking this results into account and the manufacturer previous experience, a concentration of 40 &#x003bc;g/ml of Pru p 3 was chosen as the immunotherapy concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-014">14</xref>]. This is a high dose of SLIT as the monthly cumulative maintenance dose is 5 ml at 40 &#x003bc;g/m (200 &#x003bc;g), compared to the conventional subcutaneous immunotherapy (SIT) in which the monthly dose is 1 ml at 10 &#x003bc;g/ml (10 &#x003bc;g) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-015">15</xref>]. So it implies a cumulative dose 20 times higher for SLIT than to SIT.</p><p>The use of an ultra-rush schedule probably reduced the risk of side effects and explains the excellent tolerance both in the build-up and maintenance phases. The minor local symptoms occurring on the first 3 doses were not so serious to require administration of relive medication or the interruption of the treatment.</p><p>This clinical case confirmed that this treatment is safe, at least at a concentration that we used, was well tolerated and extremely effective on clinical symptoms. A tolerance to the intake of the majority of vegetable food sources was reached, the DBPCFC were promptly negative, and an improvement of the metabolic imbalance was obtained. At the moment, only nuts and particularly pepper induce SAO symptoms. It is still unknown if pepper has large amounts of LTP, besides the ability to induce specific IgE mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib-001">1</xref>]. The decreasing SPT results to Pru p 3 are in agreement with the clinical response. However the specific IgE and IgG levels did not show significant differences as expected. The patient is still under treatment and we believe that more pronounced immunological changes will be observed in future.</p></sec><sec id="s04"><title>Patient&#x02019;s perspective</title><p>I real fell well with this treatment and my life really improved, because I have no limitations on my diet and my health markedly improved since doctors started this knew treatment for my allergic disease.</p></sec></body><back><notes><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from the patient for publication of this case report and accompanying images.
