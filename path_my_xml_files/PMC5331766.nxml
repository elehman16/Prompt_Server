This sudden change in the body fluids volume, in children with low weight and age compared to adults, will be of stronger adverse effects after surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Through stimulating the inflammatory system and creating hemodilution at the beginning of the surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass leads to the excessive increase in vascular permeability which in turns results in a severe drop of blood pressure at the beginning of bypass. Furthermore, cardiopulmonary bypass following surgery causes generalized edema throughout the body, especially in the lungs and heart.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Destructive effects of bypass on heart lead to interstitial edema and pericardial effusion which influences the cardiac diastolic function and consequently affects the hemodynamic stability of patients at postoperative phase. On the other hand, pulmonary capacities and exchange capacity of lung gasses are influenced after placing the patient on bypass pump; consequently, overall pulmonary performance of patients decreases.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Hemodilution occurring with bypass pump is the sequel of priming solution used to set up the bypass pump. Hemodilution affects children with low weight more pronouncedly than adults. Various strategies have already been used to reduce the side effects of hemodilution through using retrograde autologous priming, medications (diuretics and anti-inflammatory), ultrafiltration, and blood products as prime. In addition, reducing the length of the bypass tubes and minimizing the bypass pump circuit have also been investigated.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Administration of varied methods of ultrafiltration has been highly regarded in various centers among the various methods of reducing the improper effects of bypass pump hemodilution. The main difference between different methods of ultrafiltration is at the time of their implementation; conventional ultrafiltration (CUF) and modified ultrafiltration (MUF) are performed during bypass pumps and after the end of bypass, respectively. Volumetric limitations in the reservoir during performing the bypass have been shown to reduce the possibility of convenient and efficient ultrafiltration in pediatric patients. Thus, the use of MUF is widely used at the end of bypass.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In the literature, there is a large controversy whether to use any of these interventions. While numerous studies conducted in the past have shown that the use of MUF at the end of bypass improves brain, lung, and heart function in the period after the open heart surgery and also reduces the need for blood products, length of postoperative ICU stay through reducing the amount of body fluids and hence the tissue edema.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A number of studies have reported no significant improvement in the clinical conditions of patients, in which MUF has been implemented.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In this study, we aimed to examine the effects of combined CUF and MUF on mechanical ventilation and hemodynamic changes in pediatric cardiac surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Procedures followed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional or regional) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2000 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wma.net/e/policy/17-c_e.html">http://www.wma.net/e/policy/17-c_e.html</ext-link>). Before starting the study, it was reviewed and confirmed with the institutional Ethics Committee. Informed written consent was obtained from the parents of the participants. The ethical standards of this trial are in accordance with the guidelines provided by the CPCSEA and World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki on Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Humans for studies involving experimental animals and human beings, respectively.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Our study was a single-center, prospective, randomized trial with planned enrollment of 46 pediatric patients for congenital heart surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass in 2014. We used online random allocation software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize2/">http://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/randomize2/</ext-link>) and passed the randomization list to a third person (colleague) that was out of the study and he kept all allocations &#x0201c;concealed&#x0201d; until the end of the study and the time of statistical analyses. Inclusion criteria were gestational age &#x0003e;37 weeks, postnatal age younger than 24 months, weight between 5 and 10 kg, and patients scheduled for open congenital heart surgery. Exclusion criteria were emergency operation, redo operation, preexisting pulmonary disease, use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after surgery, active noncardiac disease affecting recovery after the surgery, and arrest and having received shock during the surgery.

Operative management was standardized. No changes in surgical or anesthetic techniques were made for the purpose of the study. Our standard pediatric perfusion protocol was used in all patients, through aortic and bicaval cannulation and flow rates of 125&#x02013;200 ml/kg/min, depending on weight, to maintain mixed venous oxygen saturations of 60%&#x02013;70%. Blood prime was used, with priming volume determined by the sizes of arterial and venous tubing. Blood cardioplegia solution was used during aortic cross-clamping. Circulatory arrest was not used. A composition of 300 U/kg heparin was added to the patients&#x02019; blood before the cannulation to prevent the blood clots during CPB, and the added heparin in surgery was used to maintain activated clotting time (ACT) over 480 s, if necessary. The alpha-stat method was used to maintain the acid-base balance for all patients. To perform ultrafiltration technique, Hemocor HPH 400 Minntech hemofilter (Minntech Corporation, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was used. The CUF was used for patients in both groups during the surgery and also the MUF was used for patients in the intervention group by taking blood from the aortic cannula and returning blood to the right atrium through the venous cannula after the end of CPB.</p><p>A line was linked from oxygenator outlet to the filter inlet, and a line was returned from venous reservoir to filter outlet in the CUF method. The arterial cannula was linked to the filter inlet through the arterial line, and for 10 min, 10 ml/kg/min of blood was filtered by patient blood pressure monitoring.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Cardioplegia cannula was linked to the filter outlet and finally blood was returned from the cardioplegia line to the right atrium in MUF method [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Then, protamine with the initial dose 1 mg/kg was administered to patients after the end of MUF and removing the arterial and venous cannulas, and the next doses were prescribed if the ACT was not at the desired levels.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>MUF circuit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JRMS-21-113-g002"/></fig><p>Hemodynamic variables (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, mean blood pressure, heart rate, and central venous pressure) were measured before anesthesia induction) baseline), the start of bypass pump, the end of bypass pump, 15 min after bypass pump (end of MUF), the time entering the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, and 48 h after the surgery. Comparison between patients who received MUF + CUF and those who received CUF was conducted with respect to the duration of mechanical ventilator support, duration of ICU stay, and duration of hospitalization.

Mean volume of ultrafiltrate separated during CUF was not significantly different in two groups. Demographic characteristics of the patients including age, weight, height, and body surface area, as well as the priming volume, time of aortic cross-clamping, time of bypass pump, and urinary output were compared between two groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Information obtained from the hemodynamic status of patients in this study showed that there is a significant difference in central venous pressure and heart rate changes between the two groups before and after MUF. Administration of MUF in the intervention group significantly reduced the central venous pressure and heart rate. Furthermore, systolic and diastolic blood and mean arterial pressure in the intervention group patients were significantly higher compared with the control group. In the study of Schl&#x000fc;nzen <italic>et al</italic>., beneficial effects including reducing the heart rate and increasing the mean arterial pressure were noted.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] At the end of MUF in our study, patients in group CUF + MUF showed an increase of 8% in the mean SBP compared to the 1.1% decrease in the mean SBP in group CUF (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). Increase in SBP was reported in most previous studies. Furthermore, Kotani <italic>et al</italic>., in their study on infants with congenital cardiac problem of transposition of the great arteries, stated that the use of MUF could increase the systolic and diastolic blood pressure of patients without a significant change in central venous pressure and left atrial pressure.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In another prospective randomized study, Torina <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] studied the effects of using MUF in adult patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery and showed that using MUF had no significant effect on the hemodynamic status of patients; in contrast, using MUF at the end of CPB improved the blood pressure and heart rate in the present study. It seems that the difference in the results obtained from these two studies represents a beneficial effect of using MUF in pediatric patients. Through evaluating the children weighing &#x0003c;15 kg and with congenital malformations undergoing surgery, Thompson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that using sole MUF was unable to increase the blood pressure and improve the heart rate of patients.

In a similar study conducted by Javadpour <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] using MUF generally reduced inotrope requirement in the postoperative period. In their study, the administration of dopamine in the 24 h after surgery was significantly lower in the MUF group; however, no significant difference in the administration of epinephrine was observed between the groups. Administration of epinephrine was different between the groups of our study; yet, the amount of administered dopamine was of no significant difference. Maybe, this difference is due to the different types of used inotropes or different surgeon and anesthesiologist views. Of note, inotrope administration was generally decreased after surgery in both studies.</p><p>In another study on infants undergoing the arterial switch surgery, Kotani <italic>et al</italic>. reported that the duration of inotrope administration decreased from 95 to 80 h using MUF, but there was no significant difference between groups.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, in our study, the number and duration of inotropes were significantly different between groups.</p><p>In evaluating the effect of MUF on left ventricle function, Davies <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in another study announced that the use of MUF immensely reduced the number and dose of the inotrope use during 24 h after the pediatric heart surgery. Dopamine was used for most patients in their study which might have contributed to the insignificant difference; epinephrine and milrinone were used in their study for patients of control group in addition to dopamine and dobutamine which represents the increased inotrope requirement for patients, in which MUF was not administered. Inotropes requirement generally declined in both studies; it seems that the difference in types of inotropes used in two studies is due to the different hospital routines.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitations</title><p>The major limitation of our study was the small sample size (<italic>n</italic> = 23), and the present study was performed only in one hospital and multicenter studies with more patients might yield more powerful results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Results of this study showed that administration of CUF method during surgery and MUF after surgery generally improve the hemodynamic status of the pediatric patients during their ICU stay compared to the sole CUF administration method during surgery. Furthermore, duration of mechanical ventilation and overall inotrope requirement during the period of 48 h after surgery significantly decreased.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by Rajaie Cardiovascular Medical and Research Center.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>
