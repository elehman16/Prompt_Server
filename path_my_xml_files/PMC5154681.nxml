Cabozantinib, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, targets MET, VEGFR, RET, ROS1, and AXL, which are implicated in lung cancer tumorigenesis. We tested the efficacy of cabozantinib and the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib, as compared with erlotinib, in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC.</p></sec><sec id="S2"><title>Methods</title><p id="P4">In this three arm, randomised phase 2 study, the primary endpoint was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with cabozantinib versus erlotinib alone, and the combination of erlotinib plus cabozantinib versus erlotinib alone. Patients were eligible if they had received 1&#x02013;2 previous treatments for advanced non-squamous <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC. Patients were stratified by performance status and line of therapy, then randomised using permuted blocks within strata to receive open label oral daily dosing of erlotinib (150 mg), cabozantinib (60 mg), or erlotinib (150 mg) and cabozantinib (40 mg). Imaging was performed every 8 weeks. At the time of radiographic progression, there was optional crossover for patients in either single agent arm to receive combination therapy. The comparison between erlotinib and each of the arms was powered (91%) to detect a PFS hazard ratio (HR) of 0.5 (1-sided p-value 0.10-level). Secondary objectives were overall survival (OS), radiographic response by RECIST version 1.1 and description of adverse events by CTCAE version 4.0. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01708954.</p></sec><sec id="S3"><title>Findings</title><p id="P5">At complete enrollment, we randomised 125 patients (42 assigned to erlotinib, 40 assigned to cabozantinib, 43 assigned to the combination), of which 111 (89%) were eligible and received treatment per protocol were included in the primary analysis (38, 38, and 35 patients on erlotinib, cabozantinib, and combination, respectively). Compared to erlotinib alone (median 1.8 months), PFS was significantly improved in the cabozantinib arm (4.3 months, HR 0.39, 1-sided p=0.0003, 80% CI 0.27&#x02013;0.55) and also in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib arm (4.7 months, HR 0.37, 1-sided p=0.0003, 80% CI 0.25&#x02013;0.53).</p><p id="P6">The safety analysis population included all patients who received study therapy regardless of eligibility. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhea (3 [8%] in the erlotinib group vs 3 [8%] in the cabozantinib group vs 11 [28%] in the erlotinib and cabozantinib group), hypertension (none vs 10 [25%] vs 1 [3%]), fatigue (5 [13%] vs 6 [15%] vs 6 [15%]), oral mucositis (none vs 4 [10%] vs 1 [3%]), and thromboembolic event (none vs 3 [8%] vs 2 [5%]). Adverse events that were grade 3 or worse occurred in 13 (33%) patients in the erlotinib group, in 28 (70%) patients in the cabozantinib group, and in 28 (72%) patients in the erlotinib and cabozantinib group. One death of respiratory failure occurred in the cabozantinib group, deemed possibly related to either drug or disease, and one death occurred in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group from pneumonitis. MET IHC results were available on 86 patients from the primary analysis and 85% were scored as positive (1&#x02013;3+ membrane or cytoplasm staining with MET4 antibody). There was no association between MET IHC status and PFS when treated with or without cabozantinib.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Interpretation</title><p id="P7">The ECOG-ACRIN 1512 trial design tested the feasibility of using cabozantinib alone or combined with erlotinib in this patient population with <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC. Despite its modest sample size, this trial identified signals of clinically meaningful efficacy superior to that of erlotinib alone, and additional toxicity that was generally manageable. Cabozantinib-based regimens are promising for further investigation in this patient population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Non-small cell lung cancer</kwd><kwd>Erlotinib</kwd><kwd>Cabozantinib</kwd><kwd>Epidermal growth factor receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S5"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P8">Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, killing more than 1.3 million people annually.(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) In non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), first-line chemotherapy with a platinum-based doublet for advanced disease has a historical response rate of only approximately 20&#x02013;30% and a median overall survival of 8&#x02013;10 months.(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) At the time of progression, second-line chemotherapeutic agents such as docetaxel and pemetrexed confer benefit with response rates of approximately 10% and progression-free survival times of approximately 3 months.(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) Over the last year, immunotherapeutic checkpoint inhibitor antibodies such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab also have been demonstrated to improve outcomes in the second line treatment of NSCLC as compared with docetaxel.(<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</p><p id="P9">NSCLC adenocarcinomas can be categorized into groups by driver genomic alterations, and an overall survival benefit has been observed in patients that received appropriate targeted therapy based on genomic profiling of their tumors.(<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) The most common driver is a mutation in the <italic>EGFR</italic> gene, present in approximately 15% of NSCLC adenocarcinomas. Erlotinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), is highly active in the treatment of tumours harboring <italic>EGFR</italic> mutations.(<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) However, more than 75% of NSCLC adenocarcinomas have neither an EGFR mutation (described as EGFR wild-type) nor another targetable genomic alteration.

VEGFR2 is a primary mediator of VEGF-stimulated angiogenesis, and anti-angiogenic strategies have been effective in the treatment of NSCLC.

We conducted this trial to directly compare the efficacy of erlotinib with cabozantinib, and to compare erlotinib with cabozantinib plus erlotinib, in patients with previously treated <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type advanced NSCLC. The primary objective was to determine whether single agent cabozantinib or combination therapy including cabozantinib extends progression-free survival (PFS) when compared to single agent erlotinib for this patient population. Secondary objectives were estimation of overall survival, best objective response, and toxicity.

Briefly, patients were included who had metastatic or recurrent non-squamous NSCLC which had progressed following first line platinum-doublet chemotherapy, and optionally progressed following a second-line chemotherapy regimen. Patients were not allowed to have prior erlotinib or MET TKI therapy. Testing for EGFR TKI sensitizing mutations - at minimum, exon 19 deletions and L858R point mutations - was performed by local sites prior to screening for the trial, and patients with these or other known EGFR TKI sensitizing mutations were excluded. Submission of paraffin embedded tissue was required for retrospective MET testing by immunohistochemistry. Patients were required be &#x0003e;= 18 years old and have measurable disease by RECIST 1.1 criteria, and patients were allowed to have previously treated and stable brain metastases. Other eligibility criteria included ECOG performance status of 0&#x02013;2, adequate bone marrow, renal, hepatic, and cardiac function, and no hemoptysis, tumor invasion of large vessels or organs, or recent surgery, chest irradiation, or major thrombotic events. The institutional review boards at each participating institution approved the study protocol and amendments. All patients in the trial provided written informed consent. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki and was done in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="S8"><title>Randomisation and masking</title><p id="P13">The three treatment arms were open-label erlotinib monotherapy, cabozantinib monotherapy, and the combination of erlotinib and cabozantinib.

Randomisation was stratified by number of prior therapies (1 vs. 2) and ECOG performance status (0 <italic>vs.</italic> 1 <italic>vs.</italic> 2). Neither patients nor investigators were blinded to assigned treatment.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Procedures</title><p id="P14">Following assignment to treatment, the first dose of study drug was administered within 5 working days. Erlotinib was prescribed as standard-of-care therapy by the treating physician to patients on the erlotinib arms at a dose of 150 mg orally daily. Cabozantinib-s-malate was distributed from CTEP via the local research pharmacy and administered at a dose of 60 mg orally daily in the monotherapy arm, and 40 mg orally daily in the combination arm. Toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute common toxicity terminology criteria for adverse events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.0. Dose reduction levels for intolerable grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 drug-related events were as follows: erlotinib: 100 mg, 50 mg; cabozantinib 40 mg, 20 mg. A maximum of 2 dose reductions or 28 day drug hold to recover from toxicity was allowed, or patients were removed from the study. Management guidelines were provided in the protocol for diarrhea, rash, and other anticipated toxicities; some toxicities allowed continuation of dose after hold, some required dose reduction, and some required permanent discontinuation.</p><p id="P15">A cycle of therapy was defined as 4 weeks. Monitoring tests for safety (complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, magnesium, phosphorus, thyroid function testing, electrocardiogram) was performed every 2&#x02013;4 weeks. Radiographic tumour assessment was performed at baseline and every 2 cycles (8 weeks) according to RECIST 1.1 criteria by site investigators without central image review.(<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) There was no limit to length of therapy as long as patients had radiographically controlled disease and managed toxicity. At the time of radiographic progression, patients in the erlotinib or cabozantinib single agent therapy groups were allowed to crossover to combination treatment with erlotinib plus cabozantinib or discontinue treatment.</p><p id="P16">MET testing was performed in the Center for Molecular Oncologic Pathology at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital. The laboratory was blinded as to study arm. Total MET IHC testing was performed on the Leica Bond III automated immunostainer using the Bond Refine Detection system on 4-&#x003bc;m sections of FFPE(formalin fixed, paraffin embedded) specimens with the rabbit polyclonal c-Met clone CVD13 (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and both membranous and cytoplasmic staining were scored from 0&#x02013;3+ intensity, and percentage positivity, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="P17">The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), defined as the time from randomization to documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first. Patients who had not experienced an event of interest by the time of analysis were censored at the date they are last known to be alive and progression-free. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomization to death from any cause, and patients who were thought to be alive at the time of final analysis were censored at the last date of contact. Best objective response was evaluated via RECIST1.1 criteria. Toxicity was determined using CTCAE v4.0 criteria. The MET outcome analysis was a pre-planned exploratory endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="P18">The primary comparison was designed to accrue and randomise 105 eligible and treated patients 1:1:1, for a total accrual of 35 patients to each of the 3 arms. After adjusting for an ineligibility rate of 10%, the total estimated sample size for randomisation was 117 patients. Using an overall one-sided 0.10 level log rank test for each comparison, this study had 91% power to detect a PFS hazard ratio of 0.50, which corresponds to an improvement in the median PFS from 2.4 months on the control arm to 4.8 months on either experimental arm. The number of PFS events needed to achieve this power for each comparison was 58 events under the alternative hypothesis. Each of the two primary comparisons of PFS used a log rank test stratified on the randomisation stratification factors with a one-sided type I error rate of 10%. PFS was defined as the time from randomisation to documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first. Patients who had not experienced an event of interest by the time of analysis were censored at the date of the last radiographic disease assessment.</p><p id="P19">The primary endpoint was assessed in the per protocol population, which was defined as all patients who were eligible, randomly assigned, and received at least one dose of treatment. Patients were radiographically assessable if there was RECIST 1.1 measurable disease and all sites were evaluated within 4 weeks of starting therapy and a minimum of 8 weeks after starting therapy. The safety analysis population included all patients who received study therapy regardless of eligibility. MET IHC outcome analysis included the primary analysis population with tissue and MET result available. Overall survival was defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause, and patients who were known to be alive at the time of final analysis were censored at the last date of contact. PFS and OS distributions were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the treatment hazard ratios. Response rates and toxicity were compared using Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. This study was monitored by the ECOG-ACRIN Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) with one planned interim analysis for futility of PFS at roughly 50% information using the methodology of Freidlin, Korn, and Gray; at that time, if either point estimate of the PFS HR was consistent with detriment (HR &#x0003e; 1.0), the DSMC may have considered terminating the respective comparison early for overall lack of treatment difference.(<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) The study was followed to full information, and at that time the DSMC recommended that the results be released and that patients still receiving erlotinib only be offered one of the other treatments.

Fourteen (11%) of 125 patients never started assigned therapy or were deemed ineligible, leaving 111 (89%) patients in the primary analysis (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). At the time of data cutoff for this analysis, August 31, 2015, 33 (30%) patients in the primary analysis population were alive. The median follow-up was 17.0 months (15.4 months for erlotinib, 23.4 months for cabozantinib, and 14.9 months for erlotinib plus cabozantinib, with interquartile range for all groups of 12.7 &#x02013; 23.1 months).

Planned or unplanned dose modifications were experienced by 29 (76%) of 38 eligible and treated patients in the erlotinib group; 36 (95%) of 38 in the cabozantinib group; and 34 (97%) of 35 in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group. The data collected did not capture the reason for dose modification, although the protocol only permitted dose modification due to adverse events, not at investigator&#x02019;s discretion, The average daily dose of erlotinib was 140.2 mg of erlotinib for the erlotinib group and 125.5 mg of erlotinib for the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group.

The estimated median OS and corresponding 95% CI on each treatment arm was 5.1 months (3.3&#x02013;9.3 months) on erlotinib, 9.2 months (5.1&#x02013;15.0 months) on cabozantinib and 13.3 months (7.6-NA months) on erlotinib plus cabozantinib. <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref> displays overall survival by treatment arm. Response rate was measured using RECIST 1.1 criteria, and objective responses did not differ significantly between the groups (<xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). There was one partial response (PR) in the erlotinib group with a 48% reduction in tumor, four PRs in the cabozantinib group with median reduction of 36% (range 30&#x02013;53%), and one PR in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group with a 33% reduction in tumor. A total of 19 (17%) of 111 patients from the monotherapy arms crossed over to start combination therapy: 13 (34%) of 38 crossed over from erlotinib, and 6 (16%) of 38 crossed over from cabozantinib. No radiographic responses (complete response or PR) were observed in patients who crossed over to combination chemotherapy.</p><p id="P24">Tissue samples were collected on all patients at baseline for central MET IHC testing. Membranous and cytoplasmic staining were individually scored, and positivity was declared if MET was expressed in either the membrane or cytoplasm. A total of 107 independent patient samples were tested. Twelve samples were excluded from the analysis due to no sufficient tumor tissue available for scoring. From the 95 remaining samples, 86 came from the primary analysis population of eligible and treated patients. The overall of MET positivity in tissue samples was 73 (85%) of 86; by group it was 24 (80%) of 30 on erlotinib, 26 (81%) of 32 on cabozantinib, and 23 (96%) of 24 on erlotinib plus cabozantinib. Per protocol, we combined the cabozantinib treated groups for this analysis. MET status was not a significant predictor of PFS in a model also adjusted for whether or not a patient received cabozantinib: the estimated PFS HR for MET positivity was 0.65 (2-sided p=0.19). Progression-free survival by MET status is displayed in <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">figure 3</xref>. The median PFS among MET-negative patients randomised to erlotinib was 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.7 months - NR); for MET-negative patients who received any cabozantinib it was 4.4 months (95% CI: 1.8 months - NR). The median PFS among MET-positive patients randomised to erlotinib was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.6&#x02013;2.9 months); for MET-positive patients who received any cabozantinib it was 5.0 months (95% CI: 3.9&#x02013;7.4 months). Testing of additional MET positive cutpoints (cytoplasmic, membranous, or either) did not demonstrate that these were a significant predictor of PFS either (data not shown).</p><sec id="S14"><title>Adverse events</title><p id="P25">Selected adverse events of interest are presented in <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, and all treatment-related adverse events are presented in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix (page 3)</xref>. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhea (3 [8%] in the erlotinib group vs 3 [8%] in the cabozantinib group vs 11 [28%] in the erlotinib and cabozantinib group), hypertension (none vs 10 [25%] vs 1 [3%]), fatigue (5 [13%] vs 6 [15%] vs 6 [15%]), oral mucositis (none vs 4 [10%] vs 1 [3%]), and thromboembolic event (none vs 3 [8%] vs 2 [5%]). Hypertension was significantly higher in the cabozantinib group compared with the erlotinib group (2-sided p=0.001), as was diarrhea in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group compared with the erlotinib group (2-sided p=0.02). Adverse events of grade 3 or worse occurred in 13 (33%) patients in the erlotinib group, and were significantly higher in the cabozantinib group (28 patients [70%], 2-sided p=0.001), and in the erlotinib and cabozantinib group (28 patients [72%], 2-sided p=0.002). In the erlotinib group, 3 patients discontinued treatment for adverse events, compared with 11 patients in the cabozantinib group, and 13 patients in the erlotinib and cabozantinib group. Deaths on or within 30 days of last dose of treatment included 7 (17%) in the erlotinib group, 3 (8%) in the cabozantinib group, and 7 (16%) in the cabozantinib plus erlotinib group, and are presented in the <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">appendix (page 8)</xref>. All were deemed unlikely or unrelated to treatment, except for two: one death due to respiratory failure in the cabozantinib group, deemed possibly related to either drug or disease, and one death in the erlotinib plus cabozantinib group from drug pneumonitis due to either agent or the combination.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P26">Our findings show that cabozantinib treatment alone, or cabozantinib plus erlotinib, was associated with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival when compared to erlotinib alone in patients with <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC who progressed after prior therapy. This treatment effect was supported by a corresponding improvement in overall survival, albeit with an increase in toxicity.</p><p id="P27">The results for the control arm were consistent with other trials using erlotinib in <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type patients. During the conduct of this study, other trials were reported that used erlotinib as a control arm in <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC, in comparison to second line single agent chemotherapy. In the Italian TAILOR trial, 222 patients were randomised to erlotinib or docetaxel.(<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) Median overall survival was 8.2 months with docetaxel, compared with 5.4 months with erlotinib (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.53&#x02013;1.00; p=0.05), and median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.9 months with docetaxel versus 2.4 months with erlotinib (adjusted HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.53&#x02013;0.95; p=0.02). In the Japanese DELTA trial, 301 patients were randomly assigned to erlotinib or docetaxel. (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) In a subset analysis of 199 patients with <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type tumors, OS for erlotinib versus docetaxel was 9.0 v 10.1 months (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.39; P = 0.91), and PFS for erlotinib versus docetaxel was 1.3 versus 2.9 months (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.09 to 1.94; P = 0.01). The phase 3 TITAN study randomised 424 patients to erlotinib versus docetaxel or pemetrexed chemotherapy.(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) No differences in OS or PFS were identified between the groups, even for the <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type subgroup, although <italic>EGFR</italic> mutation status was indeterminate or missing on more than half of patients. Overall, these studies consistently observe modest efficacy of erlotinib in <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC, and suggest inhibiting other non-EGFR signaling pathways is a rational treatment strategy in this subgroup of patients. Our observed median PFS of 1.8 months was similar to the 1.3, 1.4, and 2.4 months observed on the DELTA, TITAN, and TAILOR trials, respectively. Our observed median OS of 5.1 months was similar to the 5.3 and 5.4 months observed on the TITAN and TAILOR trials, but less than the 9.0 months observed in the DELTA trial. In addition, the PFS on the cabozantinib monotherapy arm of 4.3 months was quite similar to the 4.2 months previously observed in the previously conducted single arm phase II study of cabozantinib, and OS on this study was not reported. Therefore, the favorable efficacy outcomes observed in both experimental arms in our study are both clinically and statistically significant.</p><p id="P28">Cabozantinib therapy, or the combination of cabozantinib and erlotinib, was associated with an increased occurrence of grade 3 or worse adverse events compared with erlotinib alone. Many of these adverse events were symptomatic, such as fatigue, nausea, oral mucositis, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, all more frequently associated with cabozantinib treatment. The previous phase I/II trial of erlotinib and cabozantinib demonstrated that cabozantinib needed to be reduced to 40 mg daily in combination with erlotinib to limit diarrhea; despite this, patients still received an average of 32 mg of cabozantinib daily on the combination arm. While not statistically imbalanced for this randomised trial, the fatal adverse events of respiratory failure and pneumonitis, and life threatening adverse events of intracranial hemorrhage, thromboembolic event, other skin disorder, and thrombocytopenia were only observed on the cabozantinib arms. This suggests that cabozantinib is potentially less tolerable than erlotinib, though given its more potent clinical benefit this may be a worthwhile tradeoff. The recent FDA approval of cabozantinib 60 mg daily for renal cell carcinoma suggests that it has an acceptable overall safety profile as monotherapy.</p><p id="P29">Given the potential mechanism of action as a MET inhibitor, it was hypothesized that MET protein expression might be predictive of response to cabozantinib. However, no effect was observed on PFS by MET status in the subset of patients in whom MET IHC testing and response assessment was available. Additionally, cabozantinib is known to inhibit AXL, which may be activated together with other driver tyrosine kinases. While there is no standardized assay for AXL expression, a biomarker may be identified in an ongoing clinical trial of cabozantinib that includes patients with NSCLC that has increased AXL activity (NCT01639508). Cabozantinib also may be exerting its clinical benefit as a VEGFR2 inhibitor. It is known that VEGFR2 inhibition is effective in the second line treatment of NSCLC, as a VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody, ramucirumab, is FDA approved in combination with docetaxel based on a median overall survival of 10.5 months compared with 9.1 months for docetaxel alone (HR 0.86, 95% CI [0.75&#x02013;0.98]; p=0.023).(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) Additionally, the small molecule VEGFR2 inhibitor nintedanib plus docetaxel is active in patients with adenocarcinoma histology, with a median overall survival of 12.6 months versus 10.3 months for docetaxel alone (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.70&#x02013;0.99], p=0.0359), which led to approval by European regulatory agencies (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). However, no broadly validated predictive biomarker of anti-angiogenic therapy has been identified to date.</p><p id="P30">Limitations of this study include the modest sample size and the lack of detailed molecular driver oncogene characterization. Although effects on overall survival were observed, a larger trial would be needed to confirm these results. However, conducting a larger trial of similar design would be challenging. We believe that erlotinib is no longer a suitable control arm for a confirmatory trial given the mounting evidence that erlotinib is minimally effective in an EGFR wild-type NSCLC population. One potential comparator would be docetaxel, with a median PFS of 3.0 months and median OS of 9.1 months in a recent large randomised trial.(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) Another potential comparison therapy would be nivolumab, which was superior to docetaxel in non-squamous NSCLC for median OS (12.2 months for nivolumab vs 9.4 months for docetaxel) but not median PFS (2.3 months for nivolumab vs 4.2 months for docetaxel). However, with numerical medians of PFS and OS similar to those we observed for cabozantinib, it appears unlikely that cabozantinib monotherapy would be superior to either docetaxel or nivolumab in a randomised trial. Another limitation is that we only collected known KRAS driver oncogene status, and limited tissue exists to pursue further testing which has become a standard of care in the intervening years since the study began. It is possible that potential cabozantinib sensitive molecular drivers such as RET rearrangement, ROS1 rearrangement, and <italic>MET</italic> amplification or <italic>MET</italic> exon 14 skipping mutation were imbalanced between the groups, leading to the observed survival benefits of cabozantinib. This is unlikely, because we would predict all of these to total no more than 10% of this study population, and patients with these alterations would be expected to have radiographic responses to targeted therapy. Few such responses were observed on this trial, even in the cabozantinib groups, suggesting that individual patients with particularly sensitive disease were unlikely to be imbalanced across the arms. Therefore, it is unlikely that a small subgroup with particular molecular driver alterations was responsible the observed clinical benefit of cabozantinib, though testing of remaining tissue is of interest.</p><p id="P31">To our knowledge, ECOG-ACRIN 1512 is the first randomised study to show that cabozantinib, either alone or in combination with erlotinib, improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared with single agent erlotinib in <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC in the 2nd and 3rd line setting. Despite the increased toxicity profile, this suggests that cabozantinib is worthy of further study in this patient population. ECOG-ACRIN investigators plan to initiate a follow-up study to build on these observations and further delineate a role for cabozantinib in the treatment of advanced non-squamous NSCLC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S17"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>supplement</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS829207-supplement.pdf" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e569" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was conducted by ECOG-ACRIN with support from the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>We thank the patients, their families and caregivers for participating in the study; all co-investigators and participating sites; Jeanne Sheehan for coordination of data management; Becky Fillingham (ECOG-ACRIN, Boston, MA, USA) for assistance with the biomarker studies; Maria Pitsiouni (Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, California, USA) for effort as study liaison; John Wright at CTEP (National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, USA) and Arthur DeCillis with Exelixis (South San Francisco, California, USA) for their assistance with various aspects of the study.</p><p>This study was coordinated by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (Robert L.

We searched PubMed, with no time restrictions; abstracts of major oncology meetings; and trial websites including ClinicalTrials.gov, for preclinical data and clinical trials assessing chemotherapy in patients with lung cancer, EGFR therapies in these patients, MET inhibitor therapies in these patients, and the combination of these methods. Search terms included &#x0201c;non-small cell lung cancer&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;EGFR&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;MET&#x0201d;.</p><p id="P34">Clinical data in support of this trial included a phase 2 study cabozantinib in patients with previously treated NSCLC which showed that it was active in generating objective tumour responses and meaningful time to progression of disease. Additionally a phase 1/2 trial of erlotinib and cabozantinib demonstrated the safety of the combination of these drugs. Based on our review of the literature and discussions with clinicians, researchers, and regulatory bodies, we postulated that combining erlotinib with cabozantinib might improve treatment efficacy in patients with previously treated <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.</p></sec><sec id="S21"><title>Added value of this study</title><p id="P36">Our study shows significant improvement in progression-free survival in patients who were treated with cabozantinib, or the combination of cabozantinib and erlotinib, as compared with erlotinib alone. There was also a signal of improvement in overall survival observed in these groups. We found no evidence of associate of progression-free survival with MET status as determined by immunohistochemical staining.</p></sec><sec id="S22"><title>Implications of all the available evidence</title><p id="P38">The ECOG-ACRIN 1512 trial design tested the feasibility of using cabozantinib alone or combined with erlotinib in this patient population with <italic>EGFR</italic> wild-type NSCLC. Despite its modest sample size, this trial identified signals of clinically meaningful efficacy superior to that of erlotinib alone, and additional toxicity that was generally manageable. Further investigation of cabozantinib in this patient population, potentially in combination with other established therapies, is warranted.</p></sec></boxed-text></floats-group></article>
