The process of atrophy is universal following the decline in estrogen<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> with physiological changes taking place in the vulval, vaginal and urogenital epithelia<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. These changes underlie a broad range of genital and urinary symptoms, including dryness, burning, dyspareunia, loss of vaginal secretions, leukorrhea, vulvar pruritus, feeling of pressure, itching, urethral discomfort, frequency and urgency of urination, hematuria, urinary tract infection and dysuria<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. Up to 50% of postmenopausal women suffer from the symptoms of VVA<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>, with the onset of these symptoms varying from one woman to another<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. The presence and severity of these symptoms are variable, ranging from mild discomfort to great impairment<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and can be influenced by age, time and type of menopause<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> as well as sexual activity and other personal history elements<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>. Although VVA has a negative impact on sexual health and quality of life<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>, only a minority of postmenopausal women will ever seek medical treatment for their condition<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>The principles of treatment in women with established vaginal atrophy are to restore urogenital physiology and to alleviate symptoms<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Treatment recommendations for VVA include first-line therapy with non-hormonal lubricants with intercourse and, if indicated, regular use of long-acting vaginal moisturizers<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. However, these approaches seldom restore premenopausal anatomy or physiology and do not provide a long-term solution<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. Local estrogen therapy may be used in postmenopausal women with symptomatic VVA who do not respond to lubricants and moisturizers<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>. Systemic estrogen therapy is not usually recommended when VVA is the only menopausal symptom<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. However, long-term safety, hormone exposure and side-effects in general have been cited as concerns that women have associated with use of prescription vaginal products<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> and a potential systemic effect of local estrogens cannot totally be excluded<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, studies have suggested that satisfaction with the available treatment options is low<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>, with common reasons for dissatisfaction including messiness, ritual and inconvenience of administration and interference with the spontaneity of sex<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>. Therefore, there is a need for novel pharmacological treatment options that are easy to administer by women with symptoms of VVA<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p><p>Recent clinical trial programs for drugs to treat VVA are based on draft guidance from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, which specifies that a new product must demonstrate efficacy at three co-primary endpoints, namely a change in: (1) maturation index (decrease in the percentage of parabasal vaginal cells and increase in the percentage of superficial vaginal cells), (2) vaginal pH, and (3) severity of the patient-reported most bothersome symptom (MBS). The severity of MBS is based on self-assessment of the symptoms of VVA by the patient and includes vaginal dryness, vaginal pain associated with sexual activity (dyspareunia), vaginal and/or vulvar irritation/itching, dysuria and vaginal bleeding associated with sexual activity. Patients are required to rate the severity of the first four symptoms as none, mild, moderate or severe and the presence of vaginal bleeding after intercourse as either present or absent. The severity score is usually given a numerical value (none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 and severe = 3) enabling a &#x02018;mean change from baseline&#x02019; to be calculated. The MBS must be chosen at baseline from the symptoms rated as moderate or severe and the mean change in MBS score from baseline is used to evaluate symptomatic improvement. Although this approach is an important primary measure of efficacy and is a major step forward in standardizing measurement of self-assessed changes in the severity of VVA to validate potential new treatments<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, it is not easy to interpret what the resulting &#x02018;mean change from baseline&#x02019; means in daily clinical practice.</p><p>Ospemifene is a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), licensed in the USA for oral treatment of moderate to severe dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA, due to menopause<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>, and current recommendations from the North American Menopause Society include the use of ospemifene for treatment of these symptoms<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>. Pivotal studies with ospemifene have demonstrated the tolerability and efficacy of 12 weeks of ospemifene treatment in improving the MBS of dyspareunia<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> and vaginal dryness<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. These studies of ospemifene have reported the mean change from baseline (range: ospemifene, &#x02212; 1.19 to &#x02212; 1.5; placebo, &#x02212; 0.84 to &#x02212; 1.2)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. While these data are important to show the statistical significance of ospemifene treatment, it would be beneficial to have data that are applicable to everyday clinical practice to assist health-care professionals in understanding what can be expected from prescribed treatments. This will be useful for defining the patient's expectation of potential benefits and limitations of treatment.</p><p>In the ospemifene clinical trial program, the majority of the symptoms reported as MBS were either vaginal dryness or dyspareunia. The objective of the current analysis was to explore clinically relevant differences in the severity of vaginal dryness or dyspareunia in postmenopausal women treated with ospemifene 60 mg/day compared with placebo, using data of the primary endpoint from the two previously published studies<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. The safety and tolerability profile of 12 weeks of ospemifene in postmenopausal women, including a risk&#x02013;benefit discussion, has been reported previously<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and is therefore not included in this current analysis. Furthermore, safety data on ospemifene for the treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women for 52 weeks<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> and up to 64 weeks for women without a uterus<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> have also been reported elsewhere.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Patients and study design</title><p>The current study analyzes the results of two previously conducted trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of oral ospemifene 60 mg/day for the treatment of the symptoms of VVA (NCT00276094/sponsor protocol no. 15&#x02013;50310, referred to herein as Study 310; NCT00729469/sponsor protocol no. 15-50821, referred to herein as Study 821)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.

Although previous studies have demonstrated the efficacy of ospemifene on the mean change in vaginal dryness<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> from baseline (range: ospemifene, &#x02212; 1.26 to &#x02212; 1.3; placebo, &#x02212; 0.84 to &#x02212; 1.1) and dyspareunia<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> (range: ospemifene, &#x02212; 1.19 to &#x02212; 1.5; placebo, &#x02212; 0.89 to &#x02212; 1.2), this is the first analysis to show the clinical relevance of such changes. This is particularly important as numerical measures of severity are not routinely used in clinical practice and gynecologists and their patients may therefore find it difficult to apply such knowledge to understand how treatments for VVA may benefit women with symptoms attributable to the condition. The data presented here therefore provide clinically meaningful information as to the proportion of women who might expect to experience improvement or relief of their symptoms with ospemifene treatment.</p><p>A number of other studies investigating treatment of VVA in postmenopausal women have been published in recent years using the MBS as a co-primary endpoint<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup>. However, although the concept of the clinical relevance of changes in the severity score for the MBS with treatment has been suggested through the analysis of &#x02018;improvement&#x02019; and &#x02018;relief&#x02019; of such symptoms<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>, this is the first manuscript to report such changes in this way. We have also developed this further, with the inclusion of &#x02018;substantial improvement&#x02019; as a measure of the severity of the symptoms of VVA. There are a number of reasons for the inclusion of this definition. First, a one-unit improvement in severity score is often spontaneous and can occur without intervention. For example, in the ospemifene pivotal efficacy trials, patients selected their MBS at screening and again at randomization (baseline). The period between screening and randomization was no more than 6 weeks, with no therapeutic intervention during this time. However, in Study 821, 14.9% of patients who described their MBS as severe at screening showed improvement by randomization, but only 0.2% showed substantial improvement at this point in time. This was similar in Study 310. If a substantial improvement is observed, different from placebo, it is more likely to reflect a true effect of a treatment in the patient population since a change of that magnitude in severity is rare without intervention. Furthermore, in the absence of a strict definition of the degree of severity (none, mild, moderate or severe), it is possible to question the significance of a change in severity score of one unit. For example, what may be perceived as moderate one day can be perceived as severe another day. However, there is little uncertainty about a change from moderate to none or from severe to mild or none. Using substantial improvement therefore reduces uncertainty in a subjective patient-reported outcome.</p><p>The efficacy of ospemifene in improving objective measures of VVA, i.e. increasing the maturation index and decreasing the vaginal pH, has been shown in Studies 310 and 821<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. In both pivotal studies, 12 weeks of treatment with ospemifene 60 mg/day increased the percentage of superficial cells by approximately 10% compared with placebo (&#x0223c;2%) and decreased the percentage of parabasal cells by 30&#x02013;40% compared with placebo (0&#x02013;4%)<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Notably, in both studies, improvements in maturation index were observed after 4 weeks of treatment. The clinically relevant changes in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia with ospemifene 60 mg/day reported in this current analysis, also observed after 4 weeks of treatment, suggest that symptomatic relief follows the objective signs of improvement reported previously<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. Taken together, these data indicate that ospemifene is treating the cause of vaginal atrophy, not just ameliorating the associated symptoms. Furthermore, the onset of these benefits may be experienced within 4 weeks of treatment.</p><p>In the current analysis, there is a substantial placebo effect, with improvement of dyspareunia and vaginal dryness associated with VVA in approximately 50% of women who received placebo. However, it is important to note that the design of the two studies reported here allowed all participants to use a non-hormonal vaginal lubricant as needed and therefore the placebo effect also includes the effect of the lubricant. Indeed, in the current analysis, the placebo effect was apparent after 4 weeks of the study &#x02013; this early onset of the placebo effect has also been reported previously<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup>. This early placebo effect usually wears off, as demonstrated by the continuing improvement in the ospemifene 60 mg/day group compared with placebo. Not only did ospemifene 60 mg/day show efficacy over and above lubricant, but lubricant use was reduced in the ospemifene treatment group towards the end of the study<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>. Furthermore, in clinical practice, placebo is not prescribed.</p><p>There is a need for more stringent definitions for the degree of severity for the symptoms of VVA, particularly when conducting clinical trials and for comparisons of the efficacy of different products. Furthermore, while such subjective measurements are essential to ensure the clinical effectiveness of new treatments that address both the underlying physiology and symptoms experienced by postmenopausal women to improve and maintain their quality of life in older age, it would also be beneficial to include a formal assessment of quality of life in the assessment of new treatments to understand fully the impact of the symptoms of VVA in women. In the absence of specific VVA quality-of-life rating scales, sexual quality-of-life scales are currently used as surrogates to assess the effect of VVA symptoms. Establishing a practical, validated questionnaire, which takes into account the impact of VVA symptoms on personal, social and professional aspects of quality of life, should now be prioritized to assist in assessing the effectiveness of new treatment options for VVA<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s9"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This analysis provides a clinically meaningful analysis of the efficacy of ospemifene 60 mg/day on vaginal dryness and dyspareunia as a result of VVA.
