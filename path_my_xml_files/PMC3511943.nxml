There is no general agreement as to what constitutes an adequate alveolar concentration before the flow can be reduced. However, recent studies have used the &#x0201c;equilibration point&#x0201d; of the inhalational agent as the switch-over point.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The physical and chemical characteristics of individual agents influence the initial high FGF period. A number of techniques of minimal flow anesthesia are described in the literature. There are a number of reports that desflurane achieves adequate alveolar concentration faster than agents with comparatively lesser blood gas solubility like isoflurane, thus requiring lesser duration of high FGF and causing less environmental pollution.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The role of an end-tidal volatile agent, in evaluating the effect of FGF on achieving a suitable depth, can be explained by the Gas Man simulation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and Mapelson hypothesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After obtaining approval from hospital ethics committee and informed consent from patients, this study was conducted on 60 healthy patients of either sex scheduled for routine surgeries. Inclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II, age 20&#x02013;60 years, and hemoglobin more than 10 g/dL. Patients with cardiac diseases, lung disorders, pregnancy and patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery were excluded.</p><p>A routine preanesthetic checkup was conducted one day prior to surgery. No preanesthetic medication that could affect the total anesthetic agent requirement and recovery profile (recovery time and recovery score) was administered. Patients were randomly allocated to two groups depending on the volatile anesthetic agent being used, using concealed envelopes. Group I received desflurane as the inhalational anesthetic agent with minimal flow anesthesia (<italic>n</italic> = 30). Group II received isoflurane as anesthetic agent with minimal flow anesthesia (<italic>n</italic> = 30).</p><p>An Aestiva anesthesia workstation (Datex Ohmeda, Madison, USA) was used in all patients. A special connector for return of sampling gas back to the breathing circuit was used (one end of this connector was attached to the exhaust port of the respiratory gas monitor and the other end was attached to the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit) [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Special connector for return of sampling gas used.

Anesthesia was induced by administering intravenous (IV) fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, propofol 3 mg/kg, and atracurium 0.5 mg/kg. Lungs were hand ventilated with help of a facemask using FGF of oxygen 6 L/min for 3 min. Intermittent boluses of propofol 20 mg IV were given. Boluses of propofol 20 mg were used thus at 1 min intervals (without nitrous oxide and inhalational agent) after induction of anesthesia. Trachea was intubated 3 min after administration of atracurium. The patient was connected to the anesthesia machine with a Y-piece connector of the breathing circuit. A high FGF mixture of 6 L/min (oxygen 2 L/min and nitrous oxide 4 L/min) was delivered initially with a volatile inhalational anesthetic agent after tracheal intubation. The volatile inhalational anesthetic agent was set at 1.3 times the agent minimum alveolar concentration (MAC), i.e. 1.5% for isoflurane or 8% for desflurane. Once the ratio of expired (Fe) to inspired (Fi) volatile inhalational agent concentration (isoflurane/desflurane) became 0.8, high FGF was reduced to the minimal FGF mixture, i.e. 300 mL/min of oxygen and 200 mL/min of nitrous oxide. The point when the ratio of Fe to Fi inhalational agent concentration became 0.8 (uptake of the volatile inhalational anesthetic agent reaches: 80% &#x02013; Fe/Fi = 0.8) was defined as the &#x0201c;equilibration point&#x0201d; of the inhalational anesthetic agent.</p><p>During maintenance phase of anesthesia, a minimum inspired oxygen concentration (FiO<sub>2</sub>) of 0.3 was maintained in the minimal FGF mixture. The vaporizer dial setting was changed, if needed, after flow reduction to maintain MAC of 1 or more as required depending on the type of surgery, but keeping the FGF constant. Top-up doses of atracurium 0.1 mg/kg IV were given every 15 min and morphine 0.15 mg/kg IV was given at time of incision. Diclofenac 1 mg/kg IV, in 100 mL normal saline, was given to all patients as a part of the multimodal approach to analgesia.</p><p>The inhalational anesthetic vaporizer was switched off after the end of the surgery. The neuromuscular block was reversed with neostigmine 0.5 mg/kg and glycopyrolate 0.01 mg/kg IV administered 20 min of the last dose of relaxant or if the patient started spontaneously breathing. Thereafter, nitrous oxide was stopped and only oxygen 6 L/min was given. The trachea was extubated once extubation criteria were met, and the patient transferred to the postoperative recovery room. Before discharging the patient from the recovery room, the patient was interviewed for intraoperative awareness.</p><p>&#x0201c;Recovery time&#x0201d; was defined from the time of discontinuation of the inhalational anesthetic agent (vaporizer switched off) to the time the patient opened his/her eyes on verbal command while recovering from anesthesia. During recovery, patient recovery characteristics were defined by a recovery score (1 = No response to painful stimuli; 2 = Drowsy but arousal by verbal command; and 3 = Awake and responding to command at extubation).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The following parameters were recorded: hemodynamic characteristics (mean change in the heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure, oxygen saturation, nasopharyngeal temperature); mean equilibration time of the volatile inhalational agent (mean was taken at 5, 10, 15, 30 min, and thereafter at 30 min interval till the time of extubation); mean end-tidal volatile anesthetic partial pressure; recovery time and score; and any critical event if occurred and measures taken to tackle the problem.</p><p>Statistical analysis was done, and all values were expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). The sample size was decided by determining its power of study, which was 0.8 for the primary outcome variable. Equilibration time of the volatile anesthetic agent was taken as a primary outcome variable. Independent continuous data (example heart rate, blood pressure, and mean end-tidal agent concentration, ratio between inspired and expired agent concentration, recovery time, and recovery score) were analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) or unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test and the <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test was used for nonparametric (mean consumption of volatile agent concentration), skewed (non-normal) distribution for test of significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Sixty adult patients were studied.

However, a leak proof machine, gas monitoring, and capnography are essential for conduct of a minimal flow technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>We aimed to compare desflurane and isoflurane in minimal flow anesthesia. Use of mask ventilation with high FGF can lead to the loss of inhalational agent, defeating the purpose of minimal flow and also making it difficult to monitor the level of inhalational agent used during this period. To prevent this, boluses of propofol were used at 1 min intervals after the initial induction as recommended.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] This method is an effective alternative to the use of inhalational agent at this period of time.</p><p>Equilibration time is an effective parameter for change over from high flow to minimal flows. Time of equilibration between Fi and Fe agent concentrations is defined as the time to reach a Fe/Fi ratio of 80%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] This ratio is an effective change-over point and helps in effective denitrogenation and maintenance of the constant level of desflurane and isoflurane after the change over from high FGF to minimal FGF anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Equilibration time with desflurane was found to be shorter than isoflurane, and we could reduce the FGF earlier in the desflurane group as compared to the isoflurane group. Similar findings were obtained by others.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In the earlier studies, change over from high to low FGF was done after 10&#x02013;20 min, as recommended by Baum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>In minimal flow anesthesia, nitrous oxide usually shows an increasing trend while oxygen shows a decreasing trend because nitrous oxide is neither consumed nor metabolized, but oxygen is consumed by the body. Higher flow of oxygen in relation to nitrous oxide is recommended, to prevent undesirable fall in inspired oxygen concentration especially in long duration surgeries. Higher flow of oxygen in relation to nitrous oxide is recommended in first 30&#x02013;45 min after the start of minimal flow as the nitrous oxide uptake continuously declines and the gas tends to accumulate within the breathing system. In our study, the fall in the level of end-tidal concentration of nitrous oxide was possibly due to maintenance of the FGF flow ratio as per the study protocol and .</p><p>MAC is a useful measure because it mirrors brain partial pressure, allows comparisons of potency between agents. Around 1.3 MAC of any of volatile anesthetic has been found to prevent movement in about 95% of patients (an approximation of ED95). We did not use any depth of anesthesia monitoring, but maintained 1MAC or more asked the patient for any history of awareness before discharging from the recovery room. No patient had any awareness. Change in hemodynamics can occur during surgery because of changes in the surgical stimulus level. Hemodynamics can be maintained by regulating the depth of anesthesia (maintaining an adequate MAC/end-tidal concentration) or by the use of rescue medications such as propofol, esmolol, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The dial setting of volatile anesthetic agent concentration in our study was changed only to maintain adequate MAC. The high FGF, delivered initially, quickly achieved the desired concentration. At minimal flows, the dial was set higher as it takes longer to achieve the desired concentration. At both low and high FGF rates, the acute hemodynamic response to surgical stimulus was more efficiently treated by increasing the end-tidal concentration of desflurane concentration than isoflurane. Armavov <italic>et al</italic>. could easily control an increase in mean arterial blood pressure by changing the desflurane dial setting even at lower FGF (1 L/min).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>The effects of anesthetic duration on kinetics and recovery characteristics of desflurane and sevoflurane were studied. Awakening to response to command and orientation was found to be almost twice as rapid after anesthesia with desflurane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] We found a more rapid wake-up with desflurane than isoflurane. In the desflurane group, patients had a clear-headed recovery.</p><p>Coetzee and Stewart used a wash-in period of 10 min at high FGF, which was less than the usually recommended 15&#x02013;20 min for minimal flow.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] They concluded that even for the most soluble drug-like halothane, a 10 min wash-in period was sufficient and said that for desflurane, a shorter wash-in period will suffice with even greater cost saving. Consumption of soluble agents (such as enflurane and isoflurane) only partially depends on FGF.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>To conclude, with availability of agents like desflurane we can use minimal flow anesthesia more efficiently, with less drift in anesthetic gases and a clear-headed recovery and minimum operating room pollution.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bengtson</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Reservation of humidity and heat of respiratory gases during anesthesia a laboratory investigation</article-title><source>Acta Anaesth Scand</source><year>1987</year><volume>31</volume><fpage>127</fpage><lpage>31</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3564868</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ooi</surname><given-names>NR</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Soni</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>New agent, the circle system and short procedure</article-title><source>Anaesthesia</source><year>1997</year><volume>52</volume><fpage>364</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9135191</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>DL</given-names></name><name><surname>Soni</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficiency of a circle system for short surgical cases comparison of desflurane with isoflurane</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>1996</year><volume>76</volume><fpage>780</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8679349</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baxter</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Low and minimal flow anaesthesia</article-title><source>Can J Anaesth</source><year>1997</year><volume>44</volume><fpage>643</fpage><lpage>53</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9187785</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Coetzee</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Fresh gas flow is not the only determinant of volatile agent consumption, a multicentric study of low flow anaesthesia</article-title><source>Br J Anaesth</source><year>2002</year><volume>88</volume><fpage>46</fpage><lpage>55</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11881883</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Talib</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparative evaluation of minimal flow anaesthesia versus low flow anaesthesia with endotracheal tube and laryngeal mask airway</article-title><year>2006</year><publisher-name>Thesis National Board of Examination</publisher-name><fpage>44</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><article-title>Standards for basic anesthetic monitoring</article-title><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2012 July 28</date-in-citation><comment>(Approved by the ASA House of Delegates on October 21, 1986, and last amended on October 20, 2010 with an effective date of July 1, 2011).
