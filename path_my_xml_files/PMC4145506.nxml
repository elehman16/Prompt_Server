Medical College, Indore. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and written informed parental consent was obtained for each subject. All patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I. Patients were randomly allocated to one of the two groups by using a random number table, to receive caudal block with either bupivacaine (Group I) or ropivacaine (Group II). Patients and observer were blinded to the medication given. Patients having coagulopathy, spinal deformities, infection at the injection site or allergy to amide local anaestheticsanesthetics were excluded from the study.</p><p>Premedication was done with intravenous (i.v.) glycopyrolate glycopyrrolate (0.01 mg/kg) and all procedures were performed under general anaesthesiaanesthesia. Induction was done with i.v. propofol 3 mg/kg and i.v. atracurium 0.5 mg/kg, followed by oro-tracheal intubation. AnaesthesiaAnesthesia was maintained with 70% of nitrous oxide in oxygen, isoflurane 0.2-0.4% and atracurium. Patients received caudal block with either bupivacaine (0.25%) 1 ml/kg or ropivacaine (0.25%) 1 ml/kg in left lateral position using a 23-gauge short-bevel needle (Dispovan, Ballabgarh, India) under aseptic condition. Neither sedatives nor opioids were administered intra-operatively.</p><p>Heart rate (HR) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were recorded as a baseline, before the anesthesia induction and then at 30, 60 and 90 min after incision. During surgery, adequate analgesia was defined by hemodynamic stability, as indicated by the absence of an increase in SBP or HR by &#x0003e;15% of pre-incision baseline values, for which the child received fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg). Then patient was observed in every 5 min and fentanyl (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) was repeated as and when required. Isoflurane concentration was maintained between 0.2% and 0.4%. Fluid therapy was standardized during and after surgery. During surgery, children received lactated Ringer's solution 6 ml/kg/h, whereas 5% dextrose in 0.45% NaCl was infused at 4 ml/kg/h in the post-operative period. An intraoperative decrease of SBP or HR by &#x0003e;30% was defined as hypotension or bradycardia, respectively and was treated by fluid bolus, ephedrine, or atropine, as necessary.</p><p>Each patient was observed for 4 h in the recovery room before being transferred to the ward. HR and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and SBP were monitored every 30 min. Pain scores were assessed post-operatively by a single person at 30 min and then at 2, 4, 8 and 12 h with a 5-point observer pain score (OPS): 1 = asleep or awake and laughing; 2 = awake, but no pain; 3 = mild pain (irritable/restless); 4 = moderate pain (crying, grimacing restless but consolable); and 5 = severe pain (crying/screaming/inconsolable). The duration of absolute analgesia was defined as the time from caudal injection until the pain score was &#x0003e; 2. Rescue analgesic was given for a pain score/4 in the form of paracetamol suppository (20 mg/kg), if necessary.</p><p>Motor block was assessed on awakening by using a modified Bromage scale that consisted of 4 points: 0 = full motor strength (flexion of knees and feet), 1 = flexion of knees, 2 = little movement of feet only, 3 = no movement of knees or feet. However, younger children who could not move their legs on command were stimulated by tapping on the legs and feet. The incidence of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting and pruritus was evaluated by a yes/no survey. All evaluations were performed along with assessments of pain.</p><p>The sample size was determined with a target to have a power of 0.80 and <italic>P</italic> value of 0.05. All the statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 17 software (Chicago Inc. Illinois, USA). Data were expressed as mean (standard deviation). Analysis was performed with Chi-square test, Student's <italic>t</italic> test and log-rank test. <italic>P</italic> values of less than 0.05 were considered as significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>The two groups were comparable for age (mean 5.7 [1.5] in Group I vs. 5.4 [1.5] years in Group II), weight (mean 15.4 [2.6] in Group I vs. 15.2 [2.5] kg in Group II) and sex ratio (M: F = 24:1 in both groups), as well as in surgical procedures [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Therefore, a pragmatic practical approach of pediatric pain management has been used in recent years with the introduction of safe and effective techniques.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Ropivacaine is increasingly used in the place of bupivacaine for the single shot caudal analgesia in children because of so called lower side-effects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Several authors have described that efficacy of analgesia produced by ropivacaine is same as bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In this study, we have demonstrated that efficacy of analgesia by caudally administered bupivacaine and ropivacaine were equal in both groups.

Ray <italic>et al</italic>. found similar duration of analgesia in both groups (398 &#x000b1; 23 in bupivacaine vs. 405 &#x000b1; 18 in ropivacaine group).[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] On the contrary Locatelli <italic>et al</italic>. found that analgesic block lasted significantly longer in patients receiving bupivacaine (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03).[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, other authors didn&#x02019;t support this view and found that the average duration of analgesia is same for both drugs.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Some older studies showed that ropivacaine causes less cardiovascular events than bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In our study, hemodynamic parameters, when measured at a specific time intervals, showed no significant difference between two groups. There was no significant cardiac event. In the study of Koinig <italic>et al</italic>., hemodynamic effects of ropivacaine were compared with bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Both groups showed a significant decrease in mean arterial blood pressure and HR from baseline values, but differences between groups were not observed. In the study of Da Conceicao <italic>et al</italic>., the HR and arterial pressure were measured every 5 min after administration of local anesthetic.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] They found no difference between the two groups. These results are comparable with our findings.</p><p>Various studies have stated the prolonged motor blockade associated with bupivacaine in comparison with ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Locatelli <italic>et al</italic>. performed a randomized, double-blind, phase III, controlled trial comparing levobupivacaine 0.25%, ropivacaine 0.25% and bupivacaine 0.25% by the caudal route in children.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Bupivacaine produced a significant incidence of residual motor block compared with levobupivacaine or ropivacaine at wake-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Similarly, Da Conceicao <italic>et al</italic>. studied 60 children, randomly allocated in a double-blind manner, to receive one of two local anesthetics: 0.375% of ropivacaine 1.0 ml/kg or 0.375% bupivacaine 1.0 ml/kg.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The extent of motor block in the recovery room was scored as 1-3. The ropivacaine group showed a shorter duration of motor block than the bupivacaine group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>In the evidence based clinical update published by Dobereiner <italic>et al</italic>., statistical analysis was performed between seventeen RCTs.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It was found that, the incidence of motor blockade was higher with bupivacaine, so they advised that this drug should be administered if motor block is desired and ropivacaine is preferred if motor block is to be minimized. On the contrary, Khalil <italic>et al</italic>. found that ropivacaine (0.25%, 1 ml/kg) provided adequate post-operative analgesia with no difference from bupivacaine (0.25%, 1 ml/kg) in motor and sensory effects.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Ivani <italic>et al</italic>. performed a double-blind multicenter study involving 245 children and found no motor block in either group.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Similarly, Tan <italic>et al</italic>. designed a study to compare the quality of caudal analgesia and incidence of motor blockade produced by these two drugs in pediatric patients scheduled for elective circumcision.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Post-operative pain and motor blockade were assessed by visual analogue and modified Bromage scales respectively. There were no significant differences in pain intensity and degree of motor blockade.</p><p>Some authors showed that ropivacaine undergoes slower systemic absorption from the caudal epidural space in children than does bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] This can attribute to the lower systemic toxicity of ropivacaine.</p><p>There are some limitations of our study. First, it had a small sample size. Though the study is related to pain relief, we couldn&#x02019;t evaluate other problems of caudal analgesia like retention of urine, which is of concern, because of a large portion of patient mainly who undergone urethroplasty and cystolithotomy were catheterized post-operatively. ASA-1 might be another limitation of the study, because the cardiovascular effects are more pronounced or easier to see with children having heart disease and a higher ASA grade.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study confirms that ropivacaine is an effective local anesthetic when given by caudal route in pediatric patients. It produces sensory block similar to bupivacaine but motor block of shorter duration. This finding is useful for children for early post-operative recovery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed similar efficacy of both ropivacaine and bupivacaine in terms of onset and duration of analgesia.
