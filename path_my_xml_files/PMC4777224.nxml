In particular, we tested the soothing and anti-itch effect of Quercevita<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 1% cream for external use, a formulation characterized by a phospholipids-based delivery system.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The study was a monocentric, single blind trial that enrolled a group of 30 healthy volunteers. The back of each subject was examined to identify four quadrants with no previous skin damage or naevi that were treated in order to induce a controlled and reversible form of skin stress. The areas were treated as follows: no product; Quercevita<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1% cream, 2 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>; placebo; positive control (a commercially available topical formulation containing 1% dexchlorpheniramine).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Only quercetin phospholipids 1% and dexchlorpheniramine 1% achieved a significant reduction in erythema with comparable results: (&#x02013;10.05% [<italic>P</italic>=0.00329] for quercetin phospholipids 1% vs &#x02013;14.05% [<italic>P</italic>=0.00046] for the positive control). Moreover, quercetin phospholipids 1% and dexchlorpheniramine 1% were both associated with a significant decrease in mean wheal diameter: (&#x02013;13.25% and &#x02013;12.23% for dexchlorpheniramine 1%, respectively). Similar findings were reported for the other tested parameters.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quercetin has a skin protective effect against damage caused by a variety of insults, including UV radiation, histamine, or contact with toxic chemical compounds. Indeed, quercetin is able to reduce redness, itching, and inflammation of damaged skin; it may also help restore skin barrier function, increasing hydration, and reducing water loss.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Video abstract</title><p>

The soothing effect is visible as a reduction in redness (erythema), wheal diameter, and itching sensation. In addition, our results suggest the ability of this formulation to help restore the skin barrier functions, given the increase in hydration and the reduction in TEWL. The separate effect of the different components &#x02013; quercetin, phospholipids, and well-known antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and tocopherol &#x02013; was not evaluated in this study, since they are synergic in constituting a single active entity.</p><p>The reduction in erythema obtained with quercetin phospholipids 1% was similar to that observed after anti-histaminic treatment (dexchlorpheniramine 1%), used as positive control. Indeed, 4 hours after the application, both treatments were able to achieve a significant reduction in skin redness with comparable values, regardless of the type of agent used as skin irritant. Of note, the highest reduction in erythema was achieved for both treatments after skin exposure to GA, while the lowest effect was registered after UV radiation. The percentage variations in erythema reported for quercetin phospholipids 1% and dexchlorpheniramine 1%, respectively, were: &#x02212;10.05% and &#x02212;14.05% after exposure to UV radiation, &#x02212;17.01% and &#x02212;18.39% after contact with SLS solution, and &#x02212;16.83% and &#x02212;17.80% after contact with GA solution.</p><p>The photoprotective properties of quercetin have been investigated in a number of studies.<xref rid="b21-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b22-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Erden Inal et al<xref rid="b21-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> examined the effect of quercetin on UVA radiation on the skin in an in vivo animal study. They observed that exposure to UVA radiation resulted in oxidative damage to the skin, measured as an increase in the levels of malondialdehyde &#x02013; an end-product of lipid peroxidation &#x02013; and a significant decrease in antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. In rats treated with quercetin, malondialdehyde levels were significantly decreased if compared to rats that received UVA radiation alone, and the reduction in antioxidant enzymes was considerably lower. The authors concluded that treatment with quercetin might have a beneficial effect on skin cells, by protecting them or reducing the harmful effects of UVA irradiation.</p><p>In another study, conducted by Vicentini et al on the skin of hairless mice, quercetin significantly reduced skin damage caused by UVB radiation. The authors observed that daily application of a water/oil microemulsion of quercetin prevented the UVB irradiation-induced depletion of glutathione, one of the most important endogenous mechanisms for protection against UV-induced ROS. In addition, quercetin was able to reduce the secretion/activation of MMPs. These proteinases, whose levels are increased after UV radiation, act by degrading skin collagen and elastin, thus contributing to skin photoaging.<xref rid="b22-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>The results of our study further confirm those previously reported on the anti-oxidant properties of quercetin and on its ability to reduce the oxidative damage caused by UV radiation. However, to our knowledge, this is the first time that the effect of quercetin on the prevention of UV-induced skin damage has been demonstrated in human subjects.</p><p>In our study we also observed that quercetin phospholipids 1% was able to reduce skin irritation caused by chemical agents such as SLS. These results are in contrast with those previously reported by Katsarou et al.<xref rid="b23-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The authors evaluated the effect of quercetin on acute skin irritation induced by SLS 2% solution in 15 patients with contact dermatitis. The results of the study showed that acute inflammation induced by SLS did not significantly improve after treatment with quercetin 7.5% and that erythema and TEWL indexes, after a consistent initial increase, were only slightly reduced after 5 days of quercetin treatment and did not return to baseline levels even after 7 days of therapy.<xref rid="b23-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Conversely, we reported not only a reduction in erythema, but also an improvement in the skin barrier functions, as revealed by the increase in hydration and the decrease in TEWL. Our results suggest that the anti-oxidant activity of quercetin, and in particular the reduction in lipid peroxidation, may have a crucial effect in the restoration of the barrier function of damaged skin. Indeed, lipids in the stratum corneum play an important role for the maintenance of the permeability barrier of the skin, and lipid peroxidation products are known for their toxic effect on mammalian skin cells.<xref rid="b24-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The differences observed between our and Katsarou et al&#x02019;s study may lay in the different concentrations of the agents used (SLS 1% vs 2%) or in the fact that, although the concentration of quercetin used by Katsarou et al was higher than that utilized in our study, the lack of an appropriate delivery system might have hampered the skin permeability of the molecule. Moreover, the different experimental and evaluation protocols followed have largely contributed to the observed discrepancy between our results and theirs.</p><p>The results observed after contact with GA solution are similar to those reported for SLS. To our knowledge no previous studies have investigated the activity of quercetin on skin irritation induced by this chemical agent.</p><p>Lastly, in our study quercetin phospholipids 1% displayed anti-histaminic properties, with a reduction in mean wheal diameter and itching after histamine prick test comparable to that achieved by the positive control (dexchlorpheniramine maleate). The anti-allergic effect of quercetin has been suggested by a number of in vitro and animal studies that showed its inhibitory action on the secretory response of activated mast cells<xref rid="b25-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and on the release of histamine from basophils.<xref rid="b27-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>Of note, we conducted a separate in vitro study to assess the activity of Quercevita<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in inhibiting basophil degranulation in rodent cells. Degranulation was stimulated with a cross-linking of the IgE human receptor (FcRI) with a specific polyclonal antibody and was assessed by measuring the release of &#x003b2;-hexosaminidase &#x02013; a mediator secreted after basophils&#x02019; activation. The inhibitory activity of Quercevita<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was compared to that obtained with hyaluronic acid (positive control). Quercevita<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> resulted in an effective and dose-dependent inhibition of basophil degranulation, up to a level of 83.6% (at 10 &#x000b5;g/mL), compared to 79.2% obtained with the positive control.<xref rid="b29-ccid-9-055" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>These results suggest that quercetin exerts a dual anti-allergy action: on one hand it inhibits the release of histamine from basophil cells; on the other, if histamine is present, it reduces skin redness and itching caused by histamine. These activities, combined with the anti-inflammatory action exerted by quercetin and the inhibition of cytokine production, might account for the reduction in skin irritation observed in our study. These results prompt future study to investigate the skin protective effect of quercetin on skin damage related to allergic reactions. In addition, it would be useful to explore other potential delivery methods (eg, nanoparticles, pending a proper and careful assessment of their safety in line with European Union requirements).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall the results of our study suggest that Quercevita<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 1% has a skin protective effect against damage caused by a variety of insults, including UV radiation, histamine, or contact with toxic chemical compounds. Indeed, this formulation is able to reduce redness, itching, and inflammation of damaged skin; in addition it may help restore skin barrier function, increasing hydration, and reducing water loss. These effects are achieved mainly due to the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of quercetin, enabling it to scavenge free radicals and reduce the oxidative damage caused by UV radiation, decrease lipid peroxidation, and inhibit the production of inflammatory enzymes and other cytokines.</p><p>Moreover, quercetin exhibits anti-allergic properties, as it reduces irritation and itching caused by histamine prick test. This activity adds to the inhibitory effect exerted by quercetin on basophil degranulation and consequential histamine release.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study where the multiple properties of quercetin on skin soothing and protection have been reported in human subjects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Editorial assistance was provided by Ambra Corti; this assistance was supported by internal funds.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>GM, ST, and IP are employees of Indena S.p.A; LG is a consultant of Indena S.p.A.
