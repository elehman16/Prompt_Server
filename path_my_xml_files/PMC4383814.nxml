MCD has a poor prognosis, and treatment is generally noncurative and aimed at symptom relief. Siltuximab is a novel, monoclonal interleukin-6 antibody recently shown to be effective in a registration clinical trial. MCD symptoms, such as fatigue, pain, and weakness, are most appropriately quantified using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures.

Interleukin (IL)-6 plays a central role in the pathophysiology of MCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Secretion of the cytokine in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive cases is typically driven by human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8), which encodes viral IL-6. The mechanisms underlying HIV-negative MCD pathogenesis have not been conclusively elucidated. It has been proposed that a subclass of HIV-negative and HHV-8-negative MCD patients, with unknown etiology and pathophysiology, be referred to as displaying idiopathic disease (iMCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Signs and symptoms in MCD are multisystemic, and may include lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, pleural effusion, edema, fever, pain, sweats, pruritus, sensory neuropathy, anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In many patients, MCD is a debilitating disease and, in severe cases, multiorgan failure and death can occur.</p><p>As an orphan disease with no accepted standard of care, treatment of MCD is typically aimed at symptom management. Surgical resection, while often curative in unicentric Castleman&#x02019;s disease, is unfeasible given the systemic nature of MCD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Due to the progressive nature of MCD, a variety of therapies commonly used for lymphoproliferative malignancies (either as single agents or as combination regimens) have been used, but results have only been provided as case reports and small series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Siltuximab, a novel anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, was recently tested in patients with HIV-negative, HHV-8-negative MCD in a 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;79) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Patients treated with siltuximab showed a significantly greater durable tumor and symptom response compared with placebo (34&#x000a0;% versus 0&#x000a0;%; <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0012). On the basis of this study, siltuximab was recently approved in the United States and the European Union, and is indicated for the treatment of patients with MCD who are HIV- and HHV-8&#x02013;negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a single-arm study, blockade of the IL-6-signaling cascade with tocilizumab, an antibody against the IL-6 receptor, proved effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Tocilizumab has been approved for treatment of MCD in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The subjective symptomatology of MCD, such as fatigue and weakness, is difficult to measure using standard laboratory tests or clinical tools. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures best capture the presence and severity of these symptoms. Although there are well-established PRO instruments that measure aspects of functional status and wellbeing relevant to MCD, most do not capture the full spectrum of symptoms encountered by MCD patients. Therefore, we engaged in the development of a symptom questionnaire specific to MCD.</p><p>Based on the US Food and Drug Administration&#x02019;s guidance on best practices for the development and selection of PRO instruments for use in clinical trial settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the Multicentric Castleman&#x02019;s Disease&#x02013;Symptom Scale (MCD&#x02013;SS) was developed to assess a patient&#x02019;s perception of severity of MCD-related symptoms. The instrument design was based on literature reviews, concept elicitation and cognitive debriefing interviews conducted in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MCD, and feedback from clinical topic experts. Details of this development process and testing process are reported in the Electronic Supplementary Material and elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The objective of the present study was to assess the patient&#x02019;s perception of MCD symptoms, functional status, and wellbeing relative to treatment in the context of the aforementioned siltuximab randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>The data reported here are from a registration study evaluating the efficacy and safety of siltuximab in MCD, which included a secondary objective of demonstrating efficacy through improvement in fatigue, physical function, and other disease-related symptoms. Detailed methods were reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing siltuximab plus best supportive care with placebo plus best supportive care (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01024036). The primary endpoint was durable tumor and symptomatic response for at least 18&#x000a0;weeks for the intention-to-treat population.</p><p>All eligible patients were 18&#x000a0;years or older and had measurable and symptomatic MCD, adequate organ function as assessed by laboratory studies, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;3, and corticosteroid use not exceeding 1&#x000a0;mg/kg/day of prednisone that had remained stable or decreased in the 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to treatment. Patients were excluded if they were HIV-positive or HHV-8-positive, had skin lesions as the sole manifestation of MCD, had a disease that may have interfered with study participation, or had prior exposure to specific IL-6- or IL-6 receptor-targeted therapies. A history of malignancy, other than lymphoma, from which the patient had been disease-free for 3 or more years was acceptable.</p><p>Seventy-nine subjects were randomized to the siltuximab (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;53) or placebo arms (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;26) in a 2:1 ratio via permuted blocks stratified by corticosteroid use at baseline. Participants were treated intravenously with 11&#x000a0;mg/kg siltuximab or placebo infusions, respectively, every 3&#x000a0;weeks. Patients continued treatment until treatment failure. Both arms also received best supportive care for MCD. These supportive measures included management of effusions (e.g., drainage, diuretics) and infections (e.g., antibiotics, oral or topical antifungals, and antiviral treatment except for ganciclovir), antipyretics, antipruritics, antihistamines, pain medication, transfusions, and treatment of infusion-related reactions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>PRO Instruments</title><p>Three self-administered questionnaires were used to comprehensively assess patient perceptions of symptoms, functional status, and wellbeing. All PROs were collected on paper and were administered to the patients prior to any other procedures. One of these instruments, the MCD-SS, was newly developed to assess a patient&#x02019;s perception of MCD-related symptom severity and response to therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The MCD&#x02013;SS is a 16-item questionnaire consisting of four items in the <italic>Fatigue</italic> domain (tiredness, fatigue, lack of energy, feeling weak), two items in the <italic>Rash/Itching</italic> domain (sores/rash on skin, itch), two items in the <italic>Sweats</italic> domain (night sweats, daytime sweating), and eight items that are not categorized to a domain (cough, shortness of breath, fever, loss of appetite, numbness or tingling, pain, swollen lymph nodes, swelling or edema). The respondent was asked to recall the previous 24 hours and choose the response best capturing symptom severity on a 6-point verbal rating scale [very mild (score&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4), or very severe (5), plus a &#x0201c;did not experience&#x0201d; response option scored as 0]. The MCD&#x02013;SS domain scores were the sum of the individual domain items rescaled to a range of 0&#x02013;10, with higher scores representing greater symptom severity. An MCD&#x02013;SS total score was calculated from the <italic>Fatigue</italic>, <italic>Rash/Itching</italic>, and <italic>Sweats</italic> domains and seven of the eight items that were not categorized to a domain. Fever was excluded from total score calculations because it was determined that it was better assessed using actual temperature data rather than by patient reports. Thus, the total score denominator was ten to account for the seven individual items and the three domain scores. Further details are included in the Electronic Supplementary Material.</p><p>The Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy&#x02013;Fatigue (FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue) is a 13-item patient-reported measure of fatigue that has been validated in cancer patients and the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Subjects respond to each statement based on experiences from the previous week using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Scores can range from 0 to 52, with low total scores representing greater fatigue severity and impact of fatigue on daily activities. Based on results comparing fatigue in cancer patients with the general US population, the general population mean for the FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue was found to be 43.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]; this was rounded up to 44 as a threshold score in later analyses.</p><p>The MCD&#x02013;SS and FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue instruments were assessed at Days 1, 8, and 15 of treatment Cycle 1, and on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle.</p><p>Subjects also completed the Short Form (SF)-36, a 36-item assessment consisting of eight domains (physical functioning, role limitations due to physical health, bodily pain, general health perceptions, vitality, social functioning, role limitations due to emotional problems, and general mental health) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A physical component summary (PCS) score and mental component summary (MCS) score may also be calculated. Scores for each domain and the two summary scales can range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing better health. This instrument has been validated in multiple conditions, including hematologic cancers, and normative scores are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. SF-36 was assessed on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, and Day 1 of every three subsequent cycles.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses consisted of a combination of prespecified and ad hoc assessments. Prespecified analyses of repeated measures were conducted comparing the areas under the curve (AUC), adjusted for baseline, for each PRO measure over the first 18 cycles of treatment. Estimates were obtained from a mixed-effects model that included fixed-effect variables of treatment group, corticosteroid use (the stratification factor) and cycle, the interaction between treatment group and cycle, and the subject random effects of intercept and slope with an unstructured variance&#x02013;covariance matrix. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using data from the first 12 cycles. The same analyses were performed with MCD&#x02013;SS <italic>Fatigue</italic> domain results in patients with moderate or severe fatigue at baseline, defined as having a response of at least moderate (i.e., &#x0201c;moderate,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;severe,&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;very severe&#x0201d;) on one or more of the four items composing the MCD&#x02013;SS <italic>Fatigue</italic> domain.</p><p>The best durable response, defined as the best observed score that was sustained for 120&#x000a0;days (approximately 18&#x000a0;weeks or 6 cycles) during the treatment period or until the end of the treatment period, was assessed for the FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue instrument as an ad hoc analysis. Using a threshold of 44 or greater on the FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue as a normal level of fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the percentage of patients in each treatment group that had an abnormal baseline FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue score and had a durable response to values above the normal level was assessed and compared using a chi-square test.</p><p>The MCD&#x02013;SS was a newly developed scale for use in assessing symptoms of a rare condition, and data were not available to evaluate a meaningful change outside of the clinical trial. Thus, it was assumed that a distribution-based criterion of 0.5 standard deviation (SD) of the baseline value could be employed as the definition of a responder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In a prespecified analysis, cumulative distribution function curves were plotted by treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], showing the proportion of subjects who achieved a change from baseline of greater than or equal to the threshold. These curves used each subject&#x02019;s best change score observed during the treatment period; the durability of this change was not evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Patients and Baseline Characteristics</title><p>A total of 79 patients were recruited for the registration study of siltuximab in MCD, with 53 randomized to the siltuximab treatment group and 26 randomized to the placebo group. All patients received the treatment to which they were randomized. The first patient signed informed consent on February 9, 2010, and the final patient&#x02019;s last visit for the primary analysis was on February 28, 2013. In general, demographic and baseline characteristics of subjects were similar among treatment groups, except that there were more males in the placebo arm (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The median age across both treatment groups was 48&#x000a0;years (range 20&#x02013;78&#x000a0;years), and the median weight for both groups combined was 69&#x000a0;kg (range 42&#x02013;121&#x000a0;kg).

In its 2009 guidance, the US Food and Drug Administration noted that the &#x0201c;use of a PRO instrument is advised when measuring a concept best known by the patient or best measured from the patient perspective&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Moreover, it has been argued that such patient-reported measures should be a standard part of drug registration trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>MCD is a chronic and debilitating disease, and we incorporated PRO tools in the clinical trial design to evaluate the effect of siltuximab on a patient&#x02019;s wellbeing. During this randomized, double-blind clinical trial analysis of exploratory endpoints, we found improvements in symptoms, as perceived by participants receiving siltuximab compared with those receiving placebo, through the use of a recently designed PRO instrument for MCD symptom burden (the MCD&#x02013;SS) as well as previously established instruments. Our assessments demonstrated early and consistent improvement over time in the siltuximab arm compared with patients receiving best supportive care alone, as measured by the MCD&#x02013;SS, FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue, and SF-36 instruments.</p><p>Using the MCD&#x02013;SS, FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue, and SF-36 vitality (the only SF-36 domain that measures fatigue) instruments, we found that fatigue was a key symptom from the patient&#x02019;s perspective. It is noteworthy that improvements in fatigue among siltuximab-treated subjects not only occurred early in the course of treatment, but were also durable. Furthermore, the ability of siltuximab to confer durable improvements in fatigue was confirmed by the subgroup analysis that focused on the more severely fatigued patients. The importance of fatigue, identified by patient-reported measures, contrasts with the clinician-reported scores that included elements of overall symptom burden, such as fluid retention, neuropathy, and dermatologic symptoms. These may have effectively diluted the impact of fatigue on the clinician-reported symptom score.</p><p>Improvements in areas other than fatigue were also noted, including five of the eight SF-36 domains, providing broad support for improving patient functioning and wellbeing with siltuximab. We also found an improvement in mental health, as evidenced by a highly significant change in the SF-36 MCS score in the siltuximab group as compared with best supportive care. This is notable in the context of previous research, which demonstrated an association between depression and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Further exploration of the components of the SF-36 that contribute to the apparent improvement in mental health and their associations with inhibition of systemic IL-6 levels may be warranted.</p><p>Determining the clinical meaning of patient-reported findings remains a challenge. The MCD&#x02013;SS has not been used outside of a controlled trial setting. Consequently, score interpretation strategy and application of results to MCD management may not yet be ideal. Our threshold of 1.0 as a meaningful change in MCD&#x02013;SS was calculated from the SD of assessment scores, showing a distinct difference in meaningful change between siltuximab and control groups. However, further testing of the MCD&#x02013;SS is required, and its use in non-trial conditions may allow the threshold for meaningful change to take on clinical significance. In clinical situations, FACIT&#x02013;Fatigue may allow a more rapid assessment of one of the defining features of MCD and its response to therapy, with a more comprehensive assessment provided by the MCD&#x02013;SS.</p><p>We acknowledge limitations of this study, due both to factors related to the study design and inherent limitations of PRO research. The MCD-SS was the first PRO scale developed for the disease, and there may have been other symptoms that were not represented in the instrument that may have contributed to the overall assessment of response. As patients were lost due to disease progression, the PRO assessments for each time point were represented by fewer patients. Because MCD is a rare condition, our sample size was limited. Moreover, MCD is often associated with concurrent disease states. The exclusion of subjects with other health conditions, including HIV, limits the ability to extrapolate our results directly to other subpopulations of patients with MCD.</p><p>Future research will likely explicate the utility of siltuximab in improving patient functioning and wellbeing. Analysis of siltuximab in subgroups of MCD patients is warranted, as our results suggest that patients with more burdensome MCD symptoms, such as severe fatigue, may experience greater improvements with siltuximab therapy than patients with less severe symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Given the subjective nature of most symptoms associated with MCD, patient-reported assessments represent an essential component of measuring the impact of disease and treatments. Improvement of symptoms by an effective therapy may be a key aspect of MCD management. Siltuximab, a novel anti-IL-6 antibody, is associated with early and consistent improvement in fatigue, functioning, and wellbeing. Given that MCD is treated primarily through symptom management, these findings support the use of siltuximab for this orphan disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="40271_2015_120_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOCX 540 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the patients who participated in this study, and the investigators and their colleagues who cared for them.
