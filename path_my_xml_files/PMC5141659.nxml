Improved techniques coupled with holistic understanding of regional anatomy backed by improvements in local anesthesia (LA) have almost brought us to the brink at which, we can state that oral procedures are relatively safe with least risk of complications. However, there has been a weak cornerstone of these otherwise comfortable procedures. The weak cornerstones we are referring to are fear and anxiety. One of the most common dental procedures associated with preoperative anxiety is the removal of a third molar.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Although it is debatable that fear and anxiety are relative factors, it is beyond doubt that these reflect as changes in vital parameters of the patient which includes blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation and in turn act as early warning signs for a number of medical emergencies.</p><p>Well, nothing can determine the strength and importance of a doctor&#x02013;patient relationship in reducing fear and anxiety. Having said this, newer pharmacological modalities of anxiety reduction with the use of anxiolytics are now being largely explored to counter fear and anxiety. Use of a single dose premedication as a sedative can allay the fear and anxiety in a patient.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Our study tries to understand and explore the use of oral alprazolam in reducing fear and anxiety, thus making the procedure more safe and comfortable and improving patient compliance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was initiated after clearance from the Institutional Ethics Committee.

The control of fear, anxiety, and pain is an essential part of dental practice. In spite of technological advances in dentistry, fear and anxiety continue to plague the common man. Anxiety is not a unifactorial entity. It is an emotional state, which has a direct pertinence on the physiological and psychological makeup of an individual. Missing the appointments and uncooperative attitude toward the treatment are some of the sequelae of this problem, thus, adding to the misery and making the patient suffer further from the existing pathological conditions.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The use of sedative techniques is increasing, mainly due to patient demand and also the realization by the surgeon that the procedures performed are much improved if the patient is relaxed and cooperative. Chen <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to evaluate the effects of brief mindfulness meditation on the anxiety and depression symptoms and autonomic nervous system activity in Chinese nursing students. He correlated anxiety of the patient on the basis of self-rating anxiety scale and SBP.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Morarend <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study using respiratory rate novel biofeedback device to reduce preoperative general anxiety and study the consequent reduction in pain associated with dental injections.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In our comparative study, the effect of an anxiolytic agent - tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg, on vital parameters such as SBP, DBP, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were studied in various phases of a surgical procedure. These parameters were similar to a study carried out by Knight and Rickard; however, they assessed the effect of relaxing music on participants&#x02019; subjective and physiological response to stress.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The purpose of monitoring vital signs is 2-fold. It serves to control depth and response to the sedation given, i.e., the degree of physiological trespass, and to warn of impending disasters, most of which occur infrequently and are therefore unexpected. The monitoring techniques most frequently used in anesthesia include electrocardiography and noninvasive blood pressure monitoring which primarily are of value in the control of depth of sedation when patient sedated with midazolam. They, however, are of little value for the early detection of potentially disastrous situations. In any critical situation, time elapses between the detection of the problem, the identification of the cause and its correction, during which damage to the patient may occur. Delay in any of these phases increases the likelihood of injury. Thus, both early detection and a prompt response are important if any disaster is to be averted. In our study, anxiety is assessed as changes in vital parameters with the help of Truscope mini Multipara Monitor. A similar study was conducted by Abbas Ali Khademani to assess the effect of preoperative alprazolam on the success of inferior alveolar nerve block for teeth with irreversible pulpitis. Alprazolam has a fast onset of action, and approximately 90% of peak benefits are achieved within the 1<sup>st</sup> h after use.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In clinical terms, therapeutic effects of sublingual and oral doses of alprazolam are the same.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Chouinard <italic>et al</italic>. carried a double-blind controlled study lasting 8 weeks, fifty anxious psychoneurotic outpatients with a primary diagnosis of generalized anxiety or panic disorder were randomly assigned to alprazolam (<italic>n</italic> = 30), a new benzodiazepine, or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 20), after a washout period of 1 week. Alprazolam at dosages between 0.25 and 3 mg/day was found to be significantly better than placebo in the treatment of either disorder.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Rickels <italic>et al</italic>. carried out a similar study comparing the anxiolytic effects of alprazolam and placebo in 151 anxious outpatients. Alprazolam and diazepam produced similar clinical improvement, which was significantly larger than the improvement produced by placebo and was clearly evident after only 1 week of treatment. The incidence of sedation was lower with alprazolam than with diazepam.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we evaluated vital parameters during third molar surgery. Meechan and Seymour in 1993 suggested various sequelae that arise after third molar surgery and their use for assessing the efficacy of a variety of therapeutic measure. The surgical procedure provides an opportunity to investigate onset, depth, duration, and possible systemic effects of local anesthetic solutions. Furthermore, the anxiety which often accompanies such surgery lends itself to the appraisal of different anxiolytic agents and sedation techniques. The immediate postoperative sequelae of pain, buccal swelling, and trismus provide a useful clinical model for evaluating the efficacy of analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Arakeri and Arali say transient loss of consciousness or vasovagal syncope is a well-known phenomenon in dental/maxillofacial surgery.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Hypoxia commonly arises in dental patients during and after surgery. This dangerous condition requires the clinician to monitor patients&#x02019; vital signs - specifically pulse rate and blood oxygen content - for any signal of trouble. A technique called pulse oximetry offers a noninvasive, immediate, and continuously available means of accomplishing this.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In our study, patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria were taken up for the study and randomly divided into control group and test group. We observed that preoperative vital parameters of patients on the day of surgical removal of impacted third molars were slightly increased as compared to their baseline measurement. In the test group patients, vital parameters exhibited minimal fluctuation all through the surgical steps unlike in the control group where there was fluctuation at LA, incision, bone guttering, and tooth elevation steps. Thus, use of preoperative tablet alprazolam 0.5 mg orally for reduction of patients&#x02019; anxiety, increases patient cooperation and operator efficiency. Oral premedication with benzodiazepines or other antianxiety agents is considered for patients who are needle phobic with documented psychological and physiological complications.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Furthermore, constant monitoring of vital parameters helps us to prevent unwanted emergency which includes syncope.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis method</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Analysis</title><p>

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Surgical procedures under LA require a lot of cooperation from the patient, as they are aware of their surroundings. The patient may make interpretations of visual and auditory stimulus, depending on his existing anxiety level, which may affect the patients&#x02019; blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. In our study, it was observed that patients of the test group receiving oral alprazolam 0.5 mg showed better cooperation. This in turn made procedures more comfortable for the operator as well as the patient. The statistical analysis confirmed the clinical equivalence of reduction in anxiety of a patient who underwent the surgery using an antianxiety drug preoperatively. This was reflected as reduced fluctuation of vital parameters in the test group.</p><p>In the control group, preoperative apprehension and anxiety seem to have continued during the procedure as well. The rise in the SBP, pulse, and respiratory rate at bone guttering and tooth elevation was noted in the control group unlike in the test group. This was found to be statistically significant in this study. Although it is easier said than done, surely if not categorically through the study, we can state that anxiolytics such as alprazolam counter the negative effects of fear and anxiety which is proved by minimal fluctuation from baseline vital parameters. Although it is beyond doubt that doctor&#x02013;patient relationship is the foreground for any successful procedure, drugs such as alprazolam act as a perfect adjunct to a successful surgery under LA.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lago-M&#x000e9;ndez</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Diniz-Freitas</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Senra-Rivera</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Seoane-Pesqueira</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>G&#x000e1;ndara-Rey</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Garcia-Garcia</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dental anxiety before removal of a third molar and association with general trait anxiety</article-title><source>J Oral Maxillofac Surg</source><year>2006</year><volume>64</volume><fpage>1404</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16916676</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dawson</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name><name><surname>Jue</surname><given-names>SG</given-names></name><name><surname>Brogden</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Alprazolam: A review of its pharmacodynamic properties and efficacy in the treatment of anxiety and depression</article-title><source>Drugs</source><year>1984</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>132</fpage><lpage>47</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6141930</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Malamed</surname><given-names>SF</given-names></name></person-group><source>Sedation: A Guide to Patient Management</source><year>2003</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>New York</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Mosby</publisher-name><fpage>126</fpage><lpage>65</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A randomized controlled trial of the effects of brief mindfulness meditation on anxiety symptoms and systolic blood pressure in Chinese nursing students</article-title><source>Nurse Educ Today</source><year>2013</year><volume>33</volume><fpage>1166</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23260618</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Morarend</surname><given-names>QA</given-names></name><name><surname>Spector</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Dawson</surname><given-names>DV</given-names></name><name><surname>Clark</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The use of a respiratory rate biofeedback device to reduce dental anxiety: An exploratory investigation</article-title><source>Appl Psychophysiol Biofeedback</source><year>2011</year><volume>36</volume><fpage>63</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21365307</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Knight</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name><name><surname>Rickard</surname><given-names>NS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Relaxing music prevents stress-induced increases in subjective anxiety, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate in healthy males and females</article-title><source>J Music Ther</source><year>2001</year><volume>38</volume><fpage>254</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11796077</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Greenblatt</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Wright</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical pharmacokinetics of alprazolam.
