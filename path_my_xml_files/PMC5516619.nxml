However, efficacy and safety in the Asian population has not yet been demonstrated. In this open-label study, efficacy and safety of LCIG were assessed in Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese advanced PD patients with motor complications not adequately controlled by available PD medication. The patients were treated with LCIG monotherapy for 12 weeks. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline to week 12 in &#x02018;off&#x02019; time, as reported in the PD Symptom Diary, normalized to a 16&#x02009;h waking day and analyzed by a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Thirty-one patients were enrolled (23 Japanese, 4 Taiwanese, 4 Korean) and 28 (90%) completed the study. For those who completed the study, the mean (s.d.) total daily levodopa dose from LCIG was 1,206.3 (493.6)&#x02009;mg/day at final visit (<italic>n</italic>=28); last observation carried forward (<italic>n</italic>=30) was 1,227.6 (482.8)&#x02009;mg/day. There was a significant mean change (s.d.) of &#x02212;4.6 (3.0) hours of &#x02018;off&#x02019; time from baseline (mean (s.d.)=7.4 (2.3)) to week 12 (<italic>n</italic>=29), <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001. All the patients had an AE, with the most frequently reported being incision site pain (42%); 1 (3.2%) discontinued treatment because of an AE and later died because of sepsis, which the investigator considered unrelated to LCIG treatment. These results suggest that LCIG is efficacious and tolerable in Japanese, Taiwanese, and Korean advanced PD patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Although oral levodopa is the primary treatment for Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD), prolonged use is associated with the development of motor complications, such as dyskinesias and &#x02018;on&#x02019;/&#x02018;off&#x02019; fluctuations, that can often be problematic with advancing disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> These motor complications are due, in part, to a continual loss of dopaminergic neurons, as well as effects of the short half-life of levodopa and gastric emptying leading to non-physiologic pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> As PD progresses, the therapeutic window narrows, and there is an increase in motor complications associated with high and low plasma levodopa concentrations from frequent, intermittent exposure to oral levodopa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4 bib5 bib6 bib7">4&#x02013;7</xref></sup></p><p>Levodopa&#x02013;carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG; known in Japan as ABT-SLV187, and in the United States as carbidopa&#x02013;levodopa enteral suspension) provides continuous levodopa infusion directly into the proximal small intestine via percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J), and reduces fluctuations in plasma concentrations of levodopa.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> In a prior 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of LCIG in advanced PD patients, LCIG treatment reduced the mean &#x02018;off&#x02019; time by 4.04&#x02009;h per day from baseline to final, which was significant compared with oral levodopa&#x02013;carbidopa immediate release (LC-IR) therapy (mean change=&#x02212;2.14&#x02009;h per day).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> In that double-blind study and additional open-label studies, LCIG was well tolerated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10 bib11 bib12">10&#x02013;12</xref></sup> Safety data from these studies were integrated, and the overall rate of discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) was 17% of patients over a median exposure period of 911 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> Although these studies were multinational, the advanced PD patient populations were primarily (at least 92%) Caucasian.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p><p>Similar to Caucasian populations, cross-sectional and retrospective studies have confirmed that motor fluctuations are prevalent in Asian PD patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14 bib15 bib16 bib17 bib18">14&#x02013;18</xref></sup> However, Asian PD patients develop dyskinesias more frequently than Caucasians,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and two retrospective studies indicated that Japanese females have a shorter onset of wearing-off and dyskinesia than Japanese males.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Asian PD patients have required 20&#x02013;30% lower doses of oral levodopa to control PD symptoms,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> which may reflect a difference in BMI and under treatment of Asian PD patients overall.

Both the patients recovered.</p><p>Of the four patients who had one or more serious AE, two had serious AEs that were considered unrelated to the treatment system; one had melena on day 11 and later recovered; and the other was an 83-year-old female who had a femur fracture on day 25 (last LCIG dose on day 26), developed severe pneumonia aspiration on day 62, severe sepsis on day 64, and disseminated intravascular coagulation on day 65. She died because of sepsis on day 86; investigators did not consider the death (one patient, 3.2%) to have a reasonable possibility of being related to LCIG treatment.

Although a previous pharmacokinetic study of LCIG in Japanese patients has shown that continuous infusion of levodopa results in reduced fluctuation index,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> this is the first study to assess the efficacy and safety of LCIG in a larger Asian population. In this prospective open-label study, Asian advanced PD patients with motor complications not adequately controlled by available anti-Parkinsonian medication were enrolled. In this patient population, LCIG infusion replaced oral levodopa and other anti-Parkinsonian medication.</p><p>At most time points, continuous LCIG infusion led to a significant improvement in &#x02018;off&#x02019; time without an increase in &#x02018;on&#x02019; time with TSD. The improvements in motor fluctuations were consistent with a prior 12-week double-blind study and 54-week open-label study, in which the majority of advanced PD patients were Caucasian and showed significant improvements in &#x02018;off&#x02019; time and &#x02018;on&#x02019; time without TSD within the first 12 weeks of LCIG treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p><p>The improvement in &#x02018;off&#x02019; time was, in general, independent of gender, age, and ethnicity. There were no clinically meaningful differences in &#x02018;off&#x02019; time between Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese advanced PD patients. Although the reduction in &#x02018;off&#x02019; time in Taiwanese PD patients was not statistically significant, the sample size was small.</p><p>The improvements in motor symptoms coincided with improvement in the quality of life in Asian PD patients. The decrease (improvement) in the UPDRS Part II score was not statistically significant, which was inconsistent with the significant improvements in the activities of daily living domain of the PDQ-39 and PDQ-39 summary index. However, responses on the Patient Global Impression of Change indicated that the majority of patients believed they had improved quality of life at the end of the study, which supported the PDQ-39 results. Clinician-rated Clinical Global Impression of Change responses further demonstrated that all but one patient had improved quality of life.</p><p>The safety profile of LCIG in Asian advanced PD patients is consistent with previous open-label studies in which the majority of advanced PD patients had an AE.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> The most common AEs were primarily related to the procedure or gastrointestinal tract, mild to moderate in severity, and known complications of the PEG-J placement procedure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> Some gastrointestinal procedure AEs, such as gastrointestinal perforation, can be life-threatening; however, all serious AEs in this study that were considered to be possibly related to LCIG treatment were resolved. The most common AEs that were not related to the procedure or gastrointestinal tract are associated with levodopa exposure (dyskinesia, increased blood homocysteine), underlying PD (fall, dyskinesia), and the elderly population.</p><p>Although all patients had an AE, the most common AEs that occurred in each ethnic subgroup varied. It is very likely that this variation is because of the imbalance in sample size among the ethnic subgroups, as none of the variations were considered clinically meaningful. This study was limited by the relatively small sample size, particularly in the Korean and Taiwanese patients. The study was open-label and only levodopa-responsive patients were included, which may have introduced selection bias to the outcomes.</p><p>Despite the high incidence of AEs in this study, the discontinuation rate because of AEs (3.2%) was low and similar to a double-blind study with a similar sample size and duration, which supports the overall tolerability of LCIG in Asian advanced PD patients. This is the first study to demonstrate safety and efficacy of LCIG in Asian advanced PD patients, and further substantiates the robust and consistent nature of LCIG treatment in the general advanced PD population.<sup>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup></p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The efficacy and safety of LCIG were evaluated in a Phase 3, 12-week, single-arm, open-label, baseline-controlled, multicenter study in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (NCT01960842/JapicCTI-142431) from October 2013 to March 2015.

Total enrollment of 32 was determined on the basis of the assumption that 20% of patients would not have post-baseline PD Diary assessments or prematurely discontinue.</p><p>The baseline was defined as the last non-missing observation before the patients converted to LC-IR monotherapy. The final was defined as the last non-missing observation that was no more than 1 day after the last infusion of LCIG. The daily levodopa dose included the morning, continuous maintenance, and extra doses of LCIG, but not LC-IR taken at night.</p><p>The safety was analyzed in all the patients who underwent the NJ placement procedure. The efficacy was analyzed in patients who received at least one dose of LCIG via PEG-J with at least one post-baseline measurement of at least one efficacy measure.</p><p>Daily totals in the PD Diary were normalized to 16&#x02009;h waking hours and averaged for the 3 days before the visit. The primary end point in all the patients and subgroups defined by ethnicity were analyzed using a one-sample, two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test. After statistical significance (<italic>P</italic>&#x02a7d;0.050) was demonstrated on the primary end point, secondary measures were tested in a hierarchical order (see efficacy section) until the analysis failed to demonstrate statistical significance. For the majority of secondary efficacy measures, the change from baseline to each time point was evaluated by a mixed-model repeated-measures analysis, which included fixed effects of ethnicity and visit, baseline value as a covariate, and baseline&#x000d7;visit interaction. The Clinical Global Impression of Change and Patient Global Impression of Change scores were tested with a two-sided, one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared with the null hypothesis of a mean score of 4 (no change).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the contributions of the study investigators Dr Takashi Nakajima of National Hospital Organization Niigata National Hospital, Dr Ryosuke Takahashi of Kyoto University Hospital, Dr Yasushi Shimo of Juntendo University Hospital, Dr Takashi Kimura of National Hospital Organization Asahikawa Medical Center, Dr Chin-Song Lu of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Dr Ruey-Meei Wu of National Taiwan University Hospital.
