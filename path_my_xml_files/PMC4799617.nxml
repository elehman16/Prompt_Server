The situation &#x0201c;cannot intubate, cannot ventilate&#x0201d; is life-threatening and, if not properly managed, can end in brain damage or even death.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Since its design in 1941 by Sir Robert Reynolds Macintosh, the Macintosh laryngoscope has been widely used for endotracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, other airway devices have been developed to deal with difficult intubation.</p><p>Optical stylets have been used for more than 20 years by ear-nose-throat (ENT) surgeons.

It is a 40-cm-long, semi-rigid optical stylet with an external diameter of 5.0 mm and a fixed anterior tip curvature of 40&#x000b0;. The endotracheal tube is fixed by a cone-shaped adaptor that has a side port. The side port can be used for oxygen insufflation or local anesthetic instillation. The intubator can directly use the scope's eyepiece or use an attached monitor to visualize the airway. The monitor enables teaching, sharing opinions, and documenting the procedure.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a)Bonfils Retromolar Intubation Fiberscope &#x000a9;Karl Storz-Endoskope, Germany.

The Hamad Medical Corporation Research Committee granted approval (RC/0924/2009) number 8190/08.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were as follows: Mallampati IV, thyromental distance (TM distance) &#x02264;4 cm, mouth opening &#x0003c;4 cm, cervical spine problems, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35, sleep apnea, age of &#x0003c;16 or &#x0003e;60 years, reflux esophagitis, a history of coronary artery disease, intracranial vascular malformation, elevated intracranial pressure, bleeding disorders, allergies to any of the planned anesthetic agents, and patient refusal.</p><p>During the preoperative visit, patients were classified according to the modified Mallampati test by maximally protruding their tongues from a fully open mouth while sitting upright.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The TM distance was measured as a straight line from the thyroid notch to the most anterior part of the chin with the head fully extended.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Additionally, age, sex (male/female), height, weight, and BMI were collected for every patient. Finally, the degree of mouth opening and neck mobility were assessed. Both airway management techniques were explained to patients, and written consents were obtained.</p><p>All patients received midazolam 0.1 mg/kg and glycopyrrolate 0.2 mg IM 30 min prior to surgery. Before induction of anesthesia, the patients were randomly assigned (using a randomization computer program) to receive either fiberoptic intubation using the Bonfils scope (Group B, <italic>n</italic> = 30) or Macintosh laryngoscopy (Group M, <italic>n</italic> = 30).</p><p>Anesthesia equipment, drugs, and airway management devices were prepared. The standard monitors were connected including: O<sub>2</sub>, HR, SBP, DBP and MBP which were recorded just before intubation. Mask oxygen at 10 L/min was provided for 3 min. Anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, propofol 2 mg/kg, and cisatracurium 0.16 mg/kg. Positive pressure ventilation with 3% sevoflurane in 100% oxygen was provided for 3 min using a face mask and oropharyngeal airway. Bonfils and Macintosh intubation were performed by two experienced anesthesiologists. Each had previously performed at least 50 successful intubations.</p><p>In Group B, tracheal intubation was performed using an adult Bonfils retromolar model [Karl Storz-Endoskope, Telepack Pal 20043020; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. The Bonfils scope was loaded with a 7.5-mm inner diameter ETT for males and a 7-mm ETT for females. The intubator's left hand was used to pull the tongue and mandible upward. The Bonfils scope was introduced from the right side of the mouth (behind the last molar teeth), then slid behind the back of the tongue until the uvula was seen. The scope was rotated to direct its tip backward in the midline in order to visualize the epiglottis and laryngeal opening. The scope was then introduced a short distance inside the larynx, and the ETT was detached and pushed (under vision) inside the glottis using a gentle rotating movement. The patient's head and neck were first kept in a neutral position; if the intubation trial failed, careful head flexion and neck extension were established.</p><p>In Group M, tracheal intubation was performed using a standard Macintosh 3 blade with the patient's head and neck placed in the sniffing position according to Horton <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Immediately after intubation, the breathing circuit was connected to the ETT. Intubation was considered successful when end-tidal carbon dioxide was detected by capnography during the first three expirations. Both sides of the chest and epigastrium were auscultated to exclude inadvertent endobronchial or esophageal intubation.</p><p>Intubation time (IT) in seconds was recorded using a stopwatch; it was measured from the moment that the Bonfils or Macintosh scope was inserted into the oropharynx until end-tidal carbon dioxide detection. O<sub>2</sub>, HR, SBP, DBP and MBP were measured just after intubation. An intubation attempt was defined as the entire process of instrument insertion and removal in and out of a patient's pharynx. If there were three failed intubation attempts, other alternatives were used according to a difficult airway algorithm.</p><p>Data were recorded on a data collection sheet and included age, sex, BMI, weight, height, mouth opening (cm), TM distance, Mallampati score, the number of trials, IT (until successful intubation), and damage to the lips, dentures, and pharyngeal or laryngeal structures. Changes in HR, O<sub>2</sub>, SBP, DBP, and MBP before and after intubation were also recorded. All statistic analysis (<italic>t</italic>-test; paired and unpaired, and Chi-square test) were performed using SPSS 14.0 for Windows, SPSS Chicago, IL, USA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Both groups had comparable demographic data and preoperative airway parameters (P&#x0003e;0.05), [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic data and preoperative airway parameters</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-10-213-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The Bonfils scope showed a profile of easier intubation in comparison to the Macintosh.

The hemodynamic stability that we observed correlates with the results of a study published by Najafi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This characteristic of the Bonfils scope could be beneficial in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease.</p><p>Most airway management devices have a certain fixed, preformed shape that limits their ability to navigate, whereas good navigation ability is a characteristic of flexible fiberoptic scopes and the Bonfils retromolar scope. In this context, navigation means the ability to move in different directions to obtain the best view of the laryngeal opening.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>A flexible scope can be introduced down the tracheobronchial tree through the oral or nasal route. It should be kept stretched, so that the tip is directed by proximal end control and twisting of the shaft. When entry into the trachea is confirmed, the tip should be straightened before advancement of the ETT. Because they are expensive and have fragile fiberoptic bundles, flexible scopes are usually reserved for difficult airway cases; this decreases learning opportunities for junior anesthesiologists.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>During intubation, elevation of the mandible with the intubator's left hand will move the tongue away from the pharyngeal wall, which helps to open the space available for navigation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Because the Bonfils scope is semi-rigid, it is able to elevate the epiglottis and move soft tissues.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In this study, because all cases were successfully intubated with both scopes, it is difficult to give an advantage to either in cases of the difficult airway. Also, to avoid additional Macintosh use in the Bonfils group, this study did not include Cormack and Lehane grading, which would have added more time and intubation trials at the expense of patient safety. This could have increased the risk of injury, cardiorespiratory changes, stomach inflation, and aspiration. It is important to note that the view seen during Bonfils intubation, unlike that of the Macintosh scope, is improved through navigation. This means that what is seen through the Bonfils scope cannot be compared to what is seen through the Macintosh laryngoscope.</p><p>In previous studies, the Bonfils scope has been successfully used to intubate not only patients with normal airways but also those with difficult airways (expected or unexpected), including cases in which Macintosh intubation had failed. It is also useful in patients with limited neck mobility, cervical spine immobility or injuries, limited mouth opening, protruding incisors, large tongues, and those with a high larynx.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] This device can also be helpful for the management of &#x0201c;can&#x02019;t intubate, can&#x02019;t ventilate&#x0201d; situations, and it can provide endoscopic guidance during percutaneous tracheostomies.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Byhahn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] used a rigid cervical immobilization collar to simulate difficult intubation and showed that the Bonfils fiberoptic scope was a more efficient tool for tracheal intubation compared with direct laryngoscopy. Abramson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] successfully used the Bonfils fiberoptic scope for awake orotracheal intubation in 5 patients with anticipated difficult airways. Finally, Caruselli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] demonstrated the successful use of a pediatric Bonfils fiberscope to intubate a small for gestational age newborn.</p><p>Oxygenation can be achieved through the side channel of the Bonfils fiberscope, but the flow should be limited to 6 L/min. Hemmerling and Bracco[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported a case of cervical and facial surgical emphysema following use of a Bonfils fiberoptic scope with oxygen flow at a rate of 10 L/min; accordingly, they advised others to decrease oxygen flow to 6 L/min.</p><p>The Macintosh laryngoscope is not suitable for navigation because it has a fixed blade shape. In cases of the difficult airway, the intubator can only change blade size, adjust the patient's head and neck position, or use a stylet, bougie, or other equipment. In contrast, the Bonfils scope allows navigation among tissues and in different directions, irrespective of variations in anatomy until successful intubation is achieved.</p><p>The anesthesiologists involved in this study had all performed more than 50 intubations with the Bonfils scope. We encourage training with this instrument and routine use during endotracheal intubation, which will be helpful in cases of both easy and difficult airways.</p><p>A limitation of this study is that expert Bonfils operators performed the intubations; their success should not be extrapolated to those with less experience. However, this can encourage colleagues to build their experience base. Other limitations include the relatively small number of patients and the inclusion of patients undergoing operations on the nose or throat in which it could be difficult to determine whether blood or injuries were related to use of the Bonfils scope versus the surgery. The authors recommend further studies that avoid these limitations.</p><p>Awake intubation using local anesthesia, with or without sedation, seems to be easier with the Bonfils scope than with the Macintosh laryngoscope because there is a better view at the screen and recording facility, a less stress response is elicited, and the patient can open his or her mouth to widen the space and facilitate easier navigation. The authors also recommended that further studies which address use of the Bonfils scope in awake patients who are predicted to have difficult airways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The Bonfils scope should be used routinely like the Macintosh laryngoscope, because it has similar efficacy and is associated with more stable hemodynamics. Because of its unique navigation ability, the Bonfils scope also seems to be more helpful in cases with difficult airways. Anesthesiologists should start to build their experience base with this device by repeated practice.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benumof</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Management of the difficult adult airway.
