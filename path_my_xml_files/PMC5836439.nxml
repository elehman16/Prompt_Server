The economic cost and burden on the health system is substantial and growing. Self-management strategies offer a potential way to reduce the pressure on health services. This study evaluates a comprehensive self-management programme (the BetaMe programme) delivered by mobile and web-based technologies for people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and pre-diabetes. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BetaMe programme versus usual care among primary care populations in improving the control of T2DM and pre-diabetes, as measured by change in HbA1c and weight over 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Participants will be recruited through two primary healthcare organisations and a M&#x00101;ori healthcare provider in New Zealand (<italic>n</italic> = 430). Eligible participants will be 18 to 75 years old, with T2DM or pre-diabetes, with an HbA1c of 41&#x02013;70 mmol/mol up to 2 years prior to study commencement. Eligible participants who consent to participate will be individually randomised to the control arm (usual care) or intervention arm (usual care and BetaMe). The programme consists of a 16-week core followed by a maintenance period of 36 weeks. It incorporates (1) individualised health coaching, (2) goal setting and tracking, (3) peer support in an online forum and (4) educational resources and behaviour-change tools. The primary outcome measures are change in HbA1c and weight at 12 months. Secondary outcomes are changes in waist circumference, blood pressure, patient activation and diabetes-specific behaviours. All outcomes will be assessed at 4 and 12 months for the total study population and for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific participants specifically. All primary analyses will be based on intention-to-treat. Primary analysis will use linear mixed models comparing mean outcome levels adjusted for initial baseline characteristics at 12 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">This is a randomised controlled trial of a comprehensive self-management intervention for people with diabetes and pre-diabetes. If effective, this programme would allow healthcare providers to deliver an intervention that is person-centred and supports the self-care of people with T2DM, pre-diabetes and potentially other LTCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12617000549325.aspx">ACTRN12617000549325</ext-link>.

The economic cost and burden on the health system is substantial and growing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common long-term conditions affecting NZ adults, with a prevalence of around 7% based on glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) data from the 2008/09 NZ Adult Nutrition Survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Furthermore, the prevalence of T2DM is rapidly increasing in NZ at a rate of 7% per annum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. M&#x00101;ori, Pacific and Indian people have particularly high rates of T2DM, with rates up to three times higher than European New Zealanders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Diabetes is associated with multiple long-term complications, higher mortality and substantial healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Pre-diabetes is a precursor stage to T2DM with up to 70% eventually progressing on to T2DM; many people with pre-diabetes already have some of the complications of T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The estimated prevalence of pre-diabetes in NZ adults is 26% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Self-management measures, such as a healthy diet, regular exercise and weight management, are key to preventing the progression of pre-diabetes to T2DM, controlling T2DM and reducing complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. For example, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) study found that a lifestyle intervention resulted in a 58% reduction in incidence of diabetes among a high-risk population without diabetes, and that even short-term reversion to normal glucose control among those with pre-diabetes substantially reduced the likelihood that the person would progress to T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Similarly, those with diabetes who undergo lifestyle interventions tend to have better glycaemic control and improved long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, many people struggle to initiate and maintain these strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">Self-management strategies for T2DM have resulted in improvements in glycaemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], patient satisfaction with healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and adherence to medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is less evidence to support the use of self-management programmes in those with pre-diabetes. One study assessed the outcomes of an Internet-based diabetes prevention programme for people with pre-diabetes and found that there were clinically significant reductions in body weight and HbA1c at 2 years after entry into the programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">The BetaMe Programme is an integrated self-management programme for T2DM and pre-diabetes developed by Melon Health Ltd. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] with a strong emphasis on engagement, education and activation of patients with LTCs.

Each component has demonstrated benefits for improved outcomes for people with T2DM or pre-diabetes (summarised in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). The first 16 weeks form the core part of the programme, with the remaining 36 weeks covering the maintenance period (web-based peer support and goal-tracking only).</p><p id="Par18">The BetaMe programme underwent substantial pre-testing, and a pilot in 2015 demonstrated very positive results. In the pilot evaluation, 117 people with pre-diabetes participated from five general practices within one region of New Zealand (the Midlands Health Network). Baseline and follow-up measures at 16 weeks included HbA1c, weight, waist circumference, pre-diabetes status (defined as HbA1c 41&#x02013;49 mmol/mol) and blood pressure. Of the 117 patients, 108 completed the programme (92%). Of these, 91% reduced their HbA1c, 94% lost weight (mean = 4.2 kg), 87% had reduced waist circumference (mean = 4.2 cm) and 78% had final HbA1c levels below the pre-diabetes range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The feedback from pilot participants was extremely positive. Participants strongly endorsed both the coaching and community aspects of the programme (77% found these the most helpful aspect). Most (84%) reported that they were likely to recommend BetaMe to someone else, while only 2% said they were unlikely to do so. In a recent US review of digital diabetes prevention and self-management solutions in the workplace, the BetaMe programme ranked top for patient engagement and was in the top five overall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">In this study, we will undertake a randomised controlled trial to compare the BetaMe programme with usual primary care for patients with T2DM and pre-diabetes, examining the impact on HbA1c and weight as well as waist circumference, blood pressure and a number of self-reported measures of effectiveness at 12 months. This work will address several gaps in the current knowledge base around comprehensive self-management programmes for diabetes. First, most existing studies examine only one part of what is considered to be a self-management programme. For example, a 2011 meta-analysis of 22 trials with 1657 participants concluded that there was evidence that mobile-phone applications led to significant improvements in glycaemic control (a mean reduction in HbA1c of 6 mmol/mol over a mean 6 months&#x02019; duration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, most of the programmes studied were not comprehensive in that their interventions focussed solely on monitoring reminders or entering glucose measurements; did not involve providers or current clinical practice; or did not personalise the programme to individuals. Second, the current study will address a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of self-management programmes for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific individuals. Third, unlike most other studies that focus on &#x02018;people with diabetes&#x02019; or &#x02018;pre-diabetes&#x02019; our randomised controlled trial (RCT) will include participants with both pre-diabetes and T2DM, and will measure the effectiveness of the intervention for both groups. This will be more representative of the effectiveness of this intervention in the real clinical setting, and will give a better idea of the relative benefits for those with pre-diabetes compared to those with T2DM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims, design and setting</title><p id="Par21">The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the BetaMe programme versus usual care among primary care populations in improving the control of T2DM and pre-diabetes, as measured by change in HbA1c and weight over a 12-month period.</p><p id="Par22">The secondary aims, which will be explored using secondary analysis of the data, are to evaluate the effectiveness of the BetaMe programme versus usual care in:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par23">Improving HbA1c and weight outcomes at 12 months for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific participants specifically (combined across T2DM and pre-diabetes groups);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par24">Improving short-term weight management among those with T2DM and pre-diabetes (at 4 months, both overall and reported for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific participants);</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Improving other health-related outcomes, including waist circumference, blood pressure, health-related quality of life and self-reported self-management (overall and reported for M&#x00101;ori and Pacific participants)</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par26">The study will be a two-arm, parallel-group, individually randomised controlled trial for people with pre-diabetes and T2DM, comparing the BetaMe programme with usual primary care (active control), with investigator-blinded assessment of outcomes (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the flowchart of the BetaMe study, Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Checklist and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for the SPIRIT Figure).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the BetaMe study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2528_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Figure</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2528_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par27">The study will be based in two regions of NZ, Midlands and Greater Wellington, through two Primary Healthcare Organisations (PHOs, Midlands Health Network and Compass Health), and a large M&#x00101;ori healthcare provider (Whai Oranga o Te Iwi).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The BetaMe intervention aims to strike a balance between &#x02018;tailoring&#x02019; to individuals and delivering an intervention that is applied consistently enough to allow its impacts to be measured.</p><p id="Par43">The BetaMe intervention consists of four separate components; health coaches, provision of evidence-based educational resources, goal tracking and peer support:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par44">Health coaching. The health coaches are all either qualified personal trainers or registered nurses trained in motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioural therapy, and nutrition, and have completed the Heart Foundation Pacific Heartbeat Community Nutrition course. Health coaches arrange an initial one-on-one session with participants. The purpose of this first 1&#x000a0;h session is for health coaches to work with participants to develop goals tailored to their needs and values. The session follows a set format. M&#x00101;ori and Pacific coaches are available. Once these goals have been set and agreed on, participants&#x02019; goals are entered into their profile on the BetaMe system. Coaches will continue to work with participants, and will message participants weekly to check on their progress, reinforce information from the modules and arrange further meetings at frequencies that suit the participant (these can be weekly, fortnightly or less frequently if preferred). These subsequent meetings are generally around 15&#x02013;20 min in length. All meetings with the coaches will be by audio or video, as per the participant&#x02019;s preference. Support and clinical governance of the health coaches is provided by a clinical psychologist, general practitioner and an experienced health coach. Coaches also regularly interact with one another via an online forum (separate from patient forums) to share any problems they are having and solutions</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par45">Health literacy component. There are eight key education modules introduced to participants via the web and mobile platform with attached resources (videos, infographics, articles, tips, tools, meal ideas and mini-quiz). The key messages in the modules are reinforced in corresponding email newsletters, discussions on the newsfeed initiated by the community manager and by the participant&#x02019;s coach. Every 2 weeks, a new module is released that presents participants with a range of topics that offer key messages to help them to learn about and manage their own health. The modules cover risk factors for T2DM and pre-diabetes, healthy eating and physical activity, identifying triggers for less healthy decisions and establishing healthy habits, sleep and shift work, meal planning, problem solving, healthy coping and mindfulness (see Additional&#x000a0;file&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for more information)</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par46">Goal tracking.

They will be able to share these data with their health coach at any time, or with their physician by email or at their next appointment</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par47">Peer support. The programme also includes peer support with real-time chat within a private and secure online social network monitored by a community manager who is a registered nurse trained in nutrition. This person monitors the community to ensure nothing unsafe (like personal details, or negative health messages) is shared, and that people are supported and supportive. They will also reinforce key messages, highlight local events in the area, start conversations and welcome new people to the community. The community manager also provides a point of contact for both technical support, and for support more generally, particularly after the first 16 weeks of the programme when the health coaching module is completed.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par48">In the first 16 weeks of the programme, participants will set goals, work with health coaches, receive the evidence-based modules and be encouraged to use goal tracking and participate in the peer support programme. After that time, participants will be encouraged to continue tracking and participating in peer support, for the remainder of the 52-week programme. Information from the modules is available for the entire 52-week period.</p><p id="Par49">At the time of randomisation, contact details for participants randomised to the intervention arm will be forwarded to Melon Health Ltd. (with participant permission). A health coach will then contact the participant within five working days to initiate the programme.

Although this may vary somewhat between practices and GPs, the key interest is the extent to which the BetaMe programme may improve outcomes beyond that expected in the context of usual care. For people with T2DM, this would typically involve an annual diabetes review to monitor glycaemic control and assess the patient for the presence of any diabetes complications and a review of treatment. In addition, it could include education and advice on lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise, provided by a trained practice nurse or diabetes specialist nurse. For people with pre-diabetes, usual care would typically include lifestyle advice and education about diet and exercise, and an annual HbA1c.</p><p id="Par53">The study team will also provide participants in the control arm with standard information about pre-diabetes and T2DM and its management, from resources produced and provided by Diabetes NZ (Pamphlets entitled &#x02018;Pre-diabetes&#x02019;, &#x02018;Diabetes and Healthy Food Choices&#x02019;, and &#x02018;Live Well with Diabetes&#x02019;, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.diabetes.org.nz/pamphlet-ordering/">https://www.diabetes.org.nz/pamphlet-ordering/</ext-link>).

Randomisation will be completed within two working days of the completed baseline assessment. To ensure allocation concealment, randomisation will be centrally determined from within the REDCap electronic data capture platform <italic>after</italic> the patient is enrolled in the study (following the first assessment with the research nurse and when full eligibility based on current HbA1c level has been determined). To ensure balance in numbers allocated to each study arm, randomisation lists will be blocked.</p><p id="Par55">The randomisation allocation list will not be visible to the team member(s) requesting the allocation, and this team member(s) will only have details on the patient ID, practice, and ethnicity when requesting allocation for any patient. The exact length of each randomisation block will be kept in a separate document held by the principal investigator (PI), project manager and project statistician, and thus will not be available to the team member(s) responsible for determining allocation.</p><p id="Par56">Given the nature of the intervention, it is not possible to keep participants blind to their intervention status. Research nurses taking objective measurements will be kept blind to the intervention status of participants to the extent possible. However, when the nurse meets with the participant at the 4- and 12-month follow-up visits, it is not possible to guarantee that the nurses remain blind to the intervention allocation of the participant. The results dataset will be stored with the study arm identity blinded by code. The key to this code will be held independent of the analysis dataset by the PI, a second member of the research team (MM), and an independent member of the internal Data Monitoring Group. Data cleaning and analysis will be conducted by a statistician who is blind to group allocation. Once analysis is complete, the results will be unblinded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par57">The co-primary outcomes are changes in HbA1c and weight at 12 months.

For the HbA1c primary outcome, analysis will be conducted both combined and separately for pre-diabetes and T2DM. For weight, the primary analysis will combine participants with pre-diabetes and T2DM. Analysis will use linear mixed models, comparing mean outcome levels between intervention and control arms at the 12-month endpoint, adjusted for initial HbA1c level (accounting for baseline differences in outcome) and for other important baseline covariates (age, gender, ethnicity, weight). This analysis will include the 4-month measurements, providing some information for those individuals subsequently lost to follow-up and hence missing final outcome data (mixed models analysis treats these final data as missing at random conditional on baseline and intermediate covariates, i.e. these individuals are expected on average to have final outcomes similar to other people with the same baseline covariates and HbA1c trajectories).

Data will be collected from three sources: (1) from the mobile/web platform to identify key usage patterns; (2) with consent from the participants, health coaches will record audio interactions with participants and will log key reasons for contact (a random subset of the coaching sessions will be assessed by the research team for consistency with the log); and (3) participants will be invited to provide individual feedback on the acceptability and usefulness of the intervention at the end of the study period.</p><p id="Par76">Focus groups, lasting approximately 1 h each, will be held in each region to obtain in-depth feedback about the intervention and how participants interacted with it. Usage will be described, and linked to outcomes using standard quantitative analytic approaches (for example, proportions accessing health coaches will be reported, with 95% confidence intervals; frequency of accessing health coaches or engaging online will be reported as median access with range/interquartile range). Focus group data will be coded thematically, with key issues identified.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par77">The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on 19 April 2017.

Self-management interventions are a potential way to address this burden with evidence that they can be effective in improving physical and mental health. Important gaps in evidence remain, and are a barrier to implementation. The BetaMe programme is an integrated, evidence-based, comprehensive, self-management programme delivered by mobile and web-based technology. A pilot of 117 patients with pre-diabetes was extremely successful with 78% of people reducing their HbA1c level below pre-diabetes range over 4 months. However, the study was volunteer-based and did not incorporate a comparison arm.</p><p id="Par80">This paper describes the protocol of a study that will address the question of whether this kind of programme is likely to be effective in reducing HbA1c and weight among people with T2DM and pre-diabetes in a primary care environment. It addresses shortcomings of previous studies and includes an explicit aim to assess the effectiveness of this kind of programme among M&#x00101;ori and Pacific people who have higher rates of T2DM and pre-diabetes than other ethnic groups in NZ.</p><p id="Par81">If found to be effective, this programme would allow healthcare providers to deliver an intervention that is person-centred and supports the self-care of people with T2DM, pre-diabetes and potentially other LTCs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par82">This paper is based on protocol version 1.2, dated 1 August 2017. Recruitment to the study began on 9 June 2017. Approximate date of recruitment completion: February 2018.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
