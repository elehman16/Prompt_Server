Patients frequently receive individual treatment and advice to self-manage from physiotherapists in primary care, but the successful implementation of a clinical and cost-effective group SM programme is a key priority for health service managers in Ireland to maximise long-term outcomes and efficient use of limited and costly resources.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/analysis</title><p>This protocol describes an assessor-blinded cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial of a group-based education and exercise intervention underpinned by self-determination theory designed to support an increase in SM behaviour in patients with CLBP and OA in primary care physiotherapy. The primary care clinic will be the unit of randomisation (cluster), with each clinic randomised to 1 of 2 groups providing the Self-management of Osteoarthritis and Low back pain through Activity and Skills (SOLAS) intervention or usual individual physiotherapy. Patients are followed up at 6&#x02005;weeks, 2 and 6&#x02005;months. The primary outcomes are the (1) acceptability and demand of the intervention to patients and physiotherapists, (2) feasibility and optimal study design/procedures and sample size for a definitive trial. Secondary outcomes include exploratory analyses of: point estimates, 95% CIs, change scores and effect sizes in physical function, pain and disability outcomes; process of change in target SM behaviours and selected mediators; and the cost of the intervention to inform a definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics/dissemination</title><p>This feasibility trial protocol was approved by the UCD Human Research Ethics&#x02014;Sciences Committee (LS-13-54 Currie-Hurley) and research access has been granted by the Health Services Executive Primary Care Research Committee in January 2014. The study findings will be disseminated to the research, clinical and health service communities through publication in peer-reviewed journals, presentation at national and international academic and clinical conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN 49875385; Pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>RHEUMATOLOGY</kwd><kwd>PAIN MANAGEMENT</kwd><kwd>PRIMARY CARE</kwd><kwd>REHABILITATION MEDICINE</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This protocol describes a cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial of a theory-driven group-based intervention for primary care patients with low back pain and osteoarthritis.</p></list-item><list-item><p>This study will explore the acceptability and demand of the group-based intervention to patients and physiotherapists compared with usual individual physiotherapy.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The exclusion of patients who are unwilling or unavailable to attend a 6-week group programme will limit the study's generalisability.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic musculoskeletal pain conditions are the leading cause of disability globally, notably low back pain (LBP) ranked first,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and hip and knee osteoarthritis (OA) ranked 11th in the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study (see online supplementary file 1).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The global point prevalence of LBP was estimated at 9.4%, with OA hip and knee combined at 3.8%<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>; Ireland has slightly higher rates of 12% and 4.2%, respectively.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> health service commissioners require robust evidence of its clinical and cost-effectiveness prior to widespread implementation. Recent reviews suggest only small or equivocal effects for SM compared with other approaches for these conditions,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> while group-based SM programmes with healthcare professional input showed some beneficial effects, further evidence of their clinical and cost-effectiveness is needed.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Within Ireland's primary care health system, the majority of patients with OA and chronic low back pain (CLBP) referred for physiotherapy (PT) are treated individually<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> in a diverse range of health settings by staff with varying degrees of expertise.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Our recent rapid review found equivocal effectiveness for individual and group-based SM programmes with limited cost-effectiveness studies and failed to identify a group-based intervention for both OA hip/knee and CLBP.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> These conditions often present concurrently in those aged over 45&#x02005;years,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and could be treated together in order to maximise outcomes and minimise inefficiencies.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The successful implementation of an evidence-based group SM programme for CLBP and OA is a key priority for Ireland's PT managers in current resource constrained times.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>The multifaceted nature of SM interventions with several interacting components that need to be tailored to the individual, and underpinned by a collaborative relationship between the patient and healthcare professional within the local health service constitutes a complex intervention,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> notwithstanding the additional challenges of consistent delivery in a group format, across a diverse range of health settings with varying resources and facilities.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> It has been argued that the policy for group interventions to encourage SM in primary care has raced ahead of the evidence and there are many unanswered questions for practitioners and policymakers aiming to establish client groups in terms of their feasibility, effectiveness and costs.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Therefore, following the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> we developed the Self-management of OA and LBP through Activity and Skills (SOLAS) intervention that was acceptable and met the needs of Ireland's primary care service stakeholders and the current evidence which will be reported in detail in a separate paper. Applying the MRC framework, it is necessary to establish the feasibility of delivering the SOLAS intervention to PTs and patients with OA and CLBP to determine &#x02018;can it work?&#x02019;, &#x02018;does it work?&#x02019; and &#x02018;will it work?&#x02019;<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> in primary care centres in Ireland compared with usual individual PT care, considered the most appropriate comparison. Hence, a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design was chosen to avoid contamination of the control group.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> This feasibility trial will also determine the most efficient and effective design and sample size for a main effectiveness trial and provide an estimate of the cost of delivering the intervention compared with usual PT.</p><p>Consistent with the recommendations of trial reporting guidelines,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> we used theory to guide the design of the SOLAS intervention, its delivery and the training of PTs in the feasibility trial. The current lack of theory-driven interventions in chronic pain populations<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref> may partly explain the poor uptake and continuation of SM behaviours, such as physical activity, while conversely, the application of theory to an intervention enables theoretically identified mechanisms of action (ie, mediators) to be investigated allowing greater understanding of how an intervention works and how it can be enhanced to improve outcomes.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;43</xref> The SOLAS intervention is underpinned by self-determination theory,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> which aims to increase patients&#x02019; autonomous motivation and perceived competence to self-manage through the needs supportive environment created by the PT within the group as we have previously demonstrated in individual PT.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> The intervention is also designed to target specific determinants of SM behaviour (knowledge, skills, self-efficacy/perceived competence, fear, catastrophising, motivation, behaviour regulation) in order to increase physical activity and the use of specific evidence-based SM behaviours (ie, pain management using pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches, pain coping strategies, healthy eating for lifestyle and weight management and specific exercise) leading to changed health outcomes as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010728F1">figure 1</xref>. As the potential for the SOLAS intervention to result in a change in the target SM behaviours is uncertain, the contributing assumptions of this underlying theoretical model of behaviour change will be explored within the feasibility trial<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and will further inform the design of a future effectiveness trial.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015010728F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Process map of behaviour change in SOLAS intervention.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015010728f01"/></fig><sec id="s1a"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of this cluster randomised controlled feasibility trial is to evaluate the feasibility and costs of providing the SOLAS intervention (experimental group) to promote SM for patients with OA hip/knee and/or CLBP compared with usual PT, which will serve as the pragmatic control group in order to determine the feasibility of moving to a full scale trial by following the MRC guidelines.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p><p>Our primary objectives are: (1) to assess the acceptability and demand of the SOLAS intervention to patients and physiotherapists compared with usual PT in order to optimise its design, uptake and delivery; and (2) to determine the feasibility of trial procedures and the most efficient and effective study design for a definitive RCT, including its sample size.

See <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2015010728TB2">table 2</xref> for details. The intervention is structured and multicomponent involving (1) <italic>education</italic> to increase knowledge about the individual's chronic condition, its consequences, and its SM including the role of a healthy lifestyle and available community resources and (2) <italic>training</italic> to impart increased SM behaviours at the end of the intervention and to enable participants to deploy these enhanced skills in their lives beyond the intervention. Participants randomised to this arm will receive six consecutive sessions in a group of up to six participants led by a PT within a PCCC clinic or nearby community facility. The overall aim of the programme and the importance of weekly attendance will be explained throughout to improve adherence. To support the promotion of participant SM behaviour, its determinants have been mapped to each session and relevant behaviour change techniques incorporated within sessions. In line with SDT and the importance of social agents in facilitating autonomous motivation and perceived competence for long-term behaviour change, the PT plays a crucial role by being needs supportive and enabling participants to SM by seeking their input, avoiding controlling language such as &#x02018;should&#x02019; and &#x02018;must&#x02019;; and trying to understand their perspective. The content and dose of each class (including attendance record, rates and reasons for non-attendance or early withdrawal of each participant) will be recorded by the treating therapist in a weekly treatment record form.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2015010728TB2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>SOLAS summary intervention map</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Session</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Self-management behaviours targeted within the session</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention content and participant materials</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Behaviour change techniques embedded <italic>within sessions</italic> (as per Michie <italic>et al</italic>)<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">i.

On completion of the trial, a focus group with PT managers and a purposive sample of PTs will assess views on the practicality and potential future integration of the SOLAS intervention into existing PCCC services to further inform a definitive trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Sample size</title><p>We plan to recruit between 12 and 14 clusters (PCCC sites) to ensure the intervention is feasible across a range of settings with variable staffing, facilities, equipment and clientele. There will be a minimum of six clusters in each arm, participating in two waves of recruitment with the aim to recruit six participants in each cluster per wave, resulting in 144 participants (72 per arm). Additional clusters (n=2) will only be included as a contingency if recruitment targets are not met and added to the final study waves. Recommendations for feasibility studies suggest that the data set for analysis include at least 30 participants per arm in order to estimate parameters for future sample size calculations.<xref rid="R76" ref-type="bibr">76&#x02013;78</xref> Accounting for the cluster design effect and assuming an ICC coefficient of 0.03,<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref> an effective sample size of 30 would require 36 participants per arm. Allowing for 25% loss to follow-up, we would need to recruit 48 participants per arm (96 in total). Therefore, this study size will be sufficiently large to allow a precise estimate of the ICC coefficient; the greater the number of clusters the more precise the estimate of the ICC coefficient.<xref rid="R80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> This study design and sample size should therefore satisfy the dual aims of (1) feasibility and (2) estimation of statistics to enable a future sample size calculation for a definitive trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Data integrity</title><p>All hard copy and audio-recorded data will be kept confidential and stored in a locked filing cabinet in the research group office and in softcopy in a password-protected database only accessible to the PI, data manager and statistician. The research team will monitor the integrity of trial data. All participant, group allocation, treatment record and sociodemographic data will be coded, and outcome questionnaires scored, and all data will be double entered into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences package to detect and correct input errors, and range checks will be undertaken prior to data analysis. A research investigator unblinded to treatment allocation will perform regular data checks during data entry and provide feedback to PTs regarding data omissions where necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Planned analyses</title><p>Since this is a feasibility study, extensive exploratory and descriptive analysis of the data will be undertaken. A combination of quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to answer the primary research objectives related to the feasibility of the intervention and trial procedures to participants and PTs to determine the feasibility and most efficient and effective study design for a definitive trial. Statistical analysis will be by intention to treat according to participants&#x02019; assigned arm of the study, regardless of whether they attend for treatment or not. The data analysis plan for treatment fidelity will be reported separately.</p><p>Analysis of the feasibility aspects will be undertaken on an interim basis after each study wave by the UCD study team and used to inform minor protocol refinements for subsequent waves. Qualitative data will be analysed using inductive thematic analysis, based on Braun and Clarke's<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> method. Coding frames will be developed from a review of provisional themes, which will then be re-examined and refined. The reliability of the identified themes will be established by a second researcher who will independently code a random sample of 25% of each data set using the coding frame, with 70% agreement taken as the minimum cut-off rate of agreement.<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> The recruitment rate overall, and according to study arm and PCCC clinic will be calculated in addition to the ratio of number screened: number enrolled. The conversion rate and reasons for exclusion/refusal/withdrawal at each stage in the recruitment process and the attrition rate during the treatment period will be evaluated. The feasibility of outcome measurement procedures will be assessed by the time to complete measures, the number of missing items according to outcome measure, and the follow-up rates and methods of completion (phone, post) at each time point and participants&#x02019; reported burden of completion.</p><p>Analysis of the secondary outcome measure data will be undertaken at the end of the trial and performed by the statistician who will remain blinded to group identification until analysis is complete. A linear mixed model will be used to examine change over time in participant outcomes between treatment groups, while adjusting for study waves and clinics, and potentially individual PTs. Treatment effects will be reported with 95% CIs and ICCs for the clusters. The results will guide a sample size calculation and the form of the primary analysis for a definitive trial. The relationships between the SOLAS intervention, PT autonomy support and the physical activity/SM behaviour measures, via potential mediators (pain catastrophising, fear, self-efficacy/perceived competence and motivation) will be explored, and contingent on adequate sample size, with a series of linear models,<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> and by applying the test of Sobel,<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> and structural equation models, and extended to examine impact on secondary outcomes. Finally, the cost of the SOLAS intervention compared with usual PT will be calculated from the health service and societal perspectives using data from resource utilisation measures, alongside exploratory analysis of quality-adjusted life years (EQ-5D) and disease-specific measures.<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Adverse effects or events</title><p>No adverse events, apart from minor musculoskeletal complaints in the SOLAS intervention arm due to unaccustomed exercise, are anticipated. Treatment will be modified or discontinued if necessary due to an increase in symptoms. Participants and PTs will be informed that any adverse events should be reported immediately to the PI and will be documented by the research team by type, length of time and frequency should they occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Trial governance</title><p>The Trial Management Committee (TMC), comprising the PI and local co-investigators, provides overall management of the feasibility trial including PCCC clinic set-up, PT training, recruitment and screening procedures, trial promotion, data collection, analysis and interpretation. Trial conduct will be audited on a weekly basis using a standardised proforma during each recruitment wave, and biannually at the end of each recruitment wave. Members of the international scientific team provide independent and scientific oversight of the progress of the study through the Data Monitoring Committee on behalf of the funder (Health Research Board).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>All patients and physiotherapists will be provided with detailed written information and have an opportunity to discuss participation before providing written consent and will be advised they can withdraw at any point. Patients will be invited to give their consent to participate in a telephone interview following completion of all follow-ups. The feasibility results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international academic, clinical and health service conferences. Any protocol amendments including changes to eligibility criteria, outcomes or analyses will be communicated to the UCD Human Research Ethics&#x02014;Sciences Committee and the HSE Primary Care Research Committee, and noted on the Current Controlled Trials trial registration page and reported in the trial results papers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The provision of SM healthcare interventions with robust evidence of clinical and cost-effectiveness for chronic conditions, including LBP and OA, are becoming increasingly important due to their rising prevalence and significant impact on the individual, their family and carers, employers and wider society. The complex multifaceted nature of supporting patients to engage in SM behaviours requires an underlying model of behaviour change to enhance the likelihood of long-term adherence and to understand the underlying processes of change. Group-based interventions that are first designed, adapted and tested for feasibility and cost implications in partnership with patients&#x02019; and healthcare providers within local health service settings before robust evaluation in an effectiveness trial have the potential to address this second translational gap. The feasibility of the SOLAS theory-driven, group-based complex intervention will be evaluated from the patient, practitioner and health service manager levels, and if achieved the trial design will be refined based on the findings of this study before moving to a definitive trial.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Collaborators from the SOLAS Trial team Professor Charles Normand and Dr James F O'Mahony for advice on the cost analysis, Marian Hernon for contribution to cost methods, and Alison Keogh and Elaine Toomey for contribution to fidelity methods.
