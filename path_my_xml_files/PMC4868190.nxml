Kinesio taping on the trapezius muscle in individuals with myofascial pain syndrome.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty-seven patients with active upper trapezius myofascial
trigger points were randomly divided to 2 groups: group 1 received Kinesio taping for the
upper trapezius muscle, and group 2 received a sham Kinesio taping application. Neck pain
(Visual Analog Scale and pressure algometry) and trapezius muscle strength data were
collected at baseline, immediately after Kinesio taping application, and at one month
follow-up. [Results] The mean changes in Visual Analog Scale scores were significantly
different between groups at T2 and T1, with less pain in group 1. The mean changes in
algometry scores were significantly different between groups at T3 compared with T2 in
favor of group 1. The mean changes in trapezius muscle strength were significantly
different between the groups at T2 compared with T1 in favor of group 1. [Conclusion]
Patients with myofascial pain syndrome receiving an application of Kinesio taping
exhibited statistically significant improvements in pain and upper trapezius muscle
strength.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Myofascial pain syndrome</kwd><kwd>Taping</kwd><kwd>Trapezius</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Janet G. Travell first described myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) in 1942. The terminology
used for MPS was established in 1983, and MPS was accepted as a clinical diagnosis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Myofascial pain syndrome is characterized
by multiple trigger points in taut bands and facial constrictions. In clinical practice, MPS
is frequently diagnosed, with a prevalence as high as 30%, which combined with a prevalence
of myofascial pain as high as 30% results in a ratio of up to 85%<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Treatment strategies for MPS are primarily divided into invasive and noninvasive treatment
techniques. The non-invasive treatment techniques include medical treatment, electrotherapy,
cold spray/stretching, ischemic compression, and massage. The invasive techniques, such as
trigger point injections and dry needling, are preferred but have risks. Physical therapy
requires the time of the patient and the therapist for each session<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kinesio tape (KT) is a relatively new form of elastic therapeutic tape that was developed
by Dr. Kenzo Kase in the 1970&#x02019;s and is used in the treatment of a variety of injuries<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Despite its popularity and widespread
clinical use, there are relatively few studies that support the effectiveness of KT for neck
and upper extremity conditions<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has
been hypothesized that KT may exert its effects by (1) increasing local circulation, (2)
reducing local edema by decreasing exudative substances, (3) improving circulation of blood
by facilitating muscle, (4) providing a positional stimulus to the skin, muscle, or facial
structures, and (5) providing proper afferent input to the central nervous system<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The KT application techniques include
facilitation, inhibition, fascia correction, field correction, functional correction, and
mechanic correction techniques. The KT practitioner must decide which muscle group should be
treated with which type of technique. The inhibition technique can be used for muscle
dysfunction caused by microtrauma or tension<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Several studies have investigated the effect of KT on patellofemoral pain syndrome, ankle
instability, whiplash injury, spasticity, and low back pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. There have been only two studies of the effectiveness of KT on
mechanical neck pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, and to date, one study and a single case report have evaluated the
effects of KT use in patients with myofascial pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The purpose of the present study
was to compare the effects of KT application by the inhibition method to the upper trapezius
muscle versus placebo tape application on neck pain and muscle strength in patients with
cervical MPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifty-three patients being treated at Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation clinic
participated in this study. All subjects signed an informed consent form prior to
participation. The study protocol was approved by the University&#x02019;s ethics committee.
Demographic data including age, body mass index, and gender were recorded. The trapezius
muscle is the most common muscle presenting with MPS symptoms<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the trapezius muscle was chosen for observing the effect
of KT in the present study. Patients with neck and/or upper back pain who had an active
myofascial trigger point in the upper trapezius region and taut palpable band were included.
MPS was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of Travell and Simon<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age
between 18 and 50&#x02005;years and symptom duration of more than 2 weeks. The exclusion criteria
were as follows: diagnosis of fibromyalgia syndrome; diagnosis of psychiatric disorders such
as anxiety and depression; symptoms of radiculopathy; brachial plexopathy; or other nerve
entrapments. Patients who underwent MPS treatment in last 6 months, had a malignancy, were
pregnant, had an infectious disease, had an inflammatory musculoskeletal disease, or had
undergone shoulder or neck surgery were excluded.</p><p>Fifty-three patients were evaluated, and 40 patients who met the inclusion criteria
participated in the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1074-g001"/></fig>). Following a baseline examination, the patients were randomly assigned to the
therapeutic KT group (group 1) or a placebo (sham) group (group 2) by the closed envelope
method. For all patients, KT application was performed by a certified KT practitioner. After
the initial evaluation, six patients dropped out of the study for personal reasons. The
participants in both groups participated in home exercise programs including neck muscles
stretching and strengthening exercises and received a training booklet explaining the
exercises that they could do on their own at home.</p><p>The KT (Kinesio Tex Tape, Kinesio Holding Corporation, Albuquerque, NM, USA) used in this
study was waterproof, porous, and adhesive. Kinesio tape with a width of 5&#x02005;cm and a
thickness of 0.5&#x02005;mm was used in both groups. The experimental group received a standardized
therapeutic KT application. Prior to application, the patient was seated and asked to flex
their neck laterally to the contralateral side and to rotate their head to the same side.
The anchor was applied inferior to the acromion, and the initial part of the band was
stretched maximally before KT was applied through the upper side of the trapezius to the
hairline without stretching (the inhibition technique was applied according to the method of
Kenzo Kase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>a. The inhibition application technique in a suitable position. b. The placebo
application technique in a neutral position</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1074-g002"/></fig>). The placebo group received improper KT application consisting of an I strip (same
material as the real application) applied with no tension. For the placebo taping, the
cervical spine of the participants was placed in a neutral position. The I strip was placed
from the spine to the acromion along the spina scapula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2b</xref>). The two different tape applications looked very similar, but in the
placebo group, no tension was applied to the cervical structures. Kinesio tape was applied
to both groups at the beginning of the week and was to stay on for three days; it was
applied twice, with one day of rest between applications.</p><p>The occupations of all the participants involved 8 hours of computer-based work per day,
and they worked with the tape applied. The outcome measures for this study were Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) score, pressure algometry measurement, and scapular elevator muscle
strength measurement. All patients were evaluated before treatment (T<sub>1</sub>),
immediately after treatment (T<sub>2</sub>), and at 1 month after treatment (T<sub>3</sub>).
The VAS was used to record each patient&#x02019;s current level of neck pain, with 0 indicating no
pain and 10 indicating the worst pain that the patient had experienced. Using a ruler marked
in centimeters, the examiner obtained the exact values along a 10-cm VAS line. In this
study, also an analogue algometer (Baseline FDK) was used to detect pain level. The device
is a force gauge fitted with a disc-shaped rubber tip with a surface area of exactly
1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>. Pressure measurements are expressed as kilograms per square centimeter
(kg/cm<sup>2</sup>). The algometer was placed at a chosen trigger point with the metal rod
perpendicular to the surface of the skin and the patient in a seated position. Pressure was
applied at an increasing rate of 1&#x02005;kg/second<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patient was instructed to indicate the point at which pain was
perceived. After the dial had been set to zero, the procedure was repeated three times with
an interval of 1 munute for each patient. The average of three readings was used for
analysis. Patients were evaluated for muscle strength using a back/leg/chest dynamometer
(Baseline<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> dynamometer). External force applied to the dynamometer compressed a
steel spring and moved a pointer. Upon knowing the force required to move the pointer a
particular distance, one can determine exactly how much external force has been applied to
the dynamometer. The dynamometer thus provides a measure of the force the patient generates
while performing a standing extension of the torso<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patient was asked to assume approximately 0-degree extension
of the knees and 30-degree flexion of the hips while maintaining an appropriate lordotic
curve and then told to pull up on the dynamometer using the major muscle groups of the
shoulder elevators. The average of two strength measurements for each testing period
separated learning effects from training effects. Patients wore sportswear shoes for the
test.</p><p>Initially, a pilot study was conducted on 10 patients from each group. In order to
determine the sample size, power analysis was performed using the G*Power (v3.1.7) program.
Twenty patients per group would provide 80% statistical power at a 5% significance level
(effect size d = 0.92) according to algometer scores between groups. The Number Cruncher
Statistical System (NCSS, 2007, NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA) and Power Analysis and Sample
Size (PASS, 2008) statistical software (NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT, USA) were used to
characterize the study sample. Descriptive statistical analysis values (mean, standard
deviation, minimum, maximum, median, and ratio) were used according to the distribution
variables. Data for continuous variables were compared using Student t tests or the
Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were compared by Fisher Exact test and Yates&#x02019;
Continuity Correction test. Within-group comparisons were done using the Friedman Test. For
the variables for which significant differences were obtained, the Wilcoxon signed rank test
was used (post hoc). A p-value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically
significant difference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifty-three patients were screened according to the inclusion criteria. Thirty-seven

application of KT to the trapezius muscle resulted in a significant improvement in the pain
level after KT application, even at a month after the use of KT. Applying KT along the
trapezius area also increased trapezius muscle strength at 1 month after KT application.</p><p>In the literature, although there have been studies showing an improvement in pain with KT
application, the mechanism for this improvement has not been elucidated<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. One possible analgesic mechanism may be related to the
decreased subcutaneous nociceptor pressure in the skin. Another hypothesis involves the
application of afferent stimuli to the soft tissue structures, facilitation of a pain
inhibiting mechanism, and activation of the gait control mechanism<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thelen et al. investigated the efficacy of KT application
on rotator cuff tendinitis and impingement syndrome and observed increased abduction
angles<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, improvements in pain
were not observed in their study. Contrary to the results of Thelen et al., Garcia-Muro et
al. reported a case of myofascial pain of the deltoid muscle that exhibited improvement in
terms of pain level with KT application<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another study by Gonzalez-Iglesias et al. investigated the effect of
KT application on whiplash injury, and the authors documented improvements in terms of pain
level<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hernandez et al. compared the efficacy of cervical manipulation and KT application in
patients with mechanical neck pain and found results similar to those of Gonzalez-Iglesias
et al<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Karatas et al. researched the efficacy of KT application on
mechanical neck pain and showed that patients treated with KT exhibited improvements in
terms of pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of our study
are similar to those of these recent studies<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, improvements in terms of pain level after KT
application were observed. Furthermore, continuous effects at 1 month after KT application
were demonstrated. Significant improvements in terms of pain level immediately after
application were also observed in the placebo group. However, improvement in terms of the
pain level measured by VAS and algometry persisted in KT group after 1 month from the
application, whereas they did not continue in the placebo group. Reduced pain levels after
treatment in the placebo group were considered to be the results of possible psychological
effects<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, although the placebo application was improper, it was
applied to the same muscle so it probably provided proper sensory feedback during cervical
spine movements, which decreased mechanical irritation of the soft tissues<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. This sensory feedback may improve patient
awareness and thus increase their adherence to the ergonomics principles<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, improvements regarding scapular elevation muscle strength were observed.
Correcting muscular imbalance is important for preventing and treating musculoskeletal
disorders. If the KT application could influence the strength or flexibility of the healthy
muscle, it could be used in cases of muscular imbalance, which is important for the
treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal pathologies<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to Williams et al., KT application results in a small
immediate increase in muscle strength by producing a concentric pull on fascia, which may
stimulate increased muscle contraction, and an additional hypothesis suggests that the
facilitated muscle activity and improved muscle alignment may contribute to increases in
muscle strength<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Lumbroso et al.
evaluated the effects of KT application on the hamstring and gastrocnemius muscles and found
a significant increase in the peak force in the gastrocnemius group immediately and 48 hours
later; however, in the hamstring group, the increase in peak force was only detected 48
hours later. The authors suggested that it was possible that certain muscles react
differently to the KT application. On the other hand, Lumbroso et al. indicated that the
increase in muscle force could be due to a placebo effect, but their study did not include a
placebo group<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
improvement in terms of muscle strength was observed only in the KT group. Lumbroso et al.
also concluded that different muscles react differently to the KT application<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the method of KT application
should be should be designed specific to each muscle, because maximum muscle strength
dependent on muscle morphology and muscle activation type<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most suitable method of KT application should be tested for
each muscle in future studies. The data from the present study are in agreement with those
of the previous study<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, but the placebo group also showed an increase in muscle
strength. As a limitation of this study, both groups performed an exercise program. The
increase in muscle strength in the placebo group may have been related to exercise.</p><p>Recent studies investigating the effect of KT application on muscle strength in healthy
athletes did not find any significant change in muscle strength<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there
were limitations to these studies. One limitation was the inclusion of only healthy athletes
who had already achieved a certain level of muscle strength. Another limitation was the
evaluation of muscle strength immediately after KT application. KT application does not
cause an immediate effect on muscle strength, but an acute effect can be detected by
electroneuromyography (EMG) objectively. One way of exploring muscle activation is to look
for a change in the amplitude of a reflex, such as the H reflex.</p><p>There are a number of limitations in the current study that should be recognized, in
addition to that already mentioned. One of these limitations is the number of participants
included. The same study protocol could be performed in a larger population. Another
limitation is that the investigators who performed the therapeutic and placebo KT
applications and performed measurements were not blinded to the treatment allocation. Thus,
the beliefs and expectations of the investigators who performed the therapeutic and placebo
KT applications may have affected the measurements unknowingly. Despite this, we tried to be
as objective as possible in conducting this study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Simons</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name><name><surname>Travell</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Simons</surname><given-names>LS</given-names></name></person-group>: Travell &#x00026; Simons&#x02019; Myofascial pain and dysfunction: the trigger point
