It is characterized by the development of painful, recurring solitary, or multiple ulcers in the oral cavity and upper throat. The ulcers are usually multiple, small, round, or ovoid, with circumscribed margins, having yellow or gray floors and are surrounded by erythematous haloes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>RAS is classified into 3 types:</p><p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Minor RAS is also known as Miculiz's aphthae. Ulcers are usually less than 1 cm in size. Ulcers heal within 10-14 days without scarring.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Major RAS is also known as periadenitis mucosa necrotica recurrens or Sutton's disease. Ulcers exceed 1 cm in diameter. The ulcers persist for up to 6 weeks and heal with scarring.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Herpetiform ulceration is characterized by recurrent crops of multiple ulcers; may be up to 100 in number. These are small in size, measure 2-3 mm in diameter. Lesions may coalesce to form large irregular ulcers. These ulcers last for about 10-14 days.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>RAS is a multifactorial disease which can occur due to bacterial infections like infection with Streptococcus sanguis, immunologic abnormalities, nutritional deficiencies like iron, vitamin B12, folic acid deficiency, and certain precipitating factors like trauma, endocrine conditions, psychic, and allergic factors. Although the lesion is usually self-limited, its painful presentation, high frequency of occurrence, and multifactorial etiology leads to decreased quality of life and significant morbidity. So an efficient therapeutic strategy is needed to provide relief to the patients.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Current treatment modalities include use of topical steroids like Triamcinolone acetonide gel, which is a fluoride synthetic corticosteroid. As corticosteroids are known to get absorbed systemically even on topical application, they can lead to certain adverse reactions. So nowadays, herbal medicines are gaining more attention due to their decreased side effects.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Curcumin is a main pigment of principle spice in India, turmeric. It is bright yellow in color and is known from centuries for its strong antioxidant, antiseptic, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and analgesic properties. The anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin may be attributed to its ability to inhibit both biosynthesis of inflammatory prostaglandins which further blocks cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase activity, thereby inhibiting prostaglandin leukotriene release and neutrophil function during inflammatory states.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>So, the aim of this study was to assess and compare the efficacy of Curcumin with Triamcinolone acetonide in the gel form in treatment of RAS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study was a randomized, double blind, clinical trial and was carried out over a period of 6 months, from March 2013 to August 2013.

Patients were excluded from the study if the ulcers were present at inaccessible areas, if they had major RAS, traumatic ulcer, denture stomatitis or if they were suffering from any systemic illness. In order to minimize the effect of confounding variables in the psycho-physiological component of the study, the patients with any major illness in the past, or on any other topical or systemic medications were excluded from the study. Patients allergic to any constituents of gel used in the study, pregnant or lactating women were also excluded from the study.
