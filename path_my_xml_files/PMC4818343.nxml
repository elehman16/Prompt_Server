Ten participants underwent a crossover study (test and retest) with an intermittent running test. The test was composed of three-minute sets (at 1&#x000a0;km/h above Onset Blood Lactate Accumulation) until volitional exhaustion. To assess pace strategy change, in the first test participants chose the rest time interval (RTI) between sets (ranging from 30 to 60&#x000a0;s) and in the second test the maximum RTI values were either the RTI chosen in the first test (maximum RTI value), or less if desired. To verify the reproducibility of the test, rating perceived exertion (RPE), heart rate (HR) and blood plasma lactate concentration ([La]p) were collected at rest, immediately after each set and at the end of the tests. As results, RTI, RPE, HR, [La]p and time to exhaustion were not statistically different (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05) between test and retest, as well as they demonstrated good intraclass correlation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Pace strategy</kwd><kwd>High-intensity intermittent run test</kwd><kwd>Central and peripheral fatigue assessment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><bold>Specifications Table</bold><table-wrap id="t0005" position="float"><alt-text id="at0005">Table</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td>Subject area</td><td><italic>Sport Science,</italic></td></tr><tr><td>More specific subject area</td><td><italic>Psychology of Sport, Physiology of Sport</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Type of data</td><td><italic>Table, text file</italic></td></tr><tr><td>How data was acquired</td><td><italic>Borg scale (6&#x02013;20), Polar S810i, YSI 1500 Sport Lactate Analyzer &#x02122;</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Data format</td><td><italic>Analyzed</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Experimental factors</td><td><italic>Hemolyzed lactate concentration was determined enzymatically in whole blood, using a YSI 1500 lactate analyzer (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA).</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Experimental features</td><td><italic>Blood lactate was extracted from the ring finger of the participants&#x02019; right hand.</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Data source location</td><td><italic>S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil</italic></td></tr><tr><td>Data accessibility</td><td><italic>Data is supplied in this article</italic></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p><bold>Value of the data</bold><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0005"><label>&#x025cf;</label><p>To assess running pace strategy change.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x025cf;</label><p>To assess changes in recovery time length, between exercise bouts.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x025cf;</label><p>To assess time to exhaustion in an intermittent exercise.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x025cf;</label><p>This protocol might be used to assess performance status changes.</p></list-item></list></p><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Data</title><p>Reproducibility data of a high-intensity intermittent running test to assess changes in running pace strategy concomitant to central and peripheral variables related to fatigue onset are presented in <xref rid="s0060" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1 and 2</xref>.

All participants were amateur athletes, and all of them were used to running on treadmills.</p><p>Participants were instructed to refrain, at least 48&#x000a0;h from intense physical activity before the test; they were also instructed not to use any kind of food or substances that might interfere with the performance in the central nervous system or change physiological or biochemical parameters, such as alcohol or caffeine for at least 24&#x000a0;h before the test. In addition, 12&#x000a0;h before the test we provided the participants with a printed material that contained a standard high-carbohydrate (~70%&#x000a0;kcal), low fiber, and fat (~15%&#x000a0;kcal) diet that should be repeated on the crossover trial.

They came to the laboratory in three different occasions, always in the afternoon, at the same time of the day and the same day of the week (every Monday around 4:00 p.m.). Room temperature (&#x000b0;C) observed was around 23&#x000b1;3 and humidity (%) was of 70&#x000b1;5.</p><p>The first visit was to present the study design and to sign the informed consent form, followed by a first evaluation (anthropometric assessment; OBLA <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> and VO<sub>2</sub> max estimation) for the individualized prescription of the physical test intensity, in a motorized treadmill (Aegean 6200). In the second and the third visit to the laboratory, the tests to verify the reproducibility were carried out.</p></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>2.4</label><title>Determination of OBLA and VO<sub>2</sub> max estimation</title><p>This protocol is adapted from Denadai et al. <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> The participants completed a standard incremental treadmill test until volitional exhaustion (Aegean 6200, Porto Alegre, Brazil). The initial running speed was 10&#x000a0;km&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, with the treadmill grade set at 1%. Participants completed submaximal stages of 3-min, with 1&#x000a0;km&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increases between stages. At the end of each stage, participants jumped off to the sides of the treadmill belt. A right-hand finger capillary blood sample (100&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l) was taken within 20&#x02013;30&#x000a0;s, after which participants resumed running. Blood lactate concentration was analyzed by an automated analyzer (YSI 1500 Sport Lactate Analyzer &#x02122;). Heart rate was recorded during the whole test (Polar S810i). OBLA was determined according to Cheng et al. <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. VO<sub>2</sub>max was determined according to ACSM <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> metabolic equation for estimating gross VO<sub>2</sub> at running.</p></sec><sec id="s0035"><label>2.5</label><title>Laboratory running test</title><p>The test was performed in the same motorized treadmill (with 1% incline grade) where we analyzed the OBLA. The protocol consisted in a 9&#x000a0;min incremental warm up (e.g., a participant who had a OBLA speed at 15&#x000a0;km/h; began the warm up with three minutes at 12&#x000a0;km/h, followed by three minutes at 13&#x000a0;km/h and then three minutes at 14&#x000a0;km/h) followed by a 1-min walk interval. After the warm up, participants performed an intermittent run until volitional exhaustion, with sets of 3-minutes exercise bouts, interspersed with passive RTI determined by the participants in the first test (detailed description of the rest interval determination below). To induce a higher rate of metabolic and mental stress during the test <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> the intensity of the run was determined (by interpolation) at 1&#x000a0;km/h above the OBLA speed. (The mean &#x000b1;SD velocity (15.19&#x000b1;0.81&#x000a0;km&#x000a0;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) during the exercise bouts was a little higher than critical velocity <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>).</p><p>During all tests, the participants were encouraged by strong verbal stimulation to perform their maximum effort and they were informed of the exercise bout remaining time every 30&#x000a0;s.</p></sec><sec id="s0040"><label>2.6</label><title>The rest time interval</title><p>This variable has been created to test the possible changes in pace strategy, which might influence recovery between exercise bouts. For this, before the first test, participants were informed that in the first test they could choose the RTI between exercises bouts on the treadmill: the minimum RTI would be 30&#x000a0;s and the maximum would 60&#x000a0;s. Usually 60&#x000a0;s of RTI is sufficient to promote an increase of 100% in the total running distance when compared to continuous running (when exercise is performed at the similar intensity used in our protocol) <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. This occurs because RTI between high-intensity physical exercise series prevents RPE from reaching critical values early, i.e., restores the ability of the Central Nervous System (CNS) to stimulate muscle work, thus keeps the athlete engaged in the exercise <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>It has also been settled that the RTI values of the first test would be the maximum RTI of the next test, for example, if in the first test the RTI was 40&#x000a0;s between the first and second exercise bouts, and 50&#x000a0;s between the second and third exercise bouts, these same RTI values would be the maximum amount of RTI in the next test in their respective moments, (we believe that RTI control strategy ensured the test reproducibility). An important point is that the participants could rest less time if they feel like to resume the test and perform another set of 3&#x000a0;min of exercise (this idea was created to test the effectiveness of possible ergogenic interventions on RTI and consequently pace strategy). When the participants felt that they could not perform, or were not willing to try to perform another set of 3&#x000a0;min, the test was given as completed.</p></sec><sec id="s0045"><label>2.7</label><title>Materials and data collection procedures</title><p>Data collection was performed before the start of the test (<italic>i.e</italic>., at rest) immediately after each exercise bout and in the end.
