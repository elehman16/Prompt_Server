This may be related to the well-documented decline in the regular consumption of breakfast by this group. The regular consumption of a breakfast cereal offers a possible means to improve micronutrient status; fortified cereal is likely to have enhanced benefit. A study was conducted to determine the efficacy of the regular consumption of a fortified cereal with milk, compared with unfortified cereal, consumed either as a breakfast or a supper, in improving micronutrient intake and micronutrient status of adolescent girls.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention trial was conducted in girls recruited at ages 16&#x02013;19 years, from schools and colleges in Sheffield, UK. Girls were randomised to receive 50&#x000a0;g fortified or unfortified cereal, with 150&#x000a0;ml semi-skimmed milk, daily, for 12&#x000a0;weeks, as a breakfast or as a supper. Dietary intake was estimated using a 4-d food diary and blood collected for the assessment of nutritional status. Within-group changes were tested using a paired sample t test; two-way ANOVA was used to analyse effects of the intervention, with cereal type and time of consumption as factors, correcting for baseline values. The analysis was conducted on 71 girls who completed the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Consumption of unfortified cereal elicited an increase in the intake of vitamins B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub> and B<sub>6</sub>; consumption of fortified cereal elicited increases in vitamins B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, folate and iron (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and of vitamin D (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007), all increases were significantly greater than for unfortified cereal. Consumption of the fortified cereal also led to a significant improvement in biomarkers of status for vitamins B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, folate and of iron, compared with girls receiving the unfortified cereal, and maintained vitamin D status, in contrast with the girls receiving the unfortified cereal (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">The daily consumption of cereal with milk for 12&#x000a0;weeks by adolescent girls, increased intakes of micronutrients. The consumption of fortified cereal elicited greater increases than for unfortified cereal and improved biomarkers of micronutrient status. The findings justify strategies to encourage the consumption of fortified cereal with milk by adolescents, either as a breakfast or a supper.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par5">Registered with Current Controlled Trials (Registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/search?q=ISRCTN55141306">ISRCTN55141306</ext-link>)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Fortified cereal</kwd><kwd>Breakfast</kwd><kwd>Vitamin and mineral status</kwd><kwd>Micronutrients</kwd><kwd>Adolescents</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Kelloggs Company of Great Britain</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par6">Data from the National Diet and Nutrition Surveys (NDNS) of the UK indicate low intakes of some micronutrients and poor nutritional status among adolescent girls, with concern over vitamin B<sub>2</sub> (riboflavin), vitamin D, calcium and iron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Dietary data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) in the USA also show that adolescents are at higher risk of nutritional deficiencies than other age groups in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]<sub>.</sub> Some of these deficiencies may be of particular functional importance to adolescent females given that they are of childbearing age and that low micronutrient intakes in this group influence risk of anaemia, peak bone mass attainment and adverse effects in the offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Breakfast consumption by children and adolescents has declined over recent decades in many developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Milk consumption by children and adolescents in developed countries is also falling, and this is thought to associate with the declining trend in breakfast cereal consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] Studies of association have identified a number of correlates of breakfast consumption in adolescents. Cross sectional studies have reported associations between regular consumption of breakfast and parameters of a healthy lifestyle and some measures of nutritional status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Breakfast-skipping is associated with increased likelihood of being a smoker, of being a consumer of alcohol, of engaging in little exercise and having a higher BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the other hand, some studies report that breakfast consumers have higher energy consumption than non-consumers, and may be associated with an increase in the contribution of fat to total energy intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A cross&#x02013;sectional study in Belgium showed that the type of breakfast consumed was associated with the overall dietary intake profile in adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. There is some evidence that a breakfast of cereal may have particular value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] although it is not clear whether associations reported between breakfast cereal consumption and various biomarkers of health are attributable to the consumption of breakfast cereals per se, as part of a daily diet, or the consumption of the cereal as part of a breakfast meal.</p><p id="Par8">There is a definite gender bias in the decline of breakfast consumption, with girls significantly more likely to miss breakfast than boys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is also an age-related decline in breakfast consumption, with older adolescents more likely to miss breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Reasons often cited are lack of time, loss of appetite in the morning, tiredness or personal choice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Dieting and a desire to lose weight is another reason given for not eating breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">The lack of randomised controlled trials to examine hypotheses linking the regular consumption of breakfast cereals to particular health benefits is an obstacle to making specific dietary recommendations.</p><p id="Par10">The study reports that the daily consumption of a fortified cereal with milk, either at breakfast time or supper time for twelve weeks, elicits an increase in micronutrient intake and improvement in biomarkers of micronutrient status in adolescent girls who regularly skip breakfast, that is significantly greater than that observed by the consumption of unfortified cereal with milk. In contrast with girls receiving the unfortified cereal, all girls consuming the fortified cereal achieved the Recommended Nutrient Intake (RNI) for vitamins B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub> and folate, although they did not all achieve the RNI for iron, and no girl achieved the current RDA (USA) for vitamin D. The RNI reflects the intake considered to satisfy the requirements of 97.5&#x000a0;% of the age and gender-specific population group.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aim</title><p id="Par11">This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the regular consumption of fortified cereal with milk, compared with unfortified cereal, either as a breakfast or a supper, in improving micronutrient intake and micronutrient status of adolescent girls who self-report regularly skipping breakfast.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypotheses</title><p id="Par12">We hypothesised that the regular consumption of a fortified breakfast cereal with milk by adolescent girls who often skip breakfast will elicit an increased intake of some micronutrients and improvement in biomarkers of micronutrient status, compared with unfortified cereal.

They had to have no diagnosed illness and have low measures of riboflavin status and haemoglobin, as these have previously been found to track well with self-reported breakfast skipping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par17">Potential participants were not recruited if they used multivitamin or iron supplements, had donated blood in the previous 6&#x000a0;months, were pregnant or breast feeding or had an allergy to wheat, barley or milk.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Screening</title><p id="Par18">Recruitment to the study used a website which invited girls who self-reported skipping breakfast at least four times a week. Girls who responded were then screened for low riboflavin status and poor iron status. A screening visit was held to confirm eligibility, to answer any queries and concerns, to take consent, to collect additional information (such as date of birth, address and medication usage) and to take a small finger prick sample (~100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l) for the measurement of riboflavin and iron status. Consent was taken for both the screening and the main intervention study. Blood samples were analysed for riboflavin status using the erythrocyte glutathione reductase activation coefficient assay (EGRAC) and hemoglobin concentration measured on-site using a portable Hemocue device (Hemocue Hb 201+ DM System, Hemocure, AB, Sweden). EGRAC is the most commonly used biomarker for riboflavin status. Samples with a low riboflavin status have a higher EGRAC value. An EGRAC value of &#x0003e;1.30 is conventionally used to indicate poor riboflavin status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this study, girls with an EGRAC value &#x0003e;1.40 and a hemoglobin of &#x0003c;137&#x000a0;g/L were eligible for the main study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par19">Sample size was based on improvement in riboflavin status following the consumption of a fortified cereal with milk. Findings from the RIBOFEM study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] showed that a supplement of 2&#x000a0;mg riboflavin per day for 8&#x000a0;weeks in young women elicits a fall in EGRAC of 0.25. This cereal study would provide 1.7&#x000a0;mg riboflavin per day for 12&#x000a0;weeks to adolescent girls, in addition to habitual dietary intake. It was anticipated that the intervention would achieve a similar fall in EGRAC and that the baseline SD would be&#x02009;~&#x02009;0.20 on the basis of the RIBOFEM study. Standardised effect size was estimated to be 1.56. It was estimated that we would need 17 girls for each of 4 groups (cereal type and time of intervention) allowing for a possible 25&#x000a0;% dropout in this age and gender group. We therefore aimed to recruit 70 girls to the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Cereal</title><p id="Par20">The cereal, supplied by Kellogg Marketing and Sales Company, was a wheat, rice and barley-based flake similar to their Special K cereal supplied in the UK.

Of these, 78 girls agreed to take part in the main study. Five girls failed to complete the main study (one was withdrawn because of iron deficiency anaemia diagnosed by the Royal Hallamshire Hospital Haematology Department). Data are shown and analyses were conducted on data from 71 girls for whom there was a complete dataset. Of these, 37 girls had been randomised to receive unfortified cereal, 34 to receive fortified cereal. The main study was run alongside the screening and took place over 11&#x000a0;months between July 2012 and May 2013.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Study protocol</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12937_2016_185_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

The beneficial effects were seen whether the cereal with milk was consumed in the morning or the evening. The consumption of unfortified cereal with milk also showed some benefit but this was restricted to a few nutrients and was modest compared with the fortified cereal. This observation is important because previous statements about the health benefits of breakfast consumption in any age group have relied almost entirely on observational studies, which could only show associations. Girls taking part in the study had micronutrient intake and status profiles comparable with those reported in the NDNS, so the findings can be considered relevant to their gender and age group.</p><p id="Par52">After 12&#x000a0;weeks of consuming a fortified cereal with milk each day all girls achieved intakes of at least RNI for all micronutrients except for iron and calcium. Intakes were still lower than the DRI for folate and vitamin D for all the girls. Several observational studies have shown that regular breakfast consumption among young people is associated with higher intakes of some micronutrients, including folate, vitamin D, calcium, iron and zinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], although details of the type of breakfast consumed are often lacking. Concern has been expressed about a low intake of vitamin D in some sections of the UK population, and there is evidence for poor vitamin D status in some groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; low intakes of this vitamin in adolescents are reported for several other European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Vitamin D intake increased significantly in the girls receiving the fortified cereal and this was sufficient to maintain vitamin D status over the period of the intervention, in contrast with the girls receiving the unfortified cereal, in whom vitamin D status fell during the study. This is important because there are few good dietary sources of vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and people living in the Northern hemisphere generally show a decline in plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D during the winter months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The study was conducted during winter and summer months, when potential for dermal synthesis of vitamin D would have been different but the block randomisation method would have minimised differences in any seasonal effect on vitamin D synthesis between the groups. The regular consumption of a cereal fortified with vitamin D could make a useful contribution to dietary vitamin D and evidently has the potential to mitigate the seasonal deterioration in vitamin D status.</p><p id="Par53">This simple intervention had a clear beneficial effect in terms of nutrient intake in this vulnerable group. This was true whether the cereal was consumed in the morning or the evening, offering potentially important flexibility in terms of a public health message.</p><p id="Par54">There is very limited evidence that the consumption of a fortified breakfast cereal leads to an improvement in micronutrient status, due to the lack of randomised controlled trials. Tucker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] conducted a study in adults aged 50-85y, focussed on effects of fortified cereal on plasma homocysteine concentration. They reported improvements in vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, B<sub>12</sub> and folate status as well as a decrease in homocysteine concentration. Whilst this is of interest, adolescents are more likely to skip breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], making it particularly important to demonstrate beneficial effects of breakfast cereal consumption in this group. In our trial, compared with the girls receiving unfortified cereal, consumption of the fortified cereal led to significant improvements in biomarkers of vitamin B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, vitamin D and folate status as well as plasma ferritin, a biomarker of hepatic iron stores. Despite the increase in iron stores elicited by the fortified cereal intervention compared with the unfortified cereal, no increase in hemoglobin was observed and there was no difference in hemoglobin concentration between the two groups following the intervention. An increase in iron stores following the intervention would suggest that iron delivery to the site of hemoglobin synthesis was adequate, and that hemoglobin synthesis was not compromised at the outset. Additional available iron in the diet would then be stored as hepatic iron. There were no differences in mean hemoglobin at baseline between the cereal groups but fewer girls receiving fortified cereal had low hemoglobin (&#x0003c;12&#x000a0;g/L), which may have influenced ferritin responses in this group. An intervention study carried out in New Zealand among women with low iron stores, demonstrated a beneficial effect on iron status of consuming an iron-fortified breakfast cereal together with kiwi fruit, which has a high vitamin C content, compared with cereal consumed with banana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Although a direct comparison of this study with the present study is difficult to make, given differences in age of the women, and iron status at the outset, the results suggest that the vitamin C content of fortified cereal may be inadequate to maximise absorption of cereal iron.</p><p id="Par55">There is very little information available regarding the nutritional status of adolescent breakfast consumers compared with non-consumers. The majority of studies have paid more attention to obesity and measures of metabolic health than biomarkers of nutritional status. A recent study of younger children in Cyprus reported no difference in plasma ferritin concentration between consumers and non-consumers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">Despite the unequivocal improvement in micronutrient status in the girls receiving fortified cereal, and the decrease in the percentage of girls falling below the biomarker thresholds for normality, the improvement was insufficient to bring all girls into the normal range for conventional biomarkers of status except for folate. The normalisation of folate status is of particular relevance to this study population, given the importance of good folate status to healthy pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Girls consuming cereal in the evening showed a small but significant increase in weight, which was not seen in the girls consuming cereal in the morning. The two-way ANOVA, correcting for baseline values, did not reveal any difference between groups, suggesting that undue emphasis should not be placed on the within-group finding. It is possible that cereal consumed in the evening is less likely to displace other foods, but this was not reflected in a significant increase in energy intake in the evening consumers. Others have explored effects of breakfast habits on energy intake and there have been several reports that breakfast skipping causes a compensatory increase in energy intake later in the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. There may be differences in physical activity following cereal consumed as a breakfast or as a supper. Betts et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] recently reported that daily breakfast consumption was associated with an increase in energy expenditure during the morning of the breakfast. The mean weight gain reported in our study was small and it will be important to know whether this was maintained or lost if evening cereal consumption was sustained over a longer period.</p><p id="Par58">The cereal and milk intervention led to a modest but significant decrease in the proportion of dietary fat as a percentage of total energy intake and an increase in the proportion of energy derived from carbohydrate. This, together with the lack of increase in energy intake suggests that the cereal may have displaced fat-rich foods from the diet of these girls. This is compatible with the findings of Deshmuk-Taskar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], who reported a lower intake of fat and a higher intake of carbohydrate in children and adolescents who consumed ready to eat breakfast cereal (RTEC) compared with non-consumers. There is also a small literature suggesting that breakfast consumption may influence snacking behaviour such as to reduce energy intake from snacks and reduce snacking frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Utter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] reported that skipping breakfast is associated with a greater frequency of snacking in New Zealand teenagers. It is possible that the cereal and milk intervention had the effect of reducing the consumption of fat-rich snacks; this is the subject of further investigation. Before the intervention, analysis indicated a significant interaction between various measures of carbohydrate intake; this seemed to be a result of between-group differences in mean values (not-significant) for these variables at baseline. The interaction was not evident post-intervention and we do not ascribe particular significance to the observation.</p><p id="Par59">In conclusion, the daily consumption of a micronutrient-fortified breakfast cereal for 12&#x000a0;weeks, in the morning or the evening, by adolescent girls in the UK, improved status indices for vitamins B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>12</sub>, folate, and iron. For each of these micronutrients this effect was significantly greater than benefits of consuming a non-fortified cereal. Vitamin D status was maintained in girls consuming fortified cereal in contrast with a decline seen in girls consuming unfortified cereal. Consuming cereal in the evening, whether fortified or non-fortified, elicited a modest weight gain but this was not associated with an increase in energy intake. To our knowledge this is the only randomised controlled trial of cereal intervention in adolescents reporting on dietary intake and micronutrient status. These findings are relevant across age and gender groups but have particular importance during the transition from childhood to adolescence, which is generally associated with less healthy dietary choices. The findings contribute to our understanding of the value of developing strategies to encourage the regular consumption of breakfast cereal in adolescents.</p><sec id="Sec47"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p id="Par60">Dietary intake was estimated using 4-day diet diaries, supported by food portion booklets; the use of weighed records would have produced more reliable data but the additional burden would probably have reduced ease of recruitment to the study and jeopardised compliance. In retrospect it would have been useful to have determined energy expenditure before and during the intervention, given the reported influence of breakfast consumption on morning energy expenditure. However, this would have entailed a significant demand on participants and may have reduced compliance. It may also have been useful to have explored the prevalence of mis-reporting of dietary data, although this is a complex subject to examine and the randomisation design should have minimised the impact on the main findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Strengths of the study</title><p id="Par61">To our knowledge this is the only randomised placebo controlled intervention trial that has attempted to determine the effects of consuming breakfast cereal and milk on micronutrient intake and status in adolescents. The separation of the intervention into a morning and an evening consumption added value in that this allowed us to demonstrate the potential benefits of consuming cereal with milk in an evening as an alternative to morning consumption.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Kelloggs Company of Great Britain provided the cereal for the study and financial support for the research.
