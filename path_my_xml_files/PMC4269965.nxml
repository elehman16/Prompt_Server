Policy initiatives promote the adoption of information technologies to engage patients in care. We developed a theory-driven interactive preventive health record (IPHR) to engage patients in health promotion. The model defines five levels of functionality: (1) collecting patient information, (2) integrating with electronic health records (EHRs), (3) translating information into lay language, (4) providing individualized, guideline-based clinical recommendations, and (5) facilitating patient action. It is hypothesized that personal health records (PHRs) with these higher levels of functionality will inform and activate patients in ways that simpler PHRs cannot. However, realizing this vision requires both technological advances and effective implementation based upon clinician and practice engagement.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>We are starting a two-phase, mixed-method trial to evaluate whether the IPHR is scalable across a large number of practices and how its uptake differs for minority and disadvantaged patients. In phase 1, 40 practices from three practice-based research networks will be randomized to add IPHR functionality to their PHR versus continue to use their existing PHR. Throughout the study, we will engage intervention practices to locally tailor IPHR content and learn how to integrate new functions into their practice workflow. In phase 2, the IPHR to all nonintervention practices to observe whether the IPHR can be implemented more broadly (Scalability). Phase 1 will feature an implementation assessment in intervention practices, based on the RE-AIM model, to measure Reach (creation of IPHR accounts by patients), Adoption (practice decision to use the IPHR), Implementation (consistency, fidelity, barriers, and facilitators of use), and Maintenance (sustained use). The incremental effect of the IPHR on receipt of cancer screening tests and shared decision-making compared to traditional PHRs will assess Effectiveness. In phase 2, we will assess similar outcomes as phase 1 except for effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will yield information about the effectiveness of new health information technologies designed to actively engage patients in their care as well as information about how to effectively implement and disseminate PHRs by engaging clinicians.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02138448">NCT02138448</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-014-0181-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Health promotion</kwd><kwd>Information management</kwd><kwd>Informatics</kwd><kwd>Primary health care</kwd><kwd>Patient-centered care</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Evidence-based preventive services for the early detection of cancer and other health conditions offer profound health benefits, yet Americans receive only half of indicated services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancers are the leading causes of U.S. cancer deaths, claiming 127,860 lives annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Though many forms of cancer screening can reduce mortality, a sizable proportion of the eligible population does not receive recommended screening tests. Only 54% of adults are up-to-date with colorectal cancer screening, 74% with breast cancer screening, and 80% with cervical cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Less than half of adults are up-to-date with clinical preventive services generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and the gap is even more pronounced among low-income Americans and racial and ethnic minorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A variety of barriers affect patients, clinicians, and health-care systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients may be unaware that they need screening, lack motivation to be tested, or face logistical challenges. Clinicians may not promote needed tests due to oversight, lack of time, and/or competing demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The health system is fragmented and often lacks resources, financing, and support to close these gaps. Cancer screening has the added challenge of requiring shared decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and individualized risk assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] to determine at what age to start or stop screening, how often to rescreen, which test to use (e.g., colonoscopy versus stool blood test), or whether to screen at all (e.g., PSA testing) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Confusion is compounded by inconsistencies among guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], weak evidence supporting some screening tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and public over-enthusiasm for screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Some of these problems might be alleviated by health information technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], especially personal health records (PHRs). Some PHRs can offer patients direct access to their electronic health record (EHR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which is empowering, speeds access to past screening dates and results, and enables patients to discover potential inaccuracies in their record. The next generation of PHRs could offer even higher functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]&#x02014;they could be programmed to apply evidence-based guidelines to assess prevention needs and to incorporate personal data to shape individualized recommendations. The modern information age can enable patients to link prevention guidelines with evidence-based educational resources and decision aids, community services, logistical details, and reminders. Automation has the potential to ease the information burden on clinicians and empower patients with better information. Additionally, while early EHR adopters documented that because of the digital divide, at-risk populations less frequently used PHRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the digital divide has been steadily closing&#x02014;particularly for mobile applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Many leading disparities experts now embrace technology as having potential to reduce disparities in care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>There is, however, a shortage of objective evidence that PHRs can achieve these lofty aims. A minority of patients have a PHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and most PHRs lack the enhanced functionality described above. The PHRs that connect patients with their medical record often fail to explain content in lay language. Some PHRs offer cancer screening recommendations but rely on simple age- and gender-based logic, ignoring other risk factors. There is little empirical evidence about adoption of highly functional PHRs in typical clinical settings, whether a range of patients will use such systems, what functions patients will use, and how use will be incorporated into practice workflow and patient care.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Improving functionality of patient health records</title><p>We propose an innovative solution to the above problems based on a conceptual model that defined five levels of functionality to make information technology patient-centered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These levels include: (1) collecting patient reported information, (2) collecting existing clinical information from EHRs, (3) translating medical information into lay language, (4) providing individualized recommendations by applying information to evidence-based guidelines, and (5) facilitating informed patient action through embedded information resources and tools. We created an innovative application that can be added to existing PHRs, known as an Interactive Preventive Health Record (IPHR), which features these five levels of functionality and is currently integrated into several major EHRs and PHRs (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.MyPreventiveCare.org">www.MyPreventiveCare.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>In brief, the IPHR addresses 18 clinical preventive services, including screening tests, counseling services, preventive medications, and immunizations recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Patients are able to access the IPHR through their practice&#x02019;s PHR, through a single sign-on integration that links the IPHR to the patient&#x02019;s EHR record&#x02014;essentially, the IPHR will function as a seamless application within the existing practice PHR. The IPHR extracts hundreds of clinical data elements to individualize preventive recommendations. Patients also complete a health risk assessment to provide information not available in the EHR but necessary for making preventive service recommendations. Based on this information and the USPSTF guidelines, the IPHR applies programmed logic to generate a personally tailored list of recommendations. The interface offers patients&#x02019; hyperlinks to detailed personal messages that explain the preventive service and its rationale; relates relevant details in the patient&#x02019;s history (e.g., prior laboratory test values and dates) to the personalized recommendations; incorporates motivational interviewing content; includes links to evidence-based educational material, decision aids, and local resources based on each patient&#x02019;s profile; and summarizes the next steps. Message content is modeled after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Healthfinder.gov">www.Healthfinder.gov</ext-link> and incorporates feedback from patient usability tests, clinician focus groups, and longitudinal patient and clinician advisory boards where stakeholders function as co-investigators to help create and update content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Content can be further tailored to meet individual user&#x02019;s needs (e.g., low health literacy content, large print, audio, culturally appropriate images, local resources, free or subsidized services, visual displays for mobile devices). After patients use the IPHR, the system automatically forwards a summary to the EHR inbox of the patient&#x02019;s clinician for appropriate follow-up.</p><p>Currently, most commercial PHRs can deliver only the levels 1 and 2 functions (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) described in our model and sometimes, elements of level 4 (basic age- and gender-based recommendations). However, prior research suggests that the other functions&#x02014;translating content into lay language (level 3), robust personalized recommendations (level 4), and facilitating informed patient action (level 5)&#x02014;are essential to promote cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Successful implementation in the clinical environment requires local tailoring, redesign of practice systems, and care coordination with the patient&#x02019;s team of caregivers (i.e., personal clinician, nurses, and support staff). As with any implementation strategy that requires local tailoring, the scalability of implementing such a system must be examined.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The first was a randomized controlled trial to test whether mailing patients an invitation to use the IPHR increased delivery of services (R18 HS17046-01, Efficacy Trial, 2007&#x02013;2010) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Two prospective, observational time-series analyses expanded IPHR implementation to an entire primary care practice population in eight practices (R21 HS018811-01, Adoption Trial, 2010&#x02013;2012) and to six additional practices in Virginia (RFTO #17 290-07-100113, Implementation Trial, 2009&#x02013;2011) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. These studies culminated in the production of a <italic>How-to Guide for Using Patient-Centered Personal Health Records for Prevention,</italic> which is being disseminated nationally by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and which will inform this project&#x02019;s implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our findings demonstrate that the IPHR is technically feasible, increases delivery of preventive services for patients enrolled in a controlled trial, and can be fielded to an entire primary care population. However, these tests occurred in a small group of Virginia practices with a relatively homogenous patient population.</p><p>Through these studies, the IPHR was integrated into three EHRs (EpicCare&#x02122;, Enterprise&#x02122;, and Professional&#x02122;) that represent 31% of the U.S. EHR market share [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. The IPHR has also been integrated into two commercial PHR platforms (MyChart&#x02122; and FollowMyHealth&#x02122;). Currently, more than 70,000 patients and 190 clinicians are using the IPHR. With this integration, practices successfully incorporated the IPHR into their workflow&#x02014;using it to prepare patients for visits, augment health behavior counseling discussions, explain test results, issue automatic patient reminders for overdue services, prompt clinicians about services patients need during encounters, and formulate personalized prevention plans. However, considerable variation was documented, from 2% to 60%, in the proportion of clinicians&#x02019; patients who used the IPHR.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a two-phase, mixed-method trial designed to assess implementation (phase 1) and scalability (phase 2) with an embedded &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; comparative effectiveness trial of a traditional PHR versus a PHR with added IPHR functionality (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> for the CONSORT study flow diagram).

The network includes practices from seven health systems; using dozen of EHRs; located in rural, suburban, and urban settings; and with a range of practice organizational and ownership structures. For the purposes of this study, we are focusing on nine practices from the Virginia Commonwealth University Health System (VCUHS), allowing us to integrate the IPHR with one EHR/PHR that is housed on one server. The VCUHS practices are located in inner city Richmond and serve a predominantly African-American population. <italic>RIOS Net</italic> is a voluntary collaboration of clinicians serving southwest New Mexico&#x02019;s low-income, medically under-served, and culturally diverse communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Members include 250 primary care clinicians from academic, Indian health, community health, and private clinics. Similar to ACORN, we will focus on recruiting 21 practices from the University of New Mexico health system that utilize the same EHR/PHR. The <italic>OCHIN</italic> is a nonprofit Health Center Controlled Network headquartered in Portland Oregon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. It is a collaborative of over 70 primary health-care systems that operate more than 200 clinics across the United States. OCHIN members are community health centers (CHCs), including federally qualified health centers, rural sites, and school-based health centers. All OCHIN practices will be eligible for participation given that they use the same EHR/PHR housed on a central server.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention and control conditions</title><p>Forty practices will be recruited to participate in phase 1, which will be conducted over the span of 1&#x000a0;year. Eligible practices are those who have had an EHR for at least 6&#x000a0;months, currently have a PHR, and agree to participate. The decision to participate will be made by practices and, by extension, their clinicians. A representative from each practice will provide consent to participate through a memorandum of understanding. Randomization will be done by the biostatistician and research coordinator using a modified blocked design. To preserve allocation concealment, practices will be matched into paired clusters based on their associated health system, percent of Medicaid patients, and percent of practice PHR users and then randomized into the intervention and control conditions on a 1:1 ratio.</p><p>The intervention consists of the technical integration of the IPHR into the EHR/PHR, modification of IPHR content to support disadvantaged populations, practice implementation of IPHR functions, and ongoing practice adaptation to use the IPHR. A key element of this study will be to engage intervention practice clinicians, patients, and experts as co-investigators throughout.

This will include ensuring that all the required patient data elements for making preventive care recommendations are passed from the EHR to the IPHR, creating links to the IPHR through the practice&#x02019;s existing PHR, transmitting IPHR clinician summaries and alerts into the practice&#x02019;s EHR, and locally tailoring IPHR content to meet each practice&#x02019;s specific resources and needs.</p><p>Once technically integrated, all clinicians and staff at intervention sites will be asked to encourage adult patients age 18&#x02013;75 to use their PHR with its new IPHR features. Three theories will be used to engage the study practices and facilitate cultural and workflow changes necessary to successfully adopt the new IPHR functionality. From Organizational Change Theory, study staff will help practices to: (1) convey a sense of priority for IPHR use, (2) form a guiding coalition, (3) develop and communicate a shared vision, (4) empower practices to act on their vision, (5) plan for short-term wins, and (6) consolidate improvements and institutionalize success [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Organizational Change Theory has been successfully employed for implementing a range of practice changes as well as for adopting the use of health information technology (HIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. In addition, drawing from Complex Adaptive Systems Theory, study staff will encourage practices to adopt a variety of solutions, experimenting with and evolving their implementation strategy according to individual practice needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Finally, using concepts consistent with Diffusion of Innovations Theory, which identifies features that speed adoption, study staff will locally tailor the IPHR in order to ensure that the IPHR is advantageous to practices, provides a better way to deliver prevention, improves quality of care, improves information in the EHR, and is easy to use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>].</p><p>To operationalize these theories, practices will be provided with benchmarking, feedback, practice facilitation, online diaries, and learning collaboratives to set priorities, share experiences, and institutionalize successes. Specifically, three groups of practice champions will be assembled, one in each network. Groups will consist of a clinician, nurse, staff, or office manager from each intervention site. Each group will participate in eight learning collaboratives&#x02014;four sessions in the 4&#x000a0;months prior to adopting the IPHR and four in the year after. Learning collaboratives will be led by the practice liaisons from the PBRNs and follow an agenda successfully used in two prior AHRQ studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Throughout the process, study staff and champions will collaborate to determine strategies to facilitate implementation. A second site champion will also post biweekly diary entries via email throughout the project. This will be another method to engage stakeholders for input. The research team will read entries in real time, provide feedback to the champion, and discuss message content at research meetings. This methodology was successfully used to evaluate the implementation of 27 interventions in over 200 practices as part of a 5-year RWJF-funded initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p><p>Practices randomized to the control condition will deliver &#x0201c;usual&#x0201d; cancer screening and &#x0201c;usual&#x0201d; PHR functionality. The networks currently use commercial EHRs/PHRs with levels 1, 2, and (partial) 4 functionality. Control practices will institute ordinary PHR updates. No practices will be in a control condition in phase 2, which follows completion of the randomized trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection</title><p>Twelve data sources will be used to address the questions in our three specific aims: EHR data, IPHR data, PHR data, practice records, network records, practice surveys, champion surveys, learning collaborative observations and transcripts, practice recruitment assessments, practice diaries, patient surveys, and patient phone interviews.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>EHR, IPHR, and PHR databases</title><p>The EHR, IPHR, and PHR databases will play a central role in assessing all three aims. Every 6&#x000a0;months during phase 1 and annually during phase 2, network IT staff will transfer EHR data to the research database manager for all patients age 18&#x02013;75 who make an office visit. Throughout the data transfer process, a standard data transfer protocol will be used that allows us to link patients and their practices across all 12 data sources while maximizing the patients&#x02019; privacy and confidentiality. EHR data elements will include patient identification number, age, gender, race-ethnicity, diagnostic codes, family history, orders, screening test dates, and test results. IPHR/PHR data elements will include patient identification number and dates of use. The EHR database will capture data for all patients, irrespective of whether they establish an IPHR or PHR account, whereas the IPHR and PHR databases will contain information only about users.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Practice records, network notes, and recruitment assessment</title><p>ACORN, OCHIN, and RIOS Net currently collect annual inventories that include basic information about clinicians&#x02014;e.g., age, gender, degree, years in practice, full-time equivalent&#x02014;modeled after the Primary Care Network Survey used by AHRQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].

Responses will be used as covariates to evaluate Implementation. Surveys will be collected at baseline and 1&#x000a0;year after adopting the IPHR. Questions will address perceptions of preventive care and shared decision-making, perceptions of health information technology, barriers and facilitators to implementing the IPHR, consistency of IPHR implementation, IPHR adaptation over time, and practice culture. We will use questions from (a) the Information Systems Expectations and Experiences (I-SEE) Survey to assess elements of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)&#x02014;a validated pre- and post-implementation survey associated with increased uptake of HIT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] (b) an assessment of barriers for adopting HIT; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] (c) the reciprocal learning scale&#x02014;an organizational culture characteristic uniquely related to successful HIT implementation and organizational change; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and the Patient-Centered Medical Home Assessment (PCMH-A) that address practice workflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Champion survey</title><p>A small group of clinicians, nurses, and support staff (2&#x02013;3 people) from intervention and control practices will complete a baseline workflow and HIT infrastructure assessment.

A sample of 2,000 patients with office visits in the first 6&#x000a0;months of the trial and 2,000 with office visits in the second 6&#x000a0;months of the trial will be randomly selected to receive surveys. Because the purpose of the study centers on cancer screening, the survey sampling frame will be males age 50&#x02013;75 and females age 40&#x02013;75, stratified by age, gender, practice, and PHR use (to include a minimum of 50% PHR users for the subgroup analysis). The modified Dillman method will be used to optimize the response rate for the mail survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Surveys will be mailed on practice stationery and in practice envelopes and include a $1 incentive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p><p>As part of the comparative effectiveness evaluation (outcome #2), surveys will assess components of shared decision-making&#x02014;knowledge, communication, decisional conflict, and locus of control. Surveys will include a separate set of questions for colorectal, breast, cervical, and prostate cancer screening. National Cancer Institute&#x02019;s (NCI&#x02019;s) Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) will assess knowledge gained by using the IPHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Questions will address general knowledge about the cancers, screening tests, screening recommendations, and risks and benefits of screening. To assess whether the IPHR helps patients weigh values regarding risks and benefits, measures of both (a) process (patient-clinician communication) and (b) patient perception (decisional conflict) will be used. Questions from AHRQ&#x02019;s Consumer Assessment of HealthCare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) survey will be used to measure communication. These questions address the quality of the clinician-patient interaction as well as how often clinicians explained cancer screening, listened carefully, provided understandable instructions, knew the patient&#x02019;s medical history, and spent enough time with the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. O&#x02019;Connor&#x02019;s low literacy decisional conflict scale will be used to measure patient perspective on whether values were weighed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]-[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Decisional conflict assesses the patient&#x02019;s uncertainty, how well informed they feel, whether they have clarified their values, and whether they feel supported. To assess whether the IPHR fosters decision-making engagement at the desired level, Degner&#x02019;s locus of control metric will be used to assess patients&#x02019; desired and actual level of involvement in recent cancer screening decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>],[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>].

In addition, learning collaboratives will serve as a setting to engage the clinicians in the development IPHR content and implementation strategies.

Diary keepers will be trained on how to use the online diaries during locally based and virtual kickoff meetings in year 1. Diary keepers will be asked to make entries biweekly and share observations and experiences regarding IPHR tailoring, use and adaptation; general and IPHR-specific information about patient engagement in preventive care; and issues related to sustained use of the practice PHR and IPHR.

It remains to be seen whether clinicians can accomplish this daunting task. It is also unknown whether these efforts will pay off in terms of improved care and health outcomes. We believe that patient-centered PHRs with higher levels of functionality, combined with practice redesign to make use of these functions, can help patients obtain recommended preventive care by linking them to their doctor&#x02019;s records, explaining information in lay language, displaying tailored recommendations and educational resources, providing logistical support and tools to stimulate action, and generating reminders. Appropriate delivery of these evidence-based services should reduce the burdens of chronic disease and prevent premature death.</p><p>This project will measure whether making these resources available to primary care practices and patients promotes shared decision-making and increases the delivery of recommended preventive services compared to existing information systems. Specifically, it will yield needed information about the effectiveness of new health information technologies designed to more actively engage patients in their care as well as information about how to most effectively implement and disseminate PHRs. If the integration of an IPHR into primary care practice is proven effective and scalable, our study findings will have wide ranging practice and policy implications.</p><p>We incorporated several important design features to ensure that this study has the potential for maximum impact. For example, the two-phased design allows us to conduct a comparative effectiveness evaluation of current PHR functionality versus embedding more personalized IPHR content followed by a scalability assessment to determine the feasibility and process of broadly integrating IPHR functionality into a wide range of primary care practices. Second, our mixed-method design will provide a robust set of data to understand from multiple perspectives the issues associated with engaging patients in PHR use. This evaluation is proving timely given the recent Stage 2 Meaningful Use requirements. Third, because many of our study practices serve a range of disadvantaged populations, this study will allow us to examine disparities in IPHR and PHR use and how potential disparities in use of these HIT tools might influence outcomes in care. Finally, a core element of our study design is to engage key stakeholders throughout the research project as co-investigators&#x02014;clinicians, patients, and experts&#x02014;using a variety of robust methods to ensure that IPHR content meets users&#x02019; needs, implementation is integrated into practice workflow, outcomes assessed are meaningful for users, interpretation of findings is guided by users&#x02019; experiences, and the voice of our users is incorporated into dissemination activities. Through collaboration with our stakeholders, we hope to ensure our research directions address the prominent concerns of primary care and patients.</p><p>Collectively, the above research study design features strike a balance between the fidelity to our interventions that is typically required for internal validity and the need for quality improvement to embrace both individual variation and customization. This National Cancer Institute-funded study is forging the way in striking a balance between these tensions to ensure that our research can be translated to clinical practice in a timely manner.</p><p>We recognize that our study has several limitations. While the goal is to improve the delivery of preventive care for all patients, we expect that only a subset of patients will use the IPHR or even the practice&#x02019;s PHR. We expect that in the future, more and more patients will seek health information online. For the purposes of this study, we are assessing how practices increase their patient&#x02019;s portal use (Reach). We will also engage patients throughout IPHR refinement to ensure that content is accessible, understandable, and meaningful as well as create mobile ready content that can be accessed on a smartphone. Another study challenge is the broad geographical distribution of our study practices. This makes it more difficult to meaningfully engage local stakeholders, ensure study protocols are carried out as designed, and conduct observational assessments. We plan to use several strategies to mitigate this limitation such as standardizing study materials, using established PBRN infrastructure, building on prior practice relationships, developing methods to promote virtual participation in learning collaboratives (e.g., use of video meetings), and sharing experiences between the three PBRNs.</p><p>PHRs hold great potential to improve patient education, promote shared decision-making, facilitate more in-depth conversations, and generally engage patients in their care. However, more is needed from PHRs and from the patients, clinicians, and practices using the PHRs in order to achieve the desired outcomes. This study will evaluate whether making PHRs more patient-centered improves outcomes and it will generate needed evidence about how to engage patients online in primary care.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images</title><p>Below are the links to the authors&#x02019; original submitted files for images.<media position="anchor" xlink:href="13012_2014_181_MOESM1_ESM.gif" id="MOESM1"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 1</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13012_2014_181_MOESM2_ESM.gif" id="MOESM2"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 2</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13012_2014_181_MOESM3_ESM.gif" id="MOESM3"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 3</p></caption></media><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13012_2014_181_MOESM4_ESM.docx" id="MOESM4"><caption><p>Authors&#x02019; original file for figure 4</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contribution</bold></p><p>AK is the principle investigator for the project, led the project development, and drafted the manuscript.
