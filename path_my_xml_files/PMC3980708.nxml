Since 1997, <italic>Annals of Internal Medicine</italic>, <italic>BMJ</italic>, <italic>JAMA</italic>, <italic>Lancet</italic>, and <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> have been assessed to see if results are placed in context and, more recently, to see if systematic reviews are used to justify the trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We assessed each May 2012 issue of these journals to identify reports of randomized trials. Introduction sections were categorised as first trial, updated systematic review used in the design, systematic review mentioned, other trials mentioned, and no other trials mentioned with no claim to be the first trial. Discussion sections were categorised as first trial, systematic review integrating the new trial, systematic review mentioned, and no apparent systematic attempt to place findings in full context.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>35 reports of randomized trials were included. Introduction sections: 5 were said to be the first trial, 1 used an updated systematic review in the design, 13 discussed previous systematic reviews, 10 mentioned other trials, and 6 didn't mention other trials or claim to be the first. Discussion sections: 2 were said to be the first trial, 2 contained a systematic review integrating the new trial, 11 mentioned a systematic review, and 20 made no apparent systematic attempt to place findings in full context. There was variability across the journals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Many trials still don't use systematic reviews in their design and reporting.</p></sec></body></article>
