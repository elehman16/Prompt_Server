Nevertheless, there is evidence that physical exercise is an important non-pharmacological component of the clinical control of asthma in both children[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and adults [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Recent studies have demonstrated that aerobic exercise improves their exercise capacity [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and reduces airway inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, the treatment of a chronic disease that involves continual physical training can be discouraging. This seems especially important for children, since better performance and greater energy expenditure require an intrinsic motivation for physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Changes in lifestyle in the latter half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century have raised concerns, since four fifths of children and adolescents do not follow public health guidelines regarding the recommended levels of physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although new technologies have hugely affected the increasing sedentary lifestyle amongst young people, technologies, such as active video game systems with a high degree of energy expenditure [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], have also been employed therapeutically to stimulate activities amongst both pediatric and adult patients [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Studies involving obese adolescents have demonstrated the benefits of this therapeutic resource to improve body composition[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, no previous studies have been carried out assessing the use of active video games for the rehabilitation of children with asthma.</p><p>The hypothesis put forth herein is that an active video game system can be as effective as treadmill training to improve clinical control and aerobic fitness in children with asthma. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether aerobic exercise involving an active video game system improved asthma control, airway inflammation and exercise capacity in children with moderate to severe asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Patients</title><p>This was a randomized, controlled, single-blinded clinical trial with 36 asthmatic children from a tertiary center specialized in childhood asthma, and the protocol was carried out in the University clinic (specialized in pulmonary diseases).

A five minutes warm up period was carried out on a treadmill at 2 km/h prior to each session. The children then played the video game for 30 minutes (10 three-minute rounds with a 30-second rest interval between rounds) followed by a 5-minute cooling down on the treadmill again. The intensity was increased when the child successfully concluded a game level. A higher level required the child to carry out a greater number of jumps, squats, lateral movements and arm movements. Before and after each session, three measurements of the peak flow were made to detect exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (decrease &#x02265;20% inpeakflow)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Treadmill training</title><p>A 5-minute warm up period was carried out on a treadmill at 2 km/h prior to each session, after which the exercise training was carried out for 30 minutes starting at 70% of the maximum effort determined during the maximum exercise testing. After training there was a 5-minute cooling down period. Before and after each session, three measurements of the peak flow were made. When the child maintained an exercise-intensity for two consecutive sessions with no increase in symptoms, the intensity was increased by 5% by increasing either the treadmill speed or inclination, as previously described[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>For both groups, the heart rate, oxygen saturation and energy expenditure were monitored during training.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Assessments</title><sec id="sec014"><title>Exercise capacity</title><p>Maximum exercise testing was carried out on a treadmill using the Bruce protocol [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].The test was interrupted when the child reported maximal fatigue or when the heart rate reached 200 bpm[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

The participant was instructed to empty the lungs as much as possible and then breathe in as much as possible using the equipment, until maximum lung capacity, to minimize NO contamination from the ambient air. A nasal clip was used to avoid contamination from the sinus cavities.

The ACQ score is the mean of the item scores and ranges from 0 (completely controlled) to 6 (uncontrolled) obtained during a seven-day period. The cutoff point for controlled/uncontrolled asthma was 2 points. Thus the patients were classified as having their asthma controlled (&#x0003c; 0.75), partially controlled (0.75 to 1.5) or uncontrolled (&#x0003e; 1.5). The minimum clinically important difference was 0.5 on a seven-point scale [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Body composition</title><p>All participants were evaluated individually in the afternoon to avoid the influence of circadian changes.

The unpaired t-test was used for the analysis of energy expenditure. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Minitab 14 statistical software package. The level of significance was set at 5% (p &#x0003c; 0.05). The size effect was calculated using Cohen&#x02019;s d and the results were interpreted based on Cohen (2008)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] as follows: small (0.21 to 0.49), medium (0.50 to 0.79) or large (&#x02265;0.80).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec021"><title>Results</title><p>Ten children (seven from the VGG and three from the TG) withdrew from the study: four due to changes in the school schedule; three abandoned the study without explanation, two dropped out due to difficulties with the parents&#x02019; schedules and one moved to another city.

(2008)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Bonsignore (2008)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] evaluated the effect of aerobic training in asthmatic children and found no changes in FeNO. In contrast, Mendes et al. (2011)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] found a significant reduction in FeNO amongst asthmatic adults after exercise training. The divergence amongst these studies may be explained by differences in the exercise training and in the severity of the disease. Moreira et al. (2008)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Bonsignore et al. (2008)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] did not report any improvement in the exercise capacity of the patients, while this was observed in the present study and in Mendes&#x02019; study. Moreover, both studies also found a reduction in the FeNO levels, suggesting the importance of an increase in aerobic fitness to reduce airway inflammation [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that approximately 50% of preschool children do not carry out even the minimum level of physical activity recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (&#x02265;60 minutes/day)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This incidence may be even higher amongst children with asthma due to exercise-induced bronchospasm, which is reported to affect up to 90%[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Fun is the main driving force behind the practice of physical activity for children, and most of them spend an average of 65 minutes/day playing video games[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Thus, active video games would probably lead to a substantial reduction in this sedentary behavior and consequently increase the adherence to physical training amongst children with asthma.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, aerobic exercise is the only type of physical activity that benefits asthmatic patients[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and such activities should involve large muscle groups and be carried out for at least 20 minutes [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The treadmill has been the equipment most frequently employed for aerobic exercise amongst asthmatic adults and children [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]; however, the treatment of patients with chronic diseases with physical training can be discouraging [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The active video game Kinect/Reflex Ridge seems to be an interesting option because is an interactive game and requires full body movement, with squats, jumps and lateral movements. In the present study, activity was carried out for 30 minutes and achieved energy expenditure as high as 9.3 METs. Sustained activities reaching levels higher than 6 METs are considered vigorous and only the console type of video game has been previously evaluated in terms of energy expenditure, ranging from 3 to 6 METs in the household environment[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], where the proper stimulus is not always employed. According to Baquet et al. (2010) [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], exercise intensity should surpass 80% of the maximum HR to improve the aerobic performance of children without respiratory disorders. In the present population, the mean exercise intensity was 65.2% and 90.5% of the maximum HR in the treadmill and video game groups, respectively.</p><p>Kuys et al. (2011) [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] used a video game system as an exercise training tool in a hospital setting to improve aerobic fitness in adults with cystic fibrosis. However, no previous study has evaluated the use of active video games for aerobic training in children with asthma. The main proposal of the present study was to evaluate the effect of such exercise in a hospital setting, since most asthmatic children experience exercise-induced bronchoconstriction during exercise. However, the active video game seems to be a safe strategy, since no patients demonstrated a reduction in peak flow &#x02265;20%.[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The motivation and intensity maintenance with video game training led to an improvement in the aerobic capacity of the patients. These findings are in agreement with data reported by Donovan et al. (2012) [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and suggest that active video games could be used to improve aerobic capacity in sedentary individuals. However, Baranowski et al. (2012) [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] and Le Blanc et al. (2013)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] reported that an active video game system did not increase the level of physical activity in children. Therefore, it seems that the type of game chosen for aerobic training and motivation are important issues to be considered.</p><p>Smallwood et al. (2012)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] found that the energy expenditure using the XBOX Kinect was higher than with other video game systems. The authors attributed this finding to the fact that XBOX does not have any type of control device, which allows the player to carry out activities with larger movements. According to Mellecker et al (2013)[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], motivation is an important factor to increase energy expenditure during video game playing. The higher energy expenditure (&#x0003e;6 METs) observed in the present study was probably achieved due to the clinical setting and the constant motivation on the part of the physiotherapist during the sessions[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>].</p><p>Both groups showed improvements in aerobic capacity during maximum exercise testing after the training protocols; however the TG presented better performance. Exercise on the treadmill was continuous, whereas exercise using the video game was performed at higher intensity (demonstrated by the HR; <xref rid="pone.0135433.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>) followed by short rest periods, similar to interval training. Two previous studies reported that continuous training led to a linear increase in peak VO<sub>2</sub> while interval training also led to such an increase but not with the same linearity [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Another factor that could have contributed to the result of the TG was the specificity effect in exercise physiology.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study was due to the use of the SenseWear Pro Active device, which can underestimate the energy expenditure during vigorous physical activities [<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This accelerometer seemed quite precise for the evaluation of energy expenditure during the supervised activities in the present study; however, the VGG achieved higher maximum expenditure.</p><p>Another limitation is the intensity of the effort in the video game, which cannot be individualized[<xref rid="pone.0135433.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present findings strongly suggest that the aerobic training promoted by an active video game has a positive impact on children with asthma in terms of clinical control, improvement in their exercise capacity and a reduction in pulmonary inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135433.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135433.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135433.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Trial Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135433.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0135433.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Global Strategy for Asthma Management and Prevention, Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) 2011.
