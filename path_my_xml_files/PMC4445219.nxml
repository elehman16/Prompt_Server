Upon clinical and
radiographic examination, no signs of dental caries were observed, but the dentist noticed
that her maxillary canines may have been impacted and referred the patient to the
orthodontist. After clinical and radiographic examination, the orthodontist concluded that
the teeth were palatally displaced and needed to make a decision for a course of action.
The orthodontist suggested extracting the deciduous canines. The parents were hesitant and
wanted to wait for the deciduous teeth to exfoliate and the permanent teeth to erupt. The
orthodontist then decided to look into published literature for the best evidence available
for the treatment of impacted canines. The orthodontist decided to use the five steps of
Evidence-based practice: Ask, Acquire, Appraise, Apply and Assess (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>). </p><p>

</p><p>&#x000bb; Ask a focused question: Use the PICOT (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome,
Time) acronym to create a focused question. The clinical question was: In an 11-year-old
female patient with suspected palatally displaced maxillary canines, does the extraction of
the deciduous canine, compared to no treatment or watchful waiting, result in successful
eruption of canines after 4 years? </p><p>&#x000bb; Acquire the evidence: The orthodontist performed a "Narrow scope" search in Pubmed
Clinical Queries<xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, category "Therapy", using some of
the terms defined in the PICOT question (tooth impaction, canines, extraction). Of the
studies retrieved in the search, the orthodontist selected three. </p><p>In the first study, a female patient had deciduous canine extracted and had the permanent
canine successfully erupted. In the second study, orthodontists invited their patients, who
either would have deciduous canines extracted or did not receive any treatment, to
participate in the study. After 4 years, they assessed how many patients in each group had
erupted permanent canines. In the third study, patients were randomly allocated by the
investigators to have deciduous canines extracted or to have no treatment at all; patients
were followed up for 4 years. At the end of the study, they reported how many patients in
each group had erupted canines. </p><p>The first study is a case report; the second, a cohort study; and the third, a randomized
controlled trial. The case report does not answer the orthodontist's question because it
reports a single patient without comparison with a group of patients who did not receive
any treatment. The cohort study, however, does have a comparison group, but the decision on
whether to extract or not the deciduous canines was based on the clinician's preference and
may be biased if the reasons for providing treatment were based on better prognosis, for
instance. The orthodontist chose the randomized controlled trial in which assignment to
treatment and comparison groups was done by a random process; which is less likely to be
biased by personal preferences or favorable prognosis. Then the orthodontist retrieved the
full article.</p><p>&#x000bb; Appraise the evidence: After reading the full text of the research paper,<xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the orthodontist appraised the evidence for its
validity or risk of bias, magnitude of effect, and precision, using a critical appraisal
tool (CAT) for clinical intervention studies based on GATE (Graphic Approach to
Epidemiology) frame. The GATE frame was developed by EPIQ (Effective Practice, Informatics
and Quality Improvement), a group of academics and practitioners from the University of
Auckland, set up to help students and practitioners develop their skills in evidence-based
practice.<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The PICOT question the study was
trying to answer is: In 10-13-year-old Caucasian children with maxillary palatally
displaced canine, does the extraction of the primary canine, compared to no extraction,
result in successful eruption of the permanent canine after 24 months? Participants were
selected from public dental clinics and randomly allocated into extraction of the primary
canine (n = 44 teeth) or no extraction (n = 45 teeth) groups. The primary outcome, eruption
of the canine (canine emerged through the gingiva), was observed up to 24 months after
study onset. However, when the permanent canine showed impairment or no change in its
position at the 12-month follow-up examination, combined therapy associating surgical
exposure and orthodontic treatment was performed, regardless of the group to which the
patient belonged (14 teeth from the extraction group and 27 in the control group).
Assessment of the risk of bias using RAMBOMAN (Recruitment, Allocation, Maintenance,
Blinding or Objective Outcome and Analysis)<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t03">Table 3</xref>) suggests adequate randomized sequence
allocation and concealment of the allocation, no losses to follow up and intent-to-treat
analysis, but lack of blinding of outcome assessors and failure to report measures of
variability. The orthodontist also noticed that the selection criteria was very strict;
excluding children with more than 2 mm crowding in the maxilla and children with moderate
or severe resorption of adjacent teeth either at the start or during the trial.</p><p>

</p><p>In addition, the sample size was not calculated for the primary outcome of canine eruption,
but for a secondary outcome of positional change of the permanent canine. The orthodontist
concluded that the trial had low risk of bias, with generalizability limited to children
with similar clinical characteristics as those in the trial (e.g. no moderate to severe
crowding in the maxilla). </p><p>The results of the study were: 69% and 39% of permanent canines erupted in the extraction
group and in the control group, respectively. Measures of association were not reported in
the paper, so the orthodontist calculated them using the GATE calculator (an application
designed to accompany the GATE CAT for intervention studies used to calculate measures of
association and variability)<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t04">Table 4</xref>). The relative risk and 95% confidence
interval suggest that permanent canines, in patients whose primary canines were extracted
,were 80% more likely to erupt than those whose primary canines were not extracted (with a
variation between 20% and 172%). The NNT (number needed to treat) indicates that three
patients need to be treated with the extraction of the primary canine for one permanent
canine to erupt (with a variation between two and ten patients). Given the low risk of
bias, large confidence intervals and short follow-up period, the orthodontist ranked the
evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
system<xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> as a moderate level 2 study (in a scale
of 1 to 5 in which the lower the level, the better the evidence). Based on the best
evidence available, the orthodontist made a weak recommendation for extraction of primary
canines. </p><p>

</p><p>&#x000bb; Apply the evidence to practice: Before finding the research paper, the orthodontist had
carefully conducted a clinical and radiographic examination of the patient and communicated
with the patient and her parents to assess their preferences. After critically appraising
the best evidence available, the orthodontist needs to assess his clinical experience and
personal preferences and communicate again with the patient and his/her parents so as to
make a clinical decision. Taking into consideration all the elements of the X factor<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Table 1</xref>),
the patient underwent extraction of primary canines. </p><p>&#x000bb; Assess actual practice against best evidence-based practice: After treating the patient,
the orthodontist considered whether treatment was successful and well accepted by the
patient and her parents. The orthodontist also pondered what lessons were learned that
could be incorporated into practice so as to make a better decision next time. By
re-evaluating his/her own practice, the orthodontist is constantly reshaping the
orthodontic practice in light of new research evidence and increased clinical expertise. </p><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Depending on the research question, specific research designs are more appropriate to
answer it. They will have corresponding critical appraisal tools, such as those for
intervention studies, diagnostic test accuracy, risk factors and prognostic studies, and
systematic reviews. In the hierarchy of evidence-based practice, randomized controlled
trials are the highest level of evidence, only below systematic reviews of randomized
controlled trials. In the present study, we reviewed the appraisal of a single
randomized controlled trial for therapy using the 5 five steps of evidence-based
practice and the GATE frame (PICOT, RAMBOMAN and X factor)<xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Using this straightforward framework, practicing orthodontists
can incorporate evidence-based methods into their practice.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Pubmed Clinical Queries</collab></person-group><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/clinical">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/clinical</ext-link></element-citation></ref><ref id="B02"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Naoumova</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kurol</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kjellberg</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Extraction of the deciduous canine as an interceptive
