Such inflammation is defined by a two- to threefold increase in circulating cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-18. Low-grade inflammation is typically associated with increased levels of NEFA, hyperinsulinaemia, visceral fat accumulation and low adiponectin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Much attention has been focused on persistent low-grade inflammation in obesity. In the obese state, macrophages are recruited to the adipose tissue. The macrophages subsequently produce cytokines, causing a low-grade inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the mechanisms that lead to this proinflammatory state are still being investigated.</p><p>In obesity, both visceral and subcutaneous fat are sources of systemic low-grade inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Indeed, the distribution of adipose tissue, rather than the total amount of fat, seem to be associated with systemic low-grade inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>This is illustrated by the lipodystrophy syndrome, where patients lose subcutaneous fat in the limbs and accumulate visceral fat, both of which processes are associated with systemic low-grade inflammation and accompanied by insulin resistance, increased lipolysis and consequently increased levels of NEFA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The most common form of lipodystrophy is the acquired lipodystrophy seen in HIV-infected patients on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>It is well established that NEFAs promote insulin resistance with compensatory hyperinsulinaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], but NEFAs have also been suggested to be the underlying cause of systemic low-grade inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In support of this, NEFAs are able to engage toll-like receptor (TLR)s, activate nuclear factor &#x003ba;B (NF-&#x003ba;B) and induce proinflammatory production of TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] at least in vitro. Despite the tight association between increased NEFA levels and systemic inflammation in humans, very few studies in humans have been conducted, and all except for one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] are based on an endotoxin experimental model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus it still remains elusive as to whether NEFAs directly influence human cytokine levels in vivo.</p><p>While most systemic inflammatory molecules are released from immune cells, adiponectin is released primarily from adipocytes. Low levels of adiponectin are often associated with low-grade inflammation and increased levels of NEFA. Adiponectin has anti-inflammatory effects and decreases circulating NEFAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Conversely, increased circulating NEFAs decrease circulating adiponectin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It remains unknown whether lowering of NEFA levels regulates adiponectin, as divergent results have been reported from studies using the anti-lipolytic drug acipimox, a nicotinic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. However, as adiponectin is produced primarily by adipocytes, it can be argued that adiponectin may not sense circulating NEFA levels. Thus, the relationship between adiponectin and circulating NEFA may in fact reflect the possibility that adiponectin and other adipokines are regulated by the anti-lipolytic effect as such. To explore this, we used acipimox and insulin, both of which affect lipolysis through different intracellular pathways. The anti-lipolytic effect of acipimox takes place after the inhibitory regulative G protein action of a G protein-coupled receptor (HM74b), occurring probably with no other effects on the cell and leading to reduced intracellular concentrations of cAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Insulin also reduces intracellular cAMP, but through a completely different mechanism, namely activation of phosphodiesterases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, insulin exerts its effects via downstream signalling through phosphoinositide 3-kinase, activating, for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase. To better understand the effect on adipokine regulation of inhibiting intracellular lipolysis and lowering systemic NEFA, we explored the in vivo effects of acipimox and insulin on adiponectin and cytokine levels in patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy. Acipimox and a two-stage euglycaemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinaemic clamp were used as tools to induce anti-lipolysis, based on our hypothesis that inhibition of lipolysis would inhibit adipokine production and thereby decrease circulating cytokine and adiponectin levels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="d30e433"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited nine non-diabetic HIV-positive men on stable HAART from the Outpatient Clinic of the Department of Infectious Disease (Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark). A description of selection, anthropometry, HIV-immunology and components of HAART for all participants has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In brief, the patients were included on the basis of: (1) lipoatrophy (at least one moderate sign of lipoatrophy) [fat loss] in face, arms, buttocks or legs based on a physical examination; and (2) the presence of insulin resistance (fasting plasma insulin &#x02265;104&#x000a0;pmol/l). If fasting plasma insulin was &#x0003c;104&#x000a0;pmol/l, a standard 75&#x000a0;g OGTT was done and the participant included if insulin was &#x0003e;521&#x000a0;pmol/l after 120&#x000a0;min.

Each participant was studied twice at an interval of at least 2&#x000a0;weeks, receiving acipimox on the one occasion and placebo on the other. The HAART medication was taken 3.5 to 4.5&#x000a0;h before commencing the clamp, with no change to the HAART combination during the study. This enabled us to eliminate the effect of HAART on the cytokine response. Acipimox was administered in doses of 250&#x000a0;mg at 07:00&#x000a0;hours and 24:00&#x000a0;hours (midnight) on the day/night before, and at 07:00 and 09:00&#x000a0;hours on the day of the study. The timing of acipimox treatment and the euglycaemic clamp in relation to fasting was chosen according to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The study protocol has been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In brief, on each study day, participants reported to the laboratory at 07:00&#x000a0;hours after an overnight fast. Peripheral catheters were inserted into an antecubital vein for blood sampling, in the contralateral antecubital vein for infusion of fluids and in a dorsal hand vein for blood sampling. The hand was wrapped in a heating blanket to obtain arterialised blood samples. After catheterisation, venous blood samples were obtained at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 150&#x000a0;min for measurement of plasma NEFA, and at 0, 90 and 150&#x000a0;min (basal stage) for measurement of cytokine levels. At 2.5&#x000a0;h later, a two-stage euglycaemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinaemic clamp was initiated and continued for 6&#x000a0;h, according to a previously published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] with some modifications. Insulin (100&#x000a0;IU/ml; Actrapid; Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) was infused for 2&#x000a0;h (stage 1) at a rate of 20&#x000a0;mU&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (initiated with a two-step priming dose of 80&#x000a0;mU&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 5&#x000a0;min, followed by 40&#x000a0;mU&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 5&#x000a0;min), and for the following 4&#x000a0;h (stage 2) at a rate of 50&#x000a0;mU&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (initiated with a two-step priming dose of 200&#x000a0;mU BSA&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 5&#x000a0;min, followed by 100&#x000a0;mU&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for 5&#x000a0;min). The blood glucose concentration was kept at 5.5&#x000a0;mmol/l by a variable-rate infusion of 20% glucose. To maintain euglycaemia, arterialised blood glucose was measured every 5&#x000a0;min in the first hour of each clamp stage and every 10&#x000a0;min during the rest of the clamp, with samples being immediately analysed (EML 105; Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). During the euglycaemic&#x02013;hyperinsulinaemic clamp, venous blood samples were obtained for measurement of NEFA and cytokine levels at 180, 210, 240 and 270&#x000a0;min during stage 1, and at 300, 330, 390, 450 and 510&#x000a0;min during stage 2. As one participant did not complete the clamp study for technical reasons, results during the clamp represent data from eight participants only.</p></sec><sec id="d30e705"><title>Laboratory analyses</title><p>All blood samples were drawn into tubes containing EDTA and centrifuged (3,000 &#x02009;<italic>g</italic>). Plasma was stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Plasma concentrations of adiponectin were determined by a human adiponectin RIA kit (Linco Research, St Charles, MO, USA). Plasma concentrations of NEFA were determined using an automatic analyser (Cobas fara; Roche, Basel, Switzerland; and NEFA C; Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). The detection limits were 12.5&#x000a0;pg/ml for IL-18, 0.094&#x000a0;pg/ml for TNF-&#x003b1;, 0.18&#x000a0;pg/ml for IL-6, 0.51&#x000a0;pmol/l for insulin and 1&#x000a0;ng/ml for adiponectin.

Statistical analyses of the plasma measurements were carried out using a multivariate linear mixed-effects regression model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The effect of treatment was estimated using a binary variable (acipimox or placebo). The effect of insulin infusion was estimated using a categorical variable, i.e. none, low (20&#x000a0;mU&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) or high (50&#x000a0;mU&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>&#x000a0;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) infusion level, with a model that allowed for an interaction term between treatment and insulin infusion when needed. During the insulin infusion, time in minutes was entered as a continuous variable in the analysis of plasma variables, allowing for different effects during low and high insulin infusion, respectively. Thus, the categorical effect variable of insulin models the effect of a different insulin level in plasma, leading to a constant change in the level of the response variable, whereas the time effect during insulin infusion models the cumulative effect over time of a higher insulin level, leading to a rate change in the response variable. A random participant-specific component was introduced at the baseline level and allowed adjustment for inter-individual variations. This introduces a positive correlation between measurements from the same participant, while measurements from different participants are independent. The study protocol was designed to measure plasma TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, IL-18 and adiponectin concentrations from the same individual at several time-points. The statistical models take into account the fact that observations come from the same person [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In this way, the total variation is split into the within-participant and between-participant variations, which are known to appear in cytokine response under various stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], thereby improving the estimation of variables in the study population. Likelihood ratio tests were applied to assess statistical significance. The final model was found by backward stepwise regression. Thus, in the final models, only the terms that were statistically significant were retained. Statistical significance was defined as <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. The fit of the general linear model was evaluated by testing the residuals for normality and by inspection of the residual plots.

This suggests that either intracellular inhibition of lipolysis or reduction of NEFA as such is capable of regulating production and hence circulating levels of adiponectin and IL-18. Anti-lipolysis did not influence TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 plasma levels; however, hyperinsulinaemia increased circulating IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels, suggesting that insulin, and not NEFA regulates IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><sec id="d30e1085"><title>The anti-lipolytic effect on adiponectin</title><p>Previous studies have found that chronically and acutely elevated NEFA levels suppress adiponectin secretion in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In agreement with our hypothesis, we found that intracellular inhibition of lipolysis reduced plasma adiponectin, probably reflecting reduced intracellular production. This result was evident with both forms of lipolysis inhibition, i.e. insulin and acipimox. In agreement with our findings, previous studies using acipimox found a reduction in circulating adiponectin in healthy men with moderate overweight.

Adiponectin gene transcription is stimulated by several factors involved in adipogenesis, e.g. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)&#x003b3;, forkhead box O1 (FOXO1), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) alpha, sirtuin 1 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1. It is suppressed by hypoxia, transcription repressors such as nuclear factor of activated T cells and CREB, and by inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

When acipimox reduces NEFA, it may lead to reduced <italic>PPARG</italic> expression, and thereby reduced adiponectin gene expression and reduced circulating adiponectin as seen in our study.

This suggests that NEFA or lipolytic products, and not insulin as such, regulate systemic IL-18 in vivo. IL-18 secretion is regulated through TLRs. It may therefore be speculated that the regulation of IL-18 by NEFA occurs through engaging TLRs and the induction of NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Another possibility is through activation of the NLP3 (NLR family pyrin domain-containing 3)-ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein) inflammasome, as NEFAs have recently been found to induce activation of the NLP3-ASC inflammasome, causing IL-1 beta and IL-18 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A previous study found suppression of circulating IL-18 during acute hyperinsulinaemia in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], and is thus supported by our data. However, our study adds to the former one in as far as we suggest that the reduction in plasma IL-18 is due to insulin-mediated inhibition of lipolysis.

Some differences between these studies are the observed changes in insulin and glucose concentrations induced by infusion of intralipid.

Although our study had a small sample size, we found differences between the trials on inflammatory cytokines and adiponectin; it is therefore likely that our results suggest a robust physiological response.</p></sec><sec id="d30e1271" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Using two different tools to manipulate lipolysis, the present study provides evidence that acute inhibition of lipolysis reduces levels of adiponectin and IL-18 in patients with HIV-associated lipodystrophy.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>FOXO1</term><def><p>Forkhead box O1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPR109A</term><def><p>G protein-coupled receptor 109A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HAART</term><def><p>Highly active antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NF-&#x003ba;B</term><def><p>Nuclear factor &#x003ba;B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPAR</term><def><p>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLR</term><def><p>Toll-like receptor</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants for their participation in this study.
