With the threat of widespread antibiotic resistance rendering many antibiotics useless against important diseases, there is an increased necessity not only to minimize antibiotic use and develop novel nonantibiotic-based treatments, but also to raise the profile of disease prevention.</p><p>Probiotics may be a promising area of research in periodontal therapy. Probiotics are defined as &#x0201c;live microorganisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] They repopulate the beneficial bacteria, which can help kill pathogenic bacteria and fight against infection. Probiotics administered orally may benefit oral health by preventing the growth of harmful microbiota or by modulating mucosal immunity in the oral cavity.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Mechanical removal of supragingival plaque is the most effective tool to prevent gingivitis (Loe <italic>et al</italic>. 1965) but most individuals do not adequately control plaque accumulation and gingivitis continues to be prevalent. To overcome this hindrance, antimicrobial products in the form of dentifrices or mouthwashes have been tested for their adjunctive efficacy in reducing plaque and gingivitis. Among them, chlorhexidine is regarded as a gold standard in dentistry for the prevention of dental plaque. Though very effective, it has certain side effects such as brown discoloration of teeth, oral mucosal erosion, and bitter taste.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] As an alternative preventive tool, the use of probiotics has been proposed. However, only a few clinical studies have been so far conducted on the use of probiotics in the prevention of oral diseases. Thus taking into consideration, all these above facts and claims, this study was carried out to test the potential antiplaque and anti-inflammatory properties of probiotic in the form of a mouthwash.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 45 systemically healthy subjects (29 males and 16 females) visiting the Department of Periodontology, at the New Horizon Dental College and Research Institute Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, were recruited for the study.</p><p>The inclusion criteria for the study included:</p><p>

They are intended to augment and not to replace mechanical plaque control. Chlorhexidine has been reported to have a number of local side effects. These side effects are brown discoloration of the teeth and tongue, oral mucosal erosion, and taste perturbation. Several side effects associated with its use have stimulated the search for an alternative antiplaque agent.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Antibacterial mouthrinses act by nonspecifically reducing the levels of both friendly and harmful oral bacteria. In contrast, probiotic has been developed utilizing natural beneficial bacteria to promote a healthy balance of microorganisms in the mouth.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Probiotic technology represents a breakthrough approach to maintain oral health by utilizing natural beneficial bacteria commonly found in healthy mouths to provide a natural defense against those bacteria thought to be harmful to teeth and gums.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Probiotic species mostly belong to the genera <italic>Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium</italic>. To be able to exert probiotic properties in the oral cavity, however, it is essential for the microorganism to resist the oral environmental conditions and defense mechanism, to be able to colonize and grow in the mouth, and to inhibit oral pathogens. The putative probiotic species also needs to be safe for the host.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The potential benefits of probiotics on systemic health and medical disorders, such as gastrointestinal diseases, have been elaborately described.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The first species introduced into research were <italic>L. acidophilus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium bifidum</italic>. Among a number of potential benefits that have been proposed are reduced susceptibility to infections, reductions in allergies, and lactose intolerance, as well as lowered blood pressure and serum cholesterol values. Within dentistry, the previous studies with lactobacilli strains such as <italic>L. rhamnosus</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>. <italic>casei</italic>, <italic>Lactobacillus reuteri</italic>, or a lactobacilli mix have revealed mixed results on oral microorganisms.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A variety of mechanisms have been proposed for their actions, and some effects have been stated to be systemic rather than only local. It is likely that these mechanisms vary according to the specific strain or combinations of strains used, the presence of prebiotics and the condition that is being treated, as well as the stage of the disease process in which the probiotic is administered.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] There are common themes emerging in studies of the modes of action of probiotics and numerous mechanisms have been proposed including prevention of adhesion of pathogens to host tissues, stimulation, and modulation of the mucosal immune system, e.g., by reducing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through actions on NFkB pathways, increasing production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10, and host defense peptides such as beta-defensin 2, enhancing immunoglobulin A defenses, and influencing dendritic cell maturation. Killing or inhibition of growth of pathogens through production of bacteriocins or other products, such as acid or peroxide, which are antagonistic toward pathogenic bacteria has also been reported.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>The current concept concerning the etiology of periodontal disease considers three groups of factors which determine whether active periodontal disease will occur: A susceptible host, the presence of pathogenic species, and the absence of so-called &#x0201c;beneficial bacteria.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>It is generally accepted that the oral biofilm in association with an aerobic bacteria is the main etiological factor in periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Few experimental studies have explored the use of probiotic in periodontal diseases.</p><p>Shimauchi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] did a study in patients with moderate to severe gingivitis who were given either freeze-dried <italic>Lactobacillus salivarius</italic> WB21 (WB21)-containing tablets or xylitol containing placebos regularly (3 times daily for 8 weeks). The intake of tablets containing <italic>L. salivarius</italic> resulted in benefits in terms of pocket probing depth and PI in individuals at high-risk of periodontal disease (smokers) as compared to a placebo control group.</p><p>Krasse <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] did a study in patients with moderate to severe gingivitis who were given one of the two different <italic>L. reuteri</italic> formulations (LR-1 or LR-2) at a dose of 2 &#x000d7; 10 (8) CFU/day, or a corresponding placebo. <italic>L. reuteri</italic> was efficacious in reducing both gingivitis and plaque in patients with moderate to severe gingivitis.</p><p>Other studies have aimed to identify organisms which have the potential for probiotic action that may protect against periodontal diseases.

Most of the studies carried out to evaluate the effects of probiotics on periodontal disease have been associated with an individual bacterial strain.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Unfortunately, mislabeling of strains in probiotic products seems to be a common problem.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] On the other hand, multispecies or multi-strain probiotic products can be even more effective than products with only one bacterial strain.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><p>In our study, we used a probiotic mouthrinse containing the combination of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, <italic>bifidobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Sacchromyces</italic> strains. It is possible, in the complex environment of the human mouth that probiotic &#x0201c;cocktail&#x0201d; of multiple strains would be more effective than any single probiotic agent. This combination of probiotic strain was similar to those used by Haukioja <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and Purunaik <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] The results of our study showed a significant reduction of plaque and gingival status and were in accordance with the above-mentioned studies suggesting that combinations of probiotics strains may have synergistic adhesion effect. Though these strains tested maintained the oro-microbiological balance, their action in the oral cavity is dubious as oral mucosa is not their innate habitat. Furthermore, there is also a need to evaluate whether these lactobacilli strains are momentary or stable oral colonizers. However, it seems plausible that prolonged administration of probiotic preparations may have a preventive role against the development of plaque and gingivitis.</p><p>However, we would like to state that the major limitation of our probiotic preparation is that it needs to be used immediately once prepared and cannot be stored. Thus, we would recommend that a proper vehicle is needed for delivering probiotics so that patient compliance can be improved.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Apart from the unacceptable taste, no other adverse effects on the oral mucosa such as ulcerations were noted with probiotic mouthrinse. Likewise, it would be interesting to evaluate the additional GI benefits of probiotics in studies, where the patient is instructed to ingest rather than expectorate the probiotic mouthrinse. This was not possible to evaluate in this study, since it was a comparative clinical trial assessing the efficacy of three mouthrinses. Longitudinal studies involving probiotics and further microbiological evaluation are also essential when prescribing them in place of antiseptics and antimicrobials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In the recent times, when organisms are fast developing resistance to antibiotics, the emergence of probiotics appears to be a boon for the treatment of diseases. Researchers have confirmed that diseases of the periodontium are not confined to the oral cavity but have strong systemic effects. Hence, probiotics offer a natural and promising option to establish both a good oral and systemic health. In the present study, the probiotic mouthrinse tested was effective in reducing plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation. Therefore, probiotic mouth rinse has a potential therapeutic value, and further long-term studies are recommended to determine its efficacy.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and
