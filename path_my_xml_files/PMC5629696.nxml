Recommendations from oncologists and nurses inspired the patients to reconsider their attitudes and behaviour by accepting recruitment and participation in PA interventions during chemotherapy. Despite extensive side effects, most patients adhered to their PA commitment due to their perception of the bodily, emotional and social benefits and support of healthcare professionals, peers and family.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The patients&#x02019; attitude towards exercise transformed from having no priority in patients&#x02019; daily lives prediagnosis to being highly prioritised. This study identified four important phases in the exercise transformation process during the patients&#x02019; treatment trajectory of relevance to clinicians in identifying, motivating and supporting physically inactive patients with cancer at long-term risk. Clinicians should address young, highly educated patients with cancer at onset of adjuvant chemotherapy due to their specific risk of a sedentary lifestyle resulting from being in stressful, ambitious careers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Current Controlled Trials (ISRCTN24901641), Stage: Qualitative results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>breast tumours</kwd><kwd>gastrointestinal tumours</kwd><kwd>qualitative research</kwd><kwd>rehabilitation medicine</kwd><kwd>sports medicine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>TrygFonden Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Danish Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Understanding the transformation of behaviour among physically inactive patients with cancer is crucial to developing effective patient&#x02013;clinician collaborative strategies to reduce comorbidities and minimise cancer recurrence.

</p><p>The majority of breast and colon cancer patients receiving chemotherapy face a variety of symptoms and side effects, including fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression, putting them at risk of further physical, functional and emotional decline during treatment.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> Additionally, the literature shows that colon or breast cancer patients&#x000a0;undergoing chemotherapy experience a 50% decline in PA compared with prediagnosis.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref>

However, PA interventions targeted prediagnosis physically inactive patients with cancer are inadequate and understudied.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19 20</xref>
</p><p>Consequently, recruitment must be designed to identify and motivate prediagnosis physically inactive patients with cancer to participate in PA interventions. No studies have qualitatively explored whether oncologist recommendations for PA, combined with counselling by an exercise cancer nurse specialist (ECNS) at onset of chemotherapy, can positively impact PA among such patients undergoing chemotherapy, specifically patients perceiving themselves as non-exercisers.</p><p>A few studies have qualitatively examined breast and colon cancer patients&#x02019; participation in exercise interventions during/after treatment, though without focusing and differentiating between the patients&#x02019; prediagnosis PA and exercise history.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;27</xref>

In step 2, the 33 baseline interview transcripts and the 33 12-week, poststudy interview transcripts were organised into initial notes and coding by sorting the text into meaning units identifying preliminary themes. Selected quotations and contextual and conceptual annotations were noted during identification of the motivational, physical, emotional and social constraints and promoters for exercise integration. Three researchers (LA, TM, CA) conducted triangulation to minimise intraobserver bias using these initial steps of decontexualisation and recontextualisation especially with regard to connecting and substantially extracting the essence of notes and codes into code groups (eg, prediagnosis exercise history, oncologists&#x02019; recommendation). The respective code groups and emergent themes identified were only included in so far as the researchers (LA, CA, TM) were in agreement that the interview material (quotations) verified sufficient data saturation, indicating that the emergent themes are highly saturated.</p><p>Accordingly, in step 3, we identified emergent major themes based on coding and the contextual and conceptual annotations. At this point, the role of interventions, WCG and health professionals and psychosocial support from peers and relatives was specifically explored to clarify the underlying mechanisms behind patient experiences during the 12-week period. The last step 4 <styled-content>involved merging and synthesising the cross-case findings into a unifying model of an exercise behaviour transformation model based on the chronological appearance of major themes as they emerged during the treatment trajectory and evolved in the participants&#x02019; experiences.</styled-content>

A lack of self-discipline, desire, motivation, physical laziness and a stressful work life were a common feature in patient narratives, regardless of gender and diagnosis.</p><p>Patient narratives comprised three typologies: (1) &#x02018;Never active&#x02019;, <styled-content>desire to exercise lacking since childhood;</styled-content> (2) &#x02018;On and off&#x02019;, desire to exercise fluctuates; multiple attempts to begin but no adherence; and (3) &#x02018;Active prediagnosis&#x02019;, stopped exercising due to work-related stress and symptom load. Type 1 patients emphasised that they had never participated in sports. Patient 23: &#x0201c;Exercise has never appealed to me &#x02013; I think it&#x02019;s boring. I never did sports when I was child. I have the time but not the desire&#x0201d; (female, 42, breast cancer). Patient 16: &#x0201c;My exercise habits have been virtually non-existent the last five&#x02009;years. I&#x02019;m a civil engineer and construction manager with tough deadlines. I could&#x02019;ve found the time but I&#x02019;m too lazy&#x0201d; (Female, 38, breast cancer). Type&#x000a0;2 patients described short intense periods of exercise, followed by a loss of desire lasting up to a year before resuming exercise. Patient 26: &#x0201c;My exercise habits have always varied. In the last two&#x02009;years I haven&#x02019;t exercised at all. My work takes up a lot of space. I&#x02019;ve neglected myself. I lack discipline&#x0201d; (female, 49, breast cancer). Patients with colon cancer stressed that abdominal pain 6&#x02013;12&#x02009;months prior to diagnosis reduced their desire to exercise. Patient 14: &#x0201c;Two years ago I went to spinning and strength training. Then I had too many work deadlines &#x02026;&#x000a0;Stress, family obligations and stomach problems changed my life so I was inactive in the months prior to getting colon cancer&#x0201d; (male, 38, colon cancer).</p><p>Various patients had primarily spent their leisure time on their careers, marginalising other activities. Patient 33: &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m 33, have an MSc and head a team of 25 employees. We have tough deadlines and I feel a huge sense of responsibility. Three years ago I ran, biked and swam about seven&#x02009;hours weekly, but work prevented that&#x0201d; (male, 33, colon cancer).</p><p>Especially young, educated people reported high stress, considerable work pressure and tight deadlines prior to the appearance of symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Transforming attitudes, oncologists put PA/exercise on the agenda</title><p>None of the patients had initiated PA after being diagnosed or prior to their first consultation with the oncologist, when PA during chemotherapy was advised. Patient 28: &#x0201c;My first consultation with the oncologist was motivating and optimistic and I wanted to start exercising&#x0201d; (female, 46, breast cancer). Patient 26: &#x0201c;The oncologist&#x02019;s recommendation improved my mood. For me, it was perfect timing&#x0201d;(female, 49, breast cancer). Patients said they felt well informed. Patient 23: &#x0201c;Thinking about having side effects from chemo for five&#x02009;months was horrible, but it was great that the oncologist informed me about being physically active during chemotherapy. I needed support from professionals to feel safe&#x0201d; (female, 43, breast cancer).</p><p>The first consultation was followed by a dialogue with an ECNS, who described the barriers, benefits and safety aspects of PA in detail. Patient 14: &#x0201c;The powerlessness I felt against cancer was the most crucial factor in reconsidering my way of life<italic>&#x02026;</italic> Being told by the doctor and cancer nurse specialist <italic>&#x02026;</italic> that doing exercise could perhaps mean that I&#x02019;d feel better, that I could do something on my own&#x0201d; (male, 38, colon cancer). The patients felt that it was a suitable opportunity to focus on their lifestyle and PA when they had to undergo chemotherapy.</p><p>After allocation to interventions or WCG, patients were asked about their PA preference. The majority preferred HIGHHOSP with peers with supervision by a sports&#x02019; physiologist and nurse, which they assumed would strengthen their participation. Patients not allocated to their preference expressed disappointment. Patient 27: &#x0201c;I really needed to get into the high-intensity group due to my non-existent discipline. I needed a boost to begin an exercise programme. I felt disappointed when I was assigned to the wait-list control group&#x0201d;(female, 44, breast cancer).</p><p>WCG quotes show that two-thirds of these patients initiated PA during the 12-week study period. Patient 26: &#x0201c;I was disappointed about being assigned to WCG, but my husband and I decided to weight train three times weekly at our fitness centre&#x0201d; (female, 49, breast cancer).</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Breaks during chemotherapy: quickly back on track</title><p>Side effects of chemotherapy were overwhelming and patients were out of commission for days. Breast cancer patients&#x02019; mentioned fatigue, infections and achy joints and muscles. Patient 5: &#x0201c;My joints ached. <italic>&#x02026;</italic> I couldn&#x02019;t sleep because my hips, lower back and legs hurt. The side effects didn&#x02019;t worsen due to hard exercise&#x0201d; (female, 54, breast cancer). One patient with colon cancer experienced the impact of exercise on his physical capacity. &#x0201c;The days that I exercise <italic>&#x02026;</italic> I would initially think to myself &#x02013; oh, the next two&#x02009;hours are going to be tough<italic>&#x02026;</italic> But when I&#x02019;m done <italic>&#x02026;</italic> I feel great and my side effects become secondary&#x0201d; (male, 70, colon cancer).</p><p>However, the majority of patients took 3&#x02013;5&#x02009;day breaks after chemotherapy before resuming exercise.</p><p>Patient 10: <italic>&#x0201c;</italic>I couldn&#x02019;t participate for four&#x02009;days after I&#x02019;d received Taxotere. It was horrible. I was burning up inside. I made friends with the others in my exercise group and they texted me when I was bedridden. I overcame what was happening, resumed exercising <italic>&#x02026;</italic> We toughened up, forcing the disease and chemotherapy to fade into the background&#x0201d; (female, 44, breast cancer).</p><p>Supervised patients reported emotional and social benefits of being with others facing similar circumstances; the coaches and camaraderie helped in maintaining participation despite side effects. Patient 4: &#x0201c;The coaches were great at cracking the whip. I really enjoyed playing ball in groups; it put me in a good mood because we competed to score the highest&#x0201d; (female, 38, breast cancer).</p><p>Pedometer patients also experienced emotional and social benefits. Patient 14: &#x0201c;I still had the desire, but my body said no. <italic>&#x02026;</italic> So just after chemo, when I&#x02019;m feeling the worst, I only walk 100&#x02013;300 steps from my bed to the kitchen <italic>&#x02026;</italic> The pedometer affects my mood. I end up walking and getting started again&#x0201d; (male, 38, colon cancer). Family and friends becoming involved in PA was important. Patient 99: &#x0201c;My husband and friends got involved 100%. My husband researched all possible walking routes. There was a goal &#x02013; 10&#x02009;000 steps. So we did it&#x0201d; (female, 59, breast cancer).</p><p>While the majority of patients needed to take breaks after chemotherapy, they adhered to their commitments to PA. Six patients, however, failed to realise their ambitions when the side effects set in. Patient 17: &#x0201c;After the first three treatments, I got infections. I was hospitalised three times in that period. Exercise never really got started&#x0201d; (female, 49, breast cancer).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Rethinking exercise identity and transforming priorities</title><p>The analysis from the postintervention interviews showed: building self-confidence, believing in one&#x02019;s own abilities and having the willpower to reach new goals, representing a shift in focus from work to their own physique. The newly acquired self-discipline was viewed with pride, as an impetus to set and reach new goals.</p><p>Patient 13: &#x0201c;I&#x02019;m really proud of myself. I&#x02019;ve changed. Before I got sick I was uninterested in exercise. I took short walks with the dog, worked full time and had my family and other hobbies. I want to keep using my pedometer and plan to walk 10&#x02009;000 steps a day and run a couple times a week&#x0201d; (female, 49, breast cancer). According to the patients, participating in PA improved their physical and emotional well-being, leading them to reflect on prioritising PA in the future. Patient 10: &#x0201c;I am managing engineer and I hadn&#x02019;t exercised for 2&#x02009;years. I saw the project as a chance to get started. I need a whip over my head. It&#x02019;s necessary when your mind is filled with worry about the future. After doing the programme, my body is much stronger. I&#x02019;m doing well mentally [and] I have clear objectives for the future. <styled-content>I run 10K a wee</styled-content>k, joined the running club and I want to horseback ride. My disease has led me to reconsider my work situation. Preliminarily I&#x02019;m working part-time because I have to take better care of myself&#x0201d; (female, 44, breast cancer). Patient 2: &#x0201c;I participated almost 100% in the exercise programme. I never dreamed being active would have such a good effect on me. My lung function has improved, I can climb stairs and I&#x02019;ve halved the number of cigarettes I smoke. I want to continue being physically active at a training club for elderly people&#x0201d; (female, 67, breast cancer).</p><p>Patients of working age resumed work when treatment ended, putting their work situations into the forefront. Some patients negotiated to get better work conditions. Patient 14: &#x0201c;I spoke with my employer about how stressful work was as an IT-engineer. I&#x02019;m convinced that I&#x02019;ll resign if things don&#x02019;t change, so I have time to work out. Now I have fewer responsibilities and will start part-time. My illness has made me see what is important. I have no doubt that exercise improves my wellbeing and now I feel strong enough to work on my terms&#x0201d; (male, 38, colon cancer).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Exploring patients&#x02019; previous exercise history is a key theme in studies targeting patients with cancer who were inactive prediagnosis because exercise history may affect their attitude towards initiating PA.&#x000a0;Participants reported that they transformed their inactive exercise attitude, indicating a shift from being non-exercisers to exercisers, irrespective of pre-exercise history. This shift in PA behaviour was due to the oncologist recommendations, counselling and support from healthcare professionals and due to patient perceptions of the bodily, emotional and social benefits of exercise/PA with peers, family or friends.&#x000a0;</p><p>Recurring topics in all patient reflections included a lack of self-discipline, motivation and physical laziness but also a stressful work life. Our sample comprised highly educated relatively young patients with cancer with a mean age of 49, which explained their focus on work conditions and level of stress as a contributing factor in deprioritising exercise. Our findings were consistent with results from a study of 5000 Danish employees, concluding that highly educated employees experienced higher levels of work-related stress than their less educated counterparts.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p><p>Young, highly educated patients with cancer represent an at-risk group, which breaks with the notion that only poorly educated patients have an inactive lifestyle. This is the&#x000a0;cause for clinicians and exercise teams to pay special attention to them. Studies correlate higher education level with the likelihood of being physically active<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> but that a higher education level often means doing sedentary work.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Our study demonstrates that changing work conditions in the knowledge society require focus on detecting and advising &#x02018;new&#x02019; at-risk groups among patients with cancer who differ in age and lifestyle from their respective diagnostic groups.</p><p>Participant descriptions depicted a transformative process comprising four phases.&#x000a0;Participants generally did not rely on their own physical ability during chemotherapy and looked critically at previous and present lifestyle factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, pre-phase: Opportunity). Without exception, every patient said that their oncologist recommended PA, which they found relevant. Other studies on breast, colon and prostate cancer patients show that exercise was only mentioned in the clinic 35% of the time.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> None of our study participants spontaneously began exercising from diagnosis to first chemotherapy consultation, which undermines &#x02018;the theory of the diagnosis as the teachable moment&#x02019;.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<styled-content>The oncologist&#x02019;s perceived authority&#x000a0;increased patient awareness about changing their attitude towards PA and ECNS counselling provided important knowledge, both affecting patients&#x02019; initial steps towards transforming their attitudes towards exercise</styled-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, phase 1: Directing). Patients were enlightened about exercise as an important way to combat physical inactivity and to handle their cancer diagnosis. Our study confirmed that the first chemotherapy consultation represents a window for influence from oncologists and ECNSs.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37 38</xref>
</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Model of the exercise transforming process for physically inactive cancer patients.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016689f02"/></fig><p>Patients reported a preference for supervised intervention meeting 4&#x02009;days/week, which was surprising considering their previously inactive lifestyle and in contrast to patients&#x02019; preference for PA walking.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Participants equated this with their lack of self-discipline, their need for supervision and exercising with their peers. Qualitative studies among active, prediagnosis patients with cancer identified similar needs.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25 40</xref> Physically inactive, prediagnosis patients with cancer seemed to overcome the barrier of transportation distance identified in other studies.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Participants emphasised that their level of PA depended on how chemotherapy affected them, with the majority resuming PA after a few days, in accordance with two qualitative studies on physically active, prediagnosis patients undergoing chemotherapy.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 42</xref> Our findings confirmed that sedentary, prediagnosis patients used the same strategy to manage side effects as physically active ones.</p><p>Side effects caused participation in exercise to fluctuate, leading to a failure to practice PA for three hospitalised patients. The majority, however, experienced unexpected bodily benefits and were emboldened by their performance. This discovery of &#x02018;the successful body&#x02019; is a key factor in the second step of the transformation process. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, phase 2: Reacting). Participants who continued highlighted the emotional benefits, mirroring results from qualitative studies on breast cancer patients&#x02019; motivations for PA.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21 24 43</xref> Valuable social relationships, of importance to our target group&#x02019;s desire to continue PA, were established in group exercise. Other qualitative group exercise studies targeting patients with cancer identified a similar mechanism.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 40 42</xref>
</p><p>Participants in the pedometer intervention also experienced social benefits, though of a different nature, as ties with spouses and friends became stronger, encouraging them to stay active. These participants nonetheless also asked to participate in groups with peers, as in a study on women exercising in a home setting.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
</p><p>Our findings show that participants in the 12-week PA interventions experienced a new form of self-discipline, which caused them to rethink their abilities, leading to the third transformation phase, where exercise became a part of their mindset and goals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, phase 3: Rethinking). The lack of self-discipline patients described at baseline became a belief in their own abilities and the willpower to realise new exercise/PA goals. Despite barriers participants realised their objectives, fostering optimism about maintaining their commitment to exercise/PA by joining teams in sports clubs as the preferred form of exercise. Participants of working age who had previously prioritised work re-examined this when the time to resume working approached. Various strategies emerged during the interviews; some participants negotiating transitional agreements with employers and others seeking temporary reprieves from management responsibilities. Finally, some participants said a job change was necessary to hold onto their own priorities, as a sharper focus on making exercise/PA a habit became a reality. The fourth and final step in the transformation process encompassed a reprioritisation of structural life features, for&#x000a0;example, work situation, family and leisure time behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">figure 2</xref>, phase 4: Reprioritising).</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>Our study population comprised a group of young, highly educated breast and colon cancer patients compared with the total population of breast and colon cancer patients in Denmark.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
</p><p>The sample demonstrated similarities between the sexes regarding perceptions, preferences, experiences and adherence rates. The young women who participated equalled the men concerning work and family&#x000a0;life challenges. Adherence rates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">table 2</xref>) were 74% (HIGHHOSP) and 75% (LOWPED), indicating that the patients had adequate experience to reflect on the underlying mechanisms and shift in attitude and behaviour during their trajectory, which is in accordance with intervention adherence rates for physically active, prediagnosis patients with cancer.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4 44</xref> More patients with colon cancer may have saturated a further detailed understanding of what patients experience during their disease trajectory. The patients with colon cancer, who chose to participate in the study may thus represent participants with a particularly positive attitude and readiness to adjust their past lifestyles. However, the literature shows that recruiting patients with colon cancer for PA interventions is difficult.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44 45</xref>
</p><p>The study was not incorporating in-depth follow-up interviews, which could have contributed valuable knowledge about patients&#x02019; abilities to maintain PA behaviour. One could argue that the individual patient&#x02019;s unique trajectory from prediagnosis to post intervention would help clarify more specific issues, such as bodily reactions to side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prediagnosis physically inactive patients with cancer need to be identified at onset of chemotherapy and continuously supported during their treatment by oncologists, nurses and exercise teams to initiate, facilitate and maintain a physically active behaviour. The patients&#x02019; attitude towards physical activity transformed from having no priorities in patients&#x02019; daily lives prediagnosis to be highly prioritised during treatment; from failed <styled-content>exercise&#x000a0;discipline</styled-content> to continuous participation.</p><sec id="s5a"><title>Implication</title><p>This study identified four important phases in the PA transformation process of relevance to clinicians in identifying, motivating and supporting physically inactive patients with cancer at long-term risk.

Interventional research that aims to adopt behavioural change towards increased PA could import this model as a guide for interventional activities across various cancer diagnoses. Clinicians should pay attention towards highly educated young patients with cancer at onset of adjuvant chemotherapy whom are at specific risk of sedentary lifestyle due to stressful ambitious careers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e180" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016689.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e181" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016689.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank all participants involved in this study for sharing their perceptions and experiences of participation during their treatment trajectory.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> LA was responsible for data collection; furthermore, LA was first author and together with CA and TM participated in data analysis, interpretation and writing processes.
