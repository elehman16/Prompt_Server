for Better Balance program on the strength of hip flexors, extensors, abductors,
adductors, and knee flexors and extensors and balance in osteopenia. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty-four postmenopausal females with osteopenia volunteered to
participate in this study and were randomly assigned into two equal groups of 12: the
experimental and control groups. The Weight-bearing Exercise for Better
Balance program was applied to the experimental group, while the control group did not
receive any treatment. Isokinetic peak torque per body weight values of the hip flexors,
extensors, abductors, adductors, and knee flexors and extensors were measured by Biodex
System 3 isokinetic dynamometer for both groups before and after six weeks of the program.
Balance was assessed in both groups using the Berg Balance Scale. [Results] There was a
statistically significant increase in post-intervention mean values of all
measured variables compared with pre-intervention values in the experimental
group. Also, there was a statistically significant increase in
post-intervention mean values of all measured variables except for those of
the hip extensors in the experimental group compared with the control group. [Conclusion]
The weight-bearing exercise for better balance program has significant
effects on lower extremity muscle strength and body balance in postmenopausal females with
osteopenia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Weight-bearing</kwd><kwd>Strength</kwd><kwd>Osteopenia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Osteoporosis is considered a major public health problem<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is a chronic progressive skeletal disease characterized by low
bone mineral density (BMD) leading to bone fragility and increased susceptibility to
fractures<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Muscle mass, force, power,
and BMD decrease with age<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
osteoporosis, bone loss occurs without symptoms, so it has been described as a silent
disease<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Osteoporosis management
guidelines recommend the use of dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans for BMD
screening<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Central DEXA of the lumbar
spine and proximal femur is the preferred method for BMD testing<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The World Health Organization (WHO)<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> categorizes BMD as follows: normal BMD, T-score of
<bold>&#x02212;</bold>1 or higher; osteopenia, T-score between <bold>&#x02212;</bold>1 and
<bold>&#x02212;</bold>2.5; and osteoporosis, T-score equal to <bold>&#x02212;</bold>2.5 or less.</p><p>Osteopenia is a condition of decreased BMD and is analogous to prehypertension, so it is
the precursor to osteoporosis<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Management
of osteopenia prevents fracture<bold>-</bold>related morbidity and mortality<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with osteoporosis have a higher
risk of fracture when compared with those in the same age group due to increased risk of
fall<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The risk of fracture is 2.7
times higher for females with osteoporosis and 1.7 times higher for females with osteopenia
than females with normal BMD<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because
osteopenia is so much more common than osteoporosis, the majority of fractures occur in the
population of patients with osteopenia<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
There is a positive effect of physical activity on bone strength and on preventing
osteoporosis<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strophe et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that physical activity during
growth increases bone mass and strength with persistent benefits<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>During physical activity, mechanical forces are exerted on bones by the effect of the
ground reaction forces and the contractile activity of the muscles, resulting in maintenance
or gain of bone mass<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was illustrated that an exercise program that improves
flexibility, body balance, muscle power of lower extremities, and walking ability reduces
the incidence of falls in the elderly. The combination of strength and balance training
plays a preventive role in bone fragility and prevents falls in elderly people<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Exercises challenging balance, which are
part of the Weight<bold>-</bold>bearing Exercise for Better Balance (WEBB) program, are the
key feature of successful exercise programs for the prevention of falls in older people. The
WEBB program includes a warm<bold>-</bold>up exercise, coordination (balance) exercises, and
strength/coordination exercises. Each exercise has several levels of difficulty<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The question this randomized controlled
trial attempted to answer was does WEBB program improve lower extremity muscle strength and
body balance in postmenopausal females with osteopenia?</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty<bold>-</bold>four postmenopausal females with osteopenia volunteered to participate
in this study and were randomly assigned into two equal groups of 12. The WEBB program was
applied to the experimental group, while the control group did not receive any treatment.
Isokinetic peak torque per body weight (PT/BW) values of the hip flexors, extensors,
abductors, adductors, and knee flexors and extensors, and Berg Balance Scale (BBS) balance
scores were measured before and after six weeks of the WEBB program for all participants in
both groups. All participants were recruited from a group of females admitted to
El<bold>-</bold>Haram Hospital, Giza, Egypt, to assess their BMD through a DEXA scan. The
aim and procedures of the study were explained to the recruited females. The Research
Ethical Committee, Faculty of Physical Therapy, Cairo University, approved this study
(P.T.REC/012/00731). All participants provided written informed consent before data
collection. The study complied with the ethical standards of the Declaration of
Helsinki.</p><p>The eligibility criteria were as follows: Postmenopausal females aging from 50 to 60&#x02005;years
of age. The mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) values for age, body mass, and height of the
experimental group were 59.08 (&#x000b1; 4.14) years, 92.50 (&#x000b1; 11.80)&#x02005;kg, and 160.42 (&#x000b1; 2.02) cm,

All participants were diagnosed with osteopenia, as indicated by a T-score
value of between <bold>&#x02212;</bold>1 and <bold>&#x02212;</bold>2.5 SD of the normal mean value of young
persons of the same gender. None of the participants participated in sports or athletic
activities. Hip and knee muscle strength were at least grade four as assessed using manual
muscle test. Personal data of the participants were collected. The data included name, age,
address, weight, height, and phone number. The nature of the study, aims, equipment, and
procedures were explained to the participants to familiarize them with the study before
starting measurements.</p><p>A Biodex System 3 Isokinetic Dynamometer (Biodex Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) was
used to measure the isokinetic PT/BW values for the hip and knee muscles of the dominant
lower extremity. All measured variables were evaluated in a concentric mode of muscle
contraction<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> at an angular velocity of
60&#x000b0;/sec<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> for five repetitions<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS was used to assess body balance
in this study<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. The BBS is designed to measure balance among older people with
impairment in balance function by assessing the performance of functional tasks. It is a
5<bold>-</bold>point scale ranging from 0<bold>&#x02013;</bold>4 and consisting of 14 items. The
maximum total Score of the BBS is 56<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.
All participants in both groups were assessed for both isokinetic strength and BBS balance
scores twice before and after the intervention.</p><p>The WEBB program in the current study was performed five times per week for six weeks.
Repetitions of each exercise of the WEBB program were increased gradually according to the
patient&#x02019;s tolerance as recommended by Sherrington et al<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The program consists of a warm-up exercise, two coordination
exercises and three types of coordination and strength exercises. The warm-up exercise
performed at the beginning of the program was high stepping on a spot for 10 seconds five
times for each limb, alternatively between limbs. This exercise also enhances coordination
and endurance. After that, coordination and strength exercises were performed with different
levels of difficulty. The two exercises that targeted coordination were standing with a
decreased base and stepping in different directions.</p><p>The standing with a decreased base exercise was performed bilaterally with the following
gradually increasing levels of difficulty: 1) feet together and level, 2) semi-tandem
stance, 3) tandem stance, and 4) standing on one leg. The exercise was performed at each
level of difficulty for one minute. The stepping in different directions exercise was
performed bilaterally with the following gradually increasing levels of difficulty:1) long
step with a narrow base of support by asking the participant to take the longest step
possible with a narrow base of support (5&#x02005;cm wide) and to maintain this position for one
minute, 2) stepping forward over an object, and 3) stepping sideways over an object; for
stepping forward and sideways over an object, the participant was asked to take a step
forward or sideways, as appropriate, over an object that was gradually raised heigher. The
object height was 15&#x02005;cm in the first two weeks of training, 20&#x02005;cm in the second two weeks,
and 25&#x02005;cm in the third two weeks. The exercise was performed at each level of difficulty for
one minute.</p><p>The three types of exercises that targeted both coordination and strength were the
sit<bold>-</bold>to<bold>-</bold>stand (squatting) exercise, heel raise exercises, and
forward and lateral step<bold>-</bold>up exercises. 1) The
sit<bold>-</bold>to<bold>-</bold>stand (squatting) exercise was performed with the following
gradually increasing levels of difficulty: a) bilateral squatting on two limbs with hand
assistance, b) bilateral squatting on two limbs without hand assistance by crossing the arms
across the chest, and c) unilateral squatting on one limb while the other limb is elevated
above the ground. 2) The heel raise exercise included bilateral and unilateral heel raise
exercises. 3) The forward and lateral step<bold>-</bold>up exercises were performed with a
height of 15&#x02005;cm and 10 repetitions in the first two weeks, a height of 20&#x02005;cm and 15
repetitions in the second two weeks, and a height of 25&#x02005;cm and 20 repetitions in the third
two weeks of training. Each level of difficulty for each exercise was performed 10 times in
the first two weeks, 15 times in the second two weeks, and 20 times in the third two weeks
of training.</p><p>Two<bold>-</bold>way mixed design multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted
in the current study to test the effect of the WEBB program on seven dependent variables:
isokinetic PT/BW values of the hip flexors, extensors, abductors, adductors, and knee
flexors and extensors and BBS balance scores. Measurements were recorded from all
participants in both groups before and after six weeks of the WEBB program in the
experimental group. Levene&#x02019;s test of equality of error variance was insignificant for all
measured variables, indicating homogeneity between groups. Also, Mauchly&#x02019;s sphericity test
was insignificant, indicating homogeneity of the within factor (time of testing).

after the intervention in both groups, as presented in <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Mean isokinetic PT/BW values and BBS scores</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="5" valign="middle" align="center" colspan="1">Measured variables</th><th colspan="4" valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1">Mean &#x000b1; SD (Nm/kg for PT/BW and

determine the appropriate sample size. Power analysis was conducted at a significance level
of 5% and a test power of 80%. It revealed that a minimum of nine participants were required
for each group (i.e, 18 for both groups). A total of 78 participants were assessed, and 54
who did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Only 24 participants met the
inclusion criteria and were included in the study. They were subdivided into two equal
groups of 12. There was no loss of participants to follow<bold>-</bold>up for any reason.
After completing the study, statistical analysis revealed a high power of significance (98%)
for the study.</p><p>Multiple pairwise comparisons revealed a significant increase in the
post<bold>-</bold>intervention mean values of PT/BW of the hip flexors, extensors,
abductors, adductors, and knee flexors and extensors and BBS balance scores in the
experimental group compared with the pre<bold>-</bold>intervention values (p&#x0003c;0.05). In
the control group, multiple pairwise comparisons revealed no significant difference in the
post<bold>-</bold>intervention mean values of all measured variables compared to the pre
testing values (p&#x0003e;0.05). Moreover, there was a significant increase in the
post<bold>-</bold>intervention mean values of all measured variables except the PT/BW of
the hip extensors in the experimental group compared with the control group (p&#x0003c;0.05). In
addition, a significant interaction was found for tested group and time factors in all
measured variables (p&#x0003c;0.05). This means that the effect of the WEBB program on measured
variables depends on the testing time, and this effect was not the same at the two times of
testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The current study was conducted to investigate the effect of the WEBB program on isokinetic
hip and knee muscles strength and body balance in postmenopausal females with osteopenia.
The significant improvements in the measured variables illustrated the effective role of the
WEBB program in cases of osteopenia. The WEBB program was developed to specifically target
poor balance and lower limb muscle weakness for people at risk of falls<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, weight<bold>-</bold>bearing exercises
provide an effective way to stress important sites of bones improving muscular strength and
body balance, which reduces the risk for falls<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The insignificant difference in hip extensor strength between groups may be attributed to
inability of participants to perform deep squatting in the
sit<bold>-</bold>to<bold>-</bold>stand exercise, which targets hip extensor strength as
tolerance was limited with increasing age. Activation of the gluteus maximus is greatly
influenced by increasing the squat depth to 90&#x000b0; of hip flexion, as reported by Caterisano et
al<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, isokinetic testing
of hip extensor strength was performed in the range of 45&#x000b0; hip flexion to 0&#x000b0; hip extension,
and this may not be the accurate range for maximal activation of hip extensors, as reported
by Worrell et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, who found that full
hip extension elicited the greatest amount of gluteus maximus myoelectric activity. A study
by Burke et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> supported the results
of the current study and concluded that balance and strengthening exercises are important in
improving postural control and lower limb muscle strength in elderly females with
osteoporosis. They assessed the efficacy of an eight<bold>-</bold>week program of balance
and strengthening exercises on postural control and isokinetic strength of knee flexors,
extensors, and ankle dorsiflexors of females with osteoporosis. Their results revealed
significant improvement of all balance and strength measures.</p><p>Also, Carter et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated no
significant changes in isokinetic knee extension strength after 10 weeks of posture and
coordination training. They illustrated that the participants in the exercise group showed
an increase in isokinetic knee extension strength, although not statistically significant,
compared with their control group (4.9% and 12.8%, respectively). However, in another study,
Carter et al.<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> increased the training
period to 20 weeks for the intervention group and noticed a significant effect, and they
indeed found significant increases in dynamic isokinetic knee extension strength. This
illustrates that ensuring a sufficient period for a treatment program has a marked effect on
the results.</p><p>The same results were obtained by Sherrington et al.<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>, who studied the effect of two weeks weight-bearing versus
non-weight-bearing exercises on strength, balance, gait, and functional performance among
older inpatients following hip fracture. Although there were significant improvements in the
outcome measures after testing, there were no significant differences between groups. It was
concluded that two weeks of training was not enough to produce statistically significant
differences between groups.</p><p>Concerning balance, the results of the current study are in agreement with those of
Teixeira et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> who evaluated the
effect of a progressive muscular strength and functional training program including
proprioception and balance training on the BBS balance score and prevention of falls in
postmenopausal females with osteoporosis. It was concluded that progressive muscular
strength and proprioception training were effective in improving muscular strength, balance,
and reducing the number of falls in their experimental group compared to their control
group.</p><p>The results of the current study are also supported by the results of a study done by
Gunendi et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>, who evaluated the
effect of a 4<bold>-</bold>week submaximal aerobic exercise program on postural balance in
postmenopausal females with osteoporosis. Balance ability of all subjects was measured by
the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), Four Square Step test (FSS), and BBS. All balance scores of
the intervention group were significantly increased compared to the control group.</p><p>Although the present study was a randomized trial with random allocation of participants
for controlling the confounding factors, some methodological limitations were still present.
They include the inability to assess each participant for both isokinetic and balance
measures in the same day due to some laboratory difficulties. The learning effect gained
after the pre<bold>-</bold>intervention test of measured outcomes was another limitation
that could affect the post<bold>-</bold>intervention test results, but it may be overcome to
some extent by comparing the results with the control group. Another limitation was the
inability to confirm that all participants gave their best efforts during testing. The
investigators tried to overcome this limitation by instructing all participants to do their
best during testing.</p><p>In conclusion, the WEBB program has significant effects on lower extremity muscles strength
and body balance. It can be included in intervention programs that aim to improve lower
extremity muscle strength and body balance in osteopenia.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Kannus</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Niemi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Parkkari</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Nationwide decline in incidence of hip
