Falls can result in fractures and other injuries, disability and concern about falling (CoF), which trigger a decline in physical function and walking performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and increase an individual&#x02019;s risk of future falls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. CoF is very common for independent-living older adults, with prevalence rates often exceeding those of falls themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. About half of older adults express some level of CoF, and women are more commonly affected than men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Previous research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] has demonstrated that CoF can induce gait adaptations, by manipulating the environment in a way that exacerbates the potential consequences of a fall. These experimental studies have suggested that CoF decreases walking speed and step length, and increases double support time. It is now well-accepted that walking is not just a rhythmic and automated process, but also demands attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These demands increase with age, and with the complexity of the task being performed. More specifically, the ability to inhibit inappropriate responses and selectively attend to relevant environmental features while suppressing other inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Since most daily life activities include some level of dual-tasking, these executive functioning skills (i.e. inhibitory skills) are required. It has been proposed that people with higher levels of CoF cannot inhibit or ignore irrelevant information of the environment in the process of balance control. Therefore, during the cognitive process the CoF competes for the limited resources of attentional focus to maintain balance control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], resulting in an increased gait variability, instability and fall risk. For single task (ST) walking performance, a meta-analysis by Ayoubi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] revealed significant effects of CoF expressed in increased gait variability. Under DT conditions, a study by Donoghue et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] found reduced gait speed and step length, especially for older persons who reduced their daily physical activity due to their CoF.</p><p id="Par18">Systematic review evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] has demonstrated that DT training studies can improve DT walking performance (cadence, gait variability, walking speed, foot rolling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). It has been suggested that better transfer effects can be achieved when DT training includes task managing strategies like task-switching training (switch of attention from one task to another [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]) or task prioritization training (focus on one of the tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]). These aspects have not been integrated to intervention programs for older people with CoF, yet. Hence, it is not clear whether older adults with CoF benefit from this kind of DT training due to the additional cognitive efforts, which affect the attentional resources of this target group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in DT conditions. Therefore, the study aim was to examine whether a progressive DT balance-training intervention with a focus on task managing strategies (task switching and task prioritization) could improve DT walking performance in older adults with and without CoF. The hypothesis is that DT training effects with task managing strategies are beneficial to those participants with CoF because they address the cognitive skills needed for walking and dual-task walking.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aim</title><p id="Par19">The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of a DT training integrating task managing strategies for independent living older adults with and without concern about falling to a non-training control group on walking performance under ST and DT conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par20">The study was retrospectively registered in the German Clinical Trials Register <italic>(DRKS;</italic> Identification number DRKS00012382, 11.05.2017).</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design</title><p id="Par21">A single blind randomized controlled trial investigated the effect of a DT group-based intervention on DT walking after 12&#x000a0;weeks.

The group session was instructed by specialized DT trainers in a gymnasium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The trainers were specialized for the regime of the DT training. They are physical therapist with additional background of human movement sciences or human movement scientists with additional licenses for older aged participants and falls prevention.</p><p id="Par25">During the first 6&#x000a0;weeks, the program focused on daily situations which are commonly associated with an increased fall risk and included mostly challenging over ground walking exercises (brisk walking, start-stop exercises, walking with sidesteps, walking with turns, walking while negotiating tripping hazards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]). To further increase difficulty levels, additional challenges were added to the walking exercises: faster speed, reduced visual input (e.g. looking up to the sky or closing their eyes), reduced proprioceptive input (e.g. walking on compliant surfaces), and reduced area of support. During these walking exercises, participants were also exposed to a variety of cognitive tasks, designed to challenge their focus of attention (e.g. reacting to signs for changing directions or following rhythms introduced by the instructor). In addition to physical and visual modifications (speed, visual input) task managing strategies targeting inhibitory skills and task prioritization were introduced (i.e., prioritization of the motor task, the cognitive task or both tasks at the same time).</p><p id="Par26">During the last 6&#x000a0;weeks, the program focused more on task prioritization, task-switching and transfer into daily situations. The tasks became more complex and included visio-spatial and executive function tasks (e.g. reaction on signs that say turn right but the instruction was to turn left). Additionally, all tasks from the first phase were trained under DT conditions combined with precision tasks, time pressure, task prioritization and task switching. Daily situations were imitated (e.g. carrying shopping bags in a crowd of people while avoiding obstacles or reacting on signs while shifting around other people) to practice task managing strategies.</p><p id="Par27">The instructors explained all exercises with additional verbal feedback to improve ask performance. The importance of each exercise was explained in the context of fall prevention (education, increasing knowledge).</p><p id="Par28">The training protocol was standardized and could be repeated by all participant similarly.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Control group</title><p id="Par29">The control group participants did not receive any exercises for twelve weeks and carried on with their usual activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p id="Par30">ST and DT walking performance was assessed during a 30-s walking test at self-selected constant speed on a treadmill (h/p/cosmos, Zebris; Isny, Germany: FDM-T). Before the test session the participants practiced treadmill walking for about five minutes in order to become familiar with the ST and DT walking task until they felt comfortable. A staircase method was used with going up to a certain level of comfortable walking speed and increasing and decreasing from that point until comfortable pace is achieved afterwards. Gait parameters such as step length (cm), step width (cm), and gait line, which describes the length of the foot rolling movements (cm) were measured as main outcome parameters. Our training regime focused mainly on the gait quality and associated the kinematic parameters. Since there is a controversial discussion about gait variability, for this study we focused on the reported gait parameters, which have been shown to be important walking variables as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">A visual-verbal Stroop test with 30 events of incongruent coloured words (e.g. the word &#x0201c;blue&#x0201d; presented in a yellow font) was added to the walking test as a cognitive DT. Stimuli were projected onto a white wall two meters in front of the participants. Participants were asked to name the colour of the font letters word and inhibit reading the word. The time interval between word insertions randomly varied between 0.8 and 1.2&#x000a0;ms to avoid rhythm. A randomized process distributed three out of four different versions of the Stroop test to the participants (1. familiarization while sitting, 2. ST standing, 3. DT combined with treadmill walking) were presented to the participants. All tests were recorded as a Stroop video including the verbal responses to the visualised colour word on the screen. The number of correct answers was analysed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Other measures</title><p id="Par32">Demographics, anthropometric data and comorbidities were assessed at baseline with a standardised questionnaire.

The FES-I was used to examine concern about falling during 16 daily activities. The 16 items are rated as not at all concerned (1) to very concerned (4). Higher scores are indicative of greater concerns of falling. Participants with FES-I scores of 20 or higher were categorized into the higher CoF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Intervention groups were stratified by the SPBB, due to previously established links between SPPB and kinematic parameters of walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The SPPB was used as a control variable for the randomization process based on tests of static balance, walking speed over 4&#x000a0;m (at normal pace), and the five times chair stand test. Each test score is categorized from 1 (worst) to 4 (best); the overall sum is then used to create a SPPB summary performance scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par34">A priori sample size calculation (G*power 3.1., ANOVA: Repeated measures within factors; f&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.20; alpha error probability&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05; power&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.80; number of groups&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;2; number of measurements&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) calculated a total number of 76 participants.

The cognitive performance while DT walking improved in people in the intervention group without CoF compared to the control group, with no effect in people with CoF (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">The present study examined whether a progressive DT balance-training intervention with a focus on task managing strategies (task switching and task prioritization) could improve DT walking performance in older adults with and without CoF. The results showed a significantly improved ST and DT walking performance for the intervention group regardless of CoF after 12&#x000a0;weeks of training. Improved walking performance was demonstrated through an increased step length and gait line. These common kinematic walking variables suggest an active use of the ankle joint and roll movements, which is an important strategy to compensate for gait impairment and maintain postural control while walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Gait improvements were evident for the participants of the intervention independent of CoF under both ST and DT conditions, similar to previous studies using similar DT interventions with task-managing strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The overall aim of this present study was to explore whether there was a disparate effect of our DT intervention in older people with CoF. In line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], participants with CoF walked slower at baseline with a reduced overall walking performance compared to people without CoF, under both ST and DT conditions. However, while our DT training, improved step length, equally in both groups independently of CoF, our results show that the gait-line did not follow that same trend. This suggests that people with CoF still have more cautious gait pattern after the intervention with less foot rolling movements compared to the participants with no CoF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A recent Cochrane review has suggested that exercise can reduce CoF immediately following the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], however, there is less certainty about long-term effects. Our finding that foot rolling movement remain impaired following the intervention in people with CoF might be an explanation for a reduced effect of exercise for participants with CoF. Since the exercises did not address the CoF, additional psychological support might be required to fully address CoF and the underlying reason for the reduced DT performance e.g. Cognitive Behaviour Training (CBT) for people with CoF.</p><p id="Par42">Our results also show that cognitive performance while walking did not improve in people with CoF, which also confirms that they might require additional support through strategies such as CBT to minimize the interference of CoF on the capacity to perform tasks requiring attentional resources. The resources allocation model by Kahnemann [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] suggests that a higher amount of attention is needed for motor and cognitive performance under DT conditions to manage both tasks similarly. If CoF competes for these attentional resources, walking will be more strongly affected by a DT in people with CoF. Following the task prioritization model by Yogev-Seligmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] one might argue that the laboratory situation was not dangerous enough to switch from the cognitive focus to motor control. Therefore, future studies should include a more challenging walking task to control if this balance and task managing intervention is successful in a transfer to daily situations.</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par43">We would like to acknowledge some limitations regarding the study design. Despite our attempts to stratify participants based on fall risk and COF into control and intervention, our groups were not equal. The control group participants had a higher walking speed and increased step length. Furthermore, participants were allocated using a 2:1 ratio to intervention and control groups, respectively. This decision was guided by our previous experiences that participants are often displeased by a control group allocation. This combined with a high attrition rate in the control group due to group allocation, amplified the differences in group size further for the effectiveness analyses, which might have affected the representativeness of the sample. Moreover, we did not include a pre-post fall risk assessment or an over-ground gait assessment. The study was not powered to look at differential effects of certain tasks or dual-task cost. Additionally, one might argue that the participants trained over ground walking performance, whereas the test situation was done on a treadmill. To avoid confounding factors, we followed the recommendations by Wollesen, R&#x000f6;nnfeldt and Mattes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, there is some evidence that there are no kinetic and kinematic differences when over ground walking is compared to treadmill walking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, the measurement on the treadmill with fixed self-selected walking speed does not allow the analysis of improvements in walking speed. In addition, due to the small sample size dual-task costs could not be analysed sufficiently. Therefore, these aspects should be controlled in future studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par44">In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that our DT training intervention including task managing strategies was effective for both participants with and without CoF, by improving overall gait performance under ST and DT conditions. However, there was a disparate effect for people with CoF compared to people without CoF for the active foot rolling movements and cognitive performance while walking, where people with CoF showed less improvement following the intervention on both factors. To see long-term effects on CoF and gait performance, we suggest the addition of psychological strategies, such as CBT to DT training.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p id="Par8">Cognitive Behaviour Training</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CoF</term><def><p id="Par9">Concerns of Falling</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DT</term><def><p id="Par10">Dual task</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FES-I</term><def><p id="Par11">Falls Efficacy Scale international</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p id="Par12">Mini Mental Status Exam</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF 12</term><def><p id="Par13">Short Form (12 questionnaire) SF 36 Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SPPB</term><def><p id="Par14">Short Physical Performance Battery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ST</term><def><p id="Par15">Single task</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors wish to thank the Department of Human Movement Science of the University of Hamburg and the Medical Centrum Hammoniabad for providing the intervention for participants living in the local area.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par45">This study was conducted without external funding.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p id="Par46">Data can be obtained from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.</p></sec></ack><notes notes-type="author-contribution"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>BW and KD had the study idea and conducted the methods.
