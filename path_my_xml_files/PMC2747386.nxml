The extended release formulation of levetiracetam (Keppra XR<italic><sup>&#x02122;</sup></italic>; UCB Pharma) was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 16 years of age and older with epilepsy. This approval is based on a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multinational trial. Levetiracetam XR allows for once-daily dosing, which may increase compliance and, given the relatively constant plasma concentrations, may minimize concentration-related adverse effects. Levetiracetam&#x02019;s mode of action is not fully elucidated, but it has been found to target high-voltage, N-type calcium channels as well as the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A). Levetiracetam has nearly ideal pharmacokinetics. It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral ingestion, is &#x0003c;10% protein-bound, demonstrates linear kinetics, is minimally metabolized through a pathway independent of the cytochrome P450 system, has no significant drug&#x02013;drug interactions, and has a wide therapeutic index. The most common reported adverse events with levetiracetam XR were somnolence, irritability, dizziness, nausea, influenza, and nasopharyngitis. Levetiracetam XR provides an efficacious and well-tolerated treatment option for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>levetiracetam</kwd><kwd>partial-onset seizures</kwd><kwd>antiepileptic drugs</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Extended release levetiracetam (Keppra XR<sup>&#x02122;</sup>; UCB Pharma) is a relatively new antiepileptic drug (AED) with a unique chemical structure and mechanism of action.

The mechanism of action of levetiracetam is distinct from first-generation and other second-generation AEDs. Levetiracetam does not share a high affinity for many known targets for existing AEDs including phenytoin, carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenobarbital, dimethadione or benzodiazepines.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ndt-5-467">6</xref> In addition, levetiracetam appears not to work by the three classic routes of other AEDs: sodium channel modulation, low-voltage-activated (T-type) calcium channel modulation, and direct gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) facilitation.</p><sec><title>Animal models</title><p>Levetiracetam is devoid of anticonvulsant activity in the two classic acute seizure models used for AED screening, including the maximal electric shock seizure test and the pentylenetetrazol seizure test.

Under fasting conditions, the median time to maximal plasma concentration (T<sub>max</sub>) was 4 hours for levetiracetam XR vs 0.9 hours for levetiracetam IR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ndt-5-467">Table 1</xref>). Time to peak was further prolonged by 2.5 hours when the XR tablet was given after intake of a high-fat, high-calorie breakfast. However, the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> were similar to those in the fasting state. Furthermore, based on the slopes of the regression vs dose, the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC were dose proportional after a single dose of 1000 mg, 2000 mg, and 3000 mg levetiracetam XR. The half-life, apparent clearance, and apparent volume of distribution were dose-independent. Therefore, this study concluded that: (1) levetiracetam XR 1000 mg once a day is bioequivalent to levetiracetam IR 500 mg bid; (2) there is no food effect; and (3) the absorption of levetiracetam XR is dose proportional from 1000 mg to 3000 mg.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ndt-5-467">5</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Metabolism and elimination</title><p>The metabolism of levetiracetam is independent of the hepatic cytochrome P450 system.

For ethical reasons, 8/17 placebo-treated patients were switched to levetiracetam but remained in the placebo group for analyses. After meeting escape criteria, 25 patients were withdrawn during the downtitration period.

Discontinuation of levetiracetam was due to an adverse event in 6% and due to a combination of lack of efficacy and adverse events in 16.3%.

Isoherranen et al used a well established mouse model of AED teratogenicity to study the developmental outcomes of fetuses exposed to levetiracetam or its major metabolite in humans, 2-pyrrolidone <italic>N</italic>-butyric acid (PBA). They found significantly reduced fetal weights in most groups and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities in both the PBA and levetiracetam groups. Two out of 107 fetuses exposed to 1200 mg/kg/day of levetiracetam had cleft palate. Otherwise, no gross structural malformations among the exposed embryos were found, including those receiving a higher dose of levetiracetam (2000 mg/kg/day).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58-ndt-5-467">58</xref></p><p>In 2006, the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register reported pregnancy outcomes in a cohort of women with epilepsy and first-trimester exposure to levetiracetam IR.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59-ndt-5-467">59</xref> There were a total of 117 pregnancies, 39 of which were monotherapy exposures. Three of the 117 exposed pregnancies had a major congenital malformation. All of these occurred in pregnancies also exposed to other AEDs. The malformations included pyloric stenosis and spina bifida. Five minor congenital malformations occurred, also all in pregnancies exposed to polytherapy.</p><p>Additionally, in a study of 14 women with epilepsy on levetiracetam IR during pregnancy (8 on concomitant AEDs), breast milk levetiracetam concentrations and maternal, umbilical cord and infant levetiracetam plasma concentrations were studied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60-ndt-5-467">60</xref> The mean milk: maternal plasma concentration of levetiracetam was 1.05, suggesting extensive transfer into breast milk. Substantial placental transfer of levetiracetam was also found, and the estimated elimination half-life of levetiracetam in 13 neonates was 18 hours. However, the plasma concentrations in the infants were, on average, 13% that of maternal plasma concentrations. In light of the significant transfer of levetiracetam from mother to fetus and into breast milk, the low levetiracetam concentrations in breast-fed neonates suggest rapid elimination of levetiracetam in neonates.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Levetiracetam has many unique characteristics in regards to its mechanism of action: it lacks anticonvulsive activity in the maximal electric shock and the pentylenetetrazol seizure tests; it does not act at the three main sites of conventional AEDs; and it appears to offer disease-modifying benefits in genetic and kindled epilepsy models. Thus far, only sodium valproate and, to a lesser extent, phenobarbital have demonstrated antiepileptogenic properties in the kindling model,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61-ndt-5-467">61</xref> but only do so at doses large enough to cause significant sedation and ataxia. Neither drug demonstrates antiepileptic properties in the genetic spontaneously epileptic rat (SER) model.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ndt-5-467">11</xref> All of these qualities distinguish levetiracetam from other first and second-generation AEDs.</p><p>Whether the antiepileptic properties of levetiracetam in kindled models translate to the clinical arena is uncertain when consideration is given to the fact that clinical epilepsy, with the exception of a few rare syndromes, is not a progressive, self-perpetuating disorder.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62-ndt-5-467">62</xref> Levetiracetam has only demonstrated a delay in the development or an increase in the threshold required to acquire epilepsy in the models reviewed by this article, suggesting that it is a disease-modifying agent rather than being truly anti-epileptogenic.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63-ndt-5-467">63</xref> Furthermore, the protection levetiracetam afforded in the genetic SER model may not hold up in clinical practice considering the rats have specific mutations which have not been correlated in human causes of epilepsy and may make them metabolically and pharmacologically different.</p><p>Interestingly, levetiracetam appears to target sites previously not involved in anticonvulsive therapy, including high-voltage calcium channels and the SV2A receptor. These new mechanisms of action may contribute to levetiracetam&#x02019;s low incidence of drug&#x02013;drug interactions, making it especially useful in cases of refractory epilepsy in which polypharmacy often leads to increased adverse events.</p><p>An ideal antiepileptic drug is one that is efficacious in controlling seizures with no adverse events. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of this ideal AED would include: rapid absorption, good bioavailability, rapid achievement of steady-state concentrations, linear kinetics, minimal protein binding, absence of significant drug&#x02013;drug interactions, a half-life allowing daily or bid dosing, a wide therapeutic index, and no metabolism.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ndt-5-467">24</xref></p><p>Levetiracetam XR exhibits many of these ideal characteristics. It is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral ingestion, is &#x0003c;10% protein-bound, demonstrates linear kinetics, is minimally metabolized via a pathway independent of the cytochrome P450 system, has no active metabolites, has no significant drug&#x02013;drug interactions, allows for once-daily dosing, and has a wide therapeutic index. Levetiracetam XR is ideal for patients with multiple medical problems on polytherapy and those with hepatic impairment. In addition, preliminary data suggest that levetiracetam is a good AED option for patients on chemotherapeutic agents.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64-ndt-5-467">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65-ndt-5-467">65</xref> However, given that levetiracetam is renally excreted, dose adjustments are needed in patients with renal impairment and in some elderly patients due to an age-related decrease in creatinine clearance.</p><p>The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of levetiracetam for the adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures have been clearly proven. Additional studies have suggested efficacy of levetiracetam IR in the treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsies and as monotherapy. Levetiracetam XR was well-tolerated in its pivotal trial. The most common adverse events reported were somnolence, irritability, dizziness, nausea, influenza, and nasopharyngitis. In addition, levetiracetam does not alter body weight,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-ndt-5-467">66</xref> which may be a favorable characteristic. The most concerning associated adverse events are behavioral in nature and include agitation, anxiety, depression, nervousness, irritability and, rarely, psychosis. Those with learning disabilities and with a previous history of psychiatric illness may be at higher risk. Behavioral adverse events are reversible with discontinuation of levetiracetam.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41-ndt-5-467">41</xref></p><p>Data on pregnancy outcomes are limited; however, the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register&#x02019;s report on 117pregnancies exposed to levetiracetam IR showed promising outcomes with only 3 major congenital malformations, all in polytherapy exposures. However, data on levetiracetam&#x02019;s possible effect on cognitive development are lacking.</p><p>One of the possible benefits of levetiracetam XR is its once-daily dosing schedule because once and twice-daily dosing have been shown to result in a higher rate of compliance, and there appears to be an inverse relationship between the number of daily medication doses and compliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-ndt-5-467">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-ndt-5-467">68</xref> Furthermore, because of relatively constant plasma concentrations, extended release formulations may minimize concentration-related adverse effects. These benefits should be weighed against the potential higher risk of a breakthrough seizure if a dose of a once-daily medication is missed, as the impact of a missed dose is greater the larger the dose and the less frequent the administration schedule.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-ndt-5-467">69</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Extended release levetiracetam is a truly unique and valuable antiepileptic drug that can be added to the arsenal of existing treatment options for patients with epilepsy. Its favorable pharmacokinetic properties, lack of significant drug&#x02013;drug interactions, overall safety and tolerability, and convenient once-daily dosing make levetiracetam XR an ideal add-on therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures. Future research will undoubtedly shed more light on the role of the SV2A receptor in the pathophysiology of epilepsy and possibly other hereto undiscovered biopharmacologic properties of levetiracetam.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The author discloses no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ndt-5-467"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Peltola</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Coetzee</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Jim&#x000e9;nez</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Once-daily extended-release levetiracetam as adjunctive treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients with epilepsy: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial</article-title><source>Epilepsia</source><year>2009</year><volume>50</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>406</fpage><lpage>414</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19317886</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ndt-5-467"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ben-Menachem</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Falter</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy and tolerability of levetiracetam 3000 mg/d in patients with refractory partial seizures: a multicenter, double-blind, responder-selected study evaluating monotherapy.
