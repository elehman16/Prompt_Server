Specifically, we examined whether a training session which included explicit guidance on thinking in contraries would improve problem solving abilities. In our study, the participants in the experimental condition were exposed to a brief training session before being presented with seven visuo-spatial problems to solve. During training it was suggested that it would help them to find the solution to the problems if they systematically transformed the spatial features of each problem into their contraries. Their performance was compared to that of a control group (who had no training). Two participation conditions were considered: small groups and individuals. Higher success rates were found in the groups exposed to training as compared to the individuals (in both the training and no training conditions), even though the time required to find a solution was longer. In general, participants made more attempts (i.e., drawings) when participating in groups than individually. The number of drawings done while the participants were trying to solve the problems did not increase after training. In order to explore if the quality (if not the number) of drawings was modified, we sampled one problem out of the seven we had used in the experiment (the &#x0201c;pigs in a pen&#x0201d; problem) and examined the drawings in detail. Differences between the training and no training conditions emerged in terms of properties focused on and transformed in the drawings. Based on these results, in the final discussion possible explanations are suggested as to why training had positive effects specifically in the group condition.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>insight</kwd><kwd>problem solving</kwd><kwd>contrast class</kwd><kwd>heuristics</kwd><kwd>contraries</kwd><kwd>spatial properties</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="117"/><page-count count="16"/><word-count count="13407"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In this paper we explore the impact of explicitly guiding people to think in contraries when searching for solutions to visuo-spatial insight problems (examples of this kind of problem are provided in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We held a training session during which participants in the experiment were provided with demonstrations of how manipulating the representation of a problem in terms of contraries might be helpful. They were then asked to apply this &#x0201c;way of thinking&#x0201d; in a test phase where they were presented with other visuo-spatial problems. The aim of the experiment was to investigate the effects of specific hints or training on insight problem solving. The impact of general meta-cognitive training on performance has been addressed in previous literature (e.g., Walinga et al., <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Patrick and Ahmed, <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Patrick et al., <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), as has the impact of more specific hints which have been customized to the contents of a specific problem (e.g., Chronicle et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, Experiment 3; Weisberg and Alba, <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Grant and Spivey, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kershaw and Ohlsson, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kershaw et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; &#x000d6;llinger et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). What we aimed to focus on here, and to further test based on the results of the experiment, was the hypothesis that thinking in contraries might support transformations in the mental representation of a problem, as required by insight problem solving. Clear evidence of this has yet to be provided, but there are some precursors to the present study which suggest that the question is worth investigating. We will briefly revise these in the next section, contextualizing the underlying processing in terms of special-process and business-as-usual perspectives.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p><bold>The seven problems used in the study</bold>.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Formulation</bold></th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Figure</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;"><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Pigs in a pen</bold> (Schooler et al., <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Ball et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>): participants are asked to construct two more square pens so as to ensure that each pig ends up in a pen of its own.</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-01962-i0001.jpg"/></td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;"><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Triangle</bold> (De Bono, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>; Schooler et al., <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>): participants are asked to make the triangle shape point downwards by moving only three circles.</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-01962-i0002.jpg"/></td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;"><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Deer</bold> (Origin unknown): participants are asked to make the deer face in a different direction by moving just one of the lines.</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-01962-i0003.jpg"/></td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;"><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Eight-coin</bold> (Ormerod et al., <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; &#x000d6;llinger et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>): participants are asked to move two coins in such a way that each coin only touches three other coins.</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-01962-i0004.jpg"/></td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;"><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Five-square</bold> (Katona, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">1940</xref>): participants are asked to reduce the number of squares from five to four by moving only three sticks.</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-01962-i0005.jpg"/></td></tr><tr style="border-bottom: thin solid #000000;"><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Square</bold> (Kanizsa, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>): participants are asked to build a square by putting together six smaller figures: four right - angled isosceles triangles and two right - angled trapezoids of equal height but with bases of different lengths.</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-01962-i0006.jpg"/></td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Circumference</bold> (K&#x000f6;hler, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1969</xref>): participants are asked to find the length of the oblique side CD, given the length of the diameter AB.</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><inline-graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-07-01962-i0007.jpg"/></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Contrariety: a radical change while maintaining continuity</title><p>In the special process theory, insight is conceived of as a process arising from a sudden restructuring of the representation of a problem occurring at an unconscious level (Siegler, <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Kershaw and Ohlsson, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Bowden et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Murray and Byrne, <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). From this point of view, insight is a discontinuous process since it implies a break with previous constraints and attempts. On the other hand, in the business-as-usual theory, insight is seen as a continuous, step by step, conscious process which is similar in nature to the processes underlying the solving of non-insight problems (Newell and Simon, <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; MacGregor et al., <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Chronicle et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Ormerod et al., <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). An integrated perspective has also been put forward based on the argument that the two alternative views are not mutually exclusive and that they both contribute to insight although perhaps in different ways and/or at different moments (Fleck and Weisberg, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Weisberg, <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Using contraries as a strategy in problem solving seems to necessitate an integrated process of this type. Breaking things up into perceptual chunks and reorganizing them into opposite patterns means producing a radical change (i.e., a sharp discontinuity). However, at the same time this change is data-driven, that is, it is anchored on and driven by the inherent features of whatever is represented and in this sense the process implied is gradual. For instance, in Gale and Ball's studies (2003, 2006, 2009, 2012) on people's thought processes during hypothesis testing in Wason's (<xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>) 2-4-6 rule discovery task, the participants' performance improved when they were given a contrast class cue. In the original form of the task associated with Wason's rule, participants are asked to discover the rule (known only to the experimenter) that in this case governs the production of series of three numbers. The rule is &#x0201c;any ascending sequence.&#x0201d; Participants are then given 2-4-6 as a seed triple and are asked to generate further series of three number, which are then assessed by the experimenter as either conforming or not conforming to the target rule. When the participants are confident, they announce that they have discovered the rule. In their studies, Gale and Ball (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) used a dual-goal variant of this task, in which participants are asked to discover two complementary rules, one labeled &#x0201c;DAX&#x0201d; (i.e., the standard &#x0201c;ascending numbers&#x0201d; rule) and the other labeled &#x0201c;MED&#x0201d; (i.e., &#x0201c;any other triples&#x0201d;). The aim was to test whether providing &#x0201c;contrast class cues&#x0201d; for the MED rule might facilitate participants' performance. They provided the participants with different types of contrast class cues as MED exemplars (see in particular Gale and Ball, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). One of these was the 6-4-2 triple, that contrasted with the original 2-4-6 triple on a salient and crucial dimension, i.e. an &#x0201c;ascending&#x0201d; series versus a &#x0201c;descending&#x0201d; series. The other exemplar series, i.e., 4-4-4 and 9-8-1, contrasted with the original series of numbers in terms of dimensions which were irrelevant to the task. Namely, 4-4-4 contrasts with 2-4-6 on the &#x0201c;same-different&#x0201d; dimension (i.e., &#x0201c;three identical numbers&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;three different numbers&#x0201d;) while 9-8-1 contrasts with 2-4-6 on the &#x0201c;mixed-homogeneous&#x0201d; dimension (i.e., &#x0201c;mixed odd and even numbers&#x0201d; vs. &#x0201c;only even numbers&#x0201d;), as well as on the dimensions relating to &#x0201c;equal-unequal&#x0201d; intervals and whether the middle number &#x0201c;is-is not&#x0201d; the arithmetic mean of the two numbers which flank it. Participants who had been presented with examples of series of three ascending versus descending numbers recognized the oppositional nature of the two rules implied, explored fewer confirmatory alternatives and more frequently found the solution suggesting that contrasts play a facilitatory role. As a result of the evident contrast between the ascending and descending series of numbers, the thought process that was then triggered apparently focused on a marked <italic>discontinuity</italic>. However, at the same time, the cue also prompted the recognition of a straightforward relationship connecting the two example series suggesting that a <italic>continuous</italic> thought process was involved here too. In addition, a continuous, step by step process was suggested by the participants' tendency to generate from time to time hypotheses that varied along just one dimension. This latter feature is in agreement with hypothesis testing in general, as conceived by Oaksford and Charter in their iterative counterfactual model (1994).</p><p>The fact that there is a clear and straightforward relationship linking two &#x0201c;contrast classes&#x0201d; is part of the definition of this psychological construct (see how &#x0201c;contrast class&#x0201d; is defined by Oaksford and Stenning, <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Oaksford, <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). More in general, the characterization of contrast/contrariety/opposition in terms of maximum distance with at the same time a high degree of affinity is a common feature in research in the fields of both Psycholinguistics and Experimental Psychology. In the areas of Cognitive Semantics and Linguistics, opposites refer to the <italic>extremes</italic> of an <italic>underlying dimension</italic> (e.g., Lehrer and Lehrer, <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">1982</xref>; Cruse, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Jones et al., <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Antonyms are at the same time minimally and maximally different from one another. They are associated with the same conceptual domain, but they denote opposite poles or parts of that domain (Cruse, <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>; Paradis, <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>, <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Murphy, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>, pp. 43&#x02013;45; Willners, <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Croft and Cruse, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, pp. 164&#x02013;192; Paradis et al., <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). These two features (maximum distance and invariance) also characterize contrariety/opposition from a perceptual point of view. Various studies on the perception of this relationship in a number of different types of visual configuration have shown that a necessary condition for two events under observation to be perceived as contrary is that a maximum transformation of a salient feature (which in these studies was usually orientation) is manifested among overall invariant configurations. This has been formalized in the perceptual principles of non additivity and invariance in Bianchi and Savardi (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2008a</xref>; see also Bianchi and Savardi, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2008b</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>; Savardi et al., <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Bianchi et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>).</p><p>The duality that thinking in terms of contraries seems to imply (i.e., maximum variation in an overall invariant configuration, extremes of a common underlying dimension and discontinuity in a clearly continuous pattern) also emerges when we consider negation and counterfactual thinking. In natural language and reasoning, humans tend to use negation in precise ways, following cognitive rules. One of the roles of negation is that of being a modifier of degree. This happens, for instance, when we say that &#x0201c;the water is not hot&#x0201d; about water that may be warm, lukewarm or cool (Bolinger, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">1972</xref>; Horn and Kato, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Israel, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Giora et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2005a</xref>,<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>). Negation presupposes a polar dimension along which a shift away from the adjective to which not is applied occurs (Kaup et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>, <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Paradis and Willners, <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Fraenkel and Schul, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Bianchi et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2011c</xref>). Negated propositions are assumed to evoke two contrasting spaces, a factual and a counterfactual space (Langacker, <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Fauconnier and Turner, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Hasson and Glucksberg, <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Counterfactual thinking requires a capacity to imagine alternatives to events, actions or states in order to test and validate hypotheses (Roese, <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Byrne, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Counterfactual strategies are employed in falsification processes which are central to inductive and deductive reasoning (Wason, <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">1960</xref>, <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>, <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">1968</xref>; Farris and Revlin, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Oaksford and Chater, <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Evans, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Augustinova et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Augustinova, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In this case both confirmatory hypotheses and disconfirmatory hypotheses (that according to Wason's definition, 1960, literally <italic>contradict</italic> the previous ones) are generated. Counterfactual thinking is also implied in decision making. Inducing participants to take into account possibilities which are <italic>diametrically opposite to their initial assumptions</italic> is a de-biasing strategy which allows them to contrast the tendency to not consider adequately those alternatives which are at odds with their beliefs and perceptions and this leads to more accurate decisions (Lord et al., <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Mussweiler et al., <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). The ability to <italic>imagine contrasting alternatives</italic> is also related to creativity and analytical problem solving. Additive counterfactuals, i.e. the addition of different antecedent elements to reconstruct reality (Roese and Olson, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), enhance performance in creative generation tasks that are facilitated by an expansive processing style, whereas subtractive counterfactuals, i.e., removing antecedent elements to reconstruct reality (Roese and Olson, <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), enhance performance in analytical problem solving tasks that are facilitated by a relational process style (Markman et al., <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>The idea that both discontinuity and continuity are involved in the re-organization which takes place in insight problem solving was somehow prefigured by Gestalt psychologists. They did not explicitly discuss it in terms of contrariety/contrast, but in a sense they paved the way toward the hypothesis put forward in this paper, i.e., that contraries support the representational change that is required for an insight problem to be solved. As Wertheimer (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">1945</xref>) was the first to point out, a solution process requires problem solvers <italic>to reorganize</italic> the phenomenological features of the problem and this apparently occurs as a sudden &#x0201c;aha&#x0201d; moment. But it is less often remembered that Wertheimer also explicitly specified that this reorganization is based on the requirements of the initial phenomenological structure of the problem and is as such guided by them (representing the continuity element). According to him, the key operations in this reorganization are dividing elements that are unified and unifying elements that are separated while transforming their orientation and position in space [see Wertheimer's classic parallelogram problem, reported in Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref> (Supplementary Material)]. From Duncker's perspective too (Duncker, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1945</xref>), productive thinking implies creating a break with the original formulation and representation of the problem and the usual way of thinking and using its inherent features in an unusual, sometimes even contrary way (representing the discontinuity element). In line with Wertheimer, he also explicitly stated that the solution process is suggested by and guided along directions emerging from the original structure of the problem.</p><p>If one adds to Wertheimer's and Duncker's premises the evidence that the human direct experience of space is grounded on oppositional structures which mostly refer to the human body (e.g., Howard and Templeton, <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1966</xref>; Golledge, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Shelton and McNamara, <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>; Tversky and Hard, <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) such as near-far, high-low, vertical-horizontal, in front of-behind, above-below, left-right, etc. (Savardi and Bianchi, <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bianchi et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2011a</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), one can see first of all why contraries support the transformation of a problem's spatial representation and foster its reorganization and secondly why they do so while remaining anchored to the structure of the problem (this has been partially discussed in Branchini et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2015b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Aware vs. unaware processes</title><p>One of the factors implied in business-as-usual versus special-process perspectives concerns the consciousness vs. unconsciousness of the underlying thought processes in problem solving. This is one of the basic dichotomies characterizing thinking and reasoning processes even beyond problem solving, as acknowledged in dual-process theories (for an updated review of this see Evans and Stanovich, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Weisberg, <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The issue is also discussed in the literature investigating the effects of hints or training in problem solving. In most of these studies the <italic>hints</italic> provided by the experimenters which aim to bring to the fore the critical feature of the problem consist of <italic>implicit</italic> suggestions to problem solvers. For example, the solution to Duncker's radiation problem speaks of multiple low-intensity lasers being directed from several angles tissue rather than concentrating them onto a limited area (and thus risking damage to the skin in that area). In Grant and Spivey's study (<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) the hint came from an animation of the whole oval perimeter representing the skin. In Br&#x000f6;derbauer et al.'s study (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) on Katona's five square problem, the hint provided to participants in the experiment consisted of a &#x0201c;wave form&#x0201d; (the shape represented in the solution) hidden in the logo of the research group (Br&#x000f6;derbauer et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In &#x000d6;llinger et al.'s study (<xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) on the eight-coin problem, the implicit suggestion to use the third dimension to find the solution was provided by a variety of different initial configurations of the eight-coin problem (some of which cued the use of the third dimension).</p><p>Conversely, <italic>training</italic> tends to work on an explicit level because the aim is to make participants aware of how to solve a specific set of problems. For example, Dow and Mayer (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) developed four different training programs (i.e., a verbal insight problem training packet, a mathematical insight problem packet, a spatial insight problem training packet and a combined verbal and spatial insight problem training packet). Each of these included information about the critical features of the specific set of problems and a description of the three-step procedure to be followed in order to solve that particular type of problem. Patrick and Ahmed (<xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) and Patrick et al. (<xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) developed various training programs in which participants were informed about the nature of verbal insight problems and were then instructed to use a specific procedure to solve that specific type of insight problem.</p><p>The study presented in this paper represents a conceptual development of a previous study (Branchini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). In that study participants working in small groups were given implicit guidance during the search phase in order to help them to analyze the spatial properties of the problems they had been presented with in terms of contraries. Contraries acted as an implicit heuristic since participants were only &#x0201c;primed&#x0201d; to consider contraries in one experimental condition and &#x0201c;prompted&#x0201d; with a vague hint in another condition. They were not specifically told how or why doing this might help. The suggestion led to shorter periods of time needed to find the solution, increased success rates and it also modified the kind of operations performed during the solution process: there were more goal directed behaviors, more reformulations of the problem and more operations directed toward a modification of the visual structure of the problem (e.g., changing orientation and localization, and reciprocal positioning of parts of the overall structure). In Gale and Ball's study too (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), a contrast cue (ascending vs. descending triples) acted on an implicit level. Why the two exemplars should facilitate the discovery of the rules by pointing to the salient dimension (ascending-descending) was not made explicit to participants.</p><p>The study presented in this paper aimed to provide an expanded analysis of the impact of contraries on visual-spatial problem solving by foreseeing and testing the possibility that contraries might have a beneficial effect when used as part of a conscious and explicit strategy. If one keeps in mind &#x000d6;llinger et al. model of the phases characterizing problem solving (&#x000d6;llinger et al., <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; but see also Ohlsson, <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Knoblich et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), one could foresee contraries to be beneficial in three different stages:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In the initial problem representation (i.e., when a &#x0201c;biased&#x0201d; problem representation is established which makes it very difficult to access the operators that are necessary to transform the problem state into a proper solution).</p></list-item><list-item><p>As an intentional process during the search phase (i.e., when an appropriate solution procedure might help the problem solver not to get stuck in an impasse).</p></list-item><list-item><p>As an unconscious process (during the impasse phase) that enables the possibility that an unconscious change in problem representation will reach the threshold of awareness.</p></list-item></list></p><p>In this paper we do not put forward a hypothesis regarding at which specific stage the effect of the training should come into play. Prompting participants to think in terms of opposites from the very beginning of the solution search phase, might have an impact already at the level of the initial representation formed in problem solver's mind, but it might also have a later effect and support representational changes following the experiences of impasse, by suggesting the &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; starting point to be considered in the new attempt (at this level it would act as an intentional process). However, the preliminary training might also activate an arousal toward oppositional thinking operating also at an unconscious level during the impasse phases. A different experimental design from that used in the present study would be needed in order to answer the question of whether the effect concerns exclusively one of these phases or all of them. The aim of this study was to verify whether the training has an effect or whether it has not.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>The present study</title><p>In this study we explore whether <italic>explicit</italic> training aimed at increasing the awareness of a heuristic based on contraries has a positive effect on the reasoning processes related to visuo-spatial insight problems. A brief training program was developed which demonstrated that the systematic manipulation of the features relating to a problem (in this case transforming them into their contraries) might facilitate the search for a solution. We focused on problem solving in a group setting (with groups of three people) since a previous study which demonstrated the positive effects of providing implicit guidance to use opposites in problem solving (Branchini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>) was conducted with groups. It is also well known from previous literature that problem solving in groups does not necessarily follow the same path as individual problem solving (for a review, see for example Laughlin et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Although our main interest was in the group condition, we also added an individual condition in order to have a comparative indication of the effect of training in this latter case.</p><p>We tested the effects of the training in terms of success rates, the time needed to find the solution and the number of attempts made in the search phase. Each drawing done by the participants in the search phase was considered an attempt to find a solution. In order to further tap into the ways in which training influenced the thought processes of the participants, we also studied the spatial characteristics of the drawings done by the groups for one of the seven problems we had given them to solve. We randomly selected the &#x0201c;pigs in a pen&#x0201d; problem. The decision was made to analyze the drawings (as a dependent variable) rather than the discussions between the participants since drawings can be regarded as behavioral correlates of the cognitive search space and as such reveal participants' aware and unaware cognitive processes (see Fedor et al., <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Moreover, drawings are often the best way to share thoughts when people work together in a group.</p><p>Specifically, we aimed to explore whether the training impacted on their performance in terms of:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>(1) The number of problems successfully solved.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(2) The time needed to find the correct solution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(3) The number of attempts made.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Moreover, by means of an in-depth analysis of the drawings done by the participants working in groups while trying to solve the &#x0201c;pigs in a pen&#x0201d; problem, we aimed to gain an insight into how the training impacted on:

Another one hundred and twenty participants (33 male, 87 female, <italic>M</italic> = 21.73 years, <italic>SD</italic> = 2.19 years) took part in the experiment in groups of three. They were divided in forty inter-observational groups (20 groups, i.e., 60 participants, in the baseline condition and 20 groups, i.e., 60 participants, in the training condition). All of the participants gave written informed consent to participate in the study and they were undergraduate students at the University of Verona. The study was approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Human Sciences of the University of Verona (Italy) and conforms to the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials/problems</title><p>Seven spatial geometrical problems were used in all conditions (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The order of the seven problems was randomized between participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>The experiment consisted of two Participation conditions (individually vs. in groups) and two Training conditions (the training condition vs. the no-training condition or baseline). In the baseline condition, participants were presented with seven spatial geometrical problems and were asked to find a solution. In the training condition, participants attended a brief training session (duration: 10 min) before being shown the problems. During the training session, one of the experimenters explained how a strategy based on the manipulation of contraries could help with spatial geometrical problems. This was done by showing how three spatial geometrical problems&#x02014;i.e., the &#x0201c;parallelogram&#x0201d; problem (Wertheimer, <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">1945</xref>), the &#x0201c;nine-dot&#x0201d; problem (Maier, <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">1930</xref>) and the &#x0201c;altar-window&#x0201d; problem (Wertheimer, <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">1945</xref>)&#x02014;could be solved by applying this strategy (to understand precisely what &#x0201c;changing a property into its contrary&#x0201d; means in relation to the three example problems we refer to, see Appendix <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">1</xref> in Supplementary material). The participants were then requested to apply the strategy to seven new problems (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). They were specifically invited to identify and list all the spatial features which characterized the problem and then transform them into their contraries (the first step) before embarking on the search for a solution (the second step). Before being given the seven problems, the participants were requested to rate on a 0&#x02013;10 point scale how well they had understood the training and to what extent they considered it to be useful.</p><p>In all the conditions, participants were provided with pens and sheets of paper to use for drawings or notes. They were given seven and a half minutes for each problem<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref>. When they thought they had found the solution, they were instructed to raise their hands. The experimenters took note of their response time before ascertaining whether the solution was correct or not. If it was, the response time was recorded, if not, they were encouraged to keep searching. All the sessions were video-recorded.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s4"><title>Results</title><p>There are two points regarding methodology which need to be noted before the discussion of the results. First, the survey carried out after the training session showed that the participants exposed to training reported that they felt they had understood it (mean rating of understanding in both conditions: <italic>M</italic> = 7.4, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.67) and that they considered it to be potentially useful (mean rating of predicted usefulness in both participation conditions: <italic>M</italic> = 7.33, <italic>SD</italic> = 1.86). This confirms that the participants had not only been exposed to training, but that they had also taken it in.</p><p>Secondly, all the statistical analyses presented in the following sections were carried out using Generalized Mixed Effect Models (GLMM). This meant it was possible to deal with the variability related to the Problems and the Subjects as random effects while considering the two experimental conditions (Participation condition and Training condition) as fixed effects. Random effects have factor levels that do not exhaust the possibilities. If one of the levels of a variable were replaced by another level, the study would be essentially unchanged (Borenstein et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). For the purposes of the hypotheses tested in our study, the problems used in the experiment were simply exemplars of a general category (i.e., visuo-spatial geometrical problems) and they were interchangeable with any other problems of the same type. They did not differ in terms of one or another feature that we were interested in studying because we expected a systematic interaction between it and the fixed effects manipulated in the study; we chose these problems as random exemplars of visuo-spatial problems of varying degrees of difficulty. According to the item response theory (Baker, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), every item can be described by two characteristics: item discrimination and item difficulty. These express the relationship between a latent ability (in our case insight problem solving ability) and the probability of correct responses for an item (in our case, a problem). Since our study aimed to test whether the experimental conditions (Participation and Training) affected performance, one of the minimum desirable conditions to start with was to use a set of items (problems to solve) which were characterized by varying degrees of difficulty ranging in probability from 0 to 1. As can be seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, the frequency of correct solutions associated with each problem in effect varied across problems. It was particularly high for some problems, particularly low for others and in between for some others.</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p><bold>Success rate

Bonferroni <italic>post-hoc</italic> tests revealed that the drawings done in the baseline and training conditions did not differ either in terms of the probability of the whole dimension being used within the same drawing (DWA, <italic>EST</italic> = &#x02212;0.071, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.060, <italic>z ratio</italic> = &#x02212;1.193, <italic>p</italic> = 1.000) or between drawings (DBA, <italic>EST</italic> = 0.102, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.074, <italic>z ratio</italic> = 1.380, <italic>p</italic> = 1.000), nor did they differ in terms of a dimension never being used (N, <italic>EST</italic> = &#x02212;0.134, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.069, <italic>z ratio</italic> = &#x02212;1.939, <italic>p</italic> = 1.000). The differences concerned the use of only one of the two poles of a dimension (P): similarly to the results found for the groups, individual participants more frequently used only one pole in the baseline condition as compared to the training condition (<italic>EST</italic> = 0.388, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.083, <italic>z ratio</italic> = 4.654, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

No significant differences were found between the training and baseline conditions with regard to the other categories of responses (DBA, DWA, and N). Therefore, in both the group and individual conditions, the training led to a reduction in the <italic>partial</italic> explorations of the solution space in terms of relevant properties (i.e., those limited to only one property, P). A second GLMM was conducted to compare the two participation conditions (with Participation condition, Training Condition, Relevance and Dimension Use as fixed effects and Dimensions and Groups as random effects). A significant interaction between Participation Condition, Training condition and Dimension Use emerged [here are the Chi square values: <inline-formula><mml:math id="M13"><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>&#x003c7;</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mo>&#x000a0;</mml:mo><mml:mstyle class="text"><mml:mtext class="textit" mathvariant="italic">N</mml:mtext></mml:mstyle><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>&#x000a0;</mml:mtext><mml:mn>136</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 32.7819, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001]. The use of only one pole (P) was significantly less frequent when participants exposed to the training solved the problems in groups as compared to when they did it individually (<italic>EST</italic> = 0.448, <italic>SE</italic> = 0.109, <italic>z ratio</italic> = 4.108, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Discussion and conclusions</title><p>The study presented in this paper aimed to further explore the hypothesis that reasoning in terms of contrast/contrariety/opposition might facilitate problem solving. Our results from the explicit guidance condition add to the previous literature based on implicit guidance which we mentioned in the introduction (e.g., Gale and Ball, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Branchini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). The participants in our study were exposed to a brief training session in which it was suggested that they approach the task by systematically transforming the spatial features of a problem into their contraries. Examples were provided in order to demonstrate how this strategy might help to guide the participants' exploration of new representations throughout the solution search phase. Participants were then asked to transfer the strategy they had learned to seven other problems.</p><p>Four main findings emerged from the analyses. First, in terms of success rates (i.e., the number of problems which participants were able to find a solution to), the groups exposed to training performed better than the individuals. Exposure to training did not lead to an increase in the number of attempts made (i.e., the number of drawings). Our in-depth analysis of the characteristics of the drawings the participants had completed when trying to solve the &#x0201c;pigs in a pen&#x0201d; problem revealed that the search space which they had concentrated on did not in general expand, but they focused more on properties which were relevant to the solution, while at the same time the properties that they had examined and were non relevant to the solution were more readily disregarded in subsequent drawings. Moreover, the participants exposed to training made fewer &#x0201c;incomplete&#x0201d; explorations of the possible manipulations of the relevant properties related to the structure of the problem by limiting their explorations to only one pole. This last finding, in particular, was tested and verified in both the group and individual participation conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, our in-depth analysis of the effects of training in the case of the &#x0201c;pigs in a pen&#x0201d; problem suggests that in the group condition the training expanded the search space in a focused way, i.e., it did not lead to a disoriented multiplication of attempts and participants kept close to the properties which were relevant to the problem (on the relationship between &#x0201c;antonymous reasoning&#x0201d; and <italic>originality</italic> of solutions, rather than <italic>fluency</italic>, see also Dumas et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). We interpret this focused process (which is in line with &#x000d6;llinger et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, but also Gale and Ball, <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) as a consequence of the element of continuity that is implied in the idea of contrariety, as we pointed out in the introduction. In terms of continuity versus discontinuity in reasoning processes activated by thinking in terms of opposites, our results support discontinuity as the participants in the training condition were more likely to investigate various different paths (i.e., they less frequently limited their transformation to only one pole of the spatial dimensions they explored) each time discarding non relevant properties. They also kept more relevant properties fixed across the attempts and here too continuity is implied. Further investigations are needed in order to ascertain the extent to which these last results (which are based on an in-depth exploration of only one problem) can be generalized. What emerged is, however, in agreement with studies that suggest that the search phase of problem solving is evolutionary in nature with several search processes being launched simultaneously and their results being tested against a criterion of success which is defined by the structure of the problem. The most promising candidates are copied and modified until a solution is found or a dead-end is reached (Fernando et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Dietrich and Haider, <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>The training we exposed participants to was not specific to a given problem (as in, for example, Chronicle et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, Experiment 3; Weisberg and Alba, <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>; Grant and Spivey, <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Kershaw and Ohlsson, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Kershaw et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; &#x000d6;llinger et al., <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>, <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) but rather provided advice on how to search for a solution to a set of (spatial) problems and in this sense it resembles meta-cognitive training. However, it differs from other types of domain-specific meta-cognitive training investigated in previous literature (some of which is domain specific, e.g., Walinga et al., <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Patrick and Ahmed, <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Patrick et al., <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) in that the participants in the present study were asked to use the &#x0201c;oppositional reasoning&#x0201d; strategy they had been told about in their exploration of the spatial domain. For both of these reasons it can be said to represent yet another method to add to the types of training whose facilitating effects on insight problem solving have been tested. It should be clear from the experimental design adopted in our study (with the control condition being no training and not another type of training) that the goal of the study was not to verify whether prompting participants to think in terms of opposites is more effective as compared to other types of training. Our goal was to collect evidence of whether explicitly showing participants how thinking in terms of contraries supports representational change leads to a better result than leaving them to work on their own. We wanted to ascertain whether this type of advice is useful and in fact the results of our study were positive.</p><p>As stated in the introduction, the study presented in this paper represents a conceptual development of a previous study in which contraries were used as an unaware, implicit strategy (Branchini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). A comparison between the effects of providing contraries as an implicit versus explicit guidance might tell us something more about how this heuristic impacts on the solution process. It would also be interesting to explore new ways of stimulating both implicit processing (e.g., using dynamic visual tasks) and explicit processing (e.g., using different types of training). In terms of the current state of the art situation, only a provisional comparison can be made between the improvement due to prompting participants to use contraries in implicit and explicit guidance conditions based on the findings from the present study and that carried out by Branchini et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). There are obvious limits when one compares two experiments which do not perfectly coincide in terms of their experimental design. The problems used in Branchini et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>) were of a similar type to those used in the present study but only two were exactly the same; moreover, in the previous study the participants had no time limits whereas in the present study they were given seven and a half minutes. These differences are reflected in the percentage of correct responses in the baseline conditions in the two studies: 32% in the present study versus 67% in Branchini et al. (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). However, if we compare the improvement in the success rates associated with the experimental conditions in both of the studies, a similar effect emerges. Providing implicit guidance (as in Branchini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>) led to 79% of correct solutions, which means an increment of 12% with respect to the corresponding baseline. Providing explicit guidance (as in the present study) led to 42% of correct solutions, which means an increment of 10% with respect to the corresponding baseline. The similarity between these two increments is thought-provoking. It might indicate that aware or unaware processing of contraries led to similar results or, alternatively, it might indicate that it was not the explanation given to participants about which mechanism to apply that was relevant in the training condition. The participants were asked to look for contraries before embarking in the solution process (and this is exactly the same as in the implicit guidance condition in the study done by Branchini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>), and this, rather than the training as a whole, might have implicitly stimulated the expansion of the search space and the relaxation of the constraints relating to the mental representation of the problems.</p><p>A further question raised by the findings of the experiment presented in this paper concerns why training had positive effects specifically in the group condition. Participants worked in small groups also in the previous study where a positive effect of an implicit prompt to use opposites was found (Branchini et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2015a</xref>). The fact that groups work more effectively than individuals in problem solving also emerged in Augustinova's study (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) on the benefits of <italic>falsification cueing</italic> in Wason's selection task, and in Laughlin et al.'s studies on letters-to-numbers problems (Laughlin et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Attention has been devoted to how groups process information and a key factor seems to be the high degree of social sharedness of information at group level (e.g., Larson and Christensen, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Wittenbaum and Stasser, <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Tindale and Kameda, <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Tindale et al., <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Galinsky and Kray, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). In order to help us to explain why, in our study, the training specifically affected success rates in the performance of the groups, but not in the performance of the individuals, we explored the dimensions manipulated in the drawings made by participants in the individual condition and matched them to those made by the groups [Section The search space in terms of dimensions manipulated in the drawings done by the participants in the individual condition when trying to solve the &#x0201c;pigs in a pen&#x0201d; problem (in the baseline and training conditions)]. We found that&#x02014;similarly to what happened in groups&#x02014;also in the individual condition, participants exposed to the training limited their explorations of the properties relevant to the solution to only one pole (P) less frequently than individuals in the baseline condition. Therefore, at least for the &#x0201c;pigs in a pen problem,&#x0201d; the training seems to have a similar effect in both the individual and group conditions. It was simply stronger in the latter case. Moreover, when they were in groups, the participants made more attempts than when participating individually (Section Number of attempts, i.e., the number of drawings done). These two results taken together suggest that the difference in success rates between individuals and groups might actually lay in the fact that individuals made <italic>fewer</italic> solving attempts than groups (although in the right direction), rather than in the fact that the attempts made to apply what they had learned were <italic>less effective</italic>.</p><p>Three further considerations on the effects of &#x0201c;thinking in opposites&#x0201d; in group can however be put forward. Firstly, the general hypothesis underlying our training is that referring to contraries helps people to deal with the complexity of the problem structure by showing them &#x0201c;what is in there,&#x0201d; not only in terms of actual properties but also in terms of their potential variations. The observation that every variation occurs within the framework of contraries is not only an intuition that we are indebted to Aristotle for (ed. Aristotle, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>, Cat. 5, 4a 30-34). It is a principle that models the human direct experience of space (as pointed out by Savardi and Bianchi, <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bianchi et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>) and also goes well beyond that, as testified by the pervasiveness of antonyms in every natural language (e.g., Jones, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Murphy, <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Paradis et al., <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The training session in our study aimed to prompt divergent thinking and the creation of alternative representations by suggesting changes to the structure of the problem which were radical but at the same time also anchored to it. Working in groups might have facilitated this process since it has been demonstrated that the information which is more likely to be brought up in the discussion and more likely to influence decisions made is that which is shared by all group members (e.g., Wittenbaum and Stasser, <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>); the structure of the problem <italic>is the information shared</italic> by everyone in the group.</p><p>Secondly, in the training session participants were advised, as a first step, to identify all the spatial features characterizing the configuration of the problem. The better the descriptive analyses conducted in this initial phase were (in terms of exhaustiveness and precision), the richer the list of constraints to be relaxed in the following steps was when they transformed each feature into its contrary. We know from research into the Psychology of Perception that inter-observation in small groups of three to four members leads to more accurate descriptions of the facts under observation (see Bozzi, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1978</xref>; Bozzi and Martinuzzi, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Kubovy, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Therefore, in our case working in small groups might have improved the quality of the initial analysis of the structure of the problem.</p><p>Lastly, our training consisted of prompting participants to explore the structure of the problem in disconfirmatory rather than confirmatory terms. Confirmation biases are more likely to be prominent when people use their own problem solving strategies in an individual condition. On the contrary, if people in groups are asked to think in terms of opposites, not only do they do so on an individual basis, they also apply this strategy to suggestions coming from other members of the group. Moreover, it has already been shown that in argumentative discourse the ability to address <italic>opposing positions</italic> is crucial in order for people to coordinate their own perspective to that of other people (Kuhn and Udell, <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) and that groups benefit more than individuals from the use of <italic>falsification cueing</italic> in reasoning (Augustinova et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Augustinova, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Whether these data, taken together, are general evidence that small groups provide a better context for &#x0201c;thinking in terms of opposites&#x0201d; is an intriguing question, but as yet it is still premature for conclusions to be drawn.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study conforms to the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical committee of the Department of Human Sciences of the University of Verona.
