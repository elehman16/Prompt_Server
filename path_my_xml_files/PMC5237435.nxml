<sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide offered comparable lesion uptake to <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi, in both malignant and benign lesions.

Because MBI relies on the preferential uptake of a radiopharmaceutical in metabolically active cells to distinguish breast abnormalities from normal parenchyma, the sensitivity of this technique is not affected by mammographic breast density and has been shown to improve detection of mammographically occult cancers. In recent studies, supplemental screening with MBI has been shown to detect an additional 7.5 to 16.5 cancers per 1000 women screened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>To date, most studies of MBI have utilized the radiopharmaceutical <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi, with only limited reports on the use of alternative radiopharmaceuticals for breast imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Tc-99m sestamibi is primarily used as a perfusion agent for cardiac imaging, and was serendipitously discovered to also accumulate in breast cancer. The biodistribution of Tc-99m sestamibi is such that the relative uptake of Tc-99m sestamibi in breast cells is a factor of 20 lower than in myocardial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and hence only a small proportion of administered activity is sequestered in breast tissue. Despite this low uptake, MBI with Tc-99m sestamibi has been shown to be highly sensitive for the detection of breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However some tumors are not well-visualized on MBI. In a series of 286 patients with 390 tumor foci, 49 (12%) were occult on MBI; most of the lesions that were occult on MBI with Tc-99m sestamibi were either small (5&#x000a0;mm or less) and potentially below the resolving power of the camera system or located outside the field of view; however, in 17 of 49 (35%), the reason for the absence of Tc-99m sestamibi uptake in the lesion was unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>An ideal alternative radiopharmaceutical to Tc-99m sestamibi would have a more favorable biodistribution to breast tissue and offer better visualization of breast tumors through higher uptake in breast malignancies relative to the amount of uptake in normal breast tissue. A radiopharmaceutical of particular interest is the imaging agent <sup>99m</sup>Tc-NC100692 (also known as Maraciclatide, GE Healthcare), which is a synthetic cyclic peptide with high affinity for specific integrins, such as &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3, that are upregulated during angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Angiogenesis is critical for the growth of solid tumors as tumor growth beyond a volume of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mm<sup>3</sup> requires independent vasculature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An indirect approach to imaging angiogenesis has focused on radiotracers targeting the integrin &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 receptors which are significantly upregulated in endothelial cells during angiogenesis and are known to be expressed in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 integrin is a membrane-spanning protein that is expressed preferentially on proliferating endothelial cells associated with neovascularization but is absent in quiescent blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The binding of <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide has been confirmed to be localized to endothelial cells in the regions of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and may provide a promising alternative radiopharmaceutical to <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi. Bach-Gansmo et al. first reported on the use of a <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled angiogenesis agent (<sup>99m</sup>Tc NC100692) for the detection of breast cancers using MBI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare relative performance of <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi and <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide in patients with suspected breast cancer, using a high-resolution dedicated gamma camera for MBI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>This study was performed under an IRB-approved, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant research protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. As <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide is a not an FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical, this study was performed under an investigator IND cross-referred to the IND held by the radiopharmaceutical manufacturer, GE Healthcare Life Sciences (Pittsburgh, PA).</p><p>Female patients with known or suspected breast cancer were offered participation in the study. Eligible patients included those with at least one breast lesion identified by clinical findings, mammography, targeted ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging that was considered suspicious or highly suggestive of malignancy on the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and scheduled for biopsy. MBI examinations were performed prior to breast biopsy when possible (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;32). Patients were also eligible to have MBI performed after breast biopsy if the lesion was pathologically proven as malignant and estimated to be at least 1.5&#x000a0;cm in maximum diameter (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7). This requirement on lesion size was to avoid recruitment of patients in whom a significant portion of the lesion would likely be removed at the time of biopsy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Molecular breast imaging examinations</title><p>Patients underwent two MBI examinations&#x02014;one with <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi and one with <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide. MBI was performed on a dual-head system that comprised two compact cadmium zinc telluride detectors with 1.6&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.6&#x000a0;mm pixels (LumaGem system, Gamma Medica, Salem, NH) and was equipped with high sensitivity registered tungsten collimators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. An energy acceptance window of 110&#x02013;154&#x000a0;keV was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>When possible, patients were scheduled for <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi and <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide MBI examinations on separate days (2-day protocol; <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20). If the patient schedule did not permit a 2-day protocol, then a 1-day protocol was followed (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19), as described below. For logistical reasons related to preparation and quality control of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide and to the wait time after injection of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide, the order of the tests was not randomized. For all patients, MBI with <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi was performed first, followed by MBI with <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide. Between 24&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h after injection of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide, patients were contacted to determine if any adverse events (AEs) occurred.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>2-day protocol</title><p>Patients received an intravenous injection of 300&#x000a0;MBq (8&#x000a0;mCi) <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi for the first MBI scan on day 1 and 300&#x000a0;MBq (8&#x000a0;mCi) <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide for the second MBI scan on day 2, performed at least 16&#x000a0;h after the day 1 examination. Injections were given in the contralateral arm to the breast with the suspected lesion and residual syringe activity was measured after injection. The times at which the injections were performed, imaging was commenced, and dose activities were measured, were recorded to permit accurate correction for decay of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc and computation of administered activities. Imaging commenced approximately 5&#x000a0;min post-injection with <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi and approximately 45&#x000a0;min post-injection with <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide. The difference in wait time before imaging with <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi and <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide was to allow for known differences in rate of uptake of these radiopharmaceuticals in breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Bilateral cranio-caudal (CC) and medio-lateral oblique (MLO) analogous views were obtained under light compression for 10&#x000a0;min per view for a total imaging time of 40&#x000a0;min. The compressed breast thickness for each view acquired during the <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi MBI examination was recorded and replicated at the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide MBI examination to assist with consistent positioning of the breast between studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>1-day protocol</title><p>The 1-day protocol procedure was similar to that described above, except that after completion of the first MBI scan, performed with 300-MBq (8&#x000a0;mCi) injection of <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi, patients were immediately injected with 740&#x000a0;MBq (20&#x000a0;mCi) <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide for the second MBI scan. Approximately 45&#x000a0;min post-injection of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide, images were acquired as described above.</p><p>The rationale for the higher administered dose of <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide for the 1-day protocol was to minimize the contribution of <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi to the second scan. The time interval from injection of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi to acquisition of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide images was approximately 90&#x000a0;min for each patient (45&#x000a0;min <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi injection and imaging, 45&#x000a0;min wait after injection of <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide) allowing for physical decay of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi to at least 250&#x000a0;MBq, and physical decay of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide to 680&#x000a0;MBq. No adjustment was made for any biological washout. Therefore, the relative contribution of counts from the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide and <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi injections in the second MBI scan was anticipated to be approximately 2.7:1 (~680&#x000a0;MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide/~250&#x000a0;MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Histopathology</title><p>Histopathologic classification was by the most severe of findings from surgical excision or by core needle or vacuum-assisted biopsy.

Previous studies have shown that angiogenesis in breast tissue is initiated at the start of hyperplasia before there is any morphological evidence of malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Hence, it is not unexpected that there would be uptake of <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide in benign lesions. The uptake is similar to that observed with <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi, thereby offering little or no improvement in discriminating power between benign and malignant lesions. ROC analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>) showed only a marginal, and non-significant, difference in the ability of the two radiopharmaceuticals to distinguish benign from malignant lesions.</p><p>Bach-Gansmo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] were the first to report on the high sensitivity of <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide for the detection of breast cancer. In their studies, no comparison of the relative uptake of <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide with <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi was performed. Ma et al showed that an analog of maraciclatide, <sup>99m</sup>Tc RGD, demonstrated marginally better uptake in breast cancers than <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi, but that difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore they found that <sup>99m</sup>Tc RGD did not provide any significant advantage over <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In agreement with the findings of Ma et al, we found a good correlation between the uptakes of the 2 radiopharmaceuticals and no difference in the ability of either radiopharmaceutical to distinguish malignant from benign lesions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Likewise, apparent lesion extent appeared to be similar with both radiopharmaceuticals.</p><p>
<sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi is currently the only radiopharmaceutical that is FDA-approved for breast imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Several recent studies have shown its clinical use as an imaging agent for the detection of breast cancer in the screening environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi also offers a practical advantage over <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide in that it does not require a 45-min wait period post injection. With an excellent safety record and no serious adverse events associated with over 30&#x000a0;years of clinical use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi has essentially become the primary radiotracer used in the majority of MBI studies. Uptake of <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi in tumors is primarily dependent on blood flow to the tumor bed and on increased uptake in the mitochondria of the tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. As such, it has served as a general-purpose imaging agent for the detection of breast cancer, but these same characteristics also result in uptake in benign lesions and conditions such as fibroadenomata, papillomas, areas of inflammation, necrosis, and benign fibrocystic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>
<sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide may offer some advantages over <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi for breast imaging. <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi is known to have significantly lower uptake in invasive lobular carcinomas than in invasive ductal carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> would indicate that <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide may be a better imaging agent than <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi for the detection of invasive lobular carcinomas. However, the same figure shows that <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide can occasionally overestimate disease. The reason for this overestimation is unknown but may reflect hyperplasia in the breast tissue surrounding the lesion. <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide is extracted primarily through the hepatobiliary system with no uptake in the myocardium. In some patients, this may result in better breast image quality as the absence of myocardial activity adjacent to the breast may result in less scatter in the breast images. This point is well demonstrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> where increased activity close to the chest wall is evident on the <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi image but absent from the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide image. Both radiopharmaceuticals have a comparable radiation dosimetry profile. The effective radiation dose from <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide is 7.8&#x000a0;uSv/MBq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] which is comparable to that from <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi (7.1&#x000a0;uSv/MBq) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. However, no efforts have been expended to determine if the uptake of <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide in breast tissue could be modulated through patient preparation as has been done with <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>One potential role for breast imaging with MBI is in patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) where early prediction of response to NAC offers a potential opportunity to change treatment strategy in cases of inadequate response. Previous studies have shown that quantitative assessment of tumor uptake of <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi demonstrated the ability to differentiate between pathological responders and non-responders as early as 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;weeks after initiation of NAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. To date, there is little understanding of what these changes in tumor uptake represent. Our findings did not support an association between the uptake of either radiopharmaceutical and molecular subtype. While the Luminal cancers had some of the lowest L/B ratios, there was no clear relationship between uptake and molecular subtype. Additional studies will be needed to determine what relationship, if any, exists between the degree of uptake of either radiopharmaceutical in a tumor and molecular subtype or tumor histopathology.</p><p>This study had some limitations. The sample size of 40 patients limits our ability to detect small differences in the sensitivity of the two radiopharmaceuticals. A second limitation was the use of a 1-day protocol in approximately half of patients, imposed by limitations in patient&#x02019;s availability and inability to return for a 2-day protocol. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>b showed no evidence that L/B ratios measured using the 1-day protocol were biased high or low relative to L/B ratios measured using the 2-day protocol. However, in those patients who underwent the 1-day protocol, image quality with the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide images may have been better than that observed in the <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi images due to the increased administered dose and corresponding reduced noise in the clinical images. All of the MBI examinations acquired for this study were considered to be of adequate image quality for diagnostic interpretation and appropriate adjustments to image counts were made for ROI analyses. The order of MBI examinations with the two radiopharmaceuticals was not randomized due to restrictions with preparation of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide; however, MBI studies were reviewed in a randomized order with the radiologist blinded to radiopharmaceutical and all clinical information in order to avoid biasing the interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>
<sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide was found to offer comparable lesion uptake to <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi, in both malignant and benign lesions. Lesion extent and uptake measured from the <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide images correlated closely with values measured from the <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi images. Our findings suggest that <sup>99m</sup>Tc maraciclatide offers only a marginal improvement in sensitivity over <sup>99m</sup>Tc sestamibi that did not reach significance. Our findings did not support an association between the uptake of either radiopharmaceutical and molecular subtype of tumors.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded in part by grants from Mayo Foundation and GE Healthcare.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MKO, CBH, MMBM, KNH, ALC, and JCB analyzed the data.
