Inclusion criteria were primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) defined as glaucomatous optic neuropathy with repeatable reliable visual field defect demonstrated by automated visual field perimetry, ocular hypertension (OH) defined as IOP &#x0003e;21 mmHg without visual field loss, or post-laser iridotomy (LI) angle-closure glaucoma (ACG) defined as gonioscopically occludable angles with peripheral anterior synechia (PAS) formation and coexisting glaucomatous neuropathy and visual field loss. Patients with history of chronic or recurrent inflammatory eye disease, ocular trauma, or ocular infection within the past three months, corneal abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry, those undergoing intraocular surgery or currently using any ophthalmic, dermatologic, or systemic corticosteroid, oral CAIs, or sulfonamide drugs, and those with history of severe hypersensitivity to oral CAIs were excluded.</p><p>This study was approved and authorized by the Ethics Committee of the University of Ryukyus Faculty of Medicine and conducted according to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to study commencement.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Eligible patients were randomized by two-group crossover method to receive either dorzolamide 1% or brinzolamide 1% (the available formulations in Japan) eye drops twice daily (at 09:00 and 21:00) in combination with latanoprost (given once daily at 21:00) for 4 weeks. At the end of four weeks, they were hospitalized as follows. In the brinzolamide group, patients continued to receive the same combination therapy while their IOP was measured by physician specializing in glaucoma using Goldmann applanation tonometer every three hours from 09:00 till 24:00 and at 06:00 and 9:00 the next day. Whereas, in the dorzolamide group the patients underwent the same 24-hour IOP observation as in the brinzolamide group on two consecutive days: at first while continuing to receive dorzolamide twice daily then over the next 24 hours while receiving dorzolamide thrice daily (given at 09:00, 15:00, and 21:00). The patients in the two drug treatment groups were then crossed over to receive the other test medication for another four weeks followed by measurement of 24-hour IOP as before.</p><p>IOP was analyzed in one eye/patient. If both eyes were eligible for inclusion that with higher IOP was selected as the study eye; when IOP was the same in both eyes the right eye was selected. IOP measurements were conducted in duplicate at each time point, with the higher measurement adopted and verified by the investigators.</p><p>All patients underwent thorough ophthalmic evaluations before and at each visit during the study. Subjective ocular discomfort and adverse events and their duration after instillation of eye drops were investigated by patient interviews. Patients who complained of irritation and/or blurred vision at least once during the experimental period were regarded as having ocular discomfort. At the end of the study, the patients were asked to express any preference for dorzolamide or brinzolamide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are expressed as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).

Eleven patients had POAG, three OH, and six ACG. All ACG patients had been treated with LI &#x0003e; 3 months before enrolment in this study. Although all 20 patients in the dorzolamide bid and brinzolamide bid groups underwent 24-hour assessment of IOP, only 17 patients did so in the dorzolamide tid group; the reason for dropping out was personal choice (not because of side effects) in all three cases.</p><p>Mean baseline IOP was 20.0 &#x000b1; 1.4 mmHg. After four weeks of treatment and during hospital stay, mean IOP values on both drugs in combination with latanoprost were significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) reduced from baseline at all time-points throughout the 24-hour period as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-opth-3-395">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-opth-3-395">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>Percent reduction of IOP from baseline on dorzolamide bid and tid and brinzolamide bid was 17.3 &#x000b1; 10.0%, 21.0 &#x000b1; 9.4%, and 17.8 &#x000b1; 8.8%, respectively, during daytime and 21.1 &#x000b1; 9.5%, 20.5 &#x000b1; 10.2%, and 18.5 &#x000b1; 11.7%, respectively, at night (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-opth-3-395">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-opth-3-395">Figure 2</xref>). No significant difference was noted among the three groups. AUC of IOP reduction over 24 hours in the three treatment groups was 385 &#x000b1; 39, 381 &#x000b1; 39, and 394 &#x000b1; 47 mmHg&#x000b7;hour, respectively.</p><p>Ocular discomfort/adverse events during the treatment period were mild eye irritation (n = 8), mild foreign body sensation (n = 1), and mild blurred vision (n = 3) in patients receiving dorzolamide and mild eye irritation (n = 4), mild foreign body sensation (n = 2), and blurred vision (n = 12; severe in 2 patients and mild in 10 patients) in those receiving brinzolamide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-opth-3-395">Figure 3</xref>). According to the patients&#x02019; questionnaire survey conducted at end of study, significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) more patients favored dorzolamide 1% (n = 9) than brinzolamide 1% (n = 2), whereas nine patients did not express any preference for either drug. The major reported reasons for preference of dorzolamide over brinzolamide were that brinzolamide left white residue on eye lashes and caused long-lasting blurred vision including severe blurring in two cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study dorzolamide 1% applied twice or thrice daily and brinzolamide 1% twice daily exerted significant 24-hour IOP-lowering activity when added to latanoprost in Japanese patients with POAG, OH, and ACG. The 24-hour IOP-lowering efficacy of each CAI as second-line medication in combination therapy with latanoprost appeared similar, as did that of the twice- and thrice-daily dosing schedules of dorzolamide. However, patients&#x02019; preference significantly favored dorzolamide over brinzolamide mainly because of whitish precipitate and blurred vision of long duration associated with instillation of the latter eye drops; irritation was not a significant factor in this result.</p><p>In a previous study looking at IOP reduction, brinzolamide 1% exerted equivalent efficacy to dorzolamide 2% when added to timolol 0.5% in patients with POAG and OH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-opth-3-395">21</xref> Moreover, when added to latanoprost in patients with glaucoma and OH, dorzolamide 2% decreased IOP by 3.9 mmHg (19.7%).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-opth-3-395">17</xref> Whereas, addition of brinzolamide to latanoprost reduced IOP by 5.2 mmHg (24.6%) in patients with POAG or OH.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-opth-3-395">18</xref> IOP was maintained without further decrease when brinzolamide 1% was substituted for dorzolamide 1% in combination therapy with latanoprost and timolol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-3-395">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-opth-3-395">23</xref> The present study demonstrated almost identical effect on IOP reduction when the two CAIs examined were added to latanoprost.</p><p>This study included 11 subjects with POAG, three with OH, and six with ACG. Although there are clear differences in the underlying causes of hyper-IOP between POAG and ACG, the IOP-lowering mechanism and effect of topical antiglaucoma agents including CAIs is considered common among the patients who were included in this study. Regardless, to assess whether there were any differences of efficacy between brinzolamide and dorzolamide among the different patient groups, we performed a stratified analysis and found that in 11 POAG patients reduction of daytime IOP was &#x02212;3.5 &#x000b1; 2.5 mmHg by dorzolamide bid, &#x02212;4.6 &#x000b1; 2.5 mmHg by dorzolamide tid, and &#x02212;3.6 &#x000b1; 2.3 mmHg by brinzolamide bid; in six ACG patients the results were &#x02212;2.8 &#x000b1; 1.7 mmHg, &#x02212;3.6 &#x000b1; 1.4 mmHg, and 3.7 &#x000b1; 1.4 mmHg, respectively. No significant difference was noted between POAG and ACG patients on any of the test regimens. Moreover, the results of nighttime IOP were similar to those obtained during daytime (data not shown). Therefore CAI efficacy seems common in various glaucoma patients with hyper-IOP.</p><p>Several previous studies have reported that dorzolamide (1% and 2%) is associated with burning sensation or irritation because of its acidic formulation (pH, 5.6). Brinzolamide, on the other hand, often induces blurred vision due to its insoluble carboxyvinyl polymer. As was expected, similar results were noted in the present study: eight patients reported eye irritation while on dorzolamide and 12 patients reported blurred vision on brinzolamide. These symptoms were transient and faded without treatment.</p><p>We recorded that nine patients preferred dorzolamide and two preferred brinzolamide whereas nine gave a neutral answer. Compliance is a key issue in the treatment of glaucoma; patients are thought more likely to adhere to a course of therapy that is well tolerated. In an earlier prospective, multicenter, double-blind, parallel group trial<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-opth-3-395">24</xref> although blurred vision occurred in 20%&#x02013;25% of subjects who took brinzolamide, this medication was assessed as significantly more comfortable than dorzolamide 2%. In that study, the concentration of dorzolamide was twice as high as the 1% solution examined in this study. Other researchers have reported that substituting brinzolamide 1% for dorzolamide 1% in Japanese patients with POAG maintained stable IOP while improving ocular comfort without significant increase of blurred vision.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-opth-3-395">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-opth-3-395">23</xref></p><p>In the domestic phase IIb study of dorzolamide,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-opth-3-395">25</xref> no significant difference of efficacy was observed between 1% and 2% solutions whereas the latter concentration was associated with more adverse reactions. These results influenced the Japanese regulatory authority to approve dorzolamide 0.5% and 1% for clinical use. In the present study we observed that patients who received dorzolamide 1% experienced little ocular discomfort and significantly preferred dorzolamide 1% over brinzolamide 1%.</p><p>In conclusion, administration of CAIs concomitantly with latanoprost elicited significant further reductions of 24-hour IOP. The IOP-lowering efficacy was almost identical regardless of whether patients received dorzolamide 1% bid or tid or brinzolamide 1% bid in combination with latanoprost. However, dorzolamide 1% was significantly preferred over brinzolamide 1% in our cohort of Japanese patients with glaucoma.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-opth-3-395"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sommer</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tielsch</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name><name><surname>Katz</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Relationship between intraocular pressure and primary open angle glaucoma among white and black Americans.
