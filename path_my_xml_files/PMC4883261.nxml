It can stabilize the condition of SLE patients and reduce the chances of patient relapse through its immunosuppressive function and antiinflammatory effects. This drug was absorbed completely and rapidly by oral administration, but has a prolonged half-life for elimination. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioequivalence of a new generic (test) formulation with the branded (reference) formulation of HCQ in healthy Chinese male volunteers. This study was designed to acquire regulatory approval for the test formulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This study was conducted with a randomized, single-dose, two-period, and crossover design. The male subjects were randomly assigned to two groups at a 1:1 ratio to receive 0.2&#x000a0;g hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets (0.1&#x000a0;g/piece) of the two formulations after a 3-month washout period then administered the alternate formulation. Study drugs were administered after overnight fasting (over 10&#x000a0;h). Plasma concentrations of hydroxychloroquine were measured by a validated LC-MS/MS method. The following pharmacokinetic properties were determined by a noncompartmental pharmacokinetic method: <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221d;</sub>, and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>. The bioequivalence between the test and reference products was assessed based on the following parameters: <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, AUC0&#x02013;60d, and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221d;</sub> using the ANOVA method. If the 90% CI for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub> was within 80&#x02013;125% and for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was within 70&#x02013;143% of the statistical interval proposed by the SFDA, the two formulations were assumed bioequivalent. Concerning the main pharmacokinetic charateristics of hydroxychloroquine, a long half-life drug, the pharmacokinetic parameters of 0&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h were determined according to the FDA. Furthermore, a comparison was made between the parameters at 0&#x02013;60 days and 0&#x02013;72 h to evaluate whether a truncated AUC method can be applied to estimate the relative bioavailability of HCQ. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs and laboratory tests and by questioning subjects about adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The 90% CI of <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for HCQ is 103.8&#x02013;142.3%; the AUC0&#x02013;60 is 100&#x02013;114.2% and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221d;</sub> 100&#x02013;115.5%. Both met the criteria according to the SFDA&#x02019;s guidelines for bioequivalence. The relative bioavailability was 109.5% (according to AUC<sub>0&#x02013;60d</sub>) and 110.7% (according to AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221d;</sub>). No serious or unexpected adverse events were observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, the pharmacokinetic studies and results were conducted so that the test and reference formulations of HCQ met the Chinese criteria for assuming bioequivalence.

It was first synthesized in 1944 and initially used as an antimalarial agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The activity of HCQ against malaria is equivalent to that of CQ, and HCQ is preferred over CQ when high doses are required because of its lower level of ocular toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Both drugs have now become mainstays in the management of rheumatic diseases: principally systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Now HCQ is considered the second-line treatment for SLE, but it is quite effective therapeutically. One study showed that HCQ can reduce the risk of clinical SLE flares and severe SLE exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Insulin resistance occurs more frequently in RA and SLE and is a common risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A study showed that HCQ has a beneficial effect on insulin sensitization by using HCQ in non-diabetic obese subjects for 6&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. HCQ also appears to protect against the occurrence of thrombotic events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In addition, the main mechanism of HCQ applied in rheumatic diseases is the inhibition of stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are cellular receptors for microbial products that induce inflammatory responses by activating the innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Two types of side effects may be encountered with HCQ treatment: one is gastrointestinal intolerance, which usually disappears with dose reduction; the other is rare but potentially severe and involves various combinations of retinal, neuromuscular, cardiac, and hematological impairments. Compared with CQ treatment, retinopathy&#x02019;s incidence in HCQ treatment is very small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>HCQ is rapidly and almost completely absorbed after oral administration (the absorption rate through the gastrointestinal tract is 70&#x02013;80%). However, it has a prolonged half-life (between 40 and 50&#x000a0;days) and low blood clearance (96&#x000a0;ml/min) because of its PK properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Approximately 50% of the HCQ in plasma is bound to plasma proteins. In the liver, HCQ is metabolized to three active metabolites: desethyl-chloroquine (DCQ), desethyl-hydroxychloroquine (DHCQ), and bis-desethyl-hydroxychloroquine (BDCQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although the pharmacokinetic properties of HCQ have been well identified in previous studies, few studies have been conducted on the PK characteristics of HCQ among healthy Chinese individuals. Although one similar study reported on the bioequivalence of HCQ, it had a parallel study design. However, according to the findings of Tett et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the bioavailability of HCQ is consistent in each individual at different times but variable between subjects. The FDA also advises that a crossover study design can make the variables determined by physiological factors (such as the clearance, volume of distribution, and absorption) have less interoccasion variability than that arising from formulation performance. Therefore, differences between two products because of formulation factors can be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, this study was conducted using a crossover design. Compared with the preceding study design, this one could eliminate individual differences. Before a generic product can be marketed in China, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) requires a bioequivalence experiment. The aim of this study was to compare the relative bioavailability of a new generic formulation (test) of HCQ and the branded formulation (reference) in a Chinese population to meet the SFDA&#x02019;s requirement for marketing the generic formulation in China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p>Hydroxychloroquine sulfate was purchased from C &#x00026; O Pharmaceutical Technology (Holdings), Ltd., (Nanjing, China), lot no. 090526.

In this study, the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221d;</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of HCQ were defined as the main parameters in order to assess the bioequivalence between both preparations. The criteria according to the SFDA&#x02019;s guidelines for bioequivalence are the 90% CIs of the test/reference geometric means ratio in the range of 80&#x02013;125% for the AUC and 70&#x02013;143% for <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The ANOVA results of this study showed that the formulation, period, and sequence had no statistically significant effect on the AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221d;</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> of HCQ. Chinese regulatory authorities do not require the testing of food effects in relative bioavailability studies. Therefore, we only conducted this study under the fasting condition.</p><p>In the bioequivalence study of HCQ sulfate tablets (0&#x02013;60&#x000a0;days), the ANOVA analysis results suggested that the main pharmacokinetic parameters are in accordance with the pharmacokinetics characteristic of a long half-life drug. As previously mentioned, the intra-subject bioavailability of HCQ is consistent. Therefore, according to the guideline of the FDA, for drugs that demonstrate low intra-subject variability in distribution and clearance, an AUC truncated at 72&#x000a0;h (AUC0&#x02013;72h) can be used in place of an AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub> or AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221d;</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This sample collection time was adequate to ensure completion of gastrointestinal transit (~2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days) of the drug product and absorption of the drug substance. Therefore, this study also evaluated the bioequivalence of HCQ between a test preparation and reference preparation in 0&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h (AUC0&#x02013;72h); the results showed that both formulations are bioequivalent. The results from the two studies let us confirm that when comparing the two formulations&#x02019; bioequivalence for this kind of long half-life of drugs such as the HCQ tablets, a bioequivalence of 0&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h is available to evaluate the bioavailability.</p><p>There are some potential limitations to the study. It was an open-label study, so it might not have objectively addressed the safety profiles of the test formulation. Moreover, the data of this study were obtained from healthy Chinese males under fasting conditions; thus, the findings cannot be expanded to predict therapeutic equivalence in patients in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the pharmacokinetics and the results of this study, it was concluded that the test and reference formulations of HCQ met the Chinese criteria for assuming bioequivalence. Both formulations were well tolerated in the population studies. Moreover, the results of applying a truncated AUC method in this study showed that this method is acceptable for estimating the relative bioavailability of HCQ.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was conducted to meet the regulatory guidelines for bioequivalence before allowing a drug on the Chinese market and was approved by the SFDA (approval document no. 2009L00031).
