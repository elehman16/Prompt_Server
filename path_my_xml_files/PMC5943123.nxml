It has been reported that recombinant human erythropoietin (RHE) can promote neurogenesis and angiogenesis following brain injury in animal studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Previous study has focused on patients with STBI, and found that RHE enhances functional recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> However, a study conducted in Australia reported that erythropoietin does not improve patients&#x02019; neurological status or the incidence of deep venous thrombosis of the lower limbs.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>The inconsistent results in the existing randomized controlled trials have tested the efficacy of RHE in patients with STBI. Thus, this trial further compares the efficacy and safety of RHE to a placebo in patients with STBI in China. We tested the hypothesis that RHE would improve neurological outcomes in patients with STBI.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of The People's Hospital of Yan&#x02019;an and was conducted at this hospital from April 2013 to March 2016. One hundred and twenty patients with STBI were included and were randomly divided into an intervention group or a control group equally. The severity of each participant was evaluated by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II),<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> in which higher values indicate more severe TBI.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>In this study, all patients with STBI were diagnosed and confirmed according to the patient's history, clinical examination, computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of &#x0003c;8. Additionally, patients also met the following inclusion criteria: &#x0003c;24&#x0200a;hours since brain injury; age 18 to 70 years; and ability to provide signed informed consent from either themselves or their closest family member. Patients were excluded if they had other major organ injuries or a history of thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and other conditions; died in the first 48&#x0200a;hours; pregnancy; or received erythropoientin within 1 month before the present study.</p><p>All participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a control group at 1:1 ratio by the stratified block randomization method with a computer-generated randomization schedule (generated by Software SAS, version 8.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). All investigators, patients, outcome assessors, and data analyst were blind to the treatment allocation.</p><p>All patients received either 6000 IU REH (E-Hua Biotech, Shandong, China) or placebo (0.9% saline) by a subcutaneous injection within 2&#x0200a;hours of admission. This schedule was also adhered to on 3rd, 5th, 10th, and 15 days after admission.</p><p>The primary outcome was neurological outcome, as measured by Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) scores. The secondary outcomes were measured by mortality and adverse events (AEs). All outcome measurements were evaluated at 10 weeks post-treatment.</p><p>The required sample size for the present study was estimated to be 60 patients in each group, with &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 (2-sided) and &#x003b2;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20. All outcome data were analyzed by an intention to treat approach. Chi-square tests and <italic>t</italic> tests were used to analyze the categorical and the continuous data, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals. A <italic>P</italic> value&#x0200a;&#x0003c;.05 was considered to have a significant statistical difference.</p></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Results</title><p>A total of 187 patients with STBI were initially screened for inclusion in the study (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

They found that RHE can improve patients&#x02019; functional recovery, and does not increase the risk for thromboembolic events or severe infections. Conversely, Nichol et al<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> also explored the effect of erythropoietin on the neurological recovery, mortality, and venous thrombotic events in patients with TBI, and found that erythropoietin does not decrease the number of patients with severe neurological dysfunction, and also does not increase venous thrombosis in lower limbs. Moreover, the effect of erythropoietin on mortality remains unclear. The findings of the present study are partly consistent with the Nichol's study in showing that short-term intervention with RHE does not improve neurological function for patients with STBI. The present study also did not find that RHE can reduce mortality for patients with STBI.</p><p>In this study, the patients with STBI in the intervention group did not show significantly higher neurological function improvement, as measured by GOS scores (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e;.05) or lower mortality (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;<italic>=</italic>&#x0200a;.47) than that observed in patients in the control group, suggesting that RHE neither enhances neurological function, nor decreases mortality in patients with STBI during the period of the treatment and 10-week follow-up.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, it was conducted at a single hospital, which may limit the generalization of our findings to other hospitals. Second, differences in the severity of the clinical symptoms of patients with STBI may also have affected the outcomes evaluation, although they did not have significant differences in the injury severity scores. Third, the injured area of brain and the psychiatric history may have also affected outcome measurements. Finally, this study only evaluated the effect and safety of RHE for treating patients with STBI in the short term. Thus, future clinical trials with longer intervention and follow-up periods are still needed.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrated that RHE neither enhanced neurological outcomes, nor reduced mortality for patients with STBI in the short term.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AEs = adverse events, APACHE II = Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation, CT = computerized tomography, DBP= diastolic blood pressure, GCS = Glasgow Coma Scale, ISS = Injury Severity Score, MRI = magnetic resonance imaging, RHE = recombinant human erythropoietin, SBP = systolic blood pressure, STBI = severe traumatic brain injury, TBI = traumatic brain injury.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
