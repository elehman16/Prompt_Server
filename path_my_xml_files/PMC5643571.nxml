For advanced ovarian cancer, cytoreductive surgery combined with chemotherapy, usually platinum/paclitaxel, can temporarily alleviate the condition, but the recurrence rate is as high as 85%.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Therefore, to explore a new treatment of high specificity, limited side effects, and with acceptable patient-tolerance is particularly important. In recent years, a rapid development of molecular targeted therapy for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer at home and abroad has ushered in a new era.</p><p>Angiogenesis refers to the process of sprouting a system of new blood vessels, mainly blood capillaries, based on the existed microvascular bed. Under normal physiological conditions, angiogenesis occurs only in embryonic development and in the tissue injury repair period, while the aberrant angiogenesis is one of the pathological changes seen in tumors.<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Angiogenesis is tightly regulated by a variety of angiogenic factors and angiogenesis inhibitors, including VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR), considered to be the strongest and the most specific key regulatory factors. It demonstrated that the VEGF expression in the tumor was lower in malignant tumors, borderline tumors, and benign tumors, and in lymph node metastasis it is significantly higher than in those without lymph node metastasis.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The VEGF expression in ovarian cancer is significantly higher than in normal ovarian tissue and benign ovarian tumors, suggesting that VEGF plays a key role in the development and progression of ovarian cancer.<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> These findings provide evidence for treating ovarian cancer by blocking VEGF expression. To determine the efficacy of anti-tumor angiogenesis therapy, there must be effective chemotherapy to decrease the tumor burden, and the activity of tumor was significantly decreased. The use of anti-tumor angiogenesis therapy can block tumor angiogenesis, reduce the vascular supply of the tumor, synergize with chemotherapy and prolong its effective time.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> Bevacizumab is a new molecular targeted drugs for anti-angiogenesis in phase II and III clinical trials for the treatment of refractory and recurrent ovarian cancer and ovarian cancer associated with malignant ascites.<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> It has achieved a definite therapeutic effect.</p><p>Rh-endosta is recombinant human rh-endostatin developed in our country with multiple target points, the mechanism of which is an anti-tumor effect by inhibiting the migration of vascular endothelial cells and blocking the tumor cell nutrient supply by acting on the microenvironment of tumor cells, thus achieving the purpose of inhibiting tumor growth or metastasis.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Kisker et&#x000a0;al<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> found that with single rh-endostar intraperitoneal injection in a mouse, tumor tissue could be cleared within 2&#x000a0;h. The use of a mini-osmotic pump for continuous administration would make the plasma concentration stable for a long time, and 1/8 of the amount of the injected dose can achieve the same anti-tumor effect. This might be due to the ongoing administration of the intravenous infusion, continuous uniform liquid input, and extended infusion time that maintained a stable blood concentration so that there was drug continually presentation and neovascular endothelial cells were exposed to a better anti-tumor effect.</p><p>This study compared the rh-endostar intravenous infusion pump in combination with chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone and compared the experimental group and the control group, and the efficiency and the overall stable rate have increased, and the difference was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Another study confirmed that rh-endostar can inhibit ovarian cancer cells and tumor growth, but rh-endostar intravenous infusion studies on ovarian cancer therapy are few.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref></p><p>Meanwhile, this study also measured patients' serum VEGF levels. After both treatments, serum VEGF levels were significantly lower than before (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05), which was consistent with some other findings that chemotherapy reduced the tumor burden and decreased VEGF levels.<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This study found that after four cycles of treatment, serum VEGF levels in the experimental group decreased significantly more than in the control group. This is evidence of rh-endostar's anti-angiogenic effect via inhibition of VEGF expression. The therapeutic effect may be due to the anti-tumor effect of rh-endostar showing significant effect-time dependence. With the extension of treatment time, the anti-tumor effect was significantly higher. From a retrospective analysis, the length of the rh-endostar treatment period and sustaining its use would bring greater benefits.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Kubota<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> showed that insufficient anti-angiogenic drugs of a therapeutic dose could lead to the rapid growth of blood vessels and limit the effect of inhibiting tumor growth. Therefore, the long period of rh-endostar application and subsequent maintenance therapy may bring greater benefits to patients.</p><p>In conclusion, rh-endostatin intravenous infusion combined with the TP regimen can enhance the efficacy of patients with advanced ovarian cancer and reduce the adverse reactions. Further study also needs long-term follow-up, a large-scale sample and a new standard for judging the clinical efficacy.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref
