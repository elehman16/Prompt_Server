electrical stimulation (FES) training on brain activity in children with spastic cerebral
palsy (CP) was the aim of this study. [Subjects and Methods] Subjects were randomized into
a BCI-FES group (n=9) and a functional electrical stimulation (FES) control group (n=9).
Subjects in the BCI-FES group received wrist and hand extension training with FES for 30
minutes per day, 5 times per week for 6 weeks under the BCI-based program. The FES group
received wrist and hand extension training with FES for the same amount of time.
Sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) and middle beta waves (M-beta) were measured in frontopolar
regions 1 and 2 (Fp1, Fp2) to determine the effects of BCI-FES training. [Results]
Significant improvements in the SMR and M-beta of Fp1 and Fp2 were seen in the BCI-FES
group. In contrast, significant improvement was only seen in the SMR and M-beta of Fp2 in
the control group. [Conclusion] The results of the present study suggest that
BCI-controlled FES training may be helpful in improving brain activity in patients with
cerebral palsy and may be applied as effectively as traditional FES training.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Spastic cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Brain computer interface</kwd><kwd>Functional electrical stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is a technique that can be used to treat muscles
paralyzed because of upper motor neuron lesions such as those observed in cerebral palsy
(CP) and hemiplegia<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. FES therapeutically
provokes contraction of denervated muscles by means of electric stimulation to create
functional movements. FES is also used to treat foot drop in patients with hemiplegia (via
electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve) and to rehabilitate paralyzed motor function in
patients with other disorders of the central nervous system<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, FES is particularly effective in treating muscle
weakness due to brain injury, as symptoms commonly originate from type II muscle fibers<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The technique can also be used to stimulate
muscle activation in patients with cerebral palsy, preventing weakness because of disuse,
and helping to reeducate the patient. While FES is a passive technique with no required
cognitive investment, researchers have discovered several benefits related to movement
enhancement when paretic limbs are treated with active, goal-oriented repetitive movement
training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The brain-computer interface (BCI) is a method by which patients are able to directly
control instruments (e.g., computer, virtual keyboard, virtual-reality environment)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> using their own brains, enabling them to
communicate and exercise control by focusing on the brain&#x02019;s electrical activity, as measured
using electroencephalography (EEG)<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the initial phases of its use, BCI was
approved for use in patients with severe motor dysfunction, such as amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, to enable communication and interaction with the external environment<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. BCI was subsequently tested and utilized in
research relevant to the rehabilitation of motor neurons in patients with quadriplegia as a
result of spinal cord injury<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research
has also shown that direct control of ankle dorsiflexion is possible when FES is used with
EEG signals, potentially allowing the brain direct access to control the movements of the
four extremities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the changes in brain activity between children with CP and healthy
controls following completion of a six-week BCI-FES training protocol were analyzed. The
purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of BCI-FES on brain
activity in children with CP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty children with CP were recruited to participate in this study. The inclusion criteria
were as follows: (1) diagnosis of spastic CP; (2) 4 to 9&#x02005;years of age; (3) level III/IV on
the Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS]; and (4) no history of orthopedic
surgery or spasticity-reduction intervention in the previous six months. Patients with a
high degree of spasticity or poorly controlled epilepsy, and children taking medication for
the treatment of stiffness were excluded from the study. All children who were recruited
participated in the intervention at a rehabilitation hospital for children. The present
study was approved by the Sahmyook University Institutional Review Board (SYUIRB2014-094).
The objective of the study and its requirements were explained to the subjects, and all
participants provided written parental consent, in accordance with the ethical principles of
the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>Sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) and middle beta waves (M-beta) were evaluated prior to the
intervention. Participants were randomized into a BCI-FES group (n=10) and an FES control
group (n=10). Subjects in both groups trained for 30 minutes per session, five times per
week for six weeks. In addition, the participants were offered conventional physical therapy
for 30 minutes per session, five times per week for six weeks. Each group had one dropout
due to personal reasons. The BCI-FES group contained six males and three females; their mean
age, height, and weight were 6.33 &#x000b1; 1.41&#x02005;years, 120.49 &#x000b1; 17.23&#x02005;cm, and 26.33 &#x000b1; 8.17&#x02005;kg,
respectively. Of these nine participants, six were right-handed, while three were
left-handed. The FES group consisted of five males and four females; their mean age, height,
and weight were 5.44 &#x000b1; 1.50&#x02005;years, 115.60 &#x000b1; 13.94&#x02005;cm, and 21.80 &#x000b1; 5.76&#x02005;kg, respectively. Of
these nine participants, five were right-handed and four were left-handed. There were no
significant differences in primary outcome measures such as SMR or M-beta between the groups
prior to training.</p><p>In the BCI-FES group, FES was applied as patients concentrated on finger extension, wrist
extension, wrist abduction, and wrist circumduction while holding a wrist bar. The equipment
consisted of a monitor screen facing the subjects, EEG sensors (Brainwave-sensing headset,
Neurosky, 2011) for retrieval of brainwave information, a laptop to record and process brain
wave signals, a USB output board to link brain wave signals to FES when concentration
occurred, and FES and EEG sensors to receive brain wave information when concentration was
high<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the measured level
of concentration surpassed the threshold of the concentration index, this information was
transferred to the USB output board, activating the FES (EMG FES 1000-Walking Man II,
Cybermedic Inc., Korea, 2009). EEG patterns during concentration were subsequently used to
trigger FES of the extensor carpi radialis, extensor carpi ulnaris, and extensor digitorum
longus to achieve wrist extension. In order to avoid muscle fatigue due to electrical
stimulation, the off-time was set to last 5 seconds, pulse frequency was 35&#x02005;Hz, pulse width
was 150&#x02005;&#x000b5;s, and current was 10&#x02013;20 mA<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Participants in the FES group underwent (EMG FES 1000-Walking Man II, Cybermedic Inc.,
Korea, 2009) 30 minutes of FES. Participants in the BCI-FES group were studied using the
previously defined parameters.</p><p>Poly G-I (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon, Korea) was used to measure brain wave activity. Brain waves
were measured in a separate space where patients were left undisturbed<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The EEGs were
based on the International 10&#x02013;20 electrode system, and measurement positions were taken on
the left side of frontopolar area 1 (Fp1) and the right side of frontopolar area 2 (Fp2).
Quantitative analysis of EEG data was performed using Telescan 2.98 (Laxtha Inc., Daejeon,
South Korea). With regard to the overall raw EEG data, 70 seconds of each measurement were
analyzed after exclusion of the first and last ten seconds. Raw EEG data were converted into
frequencies using a fast Fourier transformation. Brain waves were categorized according to
convention into sensorimotor rhythm (12&#x02013;15&#x02005;Hz), and mid-beta (15&#x02013;20&#x02005;Hz). The attention index
was defined as the ratio of theta waves to SMR and mid-beta waves<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SPSS 20.0 program (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The
Shapiro-Wilk test was used to determine the distribution of general participant
characteristics and outcome measures. Paired t-tests were used to compare the changes in
pre-test and post-test brain wave measurements within each group, and an independent t-test
was performed to compare the two groups. A p-value&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Analysis of EEG data for the BCI-FES group revealed significant increases in the SMR of Fp1

interact with his or her environment through brain signals and restores motor function by
inducing activity-dependent brain plasticity<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. BCI feedback training is also used in the
rehabilitation of stroke patients. For instance, electroencephalography (EEG)-based BCI
detects event-related synchronization in the oscillatory rhythms of sensorimotor activity
associated with motor imagery or action observation, which in turn drives the BCI. Recent
research has focused on combining BCI and FES to exercise control over output devices<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, BCI offers insight into the
visuospatial patterns of such phenomena as event-related desynchronization, event-related
synchronization and sensorimotor rhythms through motor imagery, motor observation, and
movement execution<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, the results indicated a concentration index for FES with respect to
the six types of movement of the fingers/wrist after observation of the recordings. The SMR
concentration index in Fp1 increased from 9.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 19.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>
(p&#x0003c;0.05) in the BCI-FES group and the SMR concentration index in Fp2 increased from 1.5 &#x000d7;
10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 30.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> (p&#x0003c;0.05). In addition, the M-beta
concentration index in Fp1 M-beta increased 8.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 15.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>
(p&#x0003c;0.05), and from 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> to 26.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> (p&#x0003c;0.05) in Fp2 in
the BCI-FES group. Chung et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>
utilized BCI-FES in post-stroke patients, and found that the attention index was
significantly increased in Fp1 and Fp2, and activation index was significantly increased in
Fp1. Lee et al. <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> used virtual
reality-based bilateral upper-extremity training, and found significant increases in
concentration in Fp2 and Fp4 and brain activity in Fp1 and F3. In this study, the results
demonstrated significant increases in the SMR and M-beta concentration index. A potential
reason for this improvement is that the children with CP received visual stimuli. As a
result, event-related synchronization was shown while they were concentrated on finger
extension, wrist extension, wrist abduction, and wrist circumduction while holding a wrist
bar. After synchronization, brain activity was necessary for motor imagery, specifying the
details from motor observation, and then finally the movement execution stage.</p><p>Mid-beta waves are related to logical thinking, problem solving, and attentiveness to
external stimuli. When such waves are present, improvements in problem solving, simple
concentration, general cognitive ability, and self-awareness with respect to bodily position
and muscular stability, have been observed<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has also been shown that subjects in this state are able to
concentrate without tension and perform appropriately<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Educated self-control, through training designed to increase the
sensorimotor rhythm, can in turn increase memory ability, attentive concentration, sensory
perception, and language cognition<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, sensorimotor rhythms are observed when stable vigilance and attentive
concentration are maintained. Involuntary movements are reduced as motor activity declines
and sensorimotor rhythm activity is increased. Sensorimotor rhythm (12&#x02013;15&#x02005;Hz) and beta
(15&#x02013;18&#x02005;Hz) activation can consistently improve concentration and reaction time<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results indicated that BCI-controlled
FES increases brain activity in children with cerebral palsy and that the relative
difference between pre- and post-intervention measures corresponds with improved wrist
movement through visual stimuli, concentration, and muscle contraction from FES. These
increases in concentration, improvement of wrist movement from muscle contraction, and joint
ROM increase might have resulted in the improvements in upper extremity function.
Researchers have also observed activation in the somatosensory and contralateral premotor
