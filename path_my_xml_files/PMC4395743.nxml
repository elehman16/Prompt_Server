The general
characteristics of their gait include reduced gait velocity, inefficient gait, reduced
muscle cooperation, and spatiotemporal asymmetry. Reduced control of muscle activities,
muscle weakness, and spasticity-related changes characterize stroke patients&#x02019; gait
disturbance. In addition, symmetric gait is the most important determinant for the recovery
of stroke patients&#x02019; ambulatory functions<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients&#x02019; gaits have been reported to be related to sensory deficiencies, abnormal
muscle activity, or abnormal postural mechanisms<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The most important problem in post-stroke hemiplegic patients&#x02019;
physiological activities is gait disturbance. Hemiplegic patients require postural control
plans for ambulatory functions and standing, and they show functional gait disturbance when
postural control is insufficient<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Many researchers have reported that stroke patients&#x02019; hipflexor<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, kneeextensor<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and ankle plantarflexor<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> muscle strengths are correlated with comfortable and fast gaits and
that, in particular, postural instability in the pre-swing phase affects gait velocity<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Suzuki et al. reported that according to
results based on the use of isokinetic muscle strength equipment, knee extensor muscle
strength was closely related to gait velocity in mild or moderate strokepatients<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clinically, spasticity and abnormal muscle activity or tone are two general characteristics
of stroke patients. However, the level of correlation between stroke patients&#x02019;
spasticity/abnormal muscle tone and their gait velocity is still controversial. Some
researchers have reported that stroke patients&#x02019; gait velocity is correlated with the stages
of recovery of the motion of the hemiplegic side lower extremity such as Brunnstrom&#x02019;s
recovery stage<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>) </sup>or the Fugl-Meyer Motor
Assessment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. For instance, Nadeau et
al. noted that Fugl-Meyer balance scores are correlated with high gait velocity and
comfortable gait velocity in mild or moderate stroke patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Suzuki et al. argued that standing balance and maximum
gait velocity were not correlated with each other in stroke patients with a good sense of
balance, since stroke patients showed less than 30&#x02005;cm difference in the movement distance of
their center of foot pressure, and approximately 10 seconds in their level of standing
balance<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Stroke patients&#x02019; gait velocities are slower than those of healthy adults and they show
asymmetric spatiotemporal gait characteristics. In several previous studies, researchers
have reported that stroke patients&#x02019; average gait velocities range from 0.18 to 1.03 m/s<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, while those of healthy adults are
approximately1.4 m/s<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In another study, gait asymmetry was identified through the measurement of kinematic,
kinetic, and spatiotemporal parameters<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Chen et al. reported that in a comparison of stroke patients&#x02019; gait velocity and general
adults&#x02019; gait velocity, the lower extremities of stroke patients show asymmetry at the
beginning of the swing phase and the stance phase<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The present study was conducted to investigate the association between and gait parameters.
Hemiplegic patients walked at gait velocity different gait velocities and differences in
gait parameters according to gait velocity were determined to examine their
relationships.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The present study was conducted observing the research ethics described in the Declaration
of Helsinki and the research ethics regulations of the hospital. Sufficient explanations
were provided to all the study subjects, who gave their written consent before participating
in the study. There were 20 subjects in the study, 12 males and 8 females. Their average age
was 59.19&#x000b1;4.18&#x02005;years, and their average time after the onset of stroke was 15&#x000b1;3.24 months.
The affected side was the right side of 8 patients and the left side of 12 patients.</p><p>The subjects of this study were 20 hemiplegic stroke patients who recovered independent
gait after receiving rehabilitation treatment focused on gait and balance at a
rehabilitation hospital located in Hwaseong City, Gyeonggi-do. The study subjects were
patients who were scheduled to receive occupational therapy along with balance and gait
training based on neurodevelopment treatment two hours a day, five times a week. The
inclusion criteria were: ability to walk independently without a walking aid; at least six
months from onset of stroke; ability to properly communicate and comprehend instructions; no
visual, auditory, or vestibular disabilities; no orthopedic problems that might have
influenced balance of the lower extremities; and willingness to participate in the
experiment after receiving an explanation of the purposes of this study. Patients with the
following conditions were excluded: severe cardiac disorders or uncontrollable hypertensive
lesions that might lead to difficulties with gait; complaints of pain in the lower extremity
during gait due to orthopedic problems; and neuropsychiatric issues.</p><p>The subjects did not perform strenuous exercise before the study began. To enhance the
reliability of the analysis of gait characteristics, the assessments were conducted three
days per week at the same time every day. The assessments were repeated 30 minutes after the
initial assessment to enhance reliability. Measurement was conducted three times at the two
gait velocities, and the subjects were allowed to rest when necessary. The subjects were
instructed to wear comfortable shoes and were allowed to use walking aids when
necessary.</p><p>In this study, the gait velocities were measured using ground reaction forces on a
treadmill (Zebris Medical GmbH, FDM-T system, Isny, Germany). The treadmill used for gait
analysis was 1.5&#x02005;m long, 0.5&#x02005;m wide, and had 5,378 sensor plates. The data were obtained at
a sampling rate of 120&#x02005;Hz.</p><p>In the present study, the temporal and spatial elements of gait were measured. Each patient
walked maintaining a comfortable speed for the first minute, and measurement was conducted
for 30 seconds at a treadmill speed of 1&#x02005;km/hour thereafter. Then, the subjects walked at a
treadmill speed of 2&#x02005;km/hour for 30 seconds after a 30-minute rest. The patients did not
hold the safety bar when walking on the treadmill and foot rotation, step width, load
response, mid-stance, pre-swing, swing, and double-stance phases were derived from
measurements made at the different walking speeds.</p><p>SPSS ver. 17.0 stastistical software was used for the statistical analysis of the collected
data. The paired t-test was used to verify the significance of the changes between the gait
velocities. Values of p&#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Foot rotation at the l&#x02005;km/hour gait was 23.0&#x000b0; on the hemiplegic side and 9.3&#x000b0; on the
unaffected side, and at 2&#x02005;km/hour it was 21.8&#x000b0; on the hemiplegic side and 9.7&#x000b0; on the
unaffected side, with both sides showing significant differences. The step width was 19&#x000b1;1 cm
at 1&#x02005;km/hour and 21&#x000b1;2&#x02005;cm at 2&#x02005;km/hour, a significance difference. The load response at
1&#x02005;km/hour was 26.4&#x000b1;3.1% on the hemiplegic side and 21.3&#x000b1;2.9% on the unaffected side, and at
2&#x02005;km/hour it was 21.2&#x000b1;2.1% on the hemiplegic side and 19.9&#x000b1;2.2% on the unaffected side, with
the values of both sides showing significant differens. The mid-stance ratio was 18.9&#x000b1;3.1%
on the hemiplegic side and 33.3&#x000b1;2.7% on the unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour, and 22.7&#x000b1;1.2% on
the hemiplegic side and 36.1&#x000b1;1.9% on the unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour with the values of
both sides indicating significant differences. The pre-swing was 21.2&#x000b1;2.2% on the hemiplegic
side and 26.4&#x000b1;3.3% on the unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour, and 19.9&#x000b1;1.7% on the hemiplegic side
and 21.2&#x000b1;1.8% on the unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour with the values of both sides indicating
significant differences. The swing phase was 33.5&#x000b1;3.1% on the hemiplegic side and 18.9&#x000b1;1.6%
on the unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour, and 36.3&#x000b1;2.9% on the hemiplegic side and 22.7&#x000b1;1.4% on
the unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour. With the values of both sides indicating significant
differences. The double stance phase was 47.8&#x000b1;3.7% at 1&#x02005;km/hour and 41.2&#x000b1;2.7% at 2&#x02005;km/hour,
a significant difference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In hemiplegic patients, hemiplegic side lower extremity malfunction in the swing phase and
compensation are correlated. Hemiplegic patients begin having difficulty properly using the
kinetic force of the hemiplegic side lower extremity in the pre-swing phase due to
inadequate thrust from the hemiplegic side hip flexor<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> and ankle plantarflexor<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such patients have difficulty bearing weight during the peak in
the last part of the single-leg stance phase and do not generate sufficient force during the
forward movement of both lower extremities, which affects their gait patterns, resulting in
asymmetrical gait<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In hemiplegic
patients&#x02019; gait cycles, weight shifts to the hemiplegic side play an important role in
standing on one foot, preventing shaking by providing stability to the lower extremity as
well as to the trunk<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present
study, when gait parameters were examined at the two different speeds of 1&#x02005;km/hour and
2&#x02005;km/hour, the changes in load response were found to be 26.4&#x000b1;3.1% on the hemiplegic side
and 21.3&#x000b1;2.9% on the unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour, and 21.2&#x000b1;2.1% on the hemiplegic side and
19.9&#x000b1;2.2% on the unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour. The mid stance ratio was found to be
18.9&#x000b1;3.1% on the hemiplegic side and 33.3&#x000b1;2.7% on the unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour, and
22.7&#x000b1;1.2% on the hemiplegic side and 36.1&#x000b1;1.9% on the unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour. The
pre-swing ratio was found to be 21.2&#x000b1;2.2% on the hemiplegic side and 26.4&#x000b1;3.3% on the
unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour, and 19.9&#x000b1;1.7%on the hemiplegic side and 21.2&#x000b1;1.8% on the
unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour.</p><p>The swing phase ratio at the two different speeds of 1&#x02005;km/hour and 2&#x02005;km/hour were 33.5&#x000b1;3.1%
on the hemiplegic side and 18.9&#x000b1;1.6% on the unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour and 36.3&#x000b1;2.9% on
the hemiplegic side and 22.7&#x000b1;1.4% on the unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour. The double stance
phase ratio was 47.8&#x000b1;3.7% at 1&#x02005;km/hour and 41.2&#x000b1;2.7% at 2&#x02005;km/hour.</p><p>Similar to the results of the present study, previous studies have reported that hemiplegic
patients have difficulty standing on one foot on the hemiplegic side, compared to healthy
persons, and that related compensation appears frequently. In general, most hemiplegic
patients&#x02019; weight bearing and thrust for walking activities tend to be stronger on the
unaffected side than on the hemiplegic side<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the decline in hemiplegic side muscle activity shown
in the hemiplegic side stance phase in hemiplegic patients&#x02019; gait cycles aggravates decreases
in plantar pressure for forward thrust, shaking of the upper body, and pelvic
instability<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hemiplegic patients and healthy persons show differences in other gait elements as well.
Step widths are greater in hemiplegic patients, and this is associated with unstable
balance. Hemiplegic patients&#x02019; asymmetry appears more prominently in step lengths, and the
unaffected side and the hemiplegic side step lengths are not the same<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the present study, step widths on the hemiplegic side were 19&#x000b1;1.0&#x02005;cm at 1&#x02005;km/hour and
21&#x000b1;2.0&#x02005;cm at 2&#x02005;km/hour. Foot rotation at the different speeds were 23.0&#x000b1;1.7 degrees on the
hemiplegic side and 9.3&#x000b1;0.8 degrees on the unaffected side at 1&#x02005;km/hour, and 21.8&#x000b1;1.9
degrees on the hemiplegic side and 9.7&#x000b1;0.9 degrees on the unaffected side at 2&#x02005;km/hour.</p><p>Similar to the present study, previous studies have also demonstrated that in cases of mild
hemiplegia, with no deficits in cognitive ability and visual perceptual ability, ambulatory
ability (gait velocity, spatiotemporal asymmetry) and physical disorders (muscle strength,
lower extremity motor and sensory functions, the degree of spasticity of the hemiplegic side
ankle plantar flexor) are correlated.</p><p>Previous studies have also suggested that in cases of mild hemiplegia, gait velocity and
asymmetry are directly related to physical disorder. Therefore, in the case of gait training
for hemiplegic patients, the goals should be established after first considering physical
disorder<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Hemiplegic patients&#x02019; show significant differences between hemiplegic side support and
unaffected side support at the start of gait. Steps involving weight bearing on the
hemiplegic side lower extremity are shorter than those of the unaffected side lower
extremity. Therefore, in the case of hemiplegic patients, weight bearing on the hemiplegic
side lower extremity tends to decrease when gait begins, and during the stages of support by
the unaffected side lower extremity tends to increase compared to healthy adults<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies&#x02019; findings are consistent
with those of the present study.</p><p>Typical characteristics of post-stroke hemiplegic patients&#x02019; gait are long gait cycles, low
gait velocity, asymmetry of gait between the hemiplegic side and the unaffected sides, and
short strides on the hemiplegic side which result in high ratios of the swing phase<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The findings of the present study are
similar to those of previous studies.</p><p>During hemiplegic patients&#x02019; gait, the ratio of weight bearing by the hemiplegic side lower
extremity decreased, and the length of weight-bearing time on both feet increased<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our present results are consistent with
those of previous studies conducted by Hesse et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> and Kirker et al<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results are attributable to hemiplegic patients&#x02019; lack of
ability to control balance during weight-bearing by the hemiplegic side lower extremity,
which aggravates instability during weight bearing. It for hemiplegic patients to bear
weight on the unaffected side lower extremity longer than on the hemiplegic side lower
extremity, and longer than normal adults as well. The amount of time increases to compensate
for hemiplegic patients&#x02019; generation of insufficient thrust by the hemiplegic side lower
extremity<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of previous studies and the present study are consistent, indicating that
hemiplegic patients&#x02019; gait show shorter unaffected side swing phases, longer unaffected side
weight bearing, shorter hemiplegic side weight bearing, and longer hemiplegic side swing
phases than healthy adults, as well as instability in weight bearing related to differences
in gait velocities. The present results provide basic data for gait velocity changes for
hemiplegic patients.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Hodt-Billington</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Helbostad</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Moe-Nilssen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Should trunk movement or footfall parameters quantify gait
