Observational studies in high-income and resource-limited settings indicate that HIV-infected adults with low vitamin D levels may be at increased risk of mortality, HIV disease progression, and incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). As a result, vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation may improve survival and treatment outcomes for HIV-infected adults initiating ART.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Trial of Vitamins-4 (ToV4) is an individually randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) supplementation conducted among 4000 HIV-infected adults with low vitamin D levels [25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;ng/mL] initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The two primary aims of the trial are to determine the effect of a vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation regimen on incidence of (1) mortality and (2) pulmonary TB as compared to a matching placebo regimen. The primary safety outcome of the study is incident hypercalcemia. The investigational vitamin D<sub>3</sub> regimen consists of oral supplements containing 50,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> taken under direct observation at randomization and once a week for 3&#x000a0;weeks (four doses) followed by daily oral supplements containing 2000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> taken at home from the fourth week until trial discharge at 1&#x000a0;year post ART initiation. Trial participants are followed up at weekly clinic visits during the first month of ART and at monthly clinic visits thereafter until trial discharge at 1&#x000a0;year post ART initiation. Secondary aims of the trial are to examine the effect of the vitamin D<sub>3</sub> regimen on CD4 T cell reconstitution, incidence of non-TB comorbidities, body mass index (BMI), depression and anxiety, physical activity, bone health, and immunologic biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ToV4 will provide causal evidence on the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on incidence of pulmonary TB and mortality among HIV-infected Tanzanian adults initiating ART. The trial will also give insight to whether vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation trials for the prevention of pulmonary TB should be pursued in HIV-uninfected populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01798680">NCT01798680</ext-link>.

In contrast to the success in expanding ART access, HIV-infected adults initiating ART in sub-Saharan Africa continue to experience significantly higher rates of morbidity and mortality during the initial months of treatment as compared to HIV-infected individuals in high-income settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The 1-year mortality rate for HIV-infected individuals initiating ART in the urban Dar es Salaam, Tanzania HIV care and treatment program is estimated to be 13.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As a result, low-cost interventions are needed to prolong and improve quality of life for HIV-infected individuals receiving ART in Tanzania and similar resource-limited settings.</p><p>Vitamin D is a potent immunomodulator with effects on both adaptive and innate immune responses which may play a prominent role in control of intracellular pathogens by enhancing cell-mediated immunity, production of antimicrobial peptides, and phagocytic activity of macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Accordingly, HIV-infected individuals with adequate levels of vitamin D may better control HIV replication and intracellular opportunistic infections as compared to individuals with suboptimal vitamin D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Observational cohort studies have examined the association of vitamin D status with HIV-related morbidity and mortality in both high-income and resource-limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The largest study to date in high-income settings was conducted among a sub-sample of 1985 individuals enrolled in the EuroSIDA cohort, which consists of HIV-infected adults from 31 European countries, Israel, and Argentina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The EuroSIDA vitamin D study determined individuals in the highest (&#x0003e;20&#x000a0;ng/ml) and middle (12&#x02013;20&#x000a0;ng/mL) tertiles of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) had 44% and 32% reduced risk of death as compared with individuals in the lowest tertile (&#x0003c;12&#x000a0;ng/mL), respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there have been three prospective cohort studies of vitamin D conducted among HIV-infected adults in resource-limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The first vitamin D cohort study was conducted by our group among 884 HIV-infected Tanzanian pregnant women prior to availability of ART and we determined women in the highest quintile of 25(OH)D had 42% lower risk of all-cause mortality as compared with those in the lowest quintile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In addition, &#x0003c;32&#x000a0;ng/mL 25(OH)D was associated with increased risk of progression to World Health Organization (WHO) HIV stage 3 or 4 disease and incidence of severe anemia, wasting, acute upper respiratory infections, and oral thrush [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. We also more recently conducted a prospective cohort study of vitamin D among HIV-infected adult men and women initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In this study we found individuals with vitamin D deficiency at ART initiation (25(OH)D levels &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;ng/mL) had twice the risk of mortality during the first 2&#x000a0;years of treatment as compared to individuals with vitamin D sufficiency (25(OH)D levels &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;ng/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. HIV-infected adults initiating ART with vitamin D sufficiency also had reduced risk of incident pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), oral thrush, wasting, and &#x0003e;10% weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The third observational cohort study was conducted among 398 HIV-infected Ugandan adults receiving ART, which found individuals with vitamin D deficiency (&#x0003c;20&#x000a0;ng/mL 25(OH)D) had on average 65 cells/&#x003bc;L lower CD4 T cell counts at 18&#x000a0;months of follow-up as compared to individuals with vitamin D sufficiency (&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;ng/mL 25(OH)D). Overall, the observational evidence suggest HIV-infected individuals with low levels of vitamin D may be at increased risk of mortality, pulmonary TB, HIV disease progression, have poorer CD4 T cell reconstitution when on ART. Nevertheless, there are no published randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation among HIV-infected adults in resource-limited settings published to date to determine causal effects.</p><p>The potential role of vitamin D in pulmonary TB immune responses has long been acknowledged as over 25&#x000a0;years ago Rook and colleagues published results showing the active form of vitamin D suppressed proliferation of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Over the past few decades, a large number of studies have examined the role of vitamin D in immune responses, particularly in macrophage function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A study by Liu and colleagues found that ligation of macrophage toll-like receptor 2/1 by Mtb antigen induces expression of the vitamin D receptor and synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D by macrophages can then upregulate expression of cathelicidin, which is an antimicrobial peptide integral for killing Mtb and other intracellular pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In addition, a landmark study by Fabri and colleagues determined vitamin D is required for an interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;)-mediated antimicrobial pathway in macrophages which leads to autophagy, phagosomal maturation, and other antimicrobial activities against Mtb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Generally, there is strong evidence from immunological studies suggesting that maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D may improve immune responses to TB.</p><p>There have also been a similarly large number of epidemiologic studies conducted on the relationship of vitamin D and incidence of pulmonary TB. Numerous case-control studies have determined individuals with active TB have significantly lower 25(OH)D and different genetic variants of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as compared to healthy controls or the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A recent case-control study among HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected South Africans found TB cases had about five times the odds of vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;ng/mL) as compared to population controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Nevertheless, these cross-sectional studies are prone to bias due to reverse causation since increased immune activation in individuals with active TB may lead to decreased 25(OH)D levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Only a few prospective cohort studies, which limit the potential of reverse causation, have examined the association of vitamin D and incidence of TB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In one small prospective cohort study conducted in Pakistan, household TB contacts in the lowest tertile 25(OH)D (&#x0003c;7&#x000a0;ng/mL) had increased risk of developing TB, although these results are based on only eight incident TB cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another small cohort study of TB contacts in Spain determined contacts with low vitamin D (&#x0003c;10&#x000a0;ng/mL 25(OH)D) had increased risk of tuberculin skin test conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. We conducted the largest prospective cohort study of vitamin D and incidence of TB to date among HIV-infected Tanzanian adults initiating ART [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In this study we determined individuals with 25(OH)D levels &#x0003c;20&#x000a0;ng/mL at ART initiation had approximately three times the risk of incident pulmonary TB as compared to adults with &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;ng/mL and this relationship persisted after excluding TB cases in the first 2&#x000a0;months of ART to effectively rule out reverse causation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Overall, there is a growing base of observational evidence that HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals with low vitamin D may be at increased risk of developing pulmonary TB.</p><p>Randomized controlled trials of vitamin D treatment for individuals with pulmonary TB have produced mixed findings on sputum conversion and other TB treatment outcomes; however, no randomized controlled trials of vitamin D have been conducted for prevention of pulmonary TB disease to the best of our knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. One small randomized trial conducted in Mongolia examined the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on tuberculin skin test conversion among 120 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In this trial children supplemented with 800&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub>/day had about a 60% reduction in the risk of tuberculin skin test conversion during the 6&#x000a0;months of follow-up as compared to children randomized to placebo, but the results were not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. A major barrier to conducting pulmonary TB prevention trials in the general population is the large sample size required due to low rates of TB activation (1% of those with positive tuberculin skin test per year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Nevertheless, these sample size issues are not insurmountable since incident pulmonary TB endpoints are feasible in trials of HIV-infected populations. TB activation rates are 7&#x02013;10% per year in individuals with advanced HIV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As a result, randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation for TB prevention among HIV-infected individuals can be used to inform if larger and more costly trials are needed among HIV-uninfected populations, including TB contacts.</p><p>Overall, there is a growing biologic and epidemiologic evidence base which suggests HIV-infected individuals with low vitamin D levels may have increased risk of incident pulmonary TB disease and mortality; however, no randomized controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation have been published to date. In order to provide much needed causal evidence, we present the protocol for an ongoing individually randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation conducted among HIV-infected individuals initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Trial of Vitamins-4 (ToV4) is an individually randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (cholecalciferol) supplementation among HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01798680).

The majority of mortality for HIV-infected individuals initiating ART in resource-limited settings occurs in the first months of treatment and as a result boosting 25(OH)D levels quickly with large doses of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> may produce a larger effect than daily supplements which would more gradually increase 25(OH)D over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A randomized trial using a similar two-stage regimen of weekly 50,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> for 4&#x000a0;weeks followed by monthly 50,000&#x000a0;IU vitamin D<sub>3</sub> maintenance doses of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> among adults with primary hyperparathyroidism found 25(OH)D levels increased 19&#x000a0;ng/mL from baseline to 6&#x000a0;months and maintained levels up to 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. We expect a similar approximately 20&#x000a0;ng/mL increase in 25(OH)D from randomization to 6&#x000a0;months.

Research nurses assess inclusion/exclusion criteria for the trial and if eligible also seek written informed consent for a blood draw to screen serum 25(OH)D levels. In order to assess pregnancy status of potential participants, all females are asked the date of their last menstrual period and any woman who has not had their menstrual period in the previous 6&#x000a0;weeks is given a pregnancy test. Individuals who meet all eligibility for ToV4 screening and consent for a blood draw have 5&#x000a0;mL of blood collected in a red-top vacutainer tube for serum 25(OH)D assessment.

For participants who are confirmed to have died we administer a standardized verbal autopsy to relatives or individuals present around the time of death to assign a cause of death. Participants that die in a health facility also have events before and at the time of death transcribed from hospital records.

Participants who are sputum AFB negative for whom TB is still suspected are tested by GeneXpert for detection of Mtb. DNA. According to Tanzanian national guidelines, pulmonary TB diagnosis is made when at least one sputum smear is positive for AFB, GeneXpert detects Mtb DNA, or when there are radiological features suggestive of TB in the presence of constitutional TB symptoms.

In addition participants are monitored at all clinic visits by study physicians for symptoms of hypercalcemia including: nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst, anorexia, symptoms of kidney stones, and confusion. If any of these symptoms are reported and there is no other suspected cause, study clinicians order calcium and albumin testing. At this point participants with suspected hypercalcemia stop their randomized treatment regimen until calcium testing results are returned. If albumin-adjusted calcium levels are normal for hypercalcemia suspects, the patient is allowed to re-start the regimen under discretion of study physicians.

The best way to ensure full compliance is to observe each participant ingesting treatment. In ToV4 research nurses directly monitor subjects taking the weekly trial supplements (randomization, week 1, week 2, week 3), but this type of monitoring is not practical for the subsequent daily supplements taken in the home (week 4 to month 12). In order to promote adherence during the daily regimen period, all participants are encouraged to use the daily supplements at the same time every day, to put the bottle in a visible place, and identify an adherence assistant who would remind her/him to take the supplement. Compliance with the daily ToV4 supplements will be assessed three ways: (a) direct questioning about use of the supplements in the previous 24&#x000a0;hours and 2&#x000a0;weeks, (b) pill count from returned daily regimen bottles, and (c) biochemical assessment of 25(OH)D in a subset of participants longitudinally at randomization, 1, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Standard of care</title><p>All study participants are provided with HIV care and treatment that adhere to Tanzanian national guidelines.

Per Tanzanian guidelines, zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz are the choice first-line regimen with tenofovir, nevirapine, and stavudine as back-up drugs. The standard visit schedule for patients on ART is clinic visits at 2&#x000a0;weeks and 1&#x000a0;month post-initiation with monthly thereafter. Patients who are stable after 6&#x000a0;months of ART are eligible receive a 2-month supply of ART with a subsequent scheduled clinic visit at corresponding 2-month intervals. CD4 T cell counts are assessed at the ART eligibility visit and every 6&#x000a0;months after ART initiation. During the trial HIV viral load testing became available as standard of care with assessment every 6&#x000a0;months after ART initiation. Prophylaxis for opportunistic infections is provided in line with the Tanzanian HIV treatment guidelines. Participants receive co-trimoxazole prophylaxis if CD4 cell count is &#x0003c;200 cells/&#x003bc;L. All participants diagnosed with TB are treated according to the WHO-approved guidelines of the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Program (NTLP) in Tanzania. All TB patients receive directly observed therapy (DOT) with a 6-month short course regimen consisting of a 2-month intensive phase of daily rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide/ethambutol (RHZE) combination tablets, followed by a 4-month continuation phase of daily rifampicin and isoniazid (RH) combination tablets. Sputa from smear-positive TB patients is collected and examined at 0, 2 and 5&#x000a0;months and at any other time if recurrence of TB is suspected. If the direct sputum smear is negative at the end of 2&#x000a0;months, the continuation phase is started and if a smear is still positive at 3&#x000a0;months the patient is checked for multi-drug resistance. Treatment failures and relapses are treated with an 8-month re-treatment regimen containing rifampicin throughout, with the intensive period with RHZE and streptomycin injection continuing for 3&#x000a0;months.

We will use linear mixed-effects models with a random intercept, a compound symmetric covariance structure, and robust standard errors to assess mean differences between baseline and post-randomization levels of CD4 T cell count, BMI, METs, 25(OH)D, PTH, ALP, IL-2, IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3;, and cathelicidin by randomization group. Linear mixed-effects models will lead to robust inference for the fixed effects even if the covariance structure is misspecified. Linear mixed-effects models will also account for within-subject correlation, and accommodate varying number and timing of measurements per participant over time. We will use a generalized linear mixed model with random intercept, a compound symmetric covariance structure, and robust standard errors to assess differences in the incidence of comorbidities and complications associated with HIV and/or ART which are repeatable binomial events. The log-rank test will be used to assess differences in the incidence rates of wasting and &#x0003e;10% weight loss between the treatment arms.</p><p>We will also examine effect modification of any treatment effect by pre-defined baseline variables: 25(OH)D concentration, sex, age, BMI, CD4 T cell count, hemoglobin concentration, WHO HIV disease stage, pulmonary TB, receipt of isoniazid preventive therapy, ART regimen, and trial regimen compliance. To assess the statistical significance of each interaction, we will use the likelihood ratio test for risk-ratio homogeneity in the mortality, pulmonary TB, and hypercalcemia analyses and the score test in the linear mixed-effects and generalized linear mixed models for longitudinal secondary outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Antiretroviral therapy coverage is rapidly expanding globally and treatment programs are in need of interventions to prolong and improve the quality of life for HIV-infected individuals in resource-limited settings, especially during the initial months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation may be an effective ART adjunct intervention since vitamin D deficiency is common among HIV-infected individuals, ART can further reduce vitamin D levels by altering vitamin D metabolism, multiple observational cohort studies have determined low vitamin D levels are associated with increased risk of mortality, pulmonary TB, and disease progression among HIV-infected individuals, and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplements are known to be effective and safe in improving vitamin D status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Based on this rationale, the ToV4 was designed to establish the causal effect vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on mortality and incidence of pulmonary TB among HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. A search of clinicaltrials.gov determined the only other clinical trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> among HIV-infected individuals with mortality or morbidity outcomes listed as primary or secondary outcomes is an ongoing study called the &#x0201c;Trial of Vitamin D in HIV Progression, Birth Outcomes, and Child Health&#x0201d; (NCT02305927). This ongoing trial is also conducted by our research group and is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation among HIV-infected pregnant women in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Accordingly, the ToV4 will likely be the first randomized trial to determine the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on mortality and morbidity outcomes among HIV-infected adult men and non-pregnant women.</p><p>The study population of the ToV4 was purposely defined by inclusion and exclusion criteria to select a population that may have significant benefit from vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation but also allow for generalizability of the findings. In the trial we only enroll HIV-infected adults initiating ART with 25(OH)D levels &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;ng/mL and exclude individuals with &#x02265;30&#x000a0;ng/mL from randomization procedures. The 25(OH)D inclusion criteria was based on our observational cohort study of HIV-infected adults initiating ART in Tanzania which suggested there is likely little to no benefit to obtaining 25(OH)D levels &#x0003e;30&#x000a0;ng/mL in terms of mortality and pulmonary TB in our study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The restriction of the trial population to individuals &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;ng/mL 25(OH)D also assists with translation of the findings as HIV programs in similar settings will be able estimate the potential impact of implementing vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation based on their local prevalence of 25(OH)D &#x0003c;30&#x000a0;ng/mL. We also tried to maintain the generalizability of our findings by defining the study population as adults initiating ART broadly and did not restrict the study population by CD4 T cell and WHO disease stage criteria. HIV treatment programs in Tanzania and sub-Saharan Africa are moving from using a &#x0003c;350 to a &#x0003c;500 CD4 T cells/&#x003bc;L threshold for ART initiation based on WHO guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. As we expected, the Dar es Salaam HIV treatment program changed ART initiation guidelines from &#x0003c;350 to a &#x0003c;500 CD4 T cells/&#x003bc;L threshold to a &#x02018;test-and-treat&#x02019; strategy during the trial and as a result the general ToV4 population of adults initiating ART became on average healthier over the course of the trial as the new guideline were gradually implemented. Nevertheless, the slight decrease in power due to lower event rates is outweighed by the need for our trial to reflect the population of adults initiating ART for possible implementation of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation in the treatment program. The ToV4 DSMB reviews event rates every 6&#x000a0;months and will recommend any necessary changes to the trial sample size to maintain statistical power. Overall, the ToV4 study population was carefully designed to include individuals who may experience the greatest benefits of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation, but will also preserve the generalizability and potential ability to translate the findings into practice in Dar es Salaam and similar HIV treatment programs.</p><p>Overall, the ToV4 will provide causal evidence if vitamin D<sub>3</sub> should be considered as an ART adjunct intervention to reduce pulmonary TB and mortality among HIV-infected adults initiating treatment. The trial will also provide evidence for the effect of vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation on a wide range of secondary outcomes including: CD4 T cell reconstitution, non-pulmonary TB comorbidities and complications associated with HIV and/or ART, bone health, immunologic biomarkers, weight gain, depression and anxiety, physical activity, and incidence of hypercalcemia. The results of the trial are likely generalizable to HIV-infected adults with low vitamin D who are initiating ART in similar resource-limited settings and the trial findings will also inform whether larger vitamin D<sub>3</sub> supplementation trials for the prevention of TB in HIV-uninfected populations should be pursued.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>Trial enrollment started on 24 February 2014 and recruitment is ongoing as of 26 January 2017.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p>
