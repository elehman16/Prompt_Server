Narrowing of the airway caused by tracheolaryngeal edema is one of the most frequent complications after endotracheal extubation particularly amongst patients intubated for more than 36 h.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Laryngeal edema occurrence might cause post-extubation complications and increase mortality rate and the cost of therapy. Tracheolaryngeal edema causes hoarseness after extubation and in more severe cases can cause laryngospasm and the need for reintubation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] An estimated 1-17% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with airway obstruction have been reportedly needed reintubation after extubation.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Reintubation makes more complications in turn and increases the mortality rate. These complications usually occur in the first 24 h after extubation and are more common in patients intubated for more than 24-36 h.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Mortality rate of reintubation has been estimated to be more than 30-40% in patients.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The Incidence of hoarseness might vary between 6% and 37%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Various studies have indicated the administration of corticosteroids like intravenous (IV) dexamethasone can reduce or prevent the occurrence of airway obstruction.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In contrast, some other investigations have declined the effectiveness of corticosteroids in prevention of reintubation in adults and have not recommended the administration of corticosteroids.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Prolonging the hospital stay in ICU patients, reintubation increases the need to tracheostomy and the cost of treatment.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Factors that tend to pose a great risk of injury to the airway include reintubation, intubation for more than 24 h, tracheal tube size greater than glottis, old age and low Glasgow Coma Scale. Some investigations have recommended the administration of corticosteroids, nebulizing epinephrine, oxygen and helium to reduce post-extubation edema.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Similarly, the effectiveness of corticosteroids in lowering the risk of post-extubation stridor has been reported in other studies.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Since more cutting-edge corticosteroids like budesonide with lower systematic absorption and no systematic complication can be used as nebulizing particle,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] in this study we investigated the efficacy of nebulized budesonide in comparison with IV dexamethasone administration in reducing the post-extubation injuries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized double-blind clinical trial that included patients admitted to the ICU of a tertiary care center in 2012. All patients were between 18 and 65 years of age. They had not received corticosteroids and were not on chronic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs medications. They all had been intubated at least for 48 h and none had any prior airway diseases like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They also were ready for ventilator weaning. Sampling method in the study was simple randomization. After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and taking written informed consent from patients or their relatives prior to the entrance in this trial, patients who had the inclusion criteria were selected and randomly assigned into either budesonide or dexamethasone group upon their admission to the ICU. To have a power of 95% to detect 0.2 difference between the two groups in power of hydrogen PH from baseline, when the standard deviation (SD) of change and Type I error were 0.15 and 0.05, respectively, the sample size was calculated to be 40 patients in each group. Considering a probable lost-to-follow-up rate of less than 10%, we recruited 45 samples in each group. In the first group, patients underwent the therapy with nebulized budesonide at a dosage of 1 mg[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] diluted in 4 cc of sterile water for 20 min, using nebulizer system of ventilator 1 h preceding extubation. During nebulization, the tracheal tube's cuff became deflated. After extubation patients received nebulized budesonide via oxygen nebulizer mask at the same dosage for 48 h with 12 h intervals. Meanwhile, dexamethasone was administered to patients in the second group. Dexamethasone was administered intra venous at a dosage of 0.15 mg/kg[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]1 h before extubation. After extubation, the administration of IV dexamethasone continued at the same dosage every 12 h for 48 h. The cuff leak ratio (CLR)[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] was calculated for patients as follows: The ventilator's mode: volume-assisted control, tidal volume (TV) = 8 cc/kg, peep = 0. The tracheal tube's cuff was then deflated. Having calculated the TV in 6 cycles of breath, the average of the 3 breaths with the least TV was calculated using the following formula:</p><p><inline-graphic xlink:href="ABR-4-11-g001.jpg"/></p><p>Sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score) was also calculated and recorded for all patients.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Arterial blood gas test (ABG test) was performed every 12 h for 24 h and vital signs including blood oxygen saturation<sub>,</sub> respiratory rate, heart rate and post-extubation complication (stridor, respiratory distress) were reported for all patients.</p><p>Drug administration for each patient was carried out by a trained nurse and a physician who was not aware of the prescribed medications recorded data.</p><p>Patient who developed complication were treated with oxygen and nebulized epinephrine and in case they did not respond to the therapy they were then reintubated. Eventually, a statistical consultant analyzed the collected data, using the statistical package for the social sciences software version 20 (IBM Corporation). Univariate analyses between the dexamethasone and budesonide groups were conducted using Student <italic>t</italic>-tests for continuous variables and Pearson Chi-square test for categorical variables as indicated.

Peak plasma time is 1-2 h and protein bounding is 85-90%. Metabolized by CYP3A4 in the liver to 6-beta-hydroxybudesonide, 16-alpha-hydroxyprednisolone (inactive). Elimination half-life is 2-3.6 h and excretion is 60% in urine; 15.1-29.6% feces. Most common adverse effects are: headache, nausea and respiratory infection.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Dexamethasone is the anti-inflammatory corticosteroid. Dexamethasone decreases inflammation by suppressing migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and reducing capillary permeability. The half-life is 2-3.5 h and metabolized in the liver and excretion mainly in urine, minimally in bile. Most common adverse effects are: adrenal suppression, myopathy, delayed wound healing and raising blood sugar.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Since the demographic variables, SOFA score and CLR were not significantly different in the two groups, the presumable different results could be attributed to the type of drug administered preceding extubation.</p><p>Based on the findings of this study, it can be observed that there was no meaningful difference between budesonide received and Dexamethasone treated groups with regard to the post-extubation complications as 4.4% in the dexamethasone group and 6.7% in budesonide group needed reintubation. Similarly, the ABG parameters were not significantly different in the two groups up to 48 h after extubation. According to the previous studies the prevalence of reintubation rate is 1-17%.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The incidence of stridor was 11.1% in the dexamethasone group and 13.3% in budesonide group. Respiratory distress was found in 11.1% in both groups. According to a study by Lee, <italic>et al</italic>., the prevalence of stridor after extubation has been variable between 6% and 37%[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] that is comparable with stridor prevalence in the present study. In Young study also prevalence of post-extubation upper airway obstruction in patients intubated longer than 36 h was estimated about 2.3-22% with the reintubation rate of 1-19%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Mortality rate in the dexamethasone group was 4.4% compared with 6.7% of the budesonide group, none was due to the airway obstruction and no significant difference was found between the two groups. Young's study recommended corticosteroids to prevent the upper airway edema and reduce the reintubation rate.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Sinha, <italic>et al</italic>. investigated the effectiveness of a mixture of 1000 &#x00385;g budesonide and epinephrine 1% on pediatric patients where extubation failure rate declined from 40% to 10%.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Wittekamp, <italic>et al</italic>. study on post-extubation edema found that a mixture of IV corticosteroid, nebulizing epinephrine, helium and oxygen was effective; nevertheless, that study was not proved by a randomized control.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Using IV dexamethasone, Malhotra, <italic>et al</italic>. reduced the prevalence of extubation failure.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In another study by Epstein, <italic>et al</italic>. IV corticosteroid administration in patients intubated longer than 36-48 h reduced post-extubation obstruction and reintubation rate.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] A study by Wang <italic>et al</italic>. Showed the administration of corticosteroid to be effective in reduction of post-extubation stridor in 80% of cases.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Factors such as sample size, limitations of research (not managing to get the patients&#x02019; accompanying persons&#x02019; consent to participate in the study and a wide range of the patients&#x02019; age) and genetic condition of patients and employed techniques can con for the difference between our study and others.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Since no significant difference was observed between the nebulized budesonide and IV dexamethasone, we recommend nebulized budesonide for prevention of post-extubation complications in ICU patients regarding the lower systemic absorption of budesonide.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors wish to sincerely thank the support of all the colleagues in ICU staff of Alzahra University Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in Isfahan, Iran.
