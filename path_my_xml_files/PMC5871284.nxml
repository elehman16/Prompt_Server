The purpose of this study was to examine the role of response expectancies as a potential mediator. Hypnotizability was also tested as an effect moderator. Data were collected from a sample of 172 postmenopausal women, who had been randomized to receive either a 5-week hypnosis intervention or structured attention counseling. Measures of response expectancies were analyzed to determine if the relationship between group assignment and hot flashes frequency was mediated by expectancies for treatment efficacy. A series of simple mediation and conditional process analyses did not support mediation of the relationship between treatment condition and hot flash frequency through response expectancy. The effect of hypnotherapy in reducing hot flashes does not appear to be due to placebo effects as determined by response expectancies. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hot flashes</kwd><kwd>response expectancies</kwd><kwd>hypnosis</kwd><kwd>mediation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-2156587217708523"><funding-source id="funding1-2156587217708523"><institution-wrap><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-2156587217708523">U01 AT004634-05</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Approximately 80% of women report experiencing hot flashes during midlife.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Hot flashes cause significant distress and contribute to a myriad of related symptoms, including sleep disturbance,<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> fatigue,<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> decreased sex drive,<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> and impaired cognition.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Furthermore, the effective treatment of hot flashes can be challenging, as traditional treatment with hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated for many women, due to an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>Clinically significant reduction in hot flashes has been defined as 50% or greater improvement.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Several studies have shown a hypnotherapy intervention to have a clinically significant effect for the reduction of hot flashes. For example, in an early pilot study,<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> 16 female breast cancer survivors received 4 weekly 45-minute hypnosis sessions delivered by a trained hypnotherapist. During therapy, suggestions were given for coolness, comfort, and refreshment. Participants also received instruction in self-hypnosis and were encouraged to practice daily. Results indicated that hot flash frequency decreased by 59% over the course of the study.</p><p>In an additional pilot study,<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> 13 postmenopausal women who were experiencing a minimum of 50 hot flashes per week received 5 weekly sessions of self-hypnosis. During each session, participants listened to an audio recording of a hypnotic induction followed by 30 minutes of suggestions for relaxation, coolness, and guided imagery. During week 3 of treatment, participants also received instruction on how to practice self-hypnosis without the use of an audio recording and were asked to practice this technique daily. Results indicated that participants reported 72% fewer hot flashes on average after receiving treatment than they did during baseline assessment. Hot flash severity was also reduced significantly.</p><p>Results from large randomized trials have also provided evidence supporting the use of hypnotherapy for reducing hot flashes. During one such study,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> 60 female breast cancer survivors who were experiencing a minimum of 14 hot flashes per week were randomly assigned to a 5-week hypnosis intervention or a no treatment control group. Each hypnotic session lasted approximately 50 minutes and consisted of a hypnotic induction followed by suggestions for dissociation from hot flashes, coolness, relaxation, and positive future outcomes. Participants also received instruction in self-hypnosis and were encouraged to practice daily. Results indicated that participants receiving hypnosis reported an average of 4 fewer hot flashes per day at the end of treatment than they had reported at baseline assessment.</p><p>Finally, during a recently conducted large clinical trial,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> 187 postmenopausal women reporting a minimum of seven hot flashes per day were randomly assigned to a 5-week hypnosis intervention or a 5-week structured attention control group. Each hypnosis session lasted approximately 45 minutes and involved a hypnotic induction followed by suggestion for safe place imagery, relaxation, and coolness. Suggestions were individualized based on the preferences of the participant. Hypnosis participants also received instruction in self-hypnosis, and were encouraged to practice daily with or without the aid of an audio recording. Participants assigned to the control condition also met with a therapist for approximately 45 minutes each week. Control participants were able to discuss symptom severity and receive encouragement from the therapist. Control participants also received an audio recording that contained general information on hot flashes, and they were encouraged to listen to the recording at least once each day.</p><p>Results indicated that participants assigned to the hypnosis intervention reported a 64% reduction in hot flashes after 5 weeks of treatment and that hot flash frequency continued to decline by as much as 74% at a 12-week follow-up appointment.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Meanwhile, participants who had received structured attention reported only a 9% reduction in hot flash frequency after 5 weeks of treatment and that reduction only reached 17% at 12-week follow-up. These between-group differences were highly significant.</p><p>Considering the large effect that hypnotherapy has on hot flash reduction, as well as the myriad of detriments that frequent hot flashes can have on the quality of life of women, it seems well worth conducting further investigation into why hypnotherapy has proven to be such an effective treatment. However, despite the numerous studies providing empirical support for the utility of hypnosis, not just for hot flashes, but for a variety of additional symptoms and disorders as well, very little is known about the possible mechanisms of action behind hypnotherapy&#x02019;s beneficial effects.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><sec id="section1-2156587217708523"><title>Expectancy Theory</title><p>Expectancy theory provides one potential explanation as to why hypnotherapy may be effective.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> According to expectancy theory, the benefits of hypnotherapy are attributable to placebo effects that are brought about through positive response expectancies following a hypnotic induction.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> It has been hypothesized that hypnotic suggestions lead to improvement by altering the patient&#x02019;s expectations for the occurrence of nonvolitional outcomes or behaviors.</p><p>Some support for expectancy theory has come from a variety of sources. Kirsch<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> has noted that the phenomena experienced by hypnotic participants are dependent on the suggestions given, and not the particular induction technique employed by the hypnotherapist. Therefore, the rational offered is that participants are responding to a specific suggestion for symptom improvement (eg, reduced pain), and not to any unique hypnotic mechanism. Gandhi and Oakley<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> have also found evidence suggesting that the word hypnosis alone may be enough to create a beneficial expectancy effect, as participants in one study scored significantly higher on a standardized measure of hypnotizability when the induction technique was referred to as &#x0201c;hypnosis&#x0201d; rather than &#x0201c;relaxation.&#x0201d; However, only a small number of randomized control trials have investigated whether the beneficial effects of hypnosis can be explained by changes in outcome expectancies. Additionally, these studies have only examined the role of expectancies when hypnosis was being utilized as a treatment for pain. The role of expectancies during hypnosis interventions aimed at reducing hot flashes remains completely unknown.</p><p>An early study examined the contributions of placebo effects and hypnotizability on response to hypnosis for pain reduction.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Improvement in pain tolerance in insusceptible (low hyponotizable) participants following a hypnotic induction was attributed to placebo effects. This assertion is supported by the fact that participants scoring low in hypnotizability reported similar levels of pain tolerance during a hypnosis condition and a placebo pill condition. However, the response to hypnosis among high hypnotizable participants was not attributed to placebo (response expectancy) effects.</p><p>Several recent studies have provided some support for response expectancies as a mediator of hypnotherapy effects on pain and distress<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="bibr20-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr21-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> For example, in one study,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> 20 women who were to undergo an excisional breast biopsy received either a hypnosis intervention or standard care. Results indicated that although between<bold>-</bold>group differences in expectancies for pain and distress were not seen prior to the intervention, women who received hypnosis anticipated significantly less postsurgical pain than did women assigned to the control group after receiving care.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Regression analysis indicated that the total proportion of variance in postsurgical pain originally accounted for by group assignment decreased significantly when postintervention expectancies for pain were included as a predictor variable.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Additionally, it was found that postintervention expectancies for distress completely mediated the relationship between group assignment and postsurgical distress.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p><p>These findings were replicated in a larger study consisting of a sample of 200 women scheduled to undergo a breast-conserving surgery (either lumpectomy or excisional breast biopsy).<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In addition to assessing pain expectancies as a potential mediator of the relationship between group assignment and postsurgical pain, postintervention expectancies for postsurgical fatigue and nausea were also assessed, in order to determine whether hypnosis appeared to have the same mechanism of action across symptoms. Results indicated that the relationship between group assignment and postsurgical pain was partially mediated by pain expectancies.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Also, the relationship between group assignment and postsurgical fatigue was partially mediated by postintervention expectancies for fatigue.</p><p>These studies suggest there is reason to believe that response expectancies may mediate hypnotherapy&#x02019;s effect on hot flash reduction. However, no previous studies have examined the role of response expectancies as a mediator of hypnotherapy&#x02019;s effect on hot flashes. It is possible that the mechanism of action behind the beneficial effects of hypnosis interventions may vary by symptom or condition. Also, the role of hypnotizability in reduction of hot flashes is not fully known.</p></sec><sec id="section2-2156587217708523"><title>Hypnotizability</title><p>In contrast to expectancy theory, several studies have suggested that response to hypnotic treatment differs based on hypnotizability. For example, in a study involving 20 individuals ranking either high or low in hypnotizability,<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> results indicated that highly hypnotizable participants reported a significantly larger reduction in pain during a cold pressor trial than did participants scoring low in hypnotizability. Furthermore, results from an additional study involving hypnosis for the treatment of hot flashes indicated that participants scoring higher in hypnotizability benefitted more so from the intervention than did others.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Therefore, the potential moderating role of hypnotizability also merits further study.</p></sec><sec id="section3-2156587217708523"><title>The Present Study</title><p>The current study aimed to uncover the role that response expectancy plays during a hypnosis intervention for hot flashes.

No significant changes were expected for participants assigned to the structured attention control group. We also anticipated that response expectancy would be a significant mediator of the relationship between group assignment and the number of subjectively reported hot flashes after one treatment session, after 5 weeks of treatment, and then again at a 12-week follow-up appointment. Finally, when examining the role of hypnotizability as a moderator, we hypothesized that response expectancy would mediate the relationship between group assignment and the number of subjectively reported hot flashes for participants scoring low or very low in hypnotizability.

Although results are consistent with one of the fundamental tenets of expectancy theory, that hypnosis significantly increases participants&#x02019; expectations for a favorable treatment outcome,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> results indicated that, on average, expectancies were only raised by 0.87 points on a 10-point scale, an increase of only 11%. According to our measure of effect size, this represents a small to moderate increase in outcome expectancy, and it is questionable as to whether this increase is of practical significance.</p><p>Furthermore, the results of our inferential tests for the significance of the indirect effect of group assignment on hot flash frequency through response expectancy indicated that the possibility that response expectancies have no effect on treatment outcome cannot be ruled out. In fact, a trend in the results indicated that participants with greater initial expectations for improvement may actually experience more hot flashes than those with lower initial expectations as treatment progresses. However, this increase did not reach statistical significance. Therefore, our results suggest that an increase in positive response expectancies was not the mechanism of action through which the hypnosis intervention was able to reduce hot flash frequency.</p><p>This is important for several reasons. First, although previous studies have produced results suggesting that expectancies may only partially mediate the effects of hypnosis interventions aimed at reducing pain, these results have been inconsistent and have also hinted that the underlying mechanisms of hypnosis may differ depending on the symptoms being treated.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2156587217708523" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Second, this study is the first to examine whether initial expectancies continue to affect patient response to hypnosis treatment, not just after 1 session, but over a 5-week hypnosis intervention and at a 12-week follow-up appointment. Furthermore, unlike previous studies, during which pain has been deliberately induced or has resulted from a medical procedure, women suffering from hot flashes can neither predict when symptoms will occur, nor do they have much control over when they will experience symptom relief. Therefore, expectations for relief may play a different role for patients suffering from hot flashes than they do for a more manageable symptom, such as temporary or acute pain.</p><p>In addition, data suggested that response expectancy did not mediated the relationship between group assignment and hot flash frequency, regardless of participant hypnotizability. We predicted that the indirect effect would be significant for participants scoring low and very low in hypnotizability, as it would be the primary means through which these participants experienced symptom improvement. Meanwhile, the indirect effect was not predicted to reach significance for individuals scoring high in hypnotizability, because they would also benefit from changes in cognition and an ability to disassociate themselves from sensations of pain. We predicted that the relative impact of expectancies would be small by comparison. The fact that our findings did not support this position suggest that a sizable placebo effect may not exist during all hypnosis interventions and that the relative role played by expectancies during hypnotherapy may vary based on the symptoms being treated. Therefore, hypnotherapy&#x02019;s effect on reduction of hot flashes does not appear to be due to expectancy/placebo effects.</p><p>Differing from our analysis involving the indirect effect, hypnotizability was shown to be a significant moderator of the direct effect of group assignment on hot flash frequency. In fact, at all three assessment periods, individuals ranking higher in hypnotizability reported fewer hot flashes than did individuals ranking lower in hypnotizability. These results are most congruent with a state dependent theory of hypnosis, whereby undergoing a hypnotic induction increases participants&#x02019; responsiveness to suggestion. In this case, participants would have been more responsive to suggestions for hot flash reduction.</p><sec id="section14-2156587217708523"><title>Limitations and Considerations</title><p>All analyses were conducted with a sample comprised of postmenopausal women living in central Texas. Therefore, generalization of our findings to other groups of individuals should be tempered until further research has been conducted. Furthermore, our results depend on single measures for assessing response expectancy, hot flash frequency, and hypnotizability. Although efforts were made to incorporate measures that had either been used in previous research involving mediation and moderation analyses of a hypnosis intervention, as well as measures known to be highly reliable and valid, it is possible that our results may have differed had we incorporated additional assessments into our study design. Investigation into alternative means of measuring response expectancy, other than relying on self-reported visual analog scale ratings, may prove useful.</p><p>An additional consideration that should be addressed is the fact that participants assigned to the hypnosis intervention reported higher response expectancies than did participants assigned to the structured attention control condition even before their initial treatment session. Although efforts were made to blind patients to treatment condition, all patients would have been made aware of the possibility that they could be randomized to a control condition before they were asked to give their informed consent. Therefore, it is possible that this knowledge, along with subtle and involuntary hints from the experimental staff, raised the expectancies of hypnosis participants even before the start of the intervention. If so, the full extent to which expectancies were enhanced prior to randomization in our study was not accounted for. However, the fact that parameter estimates for expectancies were so small suggests that results would not have been markedly different had changes in expectancy been slightly larger.</p></sec><sec id="section15-2156587217708523"><title>Future Directions</title><p>Although our study suggests that changes in response expectancy may not account for symptom improvement during a hypnosis intervention for hot flashes, very little is known about the relative impact of response expectancies across various symptoms and treatments. It is possible that response expectancies may play a larger role during brief interventions aimed at managing symptoms over a relatively short duration. A logical next step would be to examine whether response expectancies influence outcomes differently depending on symptoms being treated. Findings may produce results leading to new hypotheses about how different variables, such as the length of treatment, the severity of symptoms, and the total duration over which the patient has been suffering from symptoms before seeking treatment influences the prospective role of response expectancies during hypnosis interventions.</p><p>The fact that response expectancies did not account for the relationship between group assignment and treatment outcome during the current study suggests that efforts to maximize placebo effects may not be beneficial to all patients. Furthermore, this finding highlights the importance of adequately training therapists to deliver hypnosis interventions, without relying solely on expectancies to produce favorable outcomes.</p><p>Another area of investigation worth exploring is whether response expectancies mediate outcomes during mind-body interventions other than hypnosis. Findings could lead to new theories regarding the relative efficacy of using various mind-body therapies for the treatment of certain disorders. Findings would also help indicate whether the mechanisms of action differ from one treatment to another.</p><p>Additional research is needed to determine the mechanisms by which hypnotherapy reduces hot flashes. Potential areas for future research are whether physiological changes brought about by hypnosis practice mediate change in frequency or severity of hot flashes. For example, reduction in stress as measured by cortisol, or stress reactivity as measured by physiological arousal, are areas for future study. Also, the role of hypnotizability warrants further study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section16-2156587217708523"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although expectancy theory has gained a considerable backing within the hypnosis community, the results of our study indicate that changes in response expectancy did not mediate the relationship between treatment condition and hot flash frequency during a randomized controlled trial. Instead, results were more congruent with a state dependent theory of hypnosis. Additional research is needed to determine whether results will generalize to other populations as well as to studies involving outcomes other than hot flash frequency.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1-2156587217708523"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> This study was conducted at the Baylor University Mind-Body Medicine Research Laboratory.
