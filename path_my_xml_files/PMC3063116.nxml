This changed in June 2010 when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cabazitaxel as a new option for patients with CRPC whose disease progresses during or after docetaxel treatment. For most of these patients, cabazitaxel will now replace mitoxantrone (a drug that was FDA-approved because of its palliative effects) as the treatment of choice for docetaxel-refractory disease. The approval of cabazitaxel was based primarily on the TROPIC trial, a large (n = 755) randomized Phase III study showing an overall median survival benefit of 2.4 months for men with docetaxel-pretreated metastatic CRPC receiving cabazitaxel (with prednisone) compared to mitoxantrone (with prednisone). Cabazitaxel is a novel tubulin-binding taxane that differs from docetaxel because of its poor affinity for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump. Cancer cells that express P-gp become resistant to taxanes, and the effectiveness of docetaxel can be limited by its high substrate affinity for P-gp. Preclinical and early clinical studies show that cabazitaxel retains activity in docetaxel-resistant tumors, and this was confirmed by the TROPIC study. Common adverse events with cabazitaxel include neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia) and diarrhea, while neuropathy was rarely observed. Thus, the combination of cabazitaxel and prednisone is an important new treatment option for men with docetaxel-refractory metastatic CRPC, but this agent should be administered cautiously and with appropriate monitoring (especially in men at high risk of neutropenic complications).</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>cabazitaxel</kwd><kwd>castration-resistant prostate cancer</kwd><kwd>clinical trial</kwd><kwd>docetaxel resistance</kwd><kwd>drug development</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>More than 217,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer and 32,000 will die of metastatic prostate cancer in the United States (US) in 2010,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dddt-5-117">1</xref> making it the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, behind lung cancer. Most patients whose disease is diagnosed at the locoregional level have an excellent prognosis, enhanced by radical prostatectomy and/or radiation therapy. About one-fifth of patients undergo watchful waiting alone. A significant fraction (20%&#x02013;40%) of patients who undergo primary therapy experience biochemical relapse (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] &#x0003e;0.2 ng/mL), and 30%&#x02013;70% of those with biochemical recurrence develop metastatic disease within 10 years after local therapy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-5-117">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dddt-5-117">5</xref> For most patients with metastatic prostate cancer, androgen-deprivation therapy, usually with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, improves symptoms but tumors invariably become castration-resistant and patients develop progressive disease. Until the mid 1990s, with no known life-prolonging options, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients with progressive disease were generally treated with palliative approaches. Chemotherapy was not well tolerated by CRPC patients, who were often elderly men with limited bone marrow reserve and concurrent medical conditions.</p><p>In 1996, Tannock et al showed that mitoxantrone (with prednisone) improved quality of life and bone pain, and reduced serum PSA levels in men with CRPC,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-5-117">6</xref> and this approach became the initial standard of care for such patients. Then in 2004, the TAX327 trial compared weekly and 3-weekly docetaxel (and prednisone) against mitoxantrone (and prednisone) and showed a significant survival benefit for the 3-weekly docetaxel arm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dddt-5-117">7</xref> That same year, the Southwest Oncology Group reported significantly extended progression-free and overall survival for CRPC patients treated with docetaxel and estramustine compared to mitoxantrone and prednisone.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-5-117">8</xref> On the basis of these results, docetaxel replaced mitoxantrone as the first-line standard of care for CRPC patients. Until last year, however, physicians had no life-prolonging second-line options after docetaxel failure. Notably, on June 17, 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved cabazitaxel &#x0201c;for the treatment of patients with hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer previously treated with a docetaxel-containing regimen&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-5-117">9</xref> This review summarizes the preclinical and clinical data that led to the FDA-approval of this agent, and touches upon the mechanism of action and rationale for the use of this drug in docetaxel-refractory disease. Our overall intention with this review is to raise awareness of a newly available second-line treatment for metastatic CRPC that provides an overall survival benefit.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of action and biological rationale for cabazitaxel</title><p>Docetaxel is a widely-used second-generation taxane compound. The first taxane was paclitaxel, a drug isolated from yew tree bark in the 1960s and first approved by the FDA in 1992 for treatment of refractory ovarian cancer.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-5-117">10</xref> Docetaxel is a semisynthetic and more active derivative of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel and docetaxel are both antimitotic cancer drugs that bind to intracellular microtubules, suppressing microtubule dynamics. The taxanes promote or inhibit assembly of tubulin into microtubules, impairing the natural dynamics of microtubules and leading to mitotic block and apoptosis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-5-117">10</xref></p><p>In preclinical studies using advanced human tumors in mouse xenograft models, cabazitaxel was shown to be active in both docetaxel-sensitive tumors and those that did not respond to chemotherapy including docetaxel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-5-117">11</xref> The effectiveness of paclitaxel and docetaxel is limited by the high substrate affinity of both agents for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent drug efflux pump that decreases the intracellular concentrations of these drugs.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-5-117">12</xref> It has been shown that cancer cells that express P-gp become resistant to taxanes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-5-117">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-5-117">13</xref> This resistance is conferred by overexpression of the multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene that encodes P-gp, a member of the ATP-binding cassette transporter family of proteins.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-5-117">14</xref></p><p>Cabazitaxel (previously also known as XRP6258, TXD258, and RPR116258A) (Jevtana&#x02122;; Sanofi-Aventis, Paris, France) is a semisynthetic taxane that uses a precursor molecule extracted from yew tree needles. It was selected for clinical development due to its poor affinity for P-gp and because it was superior to paclitaxel and docetaxel in penetration of the blood-brain barrier in preclinical models.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-5-117">15</xref> Cabazitaxel&#x02019;s poor affinity for P-gp may or may not be the principal mechanism of action that enables its efficacy in the clinic. Multiple previous clinical trials have shown MDR1 inhibitors to lack clinical efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-5-117">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Chemistry and pharmacology</title><sec><title>Chemical structure of cabazitaxel</title><p>Cabazitaxel was engineered as a dimethyloxy derivative of docetaxel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-5-117">Figure 1</xref>) that offers two advantages over its predecessor. The primary benefit provided by the extra methyl groups is elimination of the P-gp affinity characteristic of docetaxel, enabling cabazitaxel to be effective against docetaxel-refractory prostate cancer. The extra methyl groups also provide cabazitaxel with an uncommon capacity among chemotherapy agents; the ability to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, the clinical effects of which remain to be investigated.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dddt-5-117">17</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics of cabazitaxel</title><p>Pharmacokinetic evaluations were performed using blood sampling from 170 patients.

The pharmacokinetic behavior in plasma was best characterized by a triphasic model with a rapid initial-phase half-life averaging 4 minutes, followed by an intermediate-phase half-life of 2 hours, and a prolonged terminal-phase half-life averaging 95 hours. Protein binding of cabazitaxel was primarily to human serum albumin (82%) and lipoproteins;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-5-117">15</xref> cabazitaxel is equally distributed between plasma and blood. Cabazitaxel is metabolized in the liver primarily by the CYP3A4/5 isoenzymes and to a lesser degree by CYP2C8. Although formal drug&#x02013;drug interaction studies have not been completed, agents that induce or inhibit the activity of the CYP450 isoenzymes should be avoided because of potential interaction with cabazitaxel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-dddt-5-117">18</xref> The maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of cabazitaxel in patients with solid tumors was 535 &#x003bc;g/L and was reached at the conclusion of a one-hour infusion of 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> every 3 weeks.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-5-117">15</xref> Average area-under-the-curve (AUC) was 1,038 &#x000b1; 299 &#x003bc;g-h/L, and the relationship between cabazitaxel dose and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;48h</sub> was proportional, as was the relationship between dose and C<sub>max</sub>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-5-117">15</xref></p></sec></sec><sec><title>Clinical development</title><sec><title>Phase I</title><p>In a Phase I study of cabazitaxel in 25 patients with advanced solid tumors, Mita et al administered intravenous doses of cabazitaxel at 10 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (3 patients, 10 cycles), 15 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (6 patients, 25 cycles), 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (9 patients, 48 cycles), and 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> (7 patients, 19 cycles).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-5-117">15</xref> The principal dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia.

He had previously undergone surgical castration, as well as treatment with bicalutamide, diethyl-stilbesterol, and mitoxantrone/prednisone. A 50-year-old man with castration-resistant and docetaxel-refractory metastatic prostate cancer showed a confirmed partial response in measurable disease lesions and a PSA reduction from 415 to 44 ng/mL at the 25 mg/m<sup>2</sup> dose level, but experienced progressive disease after eight courses of chemotherapy.

Eligible patients were at least 18 years of age with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0&#x02013;2. Patients were required to have either rising PSA or measurable disease as documented by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-dddt-5-117">21</xref> and had to be receiving LHRH agonist therapy or to have undergone surgical orchiectomy. Patients were allowed to continue bisphosphonates if the dose had remained stable for over 3 months. Median age of participants was 68 years (cabazitaxel) and 67 years (mitoxantrone), and 18.5% of patients were &#x02265;75 years of age. Sixteen percent were non-Caucasian in both arms. Patients were stratified based on the presence/absence of measurable disease and on ECOG performance status, and then randomized equally into two groups: 378 patients received cabazitaxel (25 mg/m<sup>2</sup>), and 377 received mitoxantrone (12 mg/m<sup>2</sup>). The chemotherapy agents were administered intravenously every 3 weeks for a maximum of 10 cycles. All patients concurrently received 5 mg of oral prednisone twice daily.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-dddt-5-117">20</xref></p><p>The trial&#x02019;s primary endpoint was overall survival, and the main secondary endpoint was composite progression-free survival (defined as the time from randomization to the first date of PSA progression, radiographic tumor progression, pain progression, or death). Other secondary endpoints included PSA response rate (&#x02265;50% reduction); PSA progression (increase by &#x02265;25% over nadir); objective tumor response (for patients with measurable disease, based on RECIST); pain response (reduction of &#x02265;two points from baseline pain level using the Present Pain Intensity scale); and time to radiographic progression. Impressively, median overall survival for the cabazitaxel arm was 15.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.1&#x02013;16.3 months) compared to 12.7 months (95% CI: 11.6&#x02013;13.7 months) in the mitoxantrone arm (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).

Overall pain reduction was similar between the two groups, with no significant differences found. However, since mitoxantrone is often used because of its favorable effects on pain reduction, these results suggest that cabazitaxel will offer patients similar palliative quality of life results.</p><p>The median number of treatment cycles delivered was six (95% CI: 3&#x02013;10) for the cabazitaxel group and four (95% CI: 2&#x02013;7) for the mitoxantrone group. Disease progression was the primary reason for treatment discontinuation in both groups. Treatment delays were reported in 28% of the cabazitaxel-treated patients and 15% of the mitoxantrone-treated patients, and dose reductions were reported in 12% and 4% of patients, respectively. The most common toxicity in both treatment arms was neutropenia (82% of men in the cabazitaxel group and 58% in the mitoxantrone group experienced &#x02265;grade 3 toxicity). Febrile neutropenia was observed in 8% and 1% of men, respectively. Given the high rates of neutropenia, prophylactic granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was allowed after the first chemotherapy cycle, according to physician discretion. Other adverse events are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-5-117">Table 2</xref>. The high rates of neutropenia and other adverse events may reflect a patient population with poor-prognosis disease (50% of men having measurable disease, 25% having visceral metastases, and all having undergone previous chemotherapy treatment). Peripheral neuropathy (all grades) was reported in 14% of patients in the cabazitaxel group and 3% of the patients in the mitoxantrone group.

Of note, although the majority of patients in that study were chemotherapy-na&#x000ef;ve, a number of men (about 15%) had received prior treatment with docetaxel.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dddt-5-117">27</xref> In addition, in October 2010, overall survival results were presented from a Phase III placebo-controlled clinical trial of abiraterone acetate, a CYP17 inhibitor that impairs extra-gonadal androgen synthesis, demonstrating an overall survival advantage in men with metastatic docetaxel-pretreated CRPC randomized to abiraterone or placebo (median survival 14.8 versus 10.9 months).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dddt-5-117">33</xref> These are examples of an encouragingly large variety of new agents that have made their way into Phase III clinical trials in metastatic CRPC, and have added to the therapeutic arsenal in this disease. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-dddt-5-117">Table 4</xref> summarizes efficacy and toxicity data for some of the new agents described above, and also highlights several other promising drugs which are also currently in Phase III development.</p><p>At present, cabazitaxel is confined to post-docetaxel second-line therapy, but an upcoming head-to-head comparison against docetaxel could change that situation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dddt-5-117">23</xref> In addition, two trials of cabazitaxel in combination with other agents have been launched. These trials combine cabazitaxel with cisplatin (NCT00925743) and cabazitaxel with gemcitabine (NCT01001221), both in the Phase I/II setting in advanced solid tumors. Even more promising in the post-docetaxel space may be trials that will combine cabazitaxel with the next generation of androgen-inhibiting agents such as abiraterone and MDV3100. If cabazitaxel also acts through androgen receptor signaling (as does docetaxel), there could be synergistic effects from such combinations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dddt-5-117">23</xref> Finally, other investigators are planning a Phase I trial combining cabazitaxel with mitoxantrone and prednisone in patients with metastatic CRPC who have not previously been treated with chemotherapy for metastatic disease. This strategy relies on the fact that these two chemotherapeutic agents have nonoverlapping patterns of toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Financial considerations for cabazitaxel</title><p>The market for docetaxel was $2.6 billion in 2009, accounting for more than half of the $4.6 billion market for plant-derived anticancer agents. Between 2004 and 2009, the market for all plant-derived anticancer drugs grew at 3% per year.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dddt-5-117">28</xref> Because many CRPC patients become refractory to docetaxel chemotherapy or develop grade 3/4 toxicities within 4&#x02013;6 months of docetaxel treatment, the eventual market for cabazitaxel may be expected to be comparable to that of docetaxel. Furthermore, the price per cycle for cabazitaxel is US$5, 598,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dddt-5-117">29</xref> which is more than twice the cost per cycle of docetaxel (US$2, 483),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-dddt-5-117">30</xref> underpinning financial analysts&#x02019; estimates that cabazitaxel sales may grow to US$300 million by 2013 and US$500 million by 2016.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-dddt-5-117">31</xref> Because these estimates only reflect the second-line use of cabazitaxel, the market for this agent could rise even further if it is also approved for first-line use in men with CRPC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Treatment with cabazitaxel and prednisone was approved by the FDA in June 2010 as the first therapy that offers a survival benefit in men with metastatic CRPC whose disease progresses during or after docetaxel treatment. The TROPIC trial showed a significant overall survival advantage of 2.4 months using second-line cabazitaxel over mitoxantrone in such patients. Because of the large incidence of febrile neutropenia (and neutropenic deaths), this agent should be administered cautiously and with appropriate monitoring. To this end, careful patient selection, and use of concurrent growth factor support, is paramount for the safe prescribing of this novel taxane agent. Dose-reductions to 20 mg/m<sup>2</sup> may often be necessary, and this lower dose will now be incorporated into future trials. The modest survival benefit observed with cabazitaxel may be even greater if combined judiciously with other targeted therapies, ultimately resulting in a cumulative improvement in the lifespan of metastatic CRPC patients. Finally, the comparative effectiveness of cabazitaxel versus docetaxel in the first-line setting remains to be defined.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors
