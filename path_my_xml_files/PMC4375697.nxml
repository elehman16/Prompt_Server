The number of preterm infants in these 14 units is approximately 1083 preterm births out of a total number of approximately 5415 births; it is almost 20% (preliminary survey from the Ministry of Health, Sudan).</p><p>Tactile kinesthetic stimulation (TKS) increases insulin growth factor-1, therefore, increasing weight gain, and 62% of the variance in change of insulin resulted from changes in vagal activity during TKS.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Many randomized controlled trails documented moderate massage therapy increased weight within 5-10 days, sessions varied from 10-15 minutes, 2-3 times a day, and these studies showed 21-48% greater weight gain, and 3-6 days less hospital stays than the control groups.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Preterm infants&#x02019; weight increases by many ways, such as vestibular stimulation and oral stimulation related to breast feeding or by sucking reflexes, such as non-nutritive sucking during gavage feeding, (kangaroo care technique) kangaroo mother care, or skin to skin holding, gentle touch, massage intervention, and TKS.In this study, we evaluate the effect of TKS on preterm infants&#x02019; weight and hospital stays in Khartoum State&#x02019;s hospitals due to the lack of these applications in Sudan.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> If preterms start to gain weight immediately after birth, this will shorten the length of hospital stay, hence lowering the financial burden. This study aims to determine the effect of the 7 days of TKS on preterm infants&#x02019; weight and hospital stays in Khartoum, Sudan.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a quasi-experimental study. It was conducted during a 6 month period; between January and June 2013 in 4 hospitals in Khartoum, Sudan. Two hospitals were chosen for intervention (Omdurman Maternity Hospital [55 preterm infants], and Khartoum Teaching Hospital [25 preterm infants]), and the other 2 hospitals as controls (Alsaudi Maternity Hospital [55 preterm infants], and Gaafer Ibn-Auf Children Hospital [25 preterm infants]).</p><p>The 160 preterm infants were selected depending on the following criteria: birth weight of 1000-1200gm, gestational age of 30-37 weeks, breast milk being fed by tube, and age 4 days since birth. A number of 9 preterm infants were dropped due to attrition of their mothers from the study and only 151 preterm infants completed the study. Preterm infants were randomly assigned into 2 groups (case or control group) following informed consent from their mothers. The randomization of the 4 hospitals was made by using a simple random sampling (lottery method), the 2 hospitals (Omdurman Maternity Hospital and Khartoum Teaching Hospital) were assigned as the case group, and the other 2 hospitals (Alsaudi Maternity Hospital and Gaafer Ibn-Auf Children Hospital) were assigned as the control group. Preterm infants in the control group received routine care, while preterm infants in the case group received TKS in addition to routine care.</p><p>The mothers involved in this study undertook a 3 constitutive day training program. In day one, the researchers read and discussed the module in Arabic with the mothers, and they trained the mothers demonstrating on a doll. On day 2, the trained mothers applied their skills on their own preterm infants, and on day 3 they started the actual measurements of weight for 7 days. During the first 3 days of training, the mothers were closely observed by researchers to ensure accurate intervention.</p><p>Tactile kinesthetic stimulation was performed for 15 minutes, 3 sessions per day for 7 consecutive days. The procedure was started half an hour after feeding, physiological parameter was observed pre and post technique (temperature, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation). The procedure of TKS follows Field&#x02019;s protocol for medically stable preterm infants.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>They were massaged 3 times per day for 7 days. Fifteen minute stimulation sessions consisted of 3 standardized 5 minutes phase. The preterm infants were stroked during the first and third phase and their limbs were moved passively into flexion and extension during the middle 5 minutes phase. For the stroking phases with moderate pressure the preterm infant was placed in a prone position. The trained mother provided the stroking, placing her warm fingers on the preterm infant body. The stroking occurred for 5, one-minute periods (12 strokes at approximately 5 seconds per stroking motion) over each region as the following sequence: From the top of the head to the neck and back again, from the neck, across the shoulders and back again, from the upper back to the waist and back again, from the hip to the feet and back to the hip on both legs, and from the shoulder to the hand and back to the shoulder on both arms. Then the preterm infant was placed in supine position for the subsequent flexion/extension of limbs phase, 5, one-minute segments of 6 passive flexion/extension (kinesthetic) movement (like bicycling) were provided, approximately 10 seconds for each arm, then each leg, and finally both legs. For the final phase, the preterm infant was returned to the prone position and given the stroking process again.</p><p>This study was approved by the Graduate College and Research Ethics Committee, University of Medical Sciences and Technology, Khartoum, Sudan, (IRB 00008867) and a consent form was completed by the mothers of the preterm infants. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 17 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The chi-square test was used to analyze the differences in mothers and preterm infant&#x02019;s characteristics. The independent &#x0201c;t&#x0201d; test was used to analyze the difference in preterm infant&#x02019;s weight and hospital stays, between case and control groups, and a paired sample t-test was used to determine the differences before and after intervention. All values were tabulated as averages (mean) with standard deviation (SD). <italic>P</italic>-values less than 0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, 138 mother (preterm infants number=151, and the number of mothers=138). In the intervention group, 68 mothers for 76 preterm infants, and in the control group, 70 mother for 75 preterm infants participated in this study, due to the attrition of 22 mothers from 160, and only 138 completing the study. The number of preterms is higher than the number of mothers because some mothers had twins (8 in the intervention group and 5 in the control group). Their education levels varied between secondary and university levels. Mothers whose children had undertaken TKS showed remarkable low level of education compared with the mothers from the control group (<italic>p</italic>=0.00). As for the preterm infants participants of this study, there is no a difference in the matched variables of gestational age between intervention and control groups.

Compared with this study, the increase in weight in Mohamadzadeh et al&#x02019;s<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> study is higher (11.6gm versus 4.7gm), this difference is due to a 10 day period rather than a 7 day period, and massage for 3 consecutive hours may be more effective than every 8 hours.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Our results regarding the length of hospital stays of the preterm infants showed significant differences between the case and control groups (<italic>p</italic>=0.00). In preterm infants&#x02019;, hospital stay in the case group discharged 7 days earlier than the control group. The mean length of hospital stay in this study was similar (7 days versus 7 days) to a study performed by Mendes and Procianoy<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> who measured the effect of maternal massage on preterm infants, reducing hospital stays, and the occurrence of sepsis. Their massage was 6 hourly, 15 minutes per session, and the study design was a randomized controlled trial. Their results revealed that preterm infants who received maternal massage left the hospital 7 days earlier than similar newborns who did not receive massage. There is a similarity in the results despite the difference in the massage applied by mothers, and they followed the Field protocol in both studies, but there was similarity in hospital stays between the 2 studies.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The strength of this study is in the initiation of a KTS program among Sudanese preterms despite the limited resources. Our study revealed a significant improvement in preterms weight and shortened hospital stay with modification of the KTS technique. Study limitations were, short time for data collection, and the results for measuring the effects could have been more realistic if measured over a longer time. The study was conducted in one state of Sudan; such studies could yield more useful results if conducted on a larger sample size all over the country, which is our suggested future strategy.</p><p>In conclusion, TKS has a beneficial effect on weight gain and earlier discharge from hospitals, which is sequentially efficient and cost effective. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effect of TKS in infants with birth weight less than 1000gm, and to apply this research in other areas of Sudan in order to gather more informative data.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p><italic>Authors are grateful to all participating hospital staff, and we appreciate the efforts of all our colleagues, and the preterm infants&#x02019; mothers</italic>.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
