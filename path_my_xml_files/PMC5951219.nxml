The replicated crossover design was done because of high coefficient of variation of PK parameter for fimasartan, that is, &#x0003e;30%. With a 14 days washout period, an FDC tablet containing 60 mg fimasartan, 10 mg amlodipine, and 20 mg rosuvastatin was administered only once, and separate formulations of fimasartan/amlodipine 60 mg/10 mg FDC tablet and 20 mg rosuvastatin tablet administered twice. Blood samples were collected up to 72 hours following drug administration. The plasma concentrations of fimasartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Safety was assessed by evaluating vital signs, clinical laboratory parameters, physical examinations, and medical interviews.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The geometric mean ratios and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for the maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) and area under the curve from time zero to the last measurable sampling time (AUC<sub>t</sub>) were 1.0776 (0.9201&#x02013;1.2622) and 0.9978 (0.9538&#x02013;1.0439) for fimasartan, 1.0038 (0.9782&#x02013;1.0301) and 1.0055 (0.9828&#x02013;1.0288) for amlodipine, and 1.0006 (0.9290&#x02013;1.0776) and 0.9986 (0.9532&#x02013;1.0461) for rosuvastatin, respectively. A total of 22 adverse events (AEs) were reported by 60 subjects; there were no significant differences in the incidence of AEs between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The 90% CI of the C<sub>max</sub> of fimasartan was within the widened acceptance limit, ln(0.6984)&#x02013;ln(1.4319). The 90% CIs of the other PK parameters for drugs were between ln(0.8) and ln(1.25). These results suggest that the FDC formulation is pharmacokinetically bioequivalent and has a similar safety profile, to the co-administration of its three constituent drugs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>replicated crossover</kwd><kwd>bioequivalence</kwd><kwd>fixed-dose combination</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>fimasartan</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular diseases, such as coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, are one of the leading causes of death worldwide including in Korea. According to the statistics of deaths by the Korea National Statistical Office in 2013, the number of deaths attributed to the three major causes of death per 100,000 population was 149 for malignant neoplasm (cancer), 50.3 for cerebrovascular disease, and 50.2 for heart disease.<xref rid="b1-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that cardiovascular disease was the leading cause of death in 2011.<xref rid="b2-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Hypertension and dyslipidemia are major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases; indeed, the incidence of coronary artery disease is reduced by 36% when statin therapy is added, rather than simply controlling blood pressure in the presence of both the diseases.<xref rid="b3-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>In patients with hypertension, the first-line treatment is one of the thiazide-type diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or calcium channel blockers (CCB), and if blood pressure is not controlled, two or more drugs may be used concomitantly.<xref rid="b5-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Fimasartan is an ARB that blocks the angiotensin II AT1 receptor in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which maintains homeostasis of blood pressure and body fluids.<xref rid="b6-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> It has a superior blood pressure lowering effect than valsartan and losartan and is not inferior to that of candesartan.<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The incidence rate of adverse events (AEs) related to the nervous system, digestive system, and infection at the recommended doses of fimasartan (60 and 120 mg) was 11%, 4.3%, and 5.5%, respectively. Moreover, the incidence of AEs was not significantly different from that associated with losartan (50 and 100 mg), with good tolerability and safety.<xref rid="b8-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Amlodipine, a dihydropyridine-based CCB with indications for hypertension and angina, relaxes the vascular smooth muscle and reduces peripheral resistance.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Due to the excellent efficacy and safety of amlodipine, several derivative compounds have been developed. Rosuvastatin inhibits the synthesis of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the liver as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.<xref rid="b10-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Rosuvastatin can reduce the non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 50% and triglyceride by 30%, and its efficacy in this regard is superior to that of simvastatin and pravastatin.<xref rid="b11-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>According to the guidelines from the European Medicines Agency (EMA)<xref rid="b13-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> a highly variable drug (HVD) is defined that the within-subject coefficient of variation (CV) is &#x02265;30%, as determined using a replicate crossover study design with three or four periods. These guidelines state that if the within-subject CV of the maximum plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of a reference drug is &#x02265;30%, the conventional bioequivalence (BE) limits, 0.80&#x02013;1.25, can be widened. In previous drug&#x02013;drug interaction studies, the intrasubject variability of the C<sub>max</sub> of fimasartan was 60.9% and 76.1%. Thus, fimasartan is an HVD, and hence, the widened BE limits can be used for comparison with the pharmacokinetic profiles. Thus, we designed a three-period replicate crossover study in which the reference drug was administered twice and the test drug only once.</p><p>The combination therapy improves patient compliance, simplifies the regimen by reducing the number of drugs and the frequency of dosing, reduces costs, and may produce a superior blood pressure lowering effect in some patients.<xref rid="b17-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, the combination of fimasartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin is expected to be effective against both hypertension and dyslipidemia and to inhibit the development of cardiovascular disease.

The PK profiles of fimasartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin for test were similar to those of the reference drugs.</p><p>The GMRs (90% CIs) of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub> were 1.0776 (0.9201&#x02013;1.2622) and 0.9978 (0.9538&#x02013;1.0439) for fimasartan, 1.0038 (0.9782&#x02013;1.0301) and 1.0055 (0.9828&#x02013;1.0288) for amlodipine, and 1.0006 (0.9290&#x02013;1.0776) and 0.9986 (0.9532&#x02013;1.0461) for rosuvastatin, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-12-1157">Table 2</xref>). The within-subject CV of the C<sub>max</sub> for fimasartan was 67.95% and the expanded BE limit was 0.6894&#x02013;1.4319. The 90% CIs of the C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub> for fimasartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin fell within the predefined BE limit.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>During the study, a total of 22 AEs occurred in 19 subjects who were administered study drugs at least once. The number of AEs was 10 in nine subjects who received the test drug, 6 in six subjects who received reference <xref rid="b1-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, and <xref rid="b6-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> in five subjects who received reference <xref rid="b2-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. There was no statistically significant difference among the treatment groups in the rate of AEs.</p><p>The most frequently reported AE was headache (seven cases recorded in seven subjects) followed by dizziness (four cases in three subjects); blood creatine phosphokinase elevation (four cases in four subjects); nausea (two cases in two subjects); and oropharyngeal pain, diarrhea, epigastric discomfort, white blood cells in urine, and hypotension (each in one subject).</p><p>The severity of all AEs was mild and resolved spontaneously; there was no serious AE. Of the AEs, headache, dizziness, nausea, epigastric discomfort, and hypotension were considered to possibly be related to the study drugs.</p><p>There was no clinically significant finding or clinically relevant change in vital signs, clinical laboratory test results, physical examinations, or ECG profiles.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study showed the PKs and safety profiles of an FDC tablet formulation containing 60 mg fimasartan/10 mg amlodipine/20 mg rosuvastatin and separate formulations of fimasartan/amlodipine 60 mg/10 mg FDC tablet and 20 mg rosuvastatin tablet. And the 90% CI for the GMRs of C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub> of an FDC formulation and co-administration of fimasartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin were within the accepted limit of BE based on partial replicated crossover study design. No serious or unexpected AEs occurred, and there was no clinically significant difference among the treatment groups.</p><p>About 228 subjects were required to detect a 20% difference between the test and reference drugs with 80% statistical power at a 5% level of significance based on the intrasubject variability of the C<sub>max</sub> for fimasartan, 58.8%, in the conventional 2&#x000d7;2 crossover study design. However, we performed a replicated crossover study design according to the guidelines for HVDs of the FDA and EMA. The study involved 60 subjects after considering a 30% dropout rate or compliance to the treatment groups. The largest intraindividual CV of the C<sub>max</sub> for fimasartan was 67.95%.</p><p>Two-by-two crossover studies of HVDs typically require a large number of healthy subjects in order to satisfy the statistical power. However, this required many ethical and financial considerations. And high within-formulation variability may lead to problem than high within-subject variability. Therefore, HVDs may consider the extended BE criteria and, FDA and EMA suggested the guidelines for the method of adjusting the acceptance range of equivalence in HVDs followed by the intraindividual variability in reference drug.<xref rid="b13-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Also, MFDS, South Korea, adopted these guidelines and added new rule in the regulation documents. This is similar to the EMA&#x02019;s way of expanding the range of BE criteria according to the variation of intraindividual and not expanding beyond 50%.<xref rid="b9-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b19-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>According to the ESH/ESC 2013 guidelines, mono-therapy has a blood pressure lowering effect in limited patients, and most patients require two or more concomitant therapies. In patients with stage 1 hypertension, if the patient is at risk of cardiovascular disease, or if there is a risk of cardiovascular disease, or if the patient maintains the same blood pressure after a certain period of lifetime, the patient is advised to start treatment with antihypertensive agents. If the target blood pressure is not reached, a combination therapy is recommended.<xref rid="b26-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-dddt-12-1157" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>We assumed that the half-life of fimasartan was 5.8 hours and the washout period was 14 days. As a result, fimasartan is absorbed rapidly and its maximum concentration occurred within 1 hour (0.75 hours, 0.25&#x02013;5.00), and it had a relatively short terminal elimination half-life (6.06&#x000b1;1.27 hours). When the variability of drug is high and the elimination half-life of it is relatively short, replicated crossover study design with three or four periods would be appropriate to assess the BE.</p><p>Therefore, we can expect that it will be possible to reduce the failure burden of the clinical trial and to conduct clinical trials designed with three or four periods with appropriate number of subjects if a study is intended to demonstrate BE in the case of a HVD with a short half-life.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that the PK profile of an FDC formulation and co-administration of fimasartan, amlodipine, and rosuvastatin in partial replicated study design were within the BE acceptance range by using reference-scaled average BE method. There was no significant difference for safety assessment between the FDC formulation and co-administration of the two products.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by Boryung Pharmaceutical Co.
