In medical education, the subject of pathology has been classically imparted through a combination of theoretical and practical teaching activities, oral lectures, practical clinical autopsies, and exhibition of macro- and micro-scopic specimens in medical museums.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] However, in recent years, medical education has undergone a revolution with the development of a core curriculum that integrates clinical medicine with basic science.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Traditional medical curriculum used in western universities teaches pathology as an isolated subject in the preclinical years, and basic science concepts are imparted with limited clinical correlation.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] There has been a shift away from this magisterial teaching approach toward a system with problem-based learning, where basic science and clinical education are integrated. Such a system better mirrors real medical practice.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, the use of new informatics tools is expected to improve the learning process and expand access to medical knowledge.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Recent years have seen multimedia and information technology rise to dominance in medical education. Concurrently, there has been the gradual disappearance of traditional medical museums and autopsies, despite proven utility in medical education.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Potentiating the use of these traditional teaching methods through digital strategies should be a priority. In addition, the number of medical students is increasing, and several new medical schools have been opened in response to a recognized need for more doctors. Unfortunately, limitations in direct contact between professors and students are currently well-characterized. At the same time, in this era of personalized and genomic medicine, there has been an explosion of medical knowledge needed to be assimilated by students.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Improving student access to information generated from genomics research should remain a priority.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In this study, we applied and evaluated a teaching method, which actively combines theoretical lectures with practical sessions in the same classroom setting. Clinical cases were detailed through digital images and videos. Fundamental to this method was exposing students simultaneously to clinical and morphological data. We hypothesize that this method enables students to better understand the pathogenesis and distinctive clinical manifestations of important diseases. Our goals for this combined didactic method were to increase medical student curiosity, better correlate clinical cases with basic science, and improve interactions between students and professors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Design</title><p>An experimental study was performed between July 2009 and September 2010 to evaluate the efficacy of a new teaching strategy for the subject of pathology. This study compares 3<sup>rd</sup> year medical students placed in either an intervention group or a control group, with a similar number of participants (47 subjects) in each group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. In both groups, pathology teaching was provided with similar time intensity (10 h/week over a period of 4 months), during the same time of day (afternoon classes and laboratories), and by professors with similar academic background (physicians with board certifications in pathology), following a previously developed curriculum. This study was designed, evaluated, and analyzed by the same group of researchers. The students have not influence in be selected in any of the groups. All educational material was intended to meet medical curriculum requirements recommended by the Colombian National Accreditation Council of Higher Education (CNA) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cna.gov.co/">http://www.cna.gov.co/</ext-link>), under the Latin-America Andres Bello standards (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.convenioandresbello.org/">http://www.convenioandresbello.org/</ext-link>) to grant academic titles recognized in Latin-America countries. CNA approval for the intervention was received 1 year before the study, and our curriculum was evaluated as &#x0201c;high quality&#x0201d; (maximum score). Previously, the CNA have also approved the traditional teaching strategy used in the control group.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of subject progression through the different phases of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPI-5-25-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Medical Students</title><p>All medical students participating in this study were in their 3<sup>rd</sup> year of medical training (from a total of 6 years) and were followed for two consecutive semesters. Students were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The randomization process, evaluations, and analysis were performed in a blinded manner with respect to teaching method and student identifying information. The eligibility criteria were: (1) Be an active student (full-time student) and (2) be able to interact with personal computers during classes. All students participated in the study, and all were deemed eligible for the study.

Pathology is taught during the 3<sup>rd</sup> year, in two consecutive semesters. Each academic semester has duration of 24 weeks for a total of 48 weeks of training in pathology. During this training, students in both the interventional and control groups receive training in general pathology, anatomic pathology (AP), and pathophysiology. The training program is divided into 24-units schedules (2 weeks per unit), and within each unit, the students receive six classes with six clinical cases, covering the following topics:</p><p>

Appropriate training in anatomical and functional pathology is essential for a satisfactory medical practice.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Pathology is defined as the study of disease, and the all-encompassing nature of this definition reflects the importance of this subject matter in medical education. However, the optimal approach for pathology teaching in medical students is currently debated.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Traditional learning systems utilize textbooks, oral lectures, gross specimens, and microscopy of tissue on glass sides. Recently, however, the availability of new informatics tools has created the opportunity for new strategies in teach this subject matter.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Potential benefits include the capacity to teach multiple students simultaneously, avoidance of ethical and biological risks implicit in using human specimens, cost-effectiveness, and better distribution of clinically relevant knowledge to students.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Currently, these benefits are still under evaluation.</p><p>Traditional pathology education has been previously shown to be fairly effective. However, multiple problems have been identified with each aspect of the traditional approach, thus driving the search for new educational methods.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Medical knowledge has increased exponentially in recent years, to the point where thousands of scientific papers and hundreds of textbooks are produced each year in AP alone.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This quantity of information is far too vast for a medical student to efficiently digest and also apply to clinical medicine.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Oral lectures focus on providing summaries of this information to a passive audience of students.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The medical classroom needs a pedagogical basis in order to be meaningful for students.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Unfortunately, passive learning limits the opportunity for reflection, interaction, creativity, clinical correlation and generative thinking.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] A structural change in how medical schools educate students in the subject of pathology is necessary.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Without a peer-based learning group, students also have reduced opportunity to develop social skills in an academic setting. Other limitations of the lecture format include the lack of opportunity for self-reflection and social awareness. There is very limited individual interaction when one professor lectures hundreds of students in an auditorium, and most communication is unidirectional.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] These obstacles limit the opportunity for burgeoning physicians to develop the collaborative skills vital for a thriving clinical practice.</p><p>In AP, the practical component of the traditional teaching strategy is based around the analysis of macroscopic specimens and histology slides in medical museums, as well as, the use of clinical autopsies.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These methods are extremely effective in teaching medical students, because they provide a first-hand look at morphological manifestations of disease.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] However, they are not without limitations, including the lack of clinical correlation,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] a limited number of samples for analysis, and the biological and ethical risks of specimen manipulation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Macroscopic samples are usually preserved in glass jars containing a formalin-based solution. These specimens are usually fully labeled such that medical students can view and study them in a self-guided fashion.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] This exposure of medical students to formalin solution, an oncogenic compound, is currently an area of debate.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Furthermore, preserved pathology specimens are fragile, and the cost of maintaining these specimens is increasing. As a result, it would be useful to study certain alternatives to this approach. For microscopic study, most medical schools have teaching laboratories equipped with optical microscopes and histological slides from a number of diseases.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, laboratory work is limited by time and personnel restrictions because in this setting, professors and students typically interact on a one-on-one basis.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Finally, the use of clinical autopsy as a teaching tool has significantly declined, strongly influenced by worldwide reduction in consented clinical autopsies.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Reasons for this decline include negative public attitudes in the wake of organ retention scandals,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] medical provider attitudes, biological risks, legal concerns, and family ethical and religious dilemmas.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Autopsies, as a teaching tool, provide valuable information to preclinical medical students by integrating knowledge with clinical skills, while promoting both deductive reasoning and clinical problem solving.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Some have also suggested that exposure to autopsies during medical school will help future doctors understand the autopsy process and its utility, potentially making students more likely to recommend autopsies to family members of future patients.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Integration of biomedical disciplines is fundamental to excellence in research and medical education. Pathology, which studies the entire spectrum of human disease, is a keystone of this process.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Now, more than ever, there is a need to integrate different areas of medicine to help unveil important disease characteristics at both the molecular and clinical level.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The need for integrated medical training has become more urgent today. With the recent introduction of competency-based programs, time limitations and financial constraints are contributing to decreased opportunities for &#x0201c;learning by doing&#x0201d; in clinical areas.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, with rising availability of high-resolution imaging, classroom-based computers with audiovisual systems have provided a new teaching tool within this environment.</p><p>In this study, we evaluate a strategy based around an integrated medical curriculum, which maximizes student learning by correlating basic science pathology with clinical scenarios.
