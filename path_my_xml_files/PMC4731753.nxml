In Japan, 9.5 million people are estimated to have this disease (National Health Surveillance 2013) that is characterized by chronic hyperglycemia associated with insufficient insulin action that leads to disorders in glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism. When these metabolic disorders are chronic, they can manifest diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications. Macrovascular lesions involving large vessels, such as the coronary artery, cerebral artery, or arteries of the lower extremities, account for myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, and peripheral artery disease, whereas microvascular lesions account for visual impairment, renal failure, and neuropathy. Epidemiological studies, including the Hisayama study, demonstrate that diabetes is associated with a near threefold risk for the onset of macrovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and that this risk becomes greater when it is accompanied by hypertension and/or dyslipidemia.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Furthermore, a total of 16&#x02005;000 patients are estimated to start receiving hemodialysis annually due to diabetic nephropathy, and a large number of patients develop ischemic heart disease or stroke, at an incidence of 17.0/1000 person-years in the Japan Diabetes Complications Study (JDCS).<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> No evidence has been obtained, however, that glycemic control will prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in patients with diabetes in the Japanese population, although the Kumamoto study showed that intensive insulin therapy reduced the risk of microvascular complications.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></p><p>Globally, a number of clinical studies evaluating various antidiabetic therapeutic strategies have been conducted to provide evidence that intensive therapy reduces microvascular and macrovascular complications. Of these, the UK Prospective Diabetes Study 33 (UKPDS 33), in which a total of 3867 patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned to intensive therapy with sulfonylurea/insulin or to conventional diet therapy for glycemic control, came to a noteworthy conclusion that intensive therapy led to a decrease in the risk for the onset of microvascular complications among the treated patients, compared with diet therapy alone.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Moreover, in the UKPDS 35, in which the results of the UKPDS were further analyzed epidemiologically, it was shown that decreases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) are paralleled with decreases in the risk for mortality, myocardial infarction, and microvascular complications.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Furthermore, the 10-year post-trial observational study of UKPDS revealed the existence of a &#x02018;legacy effect&#x02019; that caused intensive blood glucose (BG) control immediately after disease onset to be associated with long-term beneficial effects on the prevention of coronary events and death by any cause.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> For the patients with advanced type 2 diabetes, the PROactive (PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events) study demonstrated that pioglitazone added to conventional therapy produced greater reductions in the onset of macrovascular complications than did placebo, indicating that intensive therapy with pioglitazone is efficacious for the secondary prevention of macrovascular complications.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, recent trials challenging whether controlling hyperglycemia to near normal levels of HbA1c could reduce the risk of macrovascular complications, such as the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: PreterAx and DiamicroN Modified Release Controlled Evaluation) trial,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and the VADT (Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial),<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> failed to show the beneficial effect of intensive BG control for patients with advanced stages of diabetes, presumably due to a marked increase in severe hypoglycemic episodes.</p><p>However, the Steno-2 study, in which patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria were randomly assigned to intensive therapy for rigorous BG, blood pressure (BP), and lipid control or to conventional therapy, reported a reduction in the incidence of microvascular and macrovascular complications in patients treated with multifactorial intensive therapy.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Moreover, the 5-year post-trial observational study of Steno-2 showed a significant reduction in macrovascular complications and mortality in the intensive therapy group (ITG),<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> suggesting that the comprehensive and strict control of BG, BP, and lipids brings with it long-term beneficial effects on the prevention of macrovascular complications and death, due to the possible &#x02018;legacy effect&#x02019;. Still, the study had limitations, including the small number of participants, only 160. In addition, glycemic control may not have been sufficient, because the mean HbA1c was nearly 8% (64&#x02005;mmol/mol) and the achievement rate of the target HbA1c, &#x0003c;6.5% (48&#x02005;mmol/mol), was around 15%, even in the ITG.</p><p>Effectiveness of multifactorial intervention was investigated also in the ADDITION-Europe (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment In People with Screen Detected Diabetes in Primary Care), in which over 3000 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes were recruited, whose mean baseline HbA1c was about 7% (53&#x02005;mmol/mol), resulting in a slight but non-significant reduction in CVD events.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Most recently, the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study showed that a sodium&#x02013;glucose linked co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, empagliflozin, reduced cardiovascular mortality, with no difference in incidence of myocardial infarction or stroke.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>In 2005, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) of Japan developed a new category of research projects, namely &#x02018;strategic research&#x02019;, whose target diseases were of the highest social priority and whose results were expected to be immediately applied to the clinical practice and the Japanese healthcare system. In the field of diabetes, three trials were planned; specifically, the Japan Diabetes Outcome Intervention Trial (J-DOIT),<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> including J-DOIT1, aimed at reducing the conversion from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes through education and lifestyle modification;<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> J-DOIT2 aimed at reducing patient dropout rates from diabetes treatment through improved therapy from primary care physicians;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and J-DOIT3 aimed at reducing macrovascular complications through multifactorial interventions. Here, we describe the design of and rationale for J-DOIT3, renamed the Japan Diabetes Optimal Integrated Treatment study for three major risk factors of cardiovascular diseases, which started in 2006 and is, as of this writing, still underway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Research design and methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The present trial is a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, conducted to examine the efficacy of intensive multifactorial therapy on the development and exacerbation of diabetic complications, in particular CVDs, and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes with high risk for CVDs, whose details are available online.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In this trial, patients with type 2 diabetes who were at high risk of macrovascular complications were recruited, allocated to either the conventional therapy group (CTG) or the ITG, and followed up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJDRC2015000123F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="BMJDRC2015000123F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Screening, enrollment, and randomization of study participants (BMI, body mass index; CTG, conventional therapy group; HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; IHD, ischemic heart disease; ITG, intensive therapy group; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjdrc2015000123f01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Organization and funding</title><p>Research funding is to be accounted for by the MHLW grants in aid, as well as corporate donations, as described later, and to be supplied through the funding agency, which was shifted from the Japan Foundation for the Promotion of International Medical Research Co-operation (the National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan), or JF-PIMRC, to the Japan Diabetes Foundation (JDF) in April 2013 (see sFigure 1).</p><p>To monitor and assess the research, the foundation organized the Trial Coordinating Committee, the Trial Administrative Committee, the Trial Assessment Committee, the Trial Progress Management Committee, the Safety Assessment Committee, the Central Ethics Committee, and the Endpoint Assessment Committees, whose purposes are referred to online.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Among them, the Endpoint Assessment Committees are blinded to the study arm, whereas the Trial Assessment Committee and the Safety Assessment Committee are not. The protocol of this study, as further mentioned later, was approved by the Central Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Eligibility</title><p>Medical institutions were selected in Japan that employed certified diabetologist(s) who were expected to register 50 or more participants (25 or more participants per group) with type 2 diabetes and hypertension and/or dyslipidemia. The inclusion and exclusion criteria, shown in sTable 1 and 2, respectively, were formulated to recruit those patients who were at high risk of CVDs, but still allow for intensification of medication for BG, BP, and lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Informed consent, registration, and random allocation</title><p>The physician in charge explained the study particulars in person to each candidate participant to obtain consent to participate in the study, and the written document of informed consent was obtained one or more days after the date of the physician's explanation.</p><p>On receiving the patient's registration, the Data Center was to confirm the eligibility of the participant, followed by dynamic allocation to the CTG or to the ITG in a 1:1 ratio through randomization adjusted by the presence or absence of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary angioplasty, cerebral revascularization, or cerebrovascular reconstruction), male/female ratio, age (&#x02265;60, &#x0003c;60&#x02005;years old), and HbA1c (&#x02265;8.9% (74&#x02005;mmol/mol), &#x0003c;8.9%), to ensure a balanced allocation of participant characteristics between the groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJDRC2015000123F1">figure 1</xref>).</p><p>After registration, each time the protocol is revised, informed consent is reobtained in all participants receiving investigational treatment. For participants who are incompetent, consent from a family member or legally authorized representative is received instead.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Management goals and investigational treatment</title><p>The treatment goals were to be set in accordance with the &#x02018;Treatment guide for diabetes&#x02019; edited by the Japan Diabetes Society<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> in the CTG, and set stricter in the ITG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJDRC2015000123F1">figure 1</xref>), with rationale as follows. The target HbA1c was the value of &#x02018;excellently controlled&#x02019; in the Treatment Guide (2006), which was defined on the basis of the distribution of the HbA1c of the individuals with normal glucose tolerance. The target BP and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were set by reference to clinical evidence available when this study was planned, including a meta-analysis on BP lowering by the PSC (Prospective Studies Collaboration),<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and results of the CARDS (Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study), an interventional trial of lipid lowering.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> To achieve these target goals, which have been kept unchanged throughout the course of the study, medications in the ITG are intensified in a stepwise manner in 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months, mainly utilizing drugs proven to prevent CVDs (see sFigure 2).</p><p>In the ITG, for glycemic control, all participants maintain treatment after registration with predetermined diet and exercise therapy, and if they fail to achieve an HbA1c&#x0003c;6.2% (44&#x02005;mmol/mol) in the first 3&#x02005;months, the treatment is intensified with antidiabetic drugs categorized into 4 groups, mainly those that improve insulin resistance with less risk of hypoglycemia. Among insulin sensitizers, pioglitazone, the only thiazolidinedione derivative available in Japan, was preferred because it had emerging evidence of CVD prevention, such as the PROactive study,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> when this study was planned. It was also because only low-dose biguanides were allowed to be administered until 2010 in Japan. In the 6&#x02005;months thereafter, the treatment is to be intensified if they fail to achieve an HbA1c&#x0003c;6.2% or &#x02265;1% decrease in HbA1c (see sFigure 2). If any of the participants receiving treatment on an outpatient basis do not achieve the management goals, hospitalization will be recommended to ensure better glycemic control. All participants in the ITG are provided a BG meter for self-monitoring of BG (SMBG), and the physicians in charge remain informed of the measured results.</p><p>All participants maintain treatment for BP on registration with predetermined diet and exercise therapy, and if they fail to achieve BP&#x0003c;120/75&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg in the first 3&#x02005;months, they are given antihypertensive drugs in steps to ensure that the goal is achieved in 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months, as shown in sFigure 2. All the participants in the ITG are also provided a BP manometer at study entry, and the physician in charge remains informed of these measurements. The physician in charge is to keep informed of self-measured BP for decisions regarding dose escalation or replacement of antihypertensive drugs.</p><p>All participants maintain lipid control treatment on registration with predetermined diet and exercise therapy, and if they fail to achieve the lipid control goal in the first 3&#x02005;months, they are given lipid-lowering drugs, as shown in sFigure 2.</p><p>In both groups, all participants with a history of CVDs are given antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy, such as low-dose aspirin and warfarin, in accordance with the guideline.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>It is up to the physician in charge to choose which agent in a class (eg, insulin) to administer. The exceptions are pioglitazone and ezetimibe, both of which are the only drugs in their class (thiazolidinedione derivatives, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, respectively) available in Japan, and so was eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which was included in the omega-3 fatty acids thereafter, as is further mentioned later.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Lifestyle modifications</title><p>In both groups, the participants are obliged to follow lifestyle modifications as shown in sTable 3.

J-DOIT3 is a quite unique study not just because it is the first large-scale trial for East Asian patients with type 2 diabetes who have many different characteristics from Caucasians, but because it also strives to achieve strict and safe control for all the risk factors of vascular complications.
