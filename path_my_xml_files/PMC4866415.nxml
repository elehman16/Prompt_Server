Patients received bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg (both trials) or 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg (noncarrier trial) or placebo every 13&#x000a0;weeks.

Bapineuzumab is a monoclonal antibody specific to the N-terminus of the amyloid &#x003b2; (A&#x003b2;) protein designed to decrease plaque formation and promote clearance of A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

The findings provided a rationale for conducting separate trials in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) &#x003b5;4 allele carriers and noncarriers and for limiting the bapineuzumab dose in carriers to minimize risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or effusion (ARIA-E; previously termed <italic>vasogenic edema</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The bapineuzumab phase 3 development program consisted of four nearly identical phase 3 trials conducted in parallel to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) bapineuzumab over 18&#x000a0;months in patients with mild to moderate AD.

Originally, Study 3000 included a bapineuzumab 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg dose, which was discontinued because of a high rate of clinically symptomatic ARIA-E. Patients randomized to the 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg group were reassigned to receive 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg for the remainder of the study, and the randomization ratio was adjusted accordingly. Allocation of patients to treatment groups using stratified block randomization proceeded through the entering of subject information by the study coordinator or delegate and the dispenser (unblinded pharmacist) into an interactive voice/web response system. The dispenser was then provided with a subject randomization number and treatment assignment, and a confirmatory facsimile was sent to the dispenser. Randomization was stratified by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (16&#x02013;21; 22&#x02013;26); concomitant cholinesterase inhibitor and/or memantine use; substudy participation; and, in the carrier study, number of copies of ApoE &#x003b5;4 allele (one allele; two alleles). Patients received a total of six IV infusions of bapineuzumab or placebo every 13&#x000a0;weeks, with brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) monitoring for ARIA-E conducted at 6&#x000a0;weeks after each infusion. There were three biomarker substudies: a brain amyloid PET substudy, a CSF substudy, and a volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (vMRI) substudy. No interim analyses were planned or performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Patients were eligible for enrollment if they were aged 50&#x02013;88 years with a diagnosis of probable AD and had an MMSE score of 16&#x02013;26, inclusive, and a screening MRI scan consistent with AD.

Change from baseline to week 78 in Dependence Scale, Clinical Dementia Rating&#x02013;Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB), and Neuropsychological Test Battery (NTB) total Z-scores were additional endpoints. Prespecified secondary biomarker endpoints included change from baseline to week 71 in PiB-PET global cortical average (GCA) standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) of five cortical regions of interest (frontal, lateral temporal, parietal, anterior cingulate, posterior cingulate/precuneus), CSF p-tau, and brain volume assessed by brain boundary shift integral (BBSI) on vMRI. PiB-PET and vMRI were read centrally. Human plasma A&#x003b2;<sub><italic>x</italic>&#x02013;40</sub> peptide levels were measured using a validated electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method on a Meso Scale Discovery (Rockville, MD, USA) platform, which had a range of quantification from 50 to 3200&#x000a0;pg/ml in 100&#x000a0;% matrix with a minimum required sample dilution of 1:2 and maximum sample dilution of 1:64. This platform had an interassay precision of 9&#x000a0;% and an intraassay precision of 5&#x000a0;%. CSF <sup>181</sup>phospho-tau concentrations were measured using the INNOTEST enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Innogenetics, Ghent, Belgium), which had an interassay precision of 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;% and an intraassay precision of 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;%. Samples were tested pairwise per patient to reduce between-assay run variability (i.e., baseline and postbaseline samples in the same assay run and on the same microtiter ELISA plate). All biosamples were analyzed in a centralized location at the Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy Research &#x00026; Development Bioanalytical Development laboratory in South San Francisco, CA, USA.

For the ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarrier study, approximately 295 patients were to be randomized to each bapineuzumab dose group (0.5 and 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg) and 400 patients to placebo, giving 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a 2.65-point advantage on ADAS-Cog/11 total score for a bapineuzumab dose over placebo and a 6.56-point advantage on DAD total score at week 78. The standard deviations for the ADAS-Cog/11 total score and the DAD total score used in the power calculation were 9.3 and 23.0, respectively (based on previous studies). Planned substudy enrollment in the carrier substudies was 80 patients for the PiB-PET substudy, 300 for the CSF substudy, and 680 for the vMRI substudy.

As in the first two U.S. trials (Studies 301 and 302), no significant differences were found in the coprimary cognitive or functional endpoints in this more global demographic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Early termination of the 3000/3001 studies could have contributed to the inability to detect a treatment effect; however, enrollment in the carrier (3001) study was complete (only the PET substudy was still recruiting), MMRM analysis was used, the treatment and placebo values were similar, and the negative results in the mITT and completer populations were consistent with studies 301/302 collectively, suggesting that the lack of clinical effect seen in these two studies was not due to early termination. There was no evidence of a clinical dose effect in the noncarrier study between the 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg doses. The small number of patients in the 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg dose group (11 patients, 9 completers) and the reassignment of these patients to 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg did not permit evaluation of the effects of higher doses.</p><p>The need for earlier intervention with amyloid-lowering therapy has been hypothesized as a potential reason for lack of clinical efficacy observed in recent phase 3 studies of bapineuzumab and of solanezumab, another anti-A&#x003b2;-targeted monoclonal antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Also, a statistically significant benefit of bapineuzumab was reported in Study 301 in a mild AD subgroup (MMSE &#x0003e;19) of ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarriers on the functional but not the cognitive measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. On the basis of these findings, phase 3 studies in patients with mild AD and prodromal AD were initiated with solanezumab and another anti-A&#x003b2;-targeted monoclonal antibody, gantenerumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Twenty-three percent of noncarriers and two percent of carriers who had baseline PiB-PET scans met the clinical criteria for AD dementia but did not meet the PiB-PET threshold for amyloid positivity at baseline. These patients with &#x0201c;suspected nonamyloid pathology&#x0201d; may have had some other form of dementia that could not be differentiated from AD on the basis of clinical inclusion criteria. Patients with low levels of amyloid would not be expected to benefit from an antiamyloid therapy. Inclusion of subthreshold amyloid patients was also a factor in the 301/302 bapineuzumab PiB-PET substudies (36&#x000a0;% and 6.5&#x000a0;% of those with baseline scans in the noncarrier and carrier studies, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The proportion of patients not meeting the amyloid threshold was lower in the 3000/3001 studies than in the 301/302 studies using the same threshold value, suggesting some differences in enrollment between the two sets of studies. The choice of amyloid threshold was based on the consensus of experts consulted at the time the studies were initiated, but the plot of baseline values shows a clear separation between positive and negative populations that would be robust to a range of selected thresholds. The amyloid-negative patients were included in the analyses of outcomes other than SUVr; however, it is unlikely that exclusion of the ten patients who were amyloid-negative would affect the overall study outcome. Since brain amyloid positivity was not an inclusion criterion, it is not possible to evaluate its impact on the observed cognitive and functional outcomes. Collectively, the findings from these studies indicate that amyloid assessment at screening is essential and that meeting an agreed amyloid threshold should be an inclusion criterion for future antiamyloid therapy trials.</p><p>The 3000/3001 bapineuzumab studies did not fully replicate the PiB-PET or CSF biomarker findings from Studies 301/302. In Studies 3000/3001, no significant treatment differences were seen in amyloid burden on PiB-PET or CSF p-tau (but trends were in the expected directions) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), which appeared to be related to stability of the placebo groups over time. This finding differs from the results of Study 302 in ApoE &#x003b5;4 carriers, in which SUVr on PiB-PET continued to increase in the placebo group with no change in the bapineuzumab group, suggesting prevention of A&#x003b2; accumulation. Significant decreases in amyloid load on PiB-PET with bapineuzumab were also reported from a phase 2 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, Study 301 in noncarriers showed no change in SUVr in the placebo group and no significant difference at week 71 between placebo and the bapineuzumab 0.5&#x000a0;mg/kg and 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mean amyloid load at baseline in amyloid-positive patients was similar between carriers and noncarriers in all four studies and between the 301/302 and 3000/3001 studies. A possible reason for lack of significance of the PiB-PET results in Studies 3000/3001 is the small number of subjects who completed each PiB-PET substudy, owing to early study termination. Only 27 patients in the current carrier study and 14 in the noncarrier study (approximately half in the bapineuzumab and half in the placebo group in each study) had an assessment at week 71, in contrast to 115 patients (75 bapineuzumab, 40 placebo) in the 302 carrier study and 39 patients (24 bapineuzumab, 15 placebo) in the 301 noncarrier study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the projected <italic>p</italic> values for the PET substudies assuming full enrollment with the observed data trends suggest that full enrollment would not have changed the study conclusions. The cerebellar gray matter was used as reference region in the PET analyses, opening up another possibility that the use of the pons as reference region might have reduced the noise and thereby improved sensitivity to detect changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In Studies 3000/3001, there was no effect of treatment on CSF p-tau, although there was a trend for significant reduction in the pooled bapineuzumab group in noncarriers. This finding differs from the results of the 301/302 studies. In ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarriers in the latter studies, there was no effect on CSF p-tau concentrations in the pooled bapineuzumab groups (the prespecified analysis), but exploratory analyses showed a significant reduction in CSF p-tau with bapineuzumab 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. As was the case for the PiB-PET analysis of SUVr, the results for CSF p-tau in the current studies were likely affected by the small number of patients who completed the assessments. Compared with the 301/302 studies, the number of patients in the bapineuzumab groups was less by almost half. vMRI assessments showed no significant effect of bapineuzumab treatment in any of the four studies, and rates of whole-brain volume loss were similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Plasma A&#x003b2;<sub><italic>x</italic>&#x02013;40</sub> levels increased significantly in the bapineuzumab groups but not in the placebo group in the 3000/3001 studies, a result expected from anti-A&#x003b2; antibody infusion observed in other studies and an indicator of peripheral target engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Infusions of bapineuzumab 0.5 and 1.0&#x000a0;mg/kg every 13&#x000a0;weeks were generally well-tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent with that reported in previous studies. No new or unexpected safety findings were observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. ARIA-E were confirmed as dose-dependent TEAEs associated with bapineuzumab; these events increased with dose and ApoE &#x003b5;4 allele number and led to discontinuation of the 2.0&#x000a0;mg/kg dose in all noncarrier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Rates of ARIA-E were three to four times higher in the placebo group of ApoE &#x003b5;4 carriers than among noncarriers in the current studies, which differs from what was reported in the previous studies. This difference may have been due to increased detection because of the central image-reading of every MRI scan, suggesting a need for more intensive radiologist training to detect ARIA-E, particularly in clinical trials. Further research is needed to identify risk factors for ARIA-E and their long-term clinical course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. There is growing evidence that ARIA is related to amyloid clearance from the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], which could eventually be tested by comparing PET and MRI images from the four completed bapineuzumab studies.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Early termination is the major limitation of both studies, as both were discontinued earlier than expected and before enrollment was complete in the noncarrier study. Premature termination led to smaller-than-expected sample sizes, particularly in the PiB-PET and CSF p-tau substudies. In addition, assuming that the PET substudy population is representative of the entire study population, a relatively high proportion of ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarriers did not meet a preestablished amyloid threshold and therefore lacked the drug target.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite early termination, these studies in a more global population demographic confirm the overall negative clinical findings of the first phase 3 trials of bapineuzumab in mild to moderate AD. Some biomarker results of the 301/302 studies were not confirmed in the present studies, although small sample sizes limit their interpretation. In the future, a pooled analysis of the data from the four studies may provide more clarity on the effects of bapineuzumab on biomarkers of AD. In the PiB-PET substudy, the percentage of ApoE &#x003b5;4 noncarriers with amyloid below the GCA threshold SUVr of 1.35 is lower in this study than in Study 301 (23&#x000a0;% vs 36&#x000a0;%). Assuming that the percentage is similar in the entire study population, it is still high and highlights the potential importance of meeting a preestablished amyloid threshold as an inclusion criterion when conducting future studies of this type. Preliminary studies to determine adequate blood-brain barrier penetration of therapeutic antibodies at planned study doses would also help answer questions about central target engagement. Large studies in patients with prodromal AD who have sufficient brain amyloid to confirm the diagnosis, with extended follow-up to ensure significant change from baseline in the placebo group, will likely be needed to ultimately determine the viability of an immunotherapeutic approach to AD treatment.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Ethical approval and consent to participate</title><p>These studies were approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each site, and each patient (or the patient&#x02019;s legal representative) and patient caregiver provided written informed consent before any screening procedures were performed.
