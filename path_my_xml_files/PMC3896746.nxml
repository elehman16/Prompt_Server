Tick vaccines have been proposed as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative for tick control. Vaccination with the candidate tick protective antigen, Subolesin (SUB), has been shown experimentally to be effective in controlling vector infestations and pathogen infection. Furthermore, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> membranes containing the chimeric antigen composed of SUB fused to <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic> Major Surface Protein 1a (MSP1a) (SUB-MSP1a) were produced using a simple low-cost process and proved to be effective for the control of cattle tick, <italic>Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus</italic> and <italic>R. annulatus</italic> infestations in pen trials. In this research, field trials were conducted to characterize the effect of vaccination with SUB-MSP1a on tick infestations and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens in a randomized controlled prospective study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two cattle and two sheep farms with similar geographical locations and production characteristics were randomly assigned to control and vaccinated groups. Ticks were collected, counted, weighed and classified and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens at the DNA and serological levels were followed for one year prior to and 9 months after vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both cattle and sheep developed antibodies against SUB in response to vaccination. The main effect of the vaccine in cattle was the 8-fold reduction in the percent of infested animals while vaccination in sheep reduced tick infestations by 63%. Female tick weight was 32-55% lower in ticks collected from both vaccinated cattle and sheep when compared to controls. The seroprevalence of <italic>Babesia bigemina</italic> was lower by 30% in vaccinated cattle, suggesting a possible role for the vaccine in decreasing the prevalence of this tick-borne pathogen. The effect of the vaccine in reducing the frequency of one <italic>A. marginale msp4</italic> genotype probably reflected the reduction in the prevalence of a tick-transmitted strain as a result of the reduction in the percent of tick-infested cattle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data provide evidence of the dual effect of a SUB-based vaccine for controlling tick infestations and pathogen infection/transmission and provide additional support for the use of the SUB-MSP1a vaccine for tick control in cattle and sheep.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Subolesin</kwd><kwd>Tick</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd><italic>Anaplasma</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Babesia</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Theileria</italic></kwd><kwd>Bovine</kwd><kwd>Ovine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Tick infestations affect animal health and production worldwide, both for the impact on animal weight gain and milk production and for the pathogens transmitted by these ectoparasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Acaricides are a major component of integrated tick control strategies, but their application has had limited efficacy in reducing tick infestations and is often accompanied by serious drawbacks, including the selection of acaricide-resistant ticks, environmental contamination and contamination of milk and meat products with drug residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. All of these issues reinforce the need for alternative approaches to control tick infestations and pathogen transmission, including the use of vaccines with tick antigens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In the early 1990s, commercial vaccines containing the recombinant <italic>Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus</italic> BM86 gut antigen were developed and commercialized for the control of cattle tick infestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These vaccines proved to be a cost-effective alternative for cattle tick control through the reduction of the number of engorged female ticks, their weight and reproductive capacity and the prevalence of some tick-borne pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, BM86-based vaccines have limited efficacy against other tick species and thus new vaccines are needed for the control of multiple tick species infestations, which occur in many areas used for animal husbandry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Recently, Subolesin (SUB) was discovered as a new candidate tick protective antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Vaccination trials with recombinant SUB and its ortholog in insects, Akirin, demonstrated effective control of arthropod vector infestations in various hard and soft tick species, mosquitoes, sand flies, poultry red mites and sea lice by reducing their numbers, weight, oviposition, fertility and/or molting and also reduced tick infection with tick-borne pathogens, <italic>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</italic>, <italic>Anaplasma marginale</italic>, <italic>Babesia bigemina</italic> and <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the chimeric antigen, tick SUB fused with <italic>A. marginale</italic> Major Surface Protein 1a (MSP1a; SUB-MSP1a), was produced in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> using a simple and low-cost process. Use of a vaccine with bacterial membranes containing the SUB-MSP1a chimera with surface-exposed SUB provided control of <italic>R. microplus</italic> and <italic>R. annulatus</italic> tick infestations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and this vaccine formulation was proposed as a low-cost and effective alternative means of tick control.</p><p>However, vaccination trials with SUB-MSP1a were conducted under controlled conditions and only in cattle experimentally infested with <italic>R. microplus</italic> and <italic>R. annulatus</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which limit the assessment of the potential impact of this vaccine for the control of tick infestations and the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens under field conditions.

The main findings of these studies were that (a) both cattle and sheep developed antibodies in response to vaccination; (b) the main effect of the vaccine in cattle was the reduction in the percent of infested animals but not in the tick infestation rate in these animals; (c) vaccination in sheep did not affect the percent of infested animals but reduced tick infestations; (d) female tick weight was lower in ticks collected from both vaccinated cattle and sheep when compared to controls; (e) lower <italic>B. bigemina</italic> seroprevalence in vaccinated cattle suggested a role for the vaccine in decreasing the prevalence of this tick-borne pathogen; and (f) the effect of the vaccine in reducing the frequency of one <italic>A. marginale</italic> genotype probably reflected the reduction in the prevalence of a tick-transmitted strain as a result of the reduction in the percent of tick-infested cattle. The lower female tick weights are likely to impact and decrease tick populations over time because it has been well documented that lower female tick engorgement weights correlate with the oviposition of smaller egg masses. This trend would likely reduce tick populations over time. As has been noted previously, tick vaccines are likely to be an important component of integrated tick control methods and would likely reduce the use of acaricides.</p><p>These results provide new evidence to support that SUB-based vaccines have the dual effect of controlling tick infestations and pathogen infection/transmission, thus reducing tick populations and their vector capacity to impact on the control of tick-borne diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. These results also provide additional support for the use of the vaccine containing <italic>E. coli</italic> membranes with the surface-exposed SUB-MSP1a chimera as a low-cost and effective alternative for tick control in cattle and sheep, even under conditions with multiple tick species infestations and the prevalence of several tick-borne pathogens.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JF, AT, SC, CG, RCL conceived the study and participated in its design and coordination.
