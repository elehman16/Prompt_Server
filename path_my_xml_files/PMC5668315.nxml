A total of 1690 male participants from multiple study sites were cluster randomly allocated to three-stage (Model A), two-stage (Model B), and one-stage (Model C) educational interventions. In all three interventions models, knowledge about MC significantly increased and the reported willingness to accept MC increased to 52.6% (255/485), 67.0% (353/527), and 45.5% (219/481) after intervention, respectively (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Rate of MC surgery uptake was highest (23.7%; 115/485) among those who received Model A intervention, compared to those who received Model B (17.1%; 90/527) or Model C (9.4%; 45/481) interventions (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Multivariable Cox regression analysis identified that Model A or Model B had twice the effect of Model C on MC uptake, with relative risks of 2.4 (95%CI, 1.5&#x02013;3.8) and 2.2 (95%CI, 1.3&#x02013;3.6), respectively. Model B was the most effective model for improving participants&#x02019; willingness to accept MC, while Model A was most successful at increasing uptake of MC surgery. Self-reported attitude towards MC uptake was not strongly correlated with actual behavior in this study focusing on the general male population in Western China.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The most recent China AIDS Response Progress Report pointed out that heterosexual transmission accounted for more than 70% of all new HIV infections reported in China during 2016<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Additionally, epidemiological evidence has shown that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has expanded from high-risk groups to the general population, with a large increase of heterosexual transmission over the past decade<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The number of HIV infections in the Guangxi, Xinjiang and Chongqing Provinces of Western China alone, account for 27.3% of the total cases of HIV in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In addition, the proportion of men infected with HIV through sexual contact has increased from 7.3% in 2000 to 45.4% in 2009 in these areas, the number of HIV/AIDS cases caused by heterosexual transmission increased to 68,671 in 2014, accounted for 66.4%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Extra-marital sex, multiple sex partners and high-risk sexual behaviors may contribute to these epidemiological changes witnessed in Western China in recent years<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">To battle this serious epidemic, a number of effective intervention strategies have been suggested, including male circumcision (MC)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in Africa have demonstrated success of MC in preventing the acquisition of HIV by men through heterosexual intercourse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Additionally, uncircumcised men have a significantly higher risk of acquiring other STIs including syphilis, high-risk human papillomavirus, herpes simplex type 2, and mycoplasma genitalium compared to circumcised men<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Acceptance rates for MC are high in the United States, Canada, the Middle East, Asian Muslim countries and some African countries, ranging between 20% to 80%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. However, MC is not commonly accepted in China. It is estimated that only 2.7% of Chinese males are circumcised, excluding the ethnic Muslim minorities of Hui and Uighur, which have higher rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The protective effect of MC may have great impact in high prevalence countries where transmission is predominantly heterosexual and MC is not generally practiced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">As previously reported, preliminary findings of our cross-sectional survey showed that the willingness of men in Western China to undergo circumcision was only 44.6%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Increasing willingness and medical practice rates of MC is a major public health concern in Western China. Previously we demonstrated that a scale up of MC was more feasible to conduct in high-risk groups such as the migrant population and drug users<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, no cohort studies have been conducted to assess the effectiveness of MC in preventing HIV infection among the general population in China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. To address this gap in knowledge, in the current study we compared three methods for improving the rates of MC acceptance and uptake among men in Western China.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p id="Par5">This study is a focused analysis on one cohort within a larger study evaluating factors influencing Chinese male&#x02019;s willingness to undergo circumcision (Registration number: ChiCTR-TRC-13004127)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Enrollment and 9 month follow-up visits occurred between September 2009 and December 2010. All adult male residents within the selected communities of three Western provinces (Guangxi, Chongqing and Xinjiang) of China were approached for enrollment. The inclusion criteria for participation were: 18&#x02013;45 years of age, male resident living in the target communities for at least three years, no plans to move from the area in the coming two years, consent to give blood samples for HIV testing, and a negative HIV test result. Participants were excluded from enrollment if they had hearing or speech impairment or had previously undergone MC. All consenting males at each of the three study sites were randomly assigned as a cluster to one of three different intervention models, in which the dissemination of educational materials and expert- and volunteer-led discussions were conducted in one, two, and three stage interventions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>A total of 1690 subjects participated in the initial interview. Of those, 1640 completed the entire interview and were randomly allocated into one of three intervention models. Model A: Delivered all the intervention at 3 stages: distribution of general materials at the initial contact (0 month); distribution of general and special materials within 1 month after the initial contact; held an one-time on-site session that included dissemination of materials and expert- and volunteer-led discussions within 1 month after receiving all the above interventions. Model B: Delivered two intervention performances at 2 stages: distribution of general and special materials at the initial contact (0 month) and held an on-site session that included dissemination of materials and expert- and volunteer-led discussions within 1 month after the initial contact. Model C: Delivered general and special materials and held an one-time on-site session that included dissemination of materials and expert- and volunteer-led discussions at the initial contact (0 month). Changes in knowledge of MC, acceptability of MC, uptake of MC surgery, the cost per acceptance, and HIV/STD infection rate were analyzed at 9-months follow-up visits.

Total cost was calculated as the production cost of the promotional materials, service charge, training related expenses, travel related costs, on-site investigation, and intervention costs. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to compare differences between intervention models, and to estimate relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI); adjusted according to demographic and migration characteristics. For statistical analyses of MC uptake, baseline was defined by date of enrollment, and endpoint was defined either by date of uptake of MC surgery for those undergoing surgery or date of final follow-up for those refusing surgery.

Additionally, in this region, safe sex practices are not a cultural norm and access to condoms is often unreliable. Therefore, promoting MC among China&#x02019;s male population may therefore have important implications for reduction in HIV prevalence in Western China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Compared to other means of partial protection such as condom use, MC is a one-time intervention with lifelong benefits. Our study showed that the knowledge about MC among the general population including reasons for MC and complications of circumcision surgery substantially increased after receiving educational interventions, particularly increasing knowledge on the role of MC in preventing HIV/AIDS and STD. The two-stage intervention (Model B) was the most effective model at improving participants&#x02019; willingness to accept MC, while the three-stage intervention (Model A) was the most effective at increasing actual uptake of MC surgery.</p><p id="Par27">There were significant differences between acceptability of MC and uptake of MC surgery as a result of each intervention model. More than half of the participants were willing to accept MC, suggesting that interventions to scale up circumcision among the general population have a high likelihood of success. This finding was similar to previous studies conducted amongst migrant populations and bisexual men who have sex with men (MSM)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. In a previous study assessing these same intervention strategies on the MSM population, willingness to undergo circumcision increased from 8.1% to 35.1% after consulting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Despite the relatively high reported rate of willingness to accept MC (55.4%), in our study only 22.9% participants actually underwent the surgery after intervention, and thus, willingness and undertake of MC surgery were not strongly correlated. These data suggest that self-reported attitudes towards MC is not strongly correlated with actual behavior in the general male population, which is similar to our previous study conducted among the migrant worker population in this same region of western China<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">Compared to some regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, our results showed a much lower acceptance rate of MC amongst the general population, likely due to a lack of history and cultural norms regarding MC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. In pooled data from thirteen studies encompassing nine countries in Sub-Sahara Africa, the median proportion of uncircumcised men willing to become circumcised was 65% (range 29&#x02013;87%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. A similar study, based in South Africa, showed that through a local effort to scale up MC, 39.1% (14,011/35,851) male participants accepted MC over a 12-months follow-up period, equivalent to 701 people per month<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">A Cox&#x02019;s proportional hazards regression model of the data in our study suggested that Model A or Model B had significantly greater effects than Model C on improving knowledge of and willingness to accept MC. In addition, Model A significantly increased the proportion of participants who actually underwent MC surgery. These results indicate that a multi-staged intervention that gradually reinforced knowledge through educational materials and volunteer and expert-led discussions has a much greater effective on promoting behavior change of male participants in Western China. The involvement of peers, partners, and medical college students likely played an important role in encouraging participants to retain and internalize knowledge on MC and to take action on seeking MC surgery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par30">While this study reveals some important information regarding the effectiveness of educational interventions on increasing acceptance and uptake of MC, there were several limitations to this study. First, the 9-month follow-up time of our program was very short, and thus greatly limited our ability to accurately assess the impact of MC on acquisition of HIV or other STIs. As a result, during the follow-up period of our study, no participants acquired HIV infection. In addition, the incidence of syphilis was very low, and therefore there were no significant findings between the MC group and non-MC groups. Furthermore, one possible reason for our results were not strongly consistent with other studies because of the huge difference in HIV prevalence between China (~0.06%) and other countries such as Kenya (&#x0003e;2.5%)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. A randomized controlled trial in Kisumu, Kenya showed that the 2-year HIV incidence rates were 2.1% (95% CI: 1.2&#x02013;3.0) in the circumcision group and 4.2% (95% CI: 3.0&#x02013;5.4) in the control group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. The results in our study need to be confirmed by further research with a longer follow-up time after MC to assess the incidence rates of HIV and other STIs. Additionally, measurement of the knowledge on MC relied on self-report and was likely impacted by social desirability, which could result in under or over-reporting. Nevertheless, there was no a priori expectation for the direction in which this might occur, nor any suggestion that this should differ between different intervention models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. Finally, in order to prevent contamination between the different interventions models within the same site, we performed cluster randomization rather than individual randomization, in which the entire group of participants at each study site was allocated randomly into one of the three intervention models.</p><p id="Par31">We believe that the conditions for large HIV epidemics are ripe within this demographic of Western China, and investigations into effective, feasible, and sustainable interventions should be of high priority. Combined with the large increase in transmission attributable to heterosexual intercourse, there is a significant need for interventions focused on prevention of sexual transmission in this region.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Bo Zhou, Chuanyi Ning and Chase D.
