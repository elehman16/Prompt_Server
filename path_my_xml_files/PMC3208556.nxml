The study was approved by The Ethical Committee of Copenhagen County and the Danish Medicines Agency. The study was carried out according to the Helsinki Declaration.</p><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026904.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0026904.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Design</title><p>The study was carried out in a randomized, open-label, cross-over design comparing an 8-week control period with an 8-week period of once-daily administration of eplerenone. Randomization was done by the principal investigator drawing sealed opaque envelopes. Patients were either allocated to start in the intervention period followed by the control period or vice versa with no wash-out period in between.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study Participants</title><p>Inclusion criteria were: age &#x0003e;18 years, persistent 24 hour proteinuria, initially planned as &#x0003e;2000 mg, but after inclusion of the first patient changed to &#x0003e;500 mg or albuminuria &#x0003e;300 mg, BP&#x0003e;130/80 mmHg or ongoing stable antihypertensive treatment, including RAS-blockade. There was no demand for ongoing RAS-blocking therapy.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: diabetic nephropathy, creatinine clearance &#x0003c;20 mL/min, plasma (p-) potassium &#x0003e;5.0 mEq/l, allergy to aldosterone antagonists, chronic liver insufficiency, ongoing treatment with CYP3A4-inhibitors, lithium or immunosuppressive agents including steroids, invalidating psychiatric disorders, other severe non-renal disease, woman of childbearing potential not using safe contraception, pregnancy or breast-feeding. Patients were recruited from and followed in the outpatient clinics of the two participating departments. All patients were seen by the principal investigator.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Eplerenone treatment was initiated by a once daily oral dose of 25 mg administered as add-on treatment to ongoing therapy. The dose was doubled after one week to 50 mg once daily for seven weeks. Patients were seen at weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10, 12 and 16. The BP goal was &#x0003c;130/80 mmHg. In case of symptomatic hypotension, reductions were primarily made in non-RAS-blocking antihypertensive agents and in case of BP above target non-RAS-blocking agents were added. Main outcome variables were albuminuria based on single 24 hour urine samples collected for every visit, fractional excretion of albumin, BP, p-potassium, and creatinine clearance, which were measured at each visit.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Safety and withdrawal criteria</title><p>Potassium supplements were withdrawn before initiation of eplerenone treatment. There were no dietary restrictions at trial entry. Withdrawal criteria were any CV event, serious non-renal disease, a persistent rise in p-creatinine above 30% of baseline value, persistent hyperkalaemia, defined as p-potassium &#x0003e;5.5 mEq/L at two successive visits, or pregnancy despite safe contraception.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Clinical and biochemical methods</title><p>BP was measured using the mercury sphygmomanometer auscultatory method. Cuff width was selected according to arm circumference. BP measurements were done after 5&#x02013;10 minutes of rest in the sitting position. Analysis of urinary albumin was done by immunoturbidimetry with antibodies from Dako A/S (Konelab PRIME 60), inter-series coefficient of variation (CV) 2% at Herlev Hospital and Tinaquant from Roche (Roche Modular), inter-series CV 10%, at Rigshospitalet.</p><p>P-creatinine was analyzed by the enzymatic method, MDRD-IDMS calibrated (Vitros 5.1), inter-series CV 2% at Herlev Hospital and by Roche Modular Enzymatic method, MDRD-IDMS calibrated, inter-series CV 2.1% at Rigshospitalet.</p><p>Fractional albumin excretion was calculated according to the following formula:<disp-formula><graphic xlink:href="pone.0026904.e001.jpg" mimetype="image" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></disp-formula>Compliance was monitored by tablet counts at the end of eplerenone treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistics</title><p>A reduction of albuminuria of 25% was considered as the minimal clinically relevant response to eplerenone treatment. Sample size was estimated to be a total of 40 patients, (power 0.8 and level of significance 0.05). Data are presented as mean and standard deviations (SD). Where data were not normally distributed, logarithmic transformations were made and these data are presented as well as geometric means with 95% confidence intervals [CI]. Changes in logarithmic transformed parameters were calculated as ratios and additionally shown in percent.</p><p>The treatment effects were calculated by the paired samples t-test, using the mean value of the variable over all four visits in each period &#x02013; i.e. control and treatment. Analyses of values at individual visits were done as a secondary end-point. Before analyzing treatment effect, analyses of carry-over and time effect were made. To test for carry-over effect, we conducted a two-sample t-test between the two randomization groups using the mean value of each subject. For time effect a paired samples t-test was conducted comparing values for each patient at the two different time periods. Two-way ANOVA was used for testing the treatment effect on urinary albumin excretion when adjusting for creatinine clearance and systolic BP. One-way ANOVA was used for testing differences in response to treatment, when level of RAS-blockade or baseline creatinine clearance was taken into account. Evaluation of significance over multiple periods was done by repeated measure ANOVA. Comparisons of data from individual visits were corrected for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. Since only baseline data were tested against data from each of the four following visits, correction was made by multiplying the P-values by four. When applying correction for multiple testing the corrected P-values are shown. All P-values were two-sided and P-values&#x0003c;0.05 were regarded as significant. All confidence intervals are two-sided 95% CI. The statistical analyses were done using the SPSS statistical software, version 17.0 and R statistical software version 2.12.1, 2011, R Foundation for Statistical Software, Vienna, Austria.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Forty-two patients were included in the study. One was included by mistake fulfilling the exclusion criterion of serious non-renal disease and was withdrawn after the first visit. Another patient was withdrawn due to non-compliance with the urinary collections. Thus, the statistical analysis comprises forty patients. Two patients were withdrawn before completion, one due to myocardial infarction (control period, study week 10) and one due to insomnia (treatment period, study week 14). Data from these two participants were averaged for the visits they had completed. Thirty-eight patients completed the full study protocol; one patient did not tolerate 50 mg eplerenone, as described below in the safety results. All patients demonstrated very good compliance, assessed by tablet counts. The trial was initiated in April 2007 and completed and ended as planned in August 2009.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Renal diagnoses were based on previous renal biopsies in chronic glomerulonephritis (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;26), specified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0026904-t001">table 1</xref>, and in vascular disease (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2).

Thus, in 40 CKD patients, add-on of eplerenone to stable antihypertensive treatment including RAS-blockade for eight weeks caused a 22% reduced excretion of urinary albumin compared to a control period. BP and creatinine clearance were slightly lower during the eplerenone period, but even after correction for that the urinary albumin excretion was significantly lower during treatment. The validity of the present observation rests on the randomized design of the study. The cross-over design was chosen in order to minimize the influence of heterogeneity between subjects and the lack of placebo control. The absence of a carry-over effect from eplerenone to control confirmed that no wash-out period after eplerenone was necessary.</p><p>Reduction in albuminuria during aldosterone blockade in the present study was less than that observed in the earlier studies. Despite this, it is relevant to consider addition of eplerenone in CKD patients on RAS-blockade, due to the fact that residual proteinuria influences the prognosis for proteinuric CKD <xref rid="pone.0026904-Ruggenenti2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>The antiproteinuric effect of eplerenone has previously only been reported in patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria and in patients with essential hypertension <xref rid="pone.0026904-Epstein2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0026904-White1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.

Second, all our patients had overt albuminuria, while some of the patients in the earlier studies were selected to have microalbuminuria and many had normal renal function.

In a recently published study of diabetic patients with a UACR&#x02265;300 mg/g creatinine treatment was initially a supramaximal dose of ACEi. Spironolactone or an ARB was added for 48 weeks.

The present study contributes to demonstrate eplerenone as an alternative to treatment with spironolactone and as a treatment alternative to patients who do not tolerate ACE-inhibition due to side effects.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The group of patients studied were not homogeneous with respect to baseline albuminuria and renal diagnoses. There were no requirements to baseline therapy or run-in period. The study was not designed to detect a difference in response to eplerenone based on the baseline RAS-blocking treatment. It was an open label design and a relatively small sample size, which limits the extent to which results should be generalized. The statistical analyses were based on samples from all visits which were given equal weight in the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Eplerenone in a dose of 25&#x02013;50 mg daily is a safe and relevant add-on therapy in patients with non-diabetic CKD when aiming at a reduction in urinary albumin excretion. The potential risk of hyperkalaemia, especially in daily practice outside the setting of a controlled trial, should be kept in mind. Long-term studies need to be designed in order to assess the question of whether the effect of eplerenone on the reduction in urinary albumin excretion is persistent, and whether the progression rate of CKD is reduced.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0026904.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
