The prices of genetic tests are dropping faster than Moore&#x02019;s law for computing costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This leads the focus to shift from cost of genetic testing to the clinical value of individual gene tests. The recent development of gene-based tests that predicts the risk of lung cancer in smokers is an important example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Despite the well accepted 10-15% probability of lung cancer in smokers, 50% of smokers do not believe they are at significantly increased risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, over 80% of smokers would like to know their personal risk of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is a plausible three way link between biomarkers for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a set of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with cancer risk and lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Research has shown a strong association between a high lung cancer susceptibility score derived from family history of cancer, the 20 SNPs, COPD history (Auckland formula) and the development of lung cancers whereas healthy smokers matched for age, gender and lifetime smoking habits had a relatively low score (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;446 lung cancer subjects, 484 healthy current smokers). The odds ratio for lung cancer risk varied from 0.2-3.2 depending on the genetic risk (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The accuracy of the Auckland formula in estimating lung cancer risk for a score of &#x0003e;4 was: sensitivity 90%, specificity 45% (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> which also includes scores for 52 subjects who developed cancer from a six year prospective study of 1212 smokers and ex-smokers). The score for prediction of non-cancer was conducted with a follow up of just six years. It means that 45% of non-cancer subjects have a low cancer score and 55% have some degree of increased score. The 55% with increased scores have simply not been followed up long enough for lung cancers to develop yet. Notwithstanding this limitation there is now a 20 SNP gene test for prediction of lung cancer in smokers under the trade name <italic>Respiragene</italic>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Research that established the respiragene test.</bold> Distribution of the Respiragene score in a cross-sectional study of 484 control smokers (blue) and 446 with lung cancer (red) (Total&#x02009;=&#x02009;930) and from the prospective study of 52 lung cancer cases (green).

A small smoking cessation pilot study using spirometry results and explanations using the Fletcher-Peto diagram to explain risk demonstrated that patients find this is an acceptable method and the quit rate at 12 months was 27% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In a randomised control trial patients were given either a full explanation of the results of spirometry testing, including an estimation of lung age or just their forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), without explanation (control group). The group of patients who were given the full explanation had a 7.2% higher quit rate than the control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Data from a hospital outpatient cohort in Auckland suggest a larger increase in quit rate with <italic>Respiragene</italic> test and the Auckland formula (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Subjects, who were current smokers in the pre-contemplative and contemplative stage, were randomised into either the test group or control group and only the test group had the <italic>Respiragene test</italic>. Counselling and follow-up was done by telephone. Using Auckland formula to incorporate the results of the <italic>Respiragene</italic> test, clinical data and family history a score ranging 1-12 with associated risk level (moderate risk, high risk, very high risk) was calculated and explained to test subjects. Neither group were involved in any formal smoking cessation programme. Indeed, of the 13 subjects that had managed to stop smoking, (28% of the gene-tested group), 48% quit without any medical assistance and only 52% had nicotine replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. When compared with previous studies using telephone counselling alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), there is a 20-25% improvement in smoking cessation with the <italic>Respiragene</italic> test (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The improvement in intention to quit increases from 56% before testing to 67% in smokers with an average smokers risk of lung cancer or 89% in smokers with a high risk of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Respiragene study in Auckland NZ (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;43)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>Cancer susceptibility scale (compared with normal lifetime risk)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Cancer susceptibility score</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Estimated lifetime risk of lung cancer</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Initial intention to quit</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Proportion that stopped smoking at 2-4&#x000a0;weeks</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Proportion still not smoking at 6&#x000a0;months</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Expected result for telephone counselling (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15%<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">41%<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10-20%<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">9-12%<hr/></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="left">Telephone counselling&#x02009;+&#x02009;Respiragene test</td><td rowspan="2" align="left">1-2.3 (10-35% risk) 2.3-6.7 (35-65% risk) 6.7-8 (65%-80% risk)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">27 had average risk score<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">15%<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">67%<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8/27 (30%)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">8 (30%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">16 had high or very high risk score</td><td align="left">30-50% (4-10 times average risk)</td><td align="left">89%</td><td align="left">10/16 (63%)</td><td align="left">6 (37.5%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Smoking cessation after Respiragene testing and estimation of lung cancer risk with telephone counselling in a small pilot study in Auckland NZ (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;43) compared with expected quit rate.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Efficacy of the variety of smoking cessation strategies.</bold> Percent increase of success for six months over unaided attempts for each type of quitting (chart from West &#x00026; Shiffman based on Cochrane review data).

It will differ from previous studies using gene testing as a motivator, however, in that the NHS primary care counselling and prescribing protocol will include several other motivators (CO breath testing, saliva cotinine testing and intensive counselling) whereas the Auckland trial, using the same gene test, had none of these.

Two case-control studies showing only a 5-10% increase in smoking cessation involved just a single gene of small effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In a randomised control trial patients were given either a full explanation of the results of spirometry testing, including an estimation of lung age or just the FEV1, without explanation (control group). The group of patients who were given the full explanation had a 7.2% higher quit rate than the control group. However, data from Auckland suggest a larger uplift of quit rate with <italic>Respiragene.</italic> This can be explained by the superior predictive power of a 20-gene test combined with clinical history (personal history of COPD and family history of lung cancer) to give a rather more impressive estimate of cancer risk than anything previously available.</p><p>The adequacy of sample size was tested using data from smoking cessation trials that showed:</p><p>&#x02022;30-40% smoking cessation at 6-months with similar protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>&#x02022;A 48% quit rate at 2-4&#x000a0;weeks in subjects with high and very high lung cancer risk scores but this difference shrinks to 27% at 6&#x000a0;months.</p><p>&#x02022;Data from Young et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (independently verified by McBride et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]) that even being given an average score for lung cancer susceptibility increases smoking cessation by approximately 10%.</p><p>Therefore, with a minimum sample sizes of 30 per group the following calculations based on these estimated quit rates apply (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

However many smokers are very reluctant to commit to a smoking cessation programme (precontemplative and contemplative) and about half of those that attend for smoking cessation intervention (action stage of change) are likely to drop out or give up trying. Therefore, any methodology that increases motivation in both unmotivated and motivated smokers could be very valuable. The gene-based test we are offering has shown promise as a smoking cessation motivator in precontemplative-contemplative smokers in a hospital outpatient setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and now needs to be tested out as a motivator for improving adherence in a primary care smoking cessation clinic using a randomised controlled study.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths</title><p>The main strengths of this study are that it is being carried out on subjects from a large primary care population and should therefore be more representative of the general population than previous studies recruited from hospital patients and other special groups. We also have the advantage of being able to carry out this research within the established framework of the local stop smoking service.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and assumptions</title><p>Although we have estimated, based on previous smoking cessation work using this gene-based test, that the primary endpoint will show that having the test improves quit rate by 20-25%, this was based on a cohort of hospital outpatients in Auckland, New Zealand and subjects recruited from primary care may respond differently. Although we plan to recruit a minimum of 60 subjects, this may not be enough to balance unexpected and unknown confounding factors.</p></sec><sec><title>What we might find</title><p>We aim to recruit a minimum of 60 subjects to randomise 30 into group A (test group) and 30 into Group B (control group). The normal experience in NHS smoking cessation clinics is a drop-out rate of 40-50% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. We need, therefore, to attempt to recruit about 120 subjects in order to get a statistically significant result, based on the assumptions in our power calculations. We may, however, have underestimated the 6-month quit rate using the NHS local stop smoking guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] which typically involves a multi-interventional programme which includes combinations of varenicline prescriptions, breath carbon monoxide monitoring and intensive counselling giving a quit rate of 70-80% at 6-weeks.There are however no Surrey data for 6-month quit rate which we assume, on the basis of similar smoking cessation data to be about half the 6-week figure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] &#x02245; 35%.</p><p>An unknown and unpredictable factor, that could skew results significantly, is the possibility that our multi-interventional approach could help to reinforce the health risk message equally for subjects in both groups. Also, the Auckland study design involved recruitment of precontemplative-contemplative smokers from a hospital outpatient setting, compared to this study that will involve primary care subjects who have volunteered to participate in a smoking cessation programme (ie smokers in the action stage of quitting). This population, therefore, could be sufficiently different to give unexpected results. However, the results of this trial will inform as to the acceptability of this approach as well as its effectiveness.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>CONSORT: Consolidated statement of reporting trials; COPD: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid; NHS: National health service UK; SNP: Single nucleotide polymorphism; SAE: Stamped addresses envelope.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>JN and PG are in receipt of research grants from Lab 21, Cambridge who are marketing the Respiragene test in the UK and Synergenz Bioscience Ltd. who financed the development of the test from its origins in New Zealand.
