In the absence of adequate treatment, acromegaly is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The goals of therapy are to control the levels of both GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), reduce and/or stabilize tumor size, preserve pituitary function and prevent recurrence. A recent consensus statement on the management of acromegaly advocates reducing GH and IGF-1 levels to as close to normal as possible (GH &#x0003c;1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L [using an ultrasensitive assay] and IGF-1 within the normal range for age and sex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Earlier studies measuring GH by radioimmunoassay indicated that suppression of random GH to &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L and normalization of IGF-1 levels are associated with restoration of mortality to that of a standard population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Somatostatin analogues are the mainstay of medical therapy for patients with acromegaly who have not achieved biochemical control after transsphenoidal surgery. They can also be used as first-line treatment when the chance of surgical cure is low (invasive macroadenomas), when surgery is contraindicated, or for patients who refuse surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, many patients do not achieve biochemical control with first-generation somatostatin analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In those patients who do not fully respond to somatostatin analogue monotherapy, recent clinical practice guidelines have advocated the addition of a dopamine agonist (cabergoline) or a GH receptor antagonist (pegvisomant) to somatostatin analogue treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Pasireotide, a multireceptor-targeted somatostatin analogue, was rationally designed with a broader somatostatin receptor (SSTR) binding profile than first-generation somatostatin analogues to achieve higher response rates. In a large, randomized, double-blind, Phase III trial (core phase of this study), pasireotide long-acting release (LAR) was significantly superior to octreotide LAR at providing GH &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L and normal IGF-1 at month 12 in medically na&#x000ef;ve patients with acromegaly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The extension phase described here allowed patients with inadequate biochemical control at month 12 to switch treatment at month 13 (ie from octreotide LAR to pasireotide LAR or vice versa). This manuscript reports the efficacy and safety results at the end of the crossover extension phase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Extension study: patients could cross over or continue</title><p>This was a planned double-blind extension study to a 12-month, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, Phase III trial (the core study).

Gadolinium-enhanced pituitary magnetic resonance imaging was performed at extension baseline and 12&#x000a0;months after crossover and evaluated by a central reader blinded to treatment. A pituitary tumor volume change of &#x02265;20&#x000a0;% from extension baseline was considered significant.

None of the patients who switched from pasireotide LAR to octreotide LAR achieved biochemical control 12&#x000a0;months after crossover. These results suggest that pasireotide LAR may be a promising therapeutic alternative in patients uncontrolled with octreotide LAR.</p><p>It is important to note that this extension phase was not designed to detect statistically significant differences between treatment groups. The crossover phase was undertaken to provide additional information on the efficacy and safety of pasireotide LAR and to provide insights into whether non-responders to octreotide LAR or pasireotide LAR may benefit from switching to the opposite therapy. The results reported here support the findings from a recent 24-week, randomized, Phase III study (PAOLA; NCT01137682), which was specifically designed to evaluate the response to pasireotide LAR in patients with acromegaly who were inadequately controlled despite &#x02265;6&#x000a0;months&#x02019; treatment with either octreotide LAR or lanreotide Autogel. In this study, a significantly higher proportion of patients achieved biochemical control with pasireotide LAR versus continued treatment with octreotide LAR or lanreotide Autogel at week 24 (15.4&#x000a0;%/20.0&#x000a0;% versus 0&#x000a0;%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0006 and <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Given the rarity of acromegaly, few prospective trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of medical therapies in a large number of patients with acromegaly. The results from this crossover phase (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;119) of a large Phase III trial provide a valuable contribution to the existing literature.</p><p>In this Phase III study, biochemical control of acromegaly was defined according to targets recommended by clinical consensus guidelines at the time of study initiation (GH &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L and normal IGF-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. More recently, clinical practice guidelines have advocated reducing GH levels to &#x0003c;1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L (using a modern ultrasensitive assay) in the presence of normal IGF-1 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is, therefore, possible that some patients who were considered to be biochemically controlled in this study may not have achieved the more stringent criteria for biochemical control of acromegaly.</p><p>Pasireotide LAR is significantly (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.007) superior to octreotide LAR at providing GH &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L and normal IGF-1 in patients who have not previously received medical treatment for acromegaly, as shown in the core study. The larger proportion of patients with biochemical control in the pasireotide LAR arm was driven by the higher rate of IGF-1 normalization seen with pasireotide LAR (38.6&#x000a0;% versus 23.6&#x000a0;%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A similar finding was seen 12&#x000a0;months after switching treatments, with 27.2&#x000a0;% of pasireotide LAR patients and 5.3&#x000a0;% of octreotide LAR patients achieving normal IGF-1. This difference may be due to the broader SSTR binding profile of pasireotide versus octreotide LAR, coupled with the potential role of SSTRs in the disruption of GH signaling on hepatic cells and, subsequently, IGF-1 transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In rodents, activation of hepatic SSTR2 and SSTR3 has been shown to downregulate IGF-1 transcription by inactivation of GH-induced signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. As pasireotide would bind with high affinity to both SSTR2 and SSTR3 in the liver, the superiority of pasireotide in normalizing IGF-1 levels may be explained by this proposed mechanism, although studies are required to substantiate this suggestion. Receptor subtype profiling to determine the relative expression of each SSTR was not performed in the current study.</p><p>Interestingly, of the 81 patients who switched from octreotide LAR to pasireotide LAR, 34 had GH &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L (but not IGF-1 normalization) at month 12 of octreotide LAR therapy, and 36 had GH &#x0003c;2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L (with or without IGF-1 normalization) 12&#x000a0;months after switching to pasireotide LAR therapy. This finding is consistent with the core study result that the two drugs have a similar effect on GH, but that pasireotide LAR has a greater effect on reducing IGF-1 levels. The similar SSTR2 binding affinity of pasireotide and octreotide may be the mechanism underlying these parallel GH findings and supports the previously established finding that IGF-1 is the driver of the superior efficacy of pasireotide LAR.</p><p>A few patients entered the crossover phase before a protocol amendment was implemented; these patients received open-label pasireotide LAR (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) during the crossover phase. As a result, there is a possibility of bias in favor of pasireotide LAR for this small subset of patients. Patients who completed the core study before the amendment could not receive octreotide LAR in the extension phase, either as continued therapy or by switching therapy; this feature may have contributed to the imbalance in crossover cohort numbers. Patient records were reviewed retrospectively and it was estimated that 14 additional patients may have been eligible to cross over to octreotide LAR if the protocol revision had been made earlier. It is unknown if these patients would have entered the crossover extension and/or achieved an improved response.</p><p>The crossover phase of this large Phase III trial provided the opportunity to examine the safety profile of pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR after switching medical therapies. After crossover, the safety profiles of pasireotide LAR and octreotide LAR were similar to those seen in the core study; pasireotide LAR has a similar safety profile to that of octreotide LAR, except for a greater frequency and degree of hyperglycemia-related AEs. This study suggests that the hyperglycemia associated with pasireotide LAR is reversible, as fasting plasma glucose and HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels declined rapidly in patients who were switched from pasireotide LAR to octreotide LAR. However, further investigation is needed to confirm this. It has recently been shown in healthy volunteers that while pasireotide inhibits insulin secretion and incretin response and suppresses glucagon levels to a more modest degree, it does not affect insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Patients receiving pasireotide treatment should be closely monitored for changes in glucose homeostasis, with antidiabetic medication initiated promptly if hyperglycemia occurs. Based on the results of mechanistic studies in healthy volunteers, a panel of experts have recently recommended that hyperglycemia associated with pasireotide in patients with Cushing&#x02019;s disease should be managed by the following staged intensification of antidiabetic treatment until glycemic control is achieved: (i) initiation of metformin; (ii) addition of a DPP-4 inhibitor; (iii) switch from the DPP-4 inhibitor to a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist; (iv) initiation of insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Given the relationship between pasireotide and hyperglycemia, these recommendations may also be applicable to patients with acromegaly.</p><p>Pegvisomant, a GH receptor antagonist, is currently used in patients who have an inadequate response to maximal doses of somatostatin analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Initial results of pegvisomant in patients with acromegaly (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;160) showed that normal IGF-1 levels were achieved in 87 of the 90 (97&#x000a0;%) patients who received pegvisomant for at least 12&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Results from the ACROSTUDY registry have demonstrated that pegvisomant, as either mono- or combination therapy, provides IGF-1 normalization in ~63&#x000a0;% of patients after 5&#x000a0;years of treatment in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, in a recent study, combined treatment with pegvisomant and long-acting somatostatin analogues normalized IGF-1 levels in 97&#x000a0;% of patients who were uncontrolled with somatostatin analogues alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Interestingly, in addition to its IGF-1-lowering effect, pegvisomant may also improve glucose homeostasis in patients with diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, pegvisomant does not target the pituitary tumor and has no effect on tumor volume. In the current study, tumor volume decreased further during the 12&#x000a0;months of the extension study in both groups, with significant tumor volume reduction demonstrated in nearly half of all patients who participated in the extension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of this study, which support those from the recent PAOLA study, suggest that pasireotide LAR may be an effective treatment option in patients with acromegaly who are inadequately controlled with first-generation somatostatin analogues.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12902_2016_96_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Appendix.
