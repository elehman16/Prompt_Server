To be effective, however, the prong has to be maintained in place in a way that it can deliver the positive distending pressure to the upper airway with minimal leak.</p><p>Several NCPAP devices are available, but all can cause nasal trauma. Damage to the skin often is mild and resolves with the cessation of NCPAP but may be a cause of unexplained septicemia in the preterm population. More significant trauma can result in permanent disfigurement and long-term functional sequelae.</p><p>Heated Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannulae (HHHFNC) seems to be well tolerated in patients and easy to apply, leading to increased use around the world.

Two infants assigned to HHHFNC and seven assigned to NCPAP were changed to nasal intermittent mandatory ventilation (NIMV). At parental request, one infant's therapy was changed from NCPAP to HHHFNC; consent was retained for the use of primary outcome data.</p><p>A total of 13 (20%) of infants assigned to NCPAP were changed to HHHFNC as the result of nasal trauma in the first 7 days after extubation. These infants had a mean nasal trauma score of 22 (SD 10.1) compared with a mean score of 7.4 (SD 6.7) in those who remained on NCPAP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and a mean score of 3.1 (SD 7.2) in those assigned to HHHFNC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>There was no difference in the rates of extubation failure between infants randomized to HHHFNC or NCPAP in the first 7 days after extubation. However, HHHFNC was associated with significantly less nasal trauma compared with NCPAP.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>COMMENTARY</title><p>Evidence is accumulating addressing the efficacy of HHHFNC utilization in the management of preterm infants. To date, most of the studies comparing NCPAP to HHHFNC were of small size and included larger preterm infants.</p><p>Evidence suggests the HHHFNC is comparable to NCPAP as a weaning method off conventional ventilation. The largest study to date was conducted in Australia and presented at the Pediatric Academic Society (PAS) meeting, 2013 in Washington DC. The study included 300 preterm infants. HHHFNC was found to be noninferior to NCPAP for extubation failure in VLBW infants. The study failed to show noninferiority for infants less than 26 weeks. This new method of respiratory support in preterm infants was found to be more convenient to apply and results in less nasal trauma as compared with NCPAP.</p><p>We believe that evidence is still not conclusive especially for the smallest preterm infants less than 26 weeks and that more data are needed. A head to head comparison of the two available devices with regard to efficacy is also needed.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Abstracted from</title><p>Collins CL, Holberton JR, Barfield C, Davis PG.
