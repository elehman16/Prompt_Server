Physical activity (PA) is associated with improved physical and mental well-being among children and young people.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref> A number of studies have shown that large proportions of young people do not engage in the recommended hour of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) per day.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Girls are often found to be less active than boys across childhood and adolescence and, as such, there is a need for interventions to encourage more PA in girls, particularly during the transition into adolescence when the decline in female PA is at its highest.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6&#x02013;8</xref> Girls tend to be more sedentary and also engage in less MVPA than boys.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> A study examining barriers faced by girls to PA suggests that safety concerns, the competitive nature of many activities, inaccessible facilities and body-image concerns are key perceived barriers to girls being active.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Additionally, girls face more restrictions than boys in terms of their freedom to play outdoors.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Dance is an activity that could resolve a number of these barriers and as such it is popular among adolescent girls in the UK, and could therefore be an appropriate activity to increase girls&#x02019; PA.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref></p><p>Schools are a good place to target interventions as attendance is a legal requirement. PA interventions delivered during the school-day have had limited effect,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> suggesting a need to consider alternative school-based interventions.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Pate and O'Neill<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> suggest that the quest for academic excellence combined with resource limitations restricts opportunities for PA within the school day. Several systematic reviews have highlighted the potential of extracurricular PA interventions for young people, however, there is a lack of robust evaluations of these programmes.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Incorporating dance into after-school activities could contribute to overall PA among girls failing to achieve the recommended UK PA guidelines.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> As such, the Bristol Girls Dance Project (BGDP) examined the potential of an after-school dance-based intervention targeted at increasing PA levels of Year 7 (age 11&#x02013;12) girls.</p><p>A feasibility trial was conducted to assess the potential of a dance-based intervention.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> This formative work found that it was possible to recruit adolescent girls to an after-school dance intervention and that such an intervention could yield positive effects on their PA. The process evaluation reported fluctuating attendance and low perceived exertion levels within sessions. Additionally, post-intervention qualitative work suggested that a reduction in the time allocated for &#x02018;creative&#x02019; tasks, better behaviour management guidance, and exposure to a wider range of dance styles would improve the intervention.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The intervention was refined in light of these findings and tested in a fully powered cluster randomised controlled trial,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> on which the present paper reports.</p><p>BGDP was a 20-week school-based two-armed cluster randomised control trial. The intervention consisted of two 75&#x02005;min after-school dance sessions per week for Year 7 (11&#x02013;12&#x02005;years) girls in the intervention arm. Intervention sessions were delivered by professional dance instructors who attended training led by study staff. The training introduced instructors to the study aims and rationale, the BGDP intervention sessions and the underpinning Self-Determination Theory (SDT).<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Session plans underpinning the BGDP sessions encouraged dance instructors to use a variety of dance styles throughout the course of the intervention (encouraging participant choice in this was strongly encouraged).</p><p>The BGDP aimed to increase autonomous motivation for dance and PA among participants. The dance instructor training and BGDP session plan manual were integral to this aim. The SDT-focused element of the training explored the practical application of the theory to dance sessions. Instructors were provided the opportunity to use autonomy-supportive styles of instruction, seek clarification and obtain feedback from study staff. Behaviour management was discussed and further details included in the session plan manual. Halfway through the intervention period the instructors attended a half-day booster session that recapped study aims, the application of SDT in sessions, and provided a forum to discuss issues that arose during session delivery.</p><p>Full details of the trial protocol<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and results have been published elsewhere (R Jago, M J Edwards, S J Sebire, <italic>et al</italic>. Effect and cost of an after-school dance programme on the physical activity of 11&#x02013;12year old girls: the Bristol girls dance project school-based cluster randomised controlled trial. <italic>Int J Behav Nutr Phys</italic> Under review). Briefly however, there was no difference in PA levels between the intervention and control group girls during the last few weeks of the intervention or at 6-month follow-up. Findings reported elsewhere showed that intervention fidelity was generally good, with high levels of enjoyment among participants (S J Sebire, M J Edwards, J M Keston, <italic>et al</italic>. Process evaluation of the Bristol girls dance project. <italic>BMC Public Health</italic> Under review). However, session attendance was highly variable with only one-third of girls attending two-thirds of the sessions. Attendance also declined during the project.</p><p>Process evaluations are central to understanding how complex interventions work<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> by focusing on the processes of intervention delivery, receipt and fidelity.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> When they are too narrowly focused, however, they can neglect to evaluate the broader contextual factors associated with individual agency, and the social context in which an intervention is delivered.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It is important to understand how logistical arrangements, operations and implementation of intervention components contribute to intervention processes, and to also acknowledge the influence of dance instructors delivering the intervention in a specific context. Thus, there is a need to identify factors that enable effective intervention delivery and establish how these factors can be influenced. The aim of this paper is to use qualitative process evaluation data to document the lessons learnt from the BGDP and to identify key points for improvement that may increase attendance rates and improve overall delivery of future after-school school-based PA interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Eighteen schools participated in the study. All schools were located within 25 miles of Bristol city centre, and fell under the Bristol City, Bath and North East Somerset, or North Somerset Council areas. Schools were urban and suburban and in terms of deprivation they were slightly less deprived than the national average. Between 6.9% and 53.3% (average=26.2%) of pupils in study schools were eligible for the &#x02018;pupil premium&#x02019;, a form of governmental funding aimed at increasing the attainment of disadvantaged pupils (higher percentage equals greater deprivation).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The national average is 27.8% of secondary pupils. Four of the nine intervention schools had above average levels of deprivation.</p><p>All Year 7 girls eligible to take part in physical education were invited to participate (n=1877). There was space for 33 girls to take part in each school. Recruitment consisted of a &#x02018;taster&#x02019; session that provided exposure to a typical intervention session, a briefing, and written information for girls and parents/guardians. Six hundred and thirty three girls returned parental consent forms, of which 571 were selected at random (due to the maximum limit of 33 girls per school). Participants completed four sets of measurements (accelerometer, psychosocial questionnaire and height and weight) at three time-points (baseline, T1 (end of intervention period), and T2 (baseline+52&#x02005;weeks)). Girls received a &#x000a3;10 thank you voucher for completing each measurement stage. Schools were randomised to control (n=9) or intervention (n=9) arm after baseline measures, with 284 girls in the intervention and 287 in the control arm.</p><p>The present study draws on interview data collected soon after the intervention ended from dance instructors (n=10) who delivered the intervention and school contacts (n=9) who facilitated intervention logistics in their school. School contacts were the study team's main point of contact with the school. These individuals were four physical education (PE) staff, one Year 7 teacher, three dance teachers and one drama teacher. Nine focus groups were conducted with girls that received the intervention (n=59, range=3&#x02013;8). Ten girls from each intervention school, reflecting different tertiles of attendance, were invited. This was in order to capture a range of participant views. Girls who attended &#x02264;3 sessions were not included as they would be unable to answer a significant proportion of the topic guide questions. Further details of participant sampling, recruitment and reasons for why children stopped attending intervention sessions are reported elsewhere (S J Sebire, <italic>et al</italic>. Under review). For dance instructors, interviews explored views on the implementation and dissemination of BGDP. School contact interviews focused on how the intervention was delivered and areas for improvement. Focus groups among girls explored motivations to participate, dance instructor teaching style, and experiences of the intervention. Interview guides are included as online supplementary files 1&#x02013;3 for participant focus groups, dance instructors and school contact interviews, respectively. School contact interviews and participant focus groups were conducted in schools and dance instructor interviews were conducted in convenient locations for participants (eg, cafes). All interviews and focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were compared with the recordings and amended as necessary.</p><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the School for Policy Studies ethics and research committee at the University of Bristol. Written parental consent was obtained for all children who participated in the study and informed consent was gained from the dance instructors and school contacts who participated. A CONSORT extension for Cluster Trials Checklist has been completed.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Analysis</title><p>A framework analysis was used.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The framework method is a seven stage procedure for analysing qualitative data, characterised by detailed line-by-line coding and the charting of data into a framework matrix.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Initial codes were created openly using NVivo (V.10, QSR International) to categorise transcripts into components that were of potential significance to the research objective. Codes were produced independently by four qualitative researchers (JMK, MJE, SJS and TM) who coded three transcripts each (one dance instructor, school contact and participant focus group). Initial codes formed a coding framework which was applied to the remaining transcripts. A predefined &#x02018;school context&#x02019; code was included to identify differences in delivery between schools. Frameworks were subsequently triangulated to substantiate the relationships between all three informant groups. The qualitative research team met weekly to discuss and iteratively refine the codes, which led to the production of the three coding frameworks (one for each respondent group). Illustrative quotes capturing the essence of each theme were identified and agreed by the researchers.

Any added burden on those delivering the intervention or school contacts should be given extensive consideration and avoided if possible</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Different methods of recruitment were required for each stakeholder group. Familiarity with participants taking part was important among school contacts providing the link between schools, dance instructors and the research team. This suggestion is pertinent given the complexities many school contacts faced when &#x02018;chasing&#x02019; research participants to encourage attendance (a task exacerbated by an unfamiliarity with the students). In future, it would be helpful to specify in detail what the role of school contact entails, highlighting the time needed for individual tasks and when they need to be completed (although over-burdening the contact with information should be treated with caution). Asking school contacts to allocate time for liaison with study staff/intervention deliverers may better prepare them for the role and improve delivery. For girls, targeting peer groups was considered sensible and a realistic method for attracting participants. Our findings also suggest that espousing the credentials of the project to instil a type of project &#x02018;privilege&#x02019; may provide a further incentive for participation. This finding is consistent with previous research that suggests it is useful to identify and garner the support of influential &#x02018;opinion makers&#x02019; to create a &#x02018;buzz&#x02019; around the study.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Such recruitment campaigns should be considered as part of the design of future after-school PA interventions.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Assigning self-employed dance instructors to schools can be logistically difficult as many work on short-term contracts and continuously bid for work. This makes attending two sessions per week over a 20-week period a difficult commitment. Indeed, one instructor had to be replaced mid-way through the intervention. We would advise recruiting a bank of reserve instructors to ensure cover is always available.</p><p>School contacts selected the days and start/end times for intervention sessions. Dance instructors were assigned to schools to proximity and availability on session days. Subsequently, however, many schools had competing after-school activities on the same day as intervention sessions. Additionally, some children and dance instructors reported about sessions starting too soon after the school day ends. As such, greater consideration needs to be given to the scheduling of sessions, with the study manager and school contacting working through a set of potentialities to find a convenient and protected time.</p><p>A number of participants suggested that the intervention intensity, both in terms of the number of sessions per week and the duration of the intervention period, may have been too great a commitment to sustain attendance and was somewhat discordant with usual school provision. One solution suggested by a school contact, was to implement the project in 5&#x02005;week modules where different dance styles are implemented in each block. As such, future projects may wish to employ structures that mimic usual school provision, and ensure intervention implementers and school staff deliver after-school interventions via this approach.</p><p>Open-enrolment was highlighted as an approach that may improve attendance and fluidity of delivery. However, it was noted that this would require dance instructors to carefully manage the dynamics of introducing new participants to the existing group, including the potential disruption this could cause. This suggestion is reasonable for mainstream delivery of the project, but the use of this strategy in a trial setting raises a problem in that participants receiving the intervention would change during the intervention period and, as such, intention-to-treat analyses would not be possible. This issue is therefore a reflection of broader debates in relation to the internal and external validity of public health interventions.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25&#x02013;27</xref> Although measures that maintain the rigour of a trial, such as limiting recruitment numbers, may increase internal validity, it may limit the external validity. Hence, although restricting the number of participants to those who signed up at baseline was a necessity, it may not reflect usual practice, whereby children are able to attend or &#x02018;drop-in&#x02019; to after-school clubs at times convenient to them. Further work examining the use of modified intervention design for real-world public health interventions may be warranted.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref></p><p>Future delivery of after-school PA interventions may benefit from a greater awareness of existing school events. Study staff may wish to ask schools for the current and previous year's schedule of activities and check this against the planned intervention sessions, in the hope of identifying any current or future overlaps. While this will not stop all withdrawals, it may reduce instances of children signing-up when they are likely to drop out at a later date (thus leaving space for children who may follow the intervention through to the end). Identifying prospective timings convenient to girls is significant, given the multiple challenges already associated with implementing PA interventions during school hours.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

Different dance styles appealed to different girls. While the programme set out to offer girls input into dance styles, music and pace of progression, the effectiveness of this approach relies on employing dance instructors who are willing and able to teach a range of dance styles. While this was largely the case in the BGDP, it is important that the recruitment of intervention deliverers ensures that their skills allow them to deliver the planned content <italic>and</italic> be flexible to input from the participant group. The group work component of the intervention was valued by participants and dance instructors as it fostered ownership of the project, helped the instructor cope with various levels of competence within the group, developed girls&#x02019; leadership skills and mitigated against inconsistent attendance. This finding is consistent with the broader literature associated with the principle of relatedness within Self Determination Theory.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>Parents were identified as an important source of support for behaviour change that was not utilised in this study.

The main school culture factors that appeared to affect the acceptability of the study were the school's organisational structure and communication between staff, the school's expectations of pupil behaviour and attendance, and the role of the school contact. When approaching schools to recruit participants, differences in attitudes were discernible from the outset, with some schools having a room booked and time set aside, and others forgetting the meeting had been arranged. Intervention logistics were also affected by distinct school cultures. Prior to recruitment, schools specified the days that intervention sessions would run so at the point of recruitment all girls knew the time and days on which they would receive dance sessions. In one case the school contact changed the days on which sessions ran. This school had the lowest average attendance, in part because many participants were not able to attend on the rescheduled day. Additionally, the same school contact set up a competing after-school club on the same day as the revised sessions. On paper, all schools encouraged consistent attendance, but in reality the expectations on girls varied widely between schools (Personal communication, S J Sebire, <italic>et al</italic>, 2016). Some school contacts expected girls to attend and were proactive in their approach in supporting them to do so. Others felt that their lack of familiarity with the girls made it difficult for them to encourage them, resulting in fewer, more ineffective attempts. All issues discussed above are reflective of the heterogeneity in the ethos of the participant schools. The findings highlight the fundamental importance of being aware of, and accounting for, the diversity of schools&#x02019; needs in planning after-school PA interventions.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>We encourage researchers to give greater consideration to the &#x02018;school context&#x02019;.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Determining what contextual factors are important for a given study are difficult to establish preintervention and any formal assessment of the impact of school context will be difficult. Researchers should keep field notes of interactions with school and record issues that facilitate or hinder the study and intervention. Such a pool of knowledge from different studies and contexts may be the foundations on which more formal assessments of school context can in the future be made.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>This study provides new information on factors which affect the delivery of after-school PA intervention. Although data used in this study are primarily focused on dance, we hope the findings will have future utility for researchers or practitioners operating within the broader field of PA interventions. A major strength of this research lies in the in-depth exploration of qualitative data obtained from a range of stakeholders. Data analysis was conducted by a team of researchers experienced in qualitative research. Two researchers participated only in the analysis stage of the process evaluation, and hence afforded a degree of objectivity, untainted by previous involvement in data collection. The total number of participants (n=78) is large, and there was evidence of data saturation. It should be noted that the findings represent issues associated with trial implementation, rather than the actual experiences of after-school PA interventions. Hence, they should not be considered a checklist for challenges associated with PA interventions. A limitation is that the issues that we report are grounded only in the experiences of stakeholders involved in one intervention, which was delivered to girls only in a relatively small area of the South West. As such, while many issues are applicable to the planning and implementation of broader after-school PA interventions it is possible that other interventions would reach different conclusions. We encourage other intervention planners and delivers to conduct detailed and reflective process evaluations and further contribute to the knowledge base for which school-based interventions can be improved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides information on factors associated with BGDP delivery and identifies lessons which may be applied to future after-school PA interventions. Although after-school PA interventions hold promise in increasing PA levels among adolescent girls, there is a need to implement them in ways that are appropriate to the needs and requirements of schools and girls. Our findings suggest that implementation processes need to be contextually specific and the recommendations proposed in this study may have utility in achieving this objective.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the children and schools who participated in the project as well as the dance instructors who were critical to the project evaluation.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> This project was convened by RJ, JEP and SJS and RJ was the principal investigator of the grant.
