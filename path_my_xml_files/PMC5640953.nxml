The management of these side effects is challenging because antiemetic drugs have adverse effects such as constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Acupuncture, a non-pharmacologic therapy, may be helpful for patients to manage the side effects of chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been shown that acupuncture may reduce the side effects of chemotherapy such as vomiting, nausea, hot flashes, and fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Acupuncture treatment has been recommended since 1997 by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to help patients undergoing chemotherapy deal with severe side effects like vomiting and nausea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Electroacupuncture has been recommended on the basis of level 1 evidence for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Such evidence has displayed the efficacy of acupuncture; however, how to match the acupoints remains a problem for clinical treatment.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>The schedule of enrollment, interventions, and assessments</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2186_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par18">Acupoints are the material basis for acupuncture effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the matching of acupoints is key to enhancing the effects. For single acupoint use, Zusanli (ST36) is one of the best acupoints for treatment of stomach disease, as it is beneficial for regulating the qi flow and harmonizing the stomach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Zusanli (ST36) and Zhongwan (CV12) are considered as the most effective matching acupoints for the stomach qi on the basis of He-sea and Front-mu acupoint-matching (ST36 is the lower He-sea point of the stomach and CV12 is the Front-mu acupoint of the stomach) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">This randomized controlled trial evaluates the effects of acupuncture on CINV after chemotherapy to offer biologic plausibility for addressing vomiting and nausea.

The impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect was explored by using sensitivity analysis.

To prevent performance bias, studies are judged at low risk of bias if they were blinded or if we judged that the lack of blinding could not have affected the results. Evaluators and operational assistants will not work together at the same time. There will be no communication between patients. The evaluators will not be able to ask whether the patients receive the acupuncture or not or where the acupoints are.

If the data are not normally distributed, we will use a Kruskal-Wallis test to compare the four treatment groups and a Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the pair-wise comparison for the primary outcome. Intergroup differences in categorical data (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) will be assessed using the chi<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher exact tests (two-tailed), as appropriate. Repeated measures analysis of variance (R-ANOVA) will be used to assess the frequency of vomiting, and the Visual Analogue Scale for nausea and nausea and vomiting and retching among the four study groups. Length of no days of nausea and vomiting will be calculated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared among the groups using the log-rank test. Subgroup analysis based on single or multiple chemotherapy sessions will be performed to compare the efficacy of basic antiemetic regimens plus electroacupuncture or an antiemetic regimen only on inducing a complete response. A <italic>p</italic> value &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par40">The mechanism of CINV is complicated. What we know at present is that the 5-HT system and SP system may have an important role in CINV. 5-HT is mainly involved in the process of acute nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. During chemotherapy, enterochromaffin cells (EC) release 5-HT receptors and vagal afferent nerves have been shown to be activated by 5-HT receptors. The signal is passed by the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve (vomiting center), which causes severe vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The SP system participates in the process, which prolongs the nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. During long-term chemotherapy, cell apoptosis and inflammation induce EC to release P substances combined with NK-1 on the chemoreceptor trigger zone by the vagal afferent nerves. Then the signal reaches the stomach through the vagal efferent fibers, which delays nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It has been shown that the dopamine system plays an important role as well in the occurrence of CINV, but the specific mechanism is unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">Electroacupuncture, in particular, has been shown to inhibit SP and 5-HT release in EC. It may directly inhibit afferent vagal nerve excitability, or it may inhibit the solitary tract nucleus or vagal nerve dorsal nucleus as the acupuncture signals are conducted through the sensory nerves through the spinal cord upwards to the central level. Thus, CINV could be reduced. However, the choice of acupoints may also alter the efficacy of EA treatment. Clinical studies are still unable to provide guidance for the prevention of or treatment for CINV. Further, there is a lack of sufficient clinical evidence as to how acupoint-matching may improve CINV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">In terms of the risk of bias, derived from the partial absence of blinding of the interventionists, it is difficult to implement a fully blind method for the operators because acupuncture is a physical operation method, and the interventionists are required to be knowledgeable about acupuncture.</p><p id="Par43">Nevertheless, the results of this trial are expected to explore the effects of the matching of different acupoints and offer biologic plausibility for the use of acupuncture in the treatment of CINV.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par44">The trial is currently recruiting patients.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec26"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par50">
