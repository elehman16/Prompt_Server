The clinical significance of this condition is its possible progression to dementia. MLC601 is a natural neuroprotective medication that has shown promising effects in Alzheimer disease.

The included participants were randomly assigned to groups to receive either MLC601 or placebo. An evaluation of global cognitive function was performed at baseline as well as at 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits. Global cognitive function was assessed by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores. Efficacy was evaluated by comparing global function scores between the 2 groups during the study period.

The prevalence of this syndrome varies between studies, with a reported prevalence of 3&#x02013;19% above the age of 65 years [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The clinical significance of MCI is its possible progression to dementia, with an approximately 5&#x02013;10% annual conversion rate [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The observed discrepancies in MCI prevalence and progression rates between studies are probably caused by controversial debate about the definition used for MCI, since MCI is a heterogeneous disorder and may progress to Alzheimer disease or to other dementing illnesses (including vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia) or remain relatively stable and lead to cognitive decline as in normal aging [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the idea of a continuum of cognitive decline is being supported by the introduction of a &#x0201c;neurocognitive disorder&#x0201d; (NCD) category in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The DSM-5 has expanded its diagnostic category to include MCI (mild NCD in the DSM-5) in an effort to help diagnose NCDs before the beginning of the clinical manifestation of dementia [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, much more attention should be paid to MCI in aspects important to patients including prevention, treatment, and clinical outcome.</p><p>In terms of treatment, a growing body of literature on medical therapy for MCI has been focusing on using anti-dementia drugs which can slow the rate of cognitive decline; however, their use is limited due to their side effects. MLC601 (NeuroAiD&#x000ae;) is a natural, neuroprotective medication that in our previous studies on Alzheimer patients had shown promising efficacy with few side effects compared to treatment with standard cholinesterase inhibitors [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Accordingly, we conducted this pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MLC601 in patients with MCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1_2"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><sec id="sec2_1"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of MLC601 in patients with MCI. After patient selection and screening, the included participants were randomly assigned to groups to receive either MLC601 (NeuroAiD, Moleac Pte. Ltd, Singapore; 0.4 g per capsule) or a placebo capsule 3 times a day, and they were prospectively followed for 6 months. The MLC601 and placebo capsules were visually identical, and the capsule containers were labeled with the name of the study and the allocated number. An expert statistician generated the allocation schedule using a computer-based program, and an allocation ratio of 1: 1 was applied. The study profile is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><p>MLC601 contains 5 animal components (0.0665 g <italic>Hirudo</italic>, 0.0285 g <italic>Cornu saigae tataricae</italic>, 0.095 g <italic>Mesobuthus martensii</italic>, 0.0665 g <italic>Eupolyphaga seu steleophaga</italic>, and 0.0285 g <italic>Calculus bovis artifactus</italic>) and 9 herbal components (0.114 g radix <italic>Paeoniae rubrae</italic>, 0.57 g radix <italic>Astragali</italic>, 0.114 g radix <italic>Salviae miltiorrhizae</italic>, 0.114 g rhizoma <italic>Chuanxiong</italic>, 0.114 g radix <italic>Angelicae sinensis</italic>, 0.114 g radix <italic>Polygalae</italic>, 0.114 g <italic>Prunus persica</italic>, 0.114 g <italic>Carthamus tinctorius</italic>, and 0.114 g rhizoma <italic>Acori tatarinowii</italic>). The placebo capsules were filled with flour as an inert chemical, making them indistinguishable from the MLC601 capsules.</p><p>The patients, care partners, and all neurologists directly involved in the study were blinded to the intervention during the period of the study. Demographic and clinical information on the patients was recorded at baseline. An evaluation of global cognitive function and a thorough neurological examination were performed by neurologists at baseline and at the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. Global cognitive function was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The MMSE measures orientation to time (5 points), orientation to place (5 points), registration (3 points), attention and calculation (5 points), recall (3 points), naming and repetition (3 points), comprehension (3 points), reading ability (1 point), writing ability (1 point), and visual construction (1 point). Scores range from 0 to 30 (the higher the score, the better the cognitive function) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The standard ADAS-cog includes 7 short cognitive tests and 4 scales rated by a physician, and it ranges from 0 (no impairment) to 70 (severe impairment) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2_2"><title>Participants</title><p>Between March 2015 and June 2015, patients with a clinical MCI diagnosis according to Petersen et al.

To the best of our knowledge there still is a serious lack of drugs that could be used to slow its progression to more severe cognitive decline or dementia. MLC601 is a natural neuroprotective medication that could be used in the treatment of MCI considering its potential efficacy and few AEs. Our primary finding in this study is that there was a statistically significantly slower decline in cognitive function in patients of the MLC601 group when compared to those treated with placebo after 6 months. Also, the most predominant minor AEs of MLC601 treatment in our study were gastrointestinal symptoms, most commonly nausea and diarrhea, and no patient left our study due to AEs.</p><p>At the date of its publication, this has been the first clinical trial that evaluated early treatment of MCI patients with MLC601, and it showed a possible efficacy with acceptable tolerability. MLC601 has shown both neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties in several controlled studies of ischemic injury to the brain [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It has been shown that MLC601 is a possible modulator of amyloid precursor protein processing and has implications as a putative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of post-stroke dementia and Alzheimer disease [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In our recent study [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], we compared the efficacy and safety of MLC601 with cholinesterase inhibitors. In that clinical trial study, MLC601 showed favorable tolerability and encouraging effects on cognitive function in Alzheimer disease patients during 18 months of treatment when compared to rivastigmine. In another study, MLC601 has shown a promising safety profile and also efficacy compared to the 3 FDA-approved cholinesterase inhibitors donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine. The study concluded that the trend for cognitive changes based on modifications over time in MMSE and ADAS-cog scores did not differ significantly between the groups (<italic>p</italic> = 0.92 for MMSE; <italic>p</italic> = 0.87 for ADAS-cog) [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The safety of treatment with MLC601 was also noted in other studies; as in our study, the most commonly reported AEs were gastrointestinal, and they were transient and tolerable [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A difficulty with treating MCI is that some patients proceed to developing Alzheimer disease, while others do not and may even get better. Therefore, even if it were known that treatment at a particular time would help (e.g., prescribing a cholinesterase inhibitor), it would be unclear which patients with MCI should be treated and which should not [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this situation, prescribing a drug with an acceptable efficacy and the least adverse effect seems reasonable.</p><p>We realize that there are limitations to our study. We did not use PET scanning or biomarker testing to pick up preclinical cases of Alzheimer disease. In addition, other aspects of cognition were not evaluated, and we followed our patients only for a short period of time. It is worth mentioning that our findings show a noticeable decline in cognition which may not be in line with the definition of MCI. This trend for change in cognition might be due to annual conversion rates of 10&#x02013;15% to Alzheimer disease, the small sample size, the potential risk of anxiety and depression among patients, the limitation of our cognition batteries identifying patients with mild and early-onset dementia, and the intention-to-treat analysis in our study. However, this report can be considered a pilot study for performing complementary studies in this setting. We suggest that studies should focus on the effect of MLC601 on different subtypes of MCI, and we also recommend that trials should be conducted on larger study populations and with longer durations of follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="sec1_5"><title>Disclosure Statement</title><p>All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
