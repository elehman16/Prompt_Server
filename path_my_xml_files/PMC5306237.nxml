Prolonged periods of reduced muscle activity and mechanical loading, e.g. immobilisation, limb-suspension or bed-rest, result in changes in skeletal muscle structure and function, bone mineral density (BMD) and intermuscular adipose content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>). Musculoskeletal trauma and sports injuries are often treated with orthopaedic surgery/limb immobilisation, which inevitably leads to periods of inactivity and disuse. The prognosis of orthopaedic surgery patients is poor especially in the older population with an ~6 to 17% mortality rate within three years of hip and knee joint replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>). Exercise could be beneficial in these circumstances, but is not always practical. In addition, there is a notable need to identify non-pharmacological interventions since polypharmacy in itself is conducive to skeletal tissue loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>).</p><p>Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is an n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid with anti-inflammatory properties, which is synthesised from ingested alpha-linolenic acid or consumed in fish, or in fish oil, such as sardines and cod liver oil. Despite there being no established Dietary Reference Intake for n-3 fatty acids, adequate intake (AI) is set at 1.6 and 1.1 g/day for men and women, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). There is evidence to suggest that EPA may reduce the pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with muscle damage-induced inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Magee et al. (2008) demonstrated in vitro that EPA inhibits the effects of TNF-&#x003b1; by reducing its apoptotic effects and enabling myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). It is unclear whether this supplement would have a beneficial effect during immobilisation, where it is generally accepted that there is muscle atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>), which is associated with decreased protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>) but scant evidence for increased protein breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>).</p><p>Another non-pharmacological agent that may potentially be used against the asthenia and sarcopenia induced through immobilisation is vitamin D. Vitamin D is required to absorb calcium and phosphorus and plays a crucial role in maintaining bone, muscle function, modulation of cell growth, neuromuscular and immune functions, and reduction of inflammation. The main source of vitamin D is sunlight, with smaller amounts found in certain foods. The Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamin D is 600 IU/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>). Vitamin D supplementation is another way of making sure the recommended allowance is achieved. Vitamin D has been shown to have direct effects on muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>); however, the exact mechanisms remain unknown. To date, research has indicated an association between genetic variation in the vitamin D receptor gene and muscle strength, fat mass and body mass in premenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>). Moreover, vitamin D has been reported to impact on both the trans-membranous flows of calcium and phosphate in skeletal muscle, and the synthesis rate of contractile properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>). Vitamin D supplementation reduced falls by 49% and improved musculoskeletal function in frail elderly women with vitamin D deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>). It remains to be seen whether vitamin D supplementation in healthy persons with no known vitamin D deficiency, would lead to any enhancement in muscle structural and contractile properties in the presence of immobilisation.</p><p>In the present study, an arm immobilisation model was chosen as it is relatively less restrictive on daily life and causes fewer burdens on participants. The aim was to determine the role that the two potential protein-sparing modulators (EPA or vitamin D supplementation) may play in attenuating atrophy induced through a model that would emulate relatively short-term decreased local mobility/activity in humans. The differential effect of immobilisation on in vivo muscle (thickness), limb composition (lean mass, bone parameters and fat mass), and anthropometry (arm girth) was systematically monitored. Participants received either omega 3 (&#x003c9;-3, a fish oil of a complex of EPA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), vitamin D or placebo (Lecithin), hereafter simply referred to as EPA, vitamin D or placebo supplementation. It was hypothesised that muscle thickness, lean mass and arm girth will decrease with limb immobilisation. It was also hypothesised that EPA will be the most effective supplement at minimising these changes, since it is understood to act on the protein synthesis pathways.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-four healthy volunteers were recruited from the local university campus. All participants provided written informed consent before taking part in this study, which was approved by the local Ethics Committee of Manchester Metropolitan University. Exclusion criteria were any conditions requiring the use of medication likely to affect muscle function or musculoskeletal health (e.g. statins and oral steroids), and any current or history of kidney/liver disease, as those suffering with such conditions are more susceptible to the side effects of nutritional supplementation. An in-house designed physical activity and general health questionnaire, generally used in our research laboratories for teaching and research purposes, was completed by each participant, to ascertain health, habitual physical exercise levels and supplement history prior to the study. This questionnaire confirmed all participants were recreationally active (defined here as undertaking three hours or less of low-to-moderate intensity exercise per week.), free from recent (last 6 months) upper limb injury, were not currently taking any supplements and had no history of &#x003c9;-3 or vitamin D supplementation within at least the last year. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: placebo [PLA: n = 8]; EPA [EPA: n = 8]; or vitamin D [Vit-D: n = 8]. For anthropometric measurements (height, weight and BMI) in our three populations, please see the results section.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>The study used a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. All participants attended a familiarisation session at least one week prior to the first testing session. All testing sessions were completed after an overnight fast. After baseline testing, the non-dominant arm was immobilised in a sling, with the correct sling wearing procedure demonstrated to each participant (<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Participants were required to wear the sling for nine waking hours a day for two continuous weeks, removal of the sling was permitted only when necessary (e.g. taking a bath/shower, driving, sleeping etc.), minimising any movement medio-laterally at the elbow and shoulder, whilst requiring participants to not contract the upper musculature (including the hands) during the hours of immobilisation. Measures of upper arm muscle and subcutaneous fat thickness, body composition (lean mass, bone parameters and fat mass), and upper and lower arm girth were taken immediately before immobilisation (Pre), on removal of the sling (Post), and two weeks after re-mobilisation (Post2).</p><p>The placebo group consumed two 1200 mg capsules of Soya Lecithin (Holland &#x00026; Barrett, UK) a day, each daily dose typically providing 1464 mg of Phosphatides. The EPA group consumed three softgel of High EPA Formula (MorEPA, Minami Nutrition, UK), with the daily dose providing 1770 mg EPA and 390 mg docosahexenoic acid (DHA). The Vit-D group consumed one softgel of Vitamin D3 (Now Foods, Bloomingdale, U.S.A.), each dose providing 1,000 IU of Vitamin D3. The participants consumed the nutritional supplements during the two weeks of limb immobilisation. Participants were asked to maintain their habitual diet and not to perform any unaccustomed strenuous exercise during the 2 weeks of immobilisation and remobilisation. To monitor this, during the immobilisation period participants completed a 3-day food diary, a daily activity log (including sling-wear hours) and wore a pedometer (Omron Walking style III step counter, Omron Healthcare Co., Ltd, Kyoto, Japan) to record the number of steps taken each day. The food diaries were analysed for macronutrient and micronutrient average intake using Microdiet Plus 1.2 (Microdiet, Downlee Systems Ltd, UK). All participants recorded their daily sling wear hours. In addition, since they were university-based local recruits, they were in full view of at least one member of the research team and/or other university staff on campus who had been made aware of the study requirement, during their hours on campus. Last but not least, participants were questioned during their final testing session, to confirm their compliance with the protocol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Muscle and sub-cutaneous adipose thickness measures</title><p>All images were recorded after approximately 20 minutes seated rest to avoid fluid shifts that might induce interstitial and/or intracellular changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>). Images of the muscle and sub-cutaneous adipose tissue of the upper arm were obtained using B-mode ultrasonography (AU5, Esaote, Genoa, Italy). A 7.5-MHz linear phased-array probe (image depth: 37.1-92.8mm) was applied in the sagittal plane with minimal pressure to the tissue area of interest to avoid image distortion. This method has previously been shown to be highly reliable for determining muscle and adipose thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>). Images were recorded using Adobe Premiere 6.0 (Adobe Systems, USA) and stored for later analysis.</p><p>Images were obtained with the participant in an upright, seated position with their arm abducted square to the body (elbow at 180&#x002da;) and resting on the ultrasound machine. In the upper arm, the proximal and distal insertions of the biceps and triceps brachii were identified by sonography and marked on the skin. The midpoint (L50) and a third of the distance (L33) from the distal end of the biceps and triceps brachii were identified and marked onto the skin. Upper arm ultrasonography images were collected in the sagittal plane, at both sites on both the biceps and triceps brachii. Muscle thickness was measured as the distance from the top of the superficial muscle aponeurosis to the bone at both sites along the biceps and triceps brachii. Ultrasound assessment of muscle tissue content has previously been validated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). Sub-cutaneous adipose thickness was measured as the distance from the bottom of the epidermis to the top of the superficial muscle aponeurosis in the biceps and triceps at both sites. Each of these distances were measured at three standardised points along the width of the probe to obtain average muscle and sub-cutaneous adipose thicknesses using ImageJ analysis software (ImageJ 1.37, Maryland, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Body composition analysis</title><p>Body composition was determined using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner (Hologic Discovery; Vertec Scientific, Reading, Berkshire, UK). Whole body scans were performed lasting approximately seven minutes with a dose-area product (DAP) of 21 cGy*cm<sup>2</sup>. The appendicular mass was isolated from the trunk and head using DXA regional computer-generated default lines, with manual adjustment, on the anterior view planogram. Measures of BMD, bone mineral content (BMC), lean mass, fat mass and fat percentage are reported for the immobilised arm only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Arm girths</title><p>Participants assumed a relaxed standing position with arms hanging by the sides and palms facing the hips. A measuring tape was used to measure upper arm girth at the mid-acromial-radial and lower arm girth at a fixed point a third of the way (from the proximal end) along the length of the radiale-stylion. Measurements were repeated three times at each point and average girths were calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Measurement reliability</title><p>All protocols were assessed for intra as well as inter-day reliability. This utilised five participants and entailed carrying out measurements three times on day 1, and repeating these on day 2, approximately a week later. Within-day coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.1 %, 0.1 %, 0.4 %, 0.2 %, 0.3 % and 0.3 %, and between-day CVs of 0.4 %, 0.2 %, 0.6 %, 0.2 %, 0.2 % and 0.4 % were yielded for upper arm girth, lower arm girth, biceps muscle thickness, triceps muscle thickness, biceps subcutaneous adipose thickness and triceps subcutaneous adipose thickness, respectively. DXA reliability is reported with a CV of 1.0 %.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data were analysed using IBM SPSS v21 (IBM Inc, USA). The Shapiro-Wilk test revealed some of the data to be nonparametric (upper arm muscle and adipose thickness, upper and lower arm girths). The effect of immobilisation was examined by assessing the changes seen in the PLA group by either repeated measures ANOVA (parametric data) or a Friedman test (non-parametric data). Parametric change relative to baseline values (Pre-to-Post: (Post-Pre)/Pre; and Pre-to-Post2: (Post2-Pre)/Pre) were analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA, with post-hoc Bonferonni corrected 2-tailed t-tests to determine group difference. Non-parametric between group effects on change data were analysed using the Kruskal Wallis test, with post-hoc Mann-Whitney U tests. All data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD). Statistical significance was set with alpha at &#x02264; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The non-immobilised limb was also monitored throughout the immobilisation and supplementation phase.

We found evidence to support this, with significant decreases in muscle thickness (PLA: -3.2 to -7.8% dependent on anatomical site), arm girth (PLA: -0.8 to -1.3% dependent on anatomical site) and lean mass (PLA: -3.6% for the immobilised limb). In addition, we found a significant increase in sub-cutaneous adipose thickness (PLA: 10.3%) and a significant decrease in BMC (PLA: -2.3%). It was also hypothesised that EPA would be the most effective supplement at minimising the effects of immobilisation. In fact, our data show that neither EPA nor vitamin D had any significant effect on the responses to non-injurious immobilisation, other than on the associated accumulation of sub-cutaneous fatty tissue. Nonetheless, a few trends towards attenuations in deleterious physiological events were observed, in the EPA and Vit-D treated groups. We discuss the observed trends for the attenuation of some parameters.

</p><p>A significant change in upper limb muscle thickness is evidenced in our ultrasound data, with a significant decrease in biceps and triceps brachii muscle thickness with immobilisation. The ultrasound data demonstrate a greater decrease in triceps brachii muscle (L50 and L33) thickness than the biceps brachii (L33) in the PLA group. We had, in fact, expected the muscle held in the shortened position (i.e. the biceps) to be impacted on more than the muscle held in the lengthened position (i.e. the triceps); previous research suggests that sarcomeres are added in series when the muscle is immobilised in the lengthened position, and sarcomeres are lost when the muscle is immobilised in the shortened position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>). In the present study, the elbow was immobilised at a 90&#x000b0; angle and, as such, would not have exerted maximal lengthening or shortening on the triceps and biceps brachii. The EPA and Vit-D supplementation groups demonstrated non-significant trends towards smaller decreases in muscle thickness in response to immobilisation, suggesting that EPA and vitamin D may have some role to play in attenuating muscle atrophy associated with disuse. A recent study in an animal model demonstrated distinct effects of EPA and DHA on protein metabolism (protein synthesis and breakdown) with EPA showing a greater ability to result in skeletal muscle protein accretion. Further work in humans is required to further investigate this and the effects EPA may have in human disuse models. Indeed, it is likely that the dose, duration and/or whole body measurement of muscle mass that was adopted in these animal studies diminished the comparability of animal models from our immobilisation model.</p><p>Upper and lower arm girths were shown to decrease significantly post immobilisation in the PLA group. We used girth as a gross marker of skeletal muscle atrophy, as previously used by Matsumura et al (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). A decrease in upper arm girth (in the PLA group) suggests a decrease in muscle CSA in the upper arm and this supports our ultrasound data along with previous findings of a decrease in elbow flexor muscle CSA and volume with arm immobilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). The decrease in lower arm girth suggests a decrease in forearm muscle CSA, and this is in line with finding from Miles et al. who reported a decrease in forearm muscle CSA with 9 days arm casting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>). The significant decrease in limb CSA is reflected in our DXA data, with a significant decrease in lean mass with immobilisation. The decrease in upper arm girth appeared to be attenuated by EPA and vitamin D supplementation, with EPA having the greater effect. Similarly, in the lower arm, supplementation showed a trend towards attenuating the losses in arm girth, this time with vitamin D having a slightly greater effect. The EPA group appear to show a smaller decrease in lean mass than both other groups.</p><p>The ultrasound data revealed no significant change in sub-cutaneous adipose thickness in the triceps brachii over the immobilisation period. Biceps sub-cutaneous adipose thickness, however, did significantly increase at the midpoint site in the placebo group. Manini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>) reported a significant increase in intermuscular adipose tissue and no significant change in subcutaneous adipose tissue in response to 4-weeks unilateral lower limb suspension. The difference between the response of sub-cutaneous adipose tissue to disuse in the current study in comparison to Manini et al. may be due to the different techniques used to assess the parameter (i.e. ultrasound vs. magnetic resonance imaging) and/or the differing modes of immobilisation (i.e. arm immobilisation vs. unilateral lower limb suspension). It is possible that the more stringent immobilisation in their study (throughout daily mobile activities, for four weeks), as well as the adiposity site (intermuscular), may account for the fact that they observed significant increases in adiposity. The present study partially agrees with their findings as our data showed a significant increase at one region, subcutaneously, along the upper arm (i.e. 50% of upper limb length). The EPA group demonstrated a significantly smaller increase in biceps sub-cutaneous adipose thickness following immobilisation than both the PLA and Vit-D groups. This effect may, indeed, be meaningful given that diet was monitored and the dietary records demonstrated neither time nor between group differences in total calories, macronutrients or vitamin D intakes, throughout the study. EPA supplementation potential for attenuating increases in sub-cutaneous adipose thickness in response to disuse. The Vit-D group also demonstrated a trend towards an attenuation in the increase of sub-cutaneous adipose thickness in comparison to the PLA group.</p><p>DXA analysis revealed no significant changes in fat mass or fat percentage with limb immobilisation. The difference in the response of adiposity to disuse in the current study in comparison to Manini et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), who reported a significant increase in intermuscular adipose tissue, may be due to the different techniques used to assess the parameter (i.e. DXA vs. magnetic resonance imaging) or the different mode and/or duration of disuse (i.e. 2 weeks arm immobilisation vs. 4 weeks unilateral lower limb suspension). Interestingly, the increases we reported in sub-cutaneous adipose thickness were not matched by our DXA analysis of fat mass or percentage. Possible explanations for this include: a) the DXA takes the average of the whole limb rather than regional data and hence would have averaged-out the regional changes observed with the ultrasound; b) it is possible that the tissue density changes with immobilisation mean that the DXA may have miss-qualified muscle and fat after immobilisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>).</p><p>We reported no significant change in BMD (-0.8%/week), but a significant decrease in BMC (-1.2%/week) following immobilisation. Decreases in bone are often reported in more severe and longer periods of disuse. For example, Rittweger et al. reported significant decreases in BMC of the tibia (-0.1 to -0.5/week) and radius (-0.03 to -0.05%/week) in response to 90 days bed rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>). Marchetti et al. found significant decreases in BMD (-1.0 to 2.3%/week) in response to 6 weeks arm immobilisation, however, the participants had also undergone surgery, which could contribute to greater decreases in BMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>). Values for BMC and BMD changes with immobilisation showed a trend towards attenuation of changes with EPA and vitamin D supplementation. Previous research indicates that BMD is affected by changes in body weight and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>), therefore our observed changes in muscle and sub-cutaneous adipose thickness may have influenced our BMD values. The value of BMD can also be limited by the inherent limitations of using a two-dimensional x-ray projection to estimate bone area and geometrical changes. The use of peripheral quantitative tomography (pQCT) may have been more advantageous to examine these specific changes.</p><p>A recent study in our own laboratory, found that a lower dose of EPA and DHA than that used in the current study, was not sufficient to decrease inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>). We therefore chose to increase the EPA and DHA of our &#x003c9;-3 supplement in the current study, in line with previous levels used in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>). The vitamin D dose of 1000 IU is equal to 25 ug. Public Health England suggest that adults at risk of vitamin D deficiency should take a daily supplement containing 10 ug of vitamin D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>). Our selected dose is much higher than this and as such should be sufficient in the healthy population used in the current study. The formula of each supplement was chosen so that the dose provided would be able to be bought over the counter and be taken without prescription. The lack of the effectiveness of vitamin D and EPA in the current study may be due to the dosage of the supplements used and therefore this needs to be altered, potentially increased, in future studies.</p><p>The NHS consensus on vitamin D states that if people achieve a sufficient supply of vitamin D in the summer, most should keep levels greater than the deficiency threshold of 25nmol/l in winter even without supplements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>). In the current study, participants reported that they typical spent at least 30 minutes outdoors every day of the week and as such would reach the necessary sunlight exposure for adequate vitamin D levels. Research has shown that light of even relatively low intensity (~180 lux) significantly phase-shifts the human circadian rhythm [40]. We therefore suggest that the current population are unlikely to be vitamin D deficient. The &#x02018;healthy, presumably non-deficient&#x02019; status of the participants may have been another reason for the lack of effectiveness of the supplementation in the current study. In a recent study, it was reported that in an elderly population, most participants were unable to meet the recommended daily omega-3 (&#x003c9;-3) intake without the use of fish oil supplements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>). Future studies need to recruit those lacking in physiological reserve and those more at risk of malnutrition/deficiencies e.g. older and/or injured persons. Future studies also need to assess endocrine markers, including serum EPA &#x00026; DHA, 25(OH) D3 levels (biomarker for vitamin D status) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) to observe the effects of supplementation.</p><p>Blinding of &#x003c9;-3 supplementation is sometimes an issue in studies due to the fact that it often repeats on participants. On completion of the study, participants were asked whether they were able to identify what supplement they believed they were taking. None of the participants correctly guessed the supplement they were taking and in fact, two participants receiving the placebo supplement believed they were taking an &#x003c9;-3 supplement.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In accordance with previous research, we demonstrated a decrease in muscle thickness, arm girth and lean mass with short-term upper limb immobilisation. We also observed a significant decrease in BMC, with no observed effect of immobilisation on fat mass or BMD. At the current dosage, neither vitamin D nor EPA supplementation impacted on these parameters at a statistically significant level. Interestingly nonetheless, we have observed that in the case of sub-cutaneous adiposity on the biceps brachii, there is a protective effect of EPA supplementation against limb immobilisation. We propose that the model used in the current study could have relevance to a sporting population in which short-term immobilisation may be prescribed (e.g. treatment for minor injury) or in clinical populations (e.g. injury/surgery induced short-term immobilisation/bed-rest). A short-term model such as this is relatively less invasive and inconvenient for participants and therefore provides a model to be used to assess other supplements and treatments in future studies.</p><p>
