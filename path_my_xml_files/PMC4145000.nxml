As well as the suffering caused by pain and disability, a socioeconomic factor is also involved. Yearly, the total cost of this problem exceeds one-hundred billion dollars in the United States alone<sup>(<xref rid="b2-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup>. The same author stated that approximately 66% of the total cost is indirect (lost wages and reduced productivity).</p><p>Back pain can have several different causes<sup>(<xref rid="b2-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup>. Red flags, such as a tumor or spinal fracture, only cause between 1% and 4% of cases<sup>(<xref rid="b3-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup>. Currently, only a minority of patients are diagnosed<sup>(<xref rid="b4-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup>. The vast majority fall into the &#x02018;non-specific&#x02019; musculoskeletal pain category<sup>(<xref rid="b4-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup>. This heterogeneity increases difficulty while researching the topic or treating patients. However, exercise therapy seems to be effective for chronic cases not related to red flags<sup>(<xref rid="b5-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>)</sup>. Postural models for pain treatment state that poor posture alters the joint position and causes pain<sup>(<xref rid="b6-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup>, which is more evident in a region with a high degree of mobility, such as the spine.</p><p>One of the postural models is based on the muscular chains therapy (MCT) concept. These chains are formed by anti-gravitational muscles that work synergistically in the same muscle or myofascial chain<sup>(<xref rid="b8-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup>. Therefore, a localized muscular action can provoke a reaction far from its origin. According to this concept, the structures forming a chain must be treated together<sup>(<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup>, stretching and strengthening several muscle groups simultaneously rather than simply treating an isolated muscle<sup>(<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of a single application of Muscular Chain Therapy on complaints of undiagnosed musculoskeletal spinal pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>In total, 100 volunteers between 20 and 39 years old participated in the study at the Physical Therapy Clinic of the State University of the Center-West (Guarapuava, Brazil). The volunteers were recruited through a local newspaper advertisement. Inclusion criterion for the subjects was to have some self-reported spinal musculoskeletal pain. The exclusion criteria included any psychiatric or neurological disorders. Volunteers signed a statement of informed consent, and were assessed and treated with muscular chain therapy, as described by Rosario<sup>(<xref rid="b11-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup>, or placed in a placebo group. The present study received approval from the Human Research Ethics Committee of the State University of the Center-West &#x02013; UNICENTRO, under protocol number 289/2011.</p><p>The subjects were divided into two groups of 50 participants each: The MCT Group that received Muscular Chain Therapy and the Control Group that received a placebo treatment of 15 minutes ultrasound off therapy (UOT). Both groups were treated by a Physical Therapist with MCT certification. The randomization method consisted of 100 identically folded pieces of paper with MCT (50) or UOT (50) written in the internal part. All these pieces of paper were mixed in a bowl. After that, the subject picked up one of the papers to be assorted in the respective group. The subjects did not know the meaning of MCT or UOT. Every piece of paper was thrown out after being picked up by the volunteer.</p><sec><title>MCT Group Assessment and Comparison of Muscle Chains</title><p>The assessment of the anterior and posterior chains, as described by Ros&#x000e1;rio<sup>(<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>, were performed to find the most compromised muscular chain. The chain presenting the highest compensation was the first to be treated.</p></sec><sec><title>MCT Treatment</title><p>Treatment consisted of two postures of 20 minutes each. Before treatment, the subjects were taught how to separate breathing by region: apical, lower ribs, and diaphragmatic breathing, aimed at helping the maintenance of posture. The selection of posture was based on the assessment described above. If the therapist found more postural alterations in the posterior chain, two postures of the posterior chain were performed. If more deviations were found in the anterior chain, two postures of the anterior chain were performed. If the two chains exhibited similar deviations, the treatment included one posture for each chain. Both of the supine postures were performed according to Ros&#x000e1;rio<sup>(<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Ultrasound Off Therapy</title><p>The subject, positioned in prone position, had 20 minutes of a placebo ultrasound therapy applied at the painful site. Gel was applied at the area of pain before the treatment. The setting of the 1 Mhz ultrasound was 0.1 W pulse mode. The ultrasound transducer probe was always being slowly moved in circles and touching the skin of the volunteer. The subjects did not know it was a placebo therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Pain Assessment</title><p>Pain is a symptom that accompanies the majority of pathological conditions that require medical care transversely. Among the internationally validated scales for measuring the intensity of pain, the analog scale is one of the most utilized<sup>(<xref rid="b8-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup>. In the present study, a 10 centimeter line, scored from 0 to 10, was shown to the subject, who verbally identified the degree of pain before and after the treatment, with zero indicating no pain and ten indicating the most intense pain possible.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>A chi-square goodness of fit test was used to compare gender distribution among groups. Subject age is presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation, with differences analyzed using the unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. Pain assessment for treatment and placebo control groups was analyzed using a paired <italic>t</italic> test and unpaired <italic>t</italic> test. The paired <italic>t</italic> test was used for intragroup before/after treatment comparison. The unpaired <italic>t</italic> test was used for comparing the difference of the pain level before and after treatment between groups.

MCT provided some pain relief in 96% of cases, whereas this figure was 36% in the Control Group.</p><p>A similar previous study conducted in our laboratory found that exercises using the concept of muscular chains were efficient in terms of decreasing nonspecific musculoskeletal pain in one session. However, the pain complaint could be located anywhere<sup>(<xref rid="b12-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup>. The present study focused on back pain. The spine has the contradictory functions of allowing a large range of movement while protecting the spinal cord. Normally, it has 33 vertebrae, nine of which are fused to form the sacrum and the coccyx. The remaining 24 are articulated vertebrae. Each vertebra articulates with the one below through two facet joints, which makes a total of 48 joints, not counting the atlantooccipital and sacroiliac joints. Adding complexity, there are the intervertebral discs and several muscles with different sizes and functions to control both small specific vertebral movements and large global spinal movements. All commands of the central nervous system pass through the spine (spinal cord), leaving it by the spinal roots. Consequently, it is not a surprise that back pain is a significant health concern<sup>(<xref rid="b1-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>)</sup>. It is considered the condition with the highest impact in terms of years lived with disability<sup>(<xref rid="b13-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>)</sup>. The previous study<sup>(<xref rid="b12-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> accepted any pain location. Because of the special characteristics of the spine, the effect of a postural exercise based on muscular chains could be different for back pain (better or worse). However, the findings are very similar, including the effects on the control group.</p><p>Back pain can be puzzling. It often seems to be more than just back pain. A survey study with more than 3,000 participants showed that just 16.8% of the respondents reported localized musculoskeletal pain<sup>(<xref rid="b14-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup>. The majority felt pain in multiple places<sup>(<xref rid="b14-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>)</sup>. Another study reported back pain as being three times more prevalent in populations that have another chronic pain complaint<sup>(<xref rid="b15-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup>. The results of Rosario et al.<sup>(<xref rid="b12-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> are in accordance to these statements once many subjects exhibited more than one complaint. Comparing the previous data<sup>(<xref rid="b12-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> with the present it is possible to observe that, regardless of spinal biomechanical complexity, MCT seems to be as effective for back pain as it is for pain in other locations. This could be due to the characteristics of MCT, which tends to work globally<sup>(<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>)</sup>.</p><p>Ros&#x000e1;rio et al.<sup>(<xref rid="b16-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)</sup> argue that this type of postural treatment technique does not act on posture simply by stretching. Their result has shown that a 15-minute therapeutic posture provided similar hamstring flexibility as a 30-second hamstring stretch. Actively maintaining better joint positioning, reducing an existing subluxation, can exert influence on postural adjustment and, consequently, solve related pain<sup>(<xref rid="b9-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)</sup>. The relief of 96% of the complaints, with a complete absence of pain in 18 of the 50 complaints, demonstrated the efficiency of MCT when properly applied.</p><p>Other authors have found positive results with this type of technique. Examples can be found in the work of Gil et al.<sup>(<xref rid="b17-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup> who decreased back pain in pregnant women in eight weeks. Canto et al.<sup>(<xref rid="b18-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup> stated that 85.7% of the participants reported a decrease in the level of back pain. Heredia and Rodrigues<sup>(<xref rid="b19-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> relieved the pain of patients with epidural fibrosis in postoperative lumbar disc herniation with 15 sessions, also using analog scales. These studies demonstrated how various causes of musculoskeletal back pain obtained positive results with this type of treatment, similar to the present study.</p><p>Another interesting result of the present study was the unexpected success of the placebo therapy, which was inferior to MCT, but still somewhat successful in achieving some pain relief in 36% of cases. These results corroborate the findings of other authors who suggested that the placebo effect occurs in 20% to 40% of the cases<sup>(<xref rid="b20-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>)</sup>. It seems that back pain is also associated with depression and anxiety<sup>(<xref rid="b21-ijtmb-7-2" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>)</sup>. Although it is not clear if depression and anxiety cause back pain or they are caused by back pain, they cannot be ignored. Thus, the emotional factor related to back pain and the emotional factor related to a subjective report of pain could also have contributed to the efficiency of the placebo treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>MCT was shown to reduce musculoskeletal back pain in young adult patients immediately post intervention. However, this study did not determine short-term nor long-term effects of MCT. Further studies are required to verify the short- and long-term effect evaluation. Based on the immediate effects of MCT to reduce pain seen in this study, other pain syndromes that may be posturally based should be studied for the potential applicability of MCT. Objectives measures are also recommended for future works.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ijtmb-7-2"><p><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST NOTIFICATION</bold></p><p>The authors declare there are
