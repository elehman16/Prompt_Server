The mechanism(s) behind such a relationship are poorly understood. Phosphorus (P) is reported to improve insulin sensitivity, which is involved in lipid metabolism, and thus we were interested in determining the impact of phosphorus ingestion on postprandial lipemia, a recognized CVD risk factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>A within&#x02013;subject study design was conducted, whereby 8 healthy male subjects received a high fat meal (330Kcal; 69% energy from fat; 35&#x000a0;mg of phosphorus) with placebo or phosphorus (500&#x000a0;mg) in a random order. Postprandial blood samples (~10&#x000a0;ml) were collected every hour for 6&#x000a0;hours after meal ingestion. Changes in different parameters were analyzed using a 2-factor repeated-measure ANOVA. In the phosphorus (P) supplemented group, postprandial serum P increased (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.00), while changes in insulin, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and triglyceride (TG) were not significantly different than that of placebo. Concurrently, phosphorus supplementation increased postprandial concentrations of apolipoprotein B48 (ApoB48) (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and decreased that of apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100) (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Phosphorus supplementation (500&#x000a0;mg) of the meal seems to alter the different components of postprandial lipemia.

Elevated serum levels of TRLs or their components (TG, ApoB48 and ApoB100) are reported to be associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and to be predictors of their future occurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition, high TG predisposes to other atherogenic risk factors such as low high density lipoproteins (HDL), high small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL) and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hence, PPL reduction is of vital clinical importance and the elucidation of factors able to regulate it can have significant clinical implications for the prevention of atherosclerosis and CVD, particularly as humans are in the postprandial state for a large part of the day. PPL is known to be affected by several factors including diet, lifestyle, genetics, obesity, and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Dietary factors include the amount and type of fat consumed as well as other components of a meal including carbohydrate, protein, alcohol and fiber content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. While data on the effect of micronutrients on PPL are limited, magnesium has been reported to improve postprandial lipemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Both low and high levels of serum phosphorus (P) have been associated with increased risk of CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Increased serum P levels have been implicated in CVD morbidity and mortality among subjects with normal and abnormal kidney function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The biological mechanism(s) of such an effect are poorly understood, though high P levels were reported to induce vascular calcification and endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, low serum P is known to be associated with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], while addition of P to an oral glucose load improves insulin sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In line with that, serum P status was reported to be inversely related to metabolic syndrome a known risk factor for CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>It was hypotheses that P addition to a meal would stimulate lipid clearance from circulation due to its capacity to increase insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the nature of the relation between serum phosphate and CVD risk factors is far from clear, which triggered our interest to investigate the effect of P ingestion on insulin and PPL, particularly NEFA, TG, ApoB48 and ApoB100.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 8 healthy male subjects participated in the study, since lipid profile is known to be affect by the sex steroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

Experimental sessions were scheduled in random order and were separated by a washout period of a minimum of 1&#x000a0;week. Following 12&#x02013;14 hours overnight fast, a Teflon catheter was inserted into the antecubital vein in the morning and subjects were asked to remain in a semi recumbent position during the experimental session. They were allowed bathroom access and provided with drinking water, when needed. A baseline blood sample (10&#x000a0;ml) was collected before receiving the treatments (meal with the allocated supplement) which was ingested within 10&#x000a0;minutes. The meal was composed of bread roll (25&#x000a0;g), unsalted spreadable butter (30&#x000a0;g), and jam (14&#x000a0;g) with tablets containing either 500&#x000a0;mg phosphorus or a placebo (Nutricap Labs, Farmingdale, NY, USA). The meal provided 330 Kcal; (69% from fat, 28% from carbohydrate and 3% from protein) and about 35&#x000a0;mg of phosphorus. The subjects were blinded on the content of the tablets. Postprandial blood samples (~10&#x000a0;ml) were taken every hour, for 6&#x000a0;hours after meal ingestion. Blood samples were centrifuged for 15&#x000a0;minutes at 3500 RPM at 3&#x000b0;C for serum and plasma separation.

The addition of P to meal was able to prolonged the increase in postprandial ApoB48 levels and this resulted in a statistical significant difference between the two treatments (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study showed that phosphorus addition to a high fat meal increases the postprandial level of ApoB48 and concomitantly decrease that of ApoB100 of healthy male subjects. Phosphorus is known to be involved in carbohydrate, fat, protein and energy metabolism and is a component of several compounds including phospholipids. The fact that P improves insulin sensitivity implicates it in PPL since the production, clearance and degradation of TRLs are known to be affected by insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Insulin resistance and diabetes stimulate the production of both intestinal (chylomicrons) and hepatic (VLDL) derived lipoproteins, and decrease their catabolic and clearance rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the similarity in insulin, TG and NEFA between treatment groups argues against their involvement in the observed ApoB100 and ApoB48 changes.</p><p>The similarity between treatments in serum ApoB48 during the first two hours implies that P ingestion did not affect fat absorption but rather extended the release of ApoB48 into circulation. In the P ingested group, the pattern of postprandial changes in serum P resembles that of ApoB48 (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.407, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) and this may raise the possibility of the involvement of increased intestinal P availability with ApoB48 production, especially since P is known to be well absorbed along the entire intestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The similarity in postprandial insulin levels between treatments does not support a difference in chylomicron (ApoB48) clearance. On the other hand, the sustained increase in ApoB48 concentrations is believed to augment its atherogenic potential, especially since postprandial arterial lipoprotein retention prefers ApoB48 as compared to ApoB100 containing lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Postprandial VLDL production is known to start 3&#x02013;4 hour post meal ingestion and thus the modest reduction in ApoB100 (component of VLDL and LDL) may imply that P content of the meal altered VLDL and LDL clearance. Such alteration may partially be related to a competition with chylomicron for clearance, especially since postprandial ApoB48 of the P ingested group was maintained for longer duration. It is worth mentioning that in the USA, daily phosphorus intake (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SE) was reported to be 1277&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.8&#x000a0;mg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and is mainly derived from animal sources, especially dairy products and meats. A 500&#x000a0;mg of phosphorus can be obtained from consuming about 500&#x000a0;ml of milk, 150&#x000a0;g of cheese, 300&#x000a0;g of meat or 5000&#x000a0;ml of carbonated cola beverages. Our study has limitations, mainly the small sample size. Even though the cross over design may be more suitable than parallel group trials for a small sample size ensuring comparability of subjects to themselves and thus less variability, we think that a study with a bigger sample size would be needed to make stronger statistical and clinical implications. At the same time, a study is needed to assess the impact of P ingestion on women. Another possible limitation is the absence of blinding of the researchers, but this may not be as important as the main outcome was objective measurements of biologic parameters.</p><p>In conclusion, in contrast to our proposed hypothesis, increased P content of a high fat meal was not able to stimulate lipid clearance from circulation. However, this study shows that P ingestion was able to manipulate several components of PPL, through the reduction in ApoB100 and the increase in ApoB48. The impact of such manipulation on the development of atheroma is not clear since both are involved in this process, although ApoB48 has a higher atherogenic effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>PPL: Postprandial lipemia; TRLs: Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins; CM: Chylomicrons; VLDL: Very low density lipoproteins; CVD: Cardiovascular disease; TG: Triglyceride; HDL: High density lipoproteins; NEFA: Non esterified fatty acids; Apo-B48: Apolipoprotein B48; Apo-B100: Apolipoprotein B100.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>OO designed the study; OO and JH conducted the research experiment; JH and DS performed the biochemical analytical methods; SH; HG; MB and OO performed the statistical analysis and wrote the paper.
