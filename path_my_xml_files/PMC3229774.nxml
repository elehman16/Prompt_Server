Nadifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone with anti-<italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> activity and additional anti-inflammatory activity, is approved for use in acne. This randomized controlled assessor blind trial compared the clinical effectiveness and safety of eight weeks therapy of nadifloxacin 1% versus clindamycin 1% as add-on therapy to benzoyl peroxide (2.5%) in mild to moderate grade acne.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The efficacy parameters were changes in the total, inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesion counts, Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), and Cardiff Acne Disability Index (CADI) scales from baseline to study end (eight weeks).

The pathogenesis is complex and multifactorial which includes abnormal sebum production, follicular hyperkeratinization, bacterial proliferation and inflammation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The treatment goals are directed to reduce activity of the sebaceous glands, normalize follicular proliferation reduce bacterial colonization and control inflammation. Therefore, topical comedolytics, antibacterials and retinoids are mainly used for mild to moderate severe acne. Systemic therapy with antibacterials, retinoids and hormones are mainly indicated for severe cases. Topical therapy with antibiotics alone can induce or select resistance in coagulase negative staphylococcus and lead to widespread distribution of cross&#x02013;resistant strains of <italic>Propionobacterium acnes</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Combination therapy with clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide is a well-accepted treatment regimen for mild to moderate acne as documented in clinical trials and meta-analysis reports.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The advantages of this combination therapy are - keratolytic action of benzoyl peroxide is possibly synergistic with the antibacterial activity of clindamycin. Secondly, benzoyl peroxide may reduce chances of antimicrobial resistance to topical antibacterials like erythromycin and clindamycin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>Topical fluoroquinolone antibiotic, nadifloxacin, is a relatively new member of the family of anti-acne medications. It has been used for the therapy of mild to moderate acne in Japan and other European countries and has also been recently launched in India. This antimicrobial agent is effective against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with infective skin disorders.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Several <italic>in-vitro</italic> studies have documented the antibacterial activity of nadifloxacin against <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic>, an important bacterial pathogen in acne.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Additionally, studies also suggest that the effectiveness of nadifloxacin in inflammatory acne lesions may be attributed to its inhibitory effect on pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b1;, IL-6, and IL-8 which also play an important role in acne pathogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]. Since there are no published studies till date that evaluated the clinical effectiveness and safety of topical nadifloxacin and benzoyl peroxide compared to clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide (an accepted standard regimen) in mild to moderate severity facial acne, we undertook this randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This post-marketing, randomized, single (assessor) blind, controlled trial was undertaken at an outpatient setting of a dermatology clinic in a tertiary care hospital. Approval of the protocol and other study documents were taken from Institutional Ethics Committee before study commencement. After taking written informed consent, subjects with mild to moderate (grade I and II) acne vulgaris attending the dermatology out-patient clinic were screened for study selection criteria. The sample size was calculated considering the total lesion count as the primary efficacy parameter. Based on an effect size of four, standard deviation of five, significance level &#x003b1; of 0.05 and power of the study (1 - &#x003b2;) as 90%, the target number of &#x0201c;evaluable&#x0201d; subjects was 34 per group using <italic>Statistica</italic> version 6 software. Considering a 15% drop out rate, this translated to a target recruitment of 40 subjects in each group.</p><p>After screening, 84 subjects fulfilled the subject selection criteria and were randomized (43 in nadifloxacin group and 41 in clindamycin group) to the two study groups using an unstratified computer generated randomization list. Allocation concealment was done by having sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes and medication dispensing was done accordingly.</p><p>The study inclusion criteria were: subjects of 12 to 40 years of age of either sex with &#x02265; 2 but &#x02264; 30 total lesions - inflammatory (papules and pustules) and/or non-inflammatory (open and closed comedones) lesions in the face which correspond to a baseline investigator global assessment (IGA) score of 2 or 3 (both inclusive). Exclusion criteria were: age out of range, total lesion count &#x0003c; 2 or &#x0003e;30, severe acne, subjects regularly using any anti-acne medications in the last 30 days before study entry or subjects with nodulo-cystic lesions, acne conglobata, acne fulminans, secondary acne (e.g. chloracne, drug-induced acne), or any acne requiring systemic treatment. Subjects were not allowed to use any other medication which might influence the study outcome and medicated cosmetics for the entire study duration.</p><p>Study was designed as a single-blind (assessor blind) study as the designated dermatologist who recruited and evaluated the subjects was unaware of the treatment allocation. The investigator who dispensed the study medications from the department of pharmacology was not involved in any subject related clinical assessment.</p><p>All enrolled subjects were instructed to apply a thin layer of the study medications over the lesions; benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel once daily at bedtime and clindamycin 1% gel or nadifloxacin 1% gel twice daily. The patients were instructed to apply the study medications at least 10 minutes after the skin was gently washed, rinsed with water and patted dry. The patients were asked not to bathe, shower, wash or swim at least 4 hours after the application of the study medications.</p><p>The study medications were dispensed as 10 gm packs of benzoyl peroxide gel and as 5 gm packs of clindamycin or nadifloxacin gel, respectively. Accountability was assessed by evaluating the subject diary in which each subject was instructed to fill in the details of drug administration.</p><p>The primary efficacy parameter was change from baseline to study end of the total lesion count - both inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions. Secondary efficacy parameters were the validated IGA,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] on a six point scale: 0 - indicating clearance of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions, 1- almost clear, 2- mild severity, 3-moderate severity, 4-severe, and 5-very severe. Proportion of subjects in each group were considered as &#x0201c;improved&#x0201d; if there was at least two scale improvement in the IGA. Percentage of &#x0201c;improved&#x0201d; subjects in each group was compared for statistically significant difference if any. Changes in the Cardiff acne disability index (CADI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] was also evaluated for assessing the impact of disease on their quality of life. The CADI included assessment on a five question scale.</p><p>A modified intention to treat (MITT) analysis was done for the efficacy and safety data set where a subject was considered &#x0201c;evaluable&#x0201d; if the baseline and one post-baseline visit data was present. All treatment emergent dermatological adverse events were noted throughout the study period for safety analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows (version 17, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The efficacy variables (total lesion, inflammatory, non-inflammatory lesion counts, and CADI scores) were tested for normality using the <italic>Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z</italic> test and were found to be normally distributed. Independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare continuous parametric variables for between-group analysis while repeated measure ANOVA for within-group analysis with <italic>Bonferroni</italic> multiple comparison posthoc test. Categorical variables were analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.05 and &#x0003c;0.01 were considered as statistically significant and highly significant, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>Out of 84 randomized subjects (43-nadifloxacin arm) and (41-clindamycin) 42 in nadifloxacin (NADI) group, 37 in clindamycin (CLN) group completed the study. Four patients in the CLN group and one in the NADI group were lost to follow-up and did not attend any post baseline visit. Hence, there were 42 &#x0201c;evaluable subjects&#x0201d; in the NADI and 37 in CLN, respectively. Thus, the target number of evaluable subjects (34) in each group was achieved.</p><p>The mean age of subjects in the NADI group was 21.4&#x00381; 4.65 compared to 20.24&#x00381;3.33 years in the CLN group, 42.85% were male in the NADI group while 54.05% in the CLN group.

The adverse events were post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, dryness, pruritus, burning sensation, and erythema. None of the patients needed treatment modification for the AEs and they resolved spontaneously. Causality assessment as per the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) adverse drug reaction (ADR) causality scale showed that most of the events were in &#x0201c;probable or possible&#x0201d; category.

No differences between two therapies were observed in the total, inflammatory or non-inflammatory lesion counts.</p><p>This study provides us with scientific evidence that a combination topical therapy of nadifloxacin and benzoyl peroxide is effective, tolerable and safe in cases of mild to moderate severity facial acne vulgaris and comparable to that of existing clindamycin-benzoyl peroxide regimen. Our findings were similar to previous published literature in this domain. Nadifloxacin inhibits activation of T cells and keratinocytes which could partly be responsible for its beneficial effects in inflammatory acne.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] A phase III, regulatory trial (non-inferiority study design), published from Japan with clindamycin (test drug) versus nadifloxacin (control) reported non-inferiority of clindamycin to nadifloxacin in terms of its efficacy in reducing inflammatory lesion count and improving global assessment scores.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Our study has shown similar effectiveness and safety of nadifloxacin with that of clindamycin.</p><p>A study by Veronnica <italic>et al</italic>., from Germany[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] was conducted to evaluate susceptibility of clinical isolates of <italic>P. acnes</italic> and the results have shown that nadifloxacin was superior to erythromycin and clindamycin as the MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values of nadilfloxacin against <italic>P. acnes</italic> were the least compared to the others.</p><p>A recently published randomized, vehicle controlled trial from Korea[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] has demonstrated that nadifloxacin 1% cream brought about a significant reduction of the inflammatory, non-inflammatory lesion counts in facial acne along-with a decrease in inflammation severities and IL-8 staining intensities in immuno-histochemistry studies. In contrast, no significant differences were observed for TGF-&#x003b2; intensity patterns.</p><p>The limitations of our study could be overcome by a double blind study of longer duration with simultaneous microbial susceptibility testing. This could further reinforce the scientific evidence.</p><p>The results of this study might be helpful for manufacturers to consider undertaking pharmacokinetic feasibility studies for preparing combination formulation of nadifloxacin and benzoyl peroxide for treatment of acne.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are thankful to the Medical officers of the Department of Dermatology, IPGMER, and SSKM Hospital.
