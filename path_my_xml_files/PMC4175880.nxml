Early treatment is most important for the relief of pain in patients. Currently, non-opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) including cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-2) inhibitors are available as medication regimens for chronic pain conditions like osteoarthritis. Although NSAIDs can effectively reduce pain and inflammation, prolonged use is reported to be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding, rise in blood pressure, heart failure and renal impairment. Due to high incidence of adverse events seen with non-selective and selective COX2 NSAID therapy, effective and safer alternative treatments for chronic pain conditions are urgently needed.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] All efforts to develop NSAIDs that spare these adverse events are still far from achieving a breakthrough.</p><p>Experimental pain models in healthy volunteers are advantageous for evaluation of analgesic action, as this is often difficult to assess in the clinic because of confounding factors which may be present in a diseased condition. These pain models minimize the gap between knowledge gained in animal and human clinical studies. These tests measure subjective pain after inducing pain.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In recent years, the gum resin extracted from the bark of an ancient herb, Boswellia serrata has gained considerable attention as a potent anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic and analgesic agent.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Its main pharmacologically active ingredients are &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; boswellic acid and other pentacyclic triterpenic acids which have been shown to inhibit pro-inflammatory processes by their effects on 5-lipooxygenase, cyclo-oxygenase and complement system. Out of all boswellic acids, acetyl-11-keto-&#x003b2;-boswellic acid is the most potent inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme responsible for inflammation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The pharmacokinetic variables of <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> are plasma half life is 5.97 &#x000b1; 0.95 hrs and the plasma clearance is 296.10 &#x000b1; 24.09 ml/min with maximum plasma concentration being 2.72 &#x000d7; 10-3 &#x000b1; 0.18 &#x003bc;moles/ml.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>A number of clinical studies support the anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties of <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> extract (BSE) and have showed a very good safety profile except mild adverse effects such as nausea, acid reflux and gastrointestinal upset.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] There are no serious, long term or irreversible adverse effects and no evidence of serious interactions.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In one study, they stated that BSE is a promising alternative to NSAIDs, which warrants investigation in further pharmacological studies and clinical trials.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Being a herbal drug, it was not evaluated in a traditional path of modern drug development (by using validated human pain models). Osteoarthritis is a mechanical joint disease in which weight bearing causes pain, hence we used mechanical pain model to see its activity in acute pain. Due to paucity of data available on the evaluation of analgesic activity on human pain models, we studied in healthy subjects to distinguish whether <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> is efficacious in reducing acute pain using one of the validated mechanical pain models[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] (Ugo basile analgesymeter) to provide the scientific validity for its analgesic activity as its anti-inflammatory activity is already proven on long term use.</p><p>The Primary endpoint of the study is mean percentage change from baseline in pain threshold force and time with <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> when compared to placebo and mean percentage change from baseline in pain tolerance force and time with <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> when compared to placebo. The Secondary endpoint is mean pain threshold force and time with <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> when compared to placebo at baseline and post treatment and mean pain tolerance force and time with <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> when compared to placebo at baseline and post treatment. Also, the safety and tolerability of <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> in healthy participants was assessed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted according to a protocol approved by the Institutional ethics committee and in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Participants with finger deformities and prior wounds or fractures on the tested extremity, pre-existing dyspepsia, gastritis, peptic ulcer, any acute or chronic drug or alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, inability to perform the test as per protocol procedure and participants using any analgesics, anti-inflammatory or any other drugs known to alter the pain sensation (topically and systemically) in the last 2 weeks were excluded. During the study period, subjects were not permitted to take any prescription and Over The Counter (OTC) medications. All the volunteers were housed in clinical facility and monitored for 48 hrs before dosing to ensure that the volunteers had abstained from any xanthine-containing food or beverages or alcoholic products and smoking for atleast 48 hrs prior to dosing and during each period.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Study Methodology</title><p>The healthy participants were trained on two separate occasions for the Randall Selitto test procedure using Ugo basile analgesymeter prior to participation in the study. The eligible subjects were randomized by computer generated random sequences in 1: 1 ratio to receive either two capsules (125 mg each) of <italic>Boswellia serrata</italic> (Shallaki<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or two identical placebo capsules as a single dose and efficacy of drugs was evaluated. Although the 99% of the drug is eliminated in 2 days, to be on safer zone and to avoid period effect of the analgesic model which induces pain (baseline value for pain would be reached with long washout period). After 2 weeks of washout period, they were crossed over in period 2 to evaluate the drug efficacy by the same procedures as in period 1.

Then, they were asked to perform the procedure as follows:</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Ugo Basile analgesymeter and Induction of Mechanical pain (Randall Selitto test)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPharm-46-475-g001"/></fig><p>Participants were asked to sit comfortably on a chair with eyes blindfolded. Participants were instructed to place the nail bed of index finger of non-dominant hand on a small plinth of Ugobasile analgesymeter, under a cone shaped pusher with a rounded tip [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Then, pedal switch was pressed by the investigator that exerts the force on the nail bed. The instrument is geometrically designed to increase the force on the finger at a constant rate of 80 grams per second (pressure of 54.42 g/cm.sec<sup>2</sup>). The participant was asked to lift his index finger of other hand when he first experienced pain and when he was unable to tolerate the pain. Then, pressure on the pedal switch was removed and the weight bearing arm of the instrument was lifted to release the pressure on the nail bed. Readings on the scale were recorded. Weight was lifted and moved left to place it in its original position.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] During the test procedure, the readings on the scale of the instrument were recorded when the subject first experiences pain (noted as pain threshold) and when he is unable to tolerate the pain (described as pain tolerance). Three readings were taken at 5 minute intervals. Then average of the three readings was taken and the force (in grams) exerted on the nail bed and the threshold time and tolerance time were calculated.</p><p>Each unit movement on the scale of the instrument corresponds to 50 gram force exerted on the index finger. For instance, if the reading on the scale is 11, then the force exerted will be 50 times the reading that is, 550 g. The subjects were given light breakfast after baseline reading and within 15 min of breakfast, study drug was administered as a single dose. At 1hr, 2 hrs and 3 hrs of drug administration, pain threshold force and time and pain tolerance force and time were recorded using the same procedure.</p><p>After two weeks of wash out period, the second drug (Run 2) was administered according to the randomization sequence and the same procedures were repeated.
