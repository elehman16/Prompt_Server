The mechanisms by which growth factors facilitate eardrum healing have been well studied. Growth factors trigger proliferation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts and promote revascularization, thereby accelerating TMP closure.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Clinical and experimental studies have suggested that topical application of EGF-2 improves the closure rate of traumatic TMPs and shortens the closure time.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> FGF-2 also promotes healing of glucocorticoid-induced TMPs.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> A few studies have shown that topical FGF-2 application facilitates the closure of chronic TMPs.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Kato and Jackler<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> treated chronic TMPs by applying 25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;L amounts of an FGF-2 solution delivered in a Gelfoam pledget every other day, for 6 days, in an experimental group [the control group received phosphate buffer solution (PBS)]. The closure rates were 81% in the FGF-2 group and 41% in the control group. EGF stimulates keratinocyte division in vitro and epidermal regeneration in vivo. Santa Maria et al<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> found that EGF played an important role in wound healing of the eardrum, facilitating keratinocyte proliferation and migration. Other studies have found that topical EGF accelerates the closure rates of acute TMPs of rats and chronic TMPs of chinchillas.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> A recent clinical study found that both EGF and FGF-2 accelerated the closure of large traumatic TMPs in humans; the healing outcomes afforded by the 2 growth factors did not differ significantly.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> However, prior clinical studies have focused principally on the healing outcomes afforded by single growth factors.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> There is a paucity of clinical randomized controlled trials comparing different growth factors and other agent solutions.</p><p>Ofloxacin 0.3% (w/v) drops contain a broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotic widely used in practice to treat acute and chronic otitis externa and suppurative otitis media.

The inclusion criteria were: a traumatic dry TMP; age &#x0003e;16 years; injury caused by a slap or blow to the ear, a blast, participation in sport, or direct penetration; and perforation of at least 25% of the pars tensa.</p><p>The exclusion criteria were: middle-ear infection or severe vertigo at the time of the initial hospital visit; ossicular chain damage or hyperplasia of granulation tissue (as revealed endoscopically and via computed tomography of the temporal bone); an additional (in particular, craniocerebral) injury associated with an inability to walk independently; and patient relocation from the region served by our hospital. Age, sex, date of injury, cause of injury, size of the TMP, and the presence or absence of otorrhea were recorded at the time of each hospital visit. Each patient was endoscopically examined after cerumen and/or blood clots in the external auditory canal (EAC) were removed. The tympanic membrane was photographed at the same time using a digital video camera, and the perforation size was recorded using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and expressed as a percentage of the entire tympanic membrane (TM) area.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> A large perforation was defined as a perforation extending over &#x0003e;25% of the entire TM.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> Pure-tone audiograms were obtained using a Genemed Synthesis Inc 10 audiometer in a quiet room, at the initial and final visits or at 6 months after traumatic injury or treatment.

The first follow-up occurred 2 to 3 days following treatment commencement. We confirmed that all patients correctly self-applied their drops. Dosages were carefully adjusted to ensure that the eardrum surface remained moist, thus neither dry nor overly liquid. Any inappropriate patient technique was corrected. Thereafter, follow-up was scheduled weekly until complete closure of the perforation was evident or for 6 months, whichever came first. Patients were advised to reduce the number of ear drops, and to take oral amoxicillin (with or without application of ofloxacin drops) if purulent otorrhoea developed. The tympanic membrane was repeatedly examined endoscopically, and color photographs were taken at all follow-up visits by a clinician blinded to treatment data.</p></sec><sec><label>3.4</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>To calculate the sample size, the study was powered at 80% and a type I error of 5% (&#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05) was used. A 15% difference in closure rate between the 3 treatment groups and control group was expected, and the sample size ratio of the EGF group, FGF-2 group, FLOX group, and control group was 1:1:1:1. With these values used to calculate sample size, it was determined that 44 patients were needed in each group using PASS software (ver. 11.0, Inc., Chicago, IL) software.

Among-group differences were compared by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) when the data were normally distributed. Post hoc multiple comparisons among groups were performed using the Bonferroni least significant difference test for homoscedasticity, and Dunnett's T3 test for heteroscedasticity.

Delayed healing may cause long-term tinnitus, conductive hearing loss, chronic TMP problems, and severe diminishment of quality of life.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> In recent years, some growth factors (e.g., EGF, FGF-2, and HA) have been used to aid TMP healing.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Of the many growth factors currently known, the most important in terms of eardrum healing are EGF and FGF-2.</p><p>The safety and effectiveness of EGF and bFGF used to treat TMPs have been well-demonstrated.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> This study also demonstrated that topical application of growth factors (EGF or FGF-2) significantly shortens the closure time compared to conservative treatment. In addition, we did not use scaffolding material nor did we approximate the perforation edges in our study. Each test group received only a single agent solution (EGF, FGF-2, or ofloxacin). Thus, some confounding factors were eliminated, and we considered that the promoting effects of traumatic TMP healing was mainly due to spontaneous healing of the eardrum and the biological effects exerted by these agents.</p><p>Theoretically, the healing outcome of the 2 growth factor groups was superior to that of the ofloxacin drops group. However, surprisingly, neither EGF nor FGF-2 significantly improved the closure rate or shortened the closure time relative to the ofloxacin drops group in this study. Most perforations closed completely within 1 to 2 weeks of the commencement of treatment in the 3 test groups. This unexpected finding raises certain questions: first, does the topical application of exogenous growth factors actually promote eardrum healing? Second, does ofloxacin act in a similar manner to growth factors? third, ofloxacin ear drops include a broad-spectrum quinolone antibiotic commonly used worldwide to treat acute, chronic, and suppurative otitis media in adults and children. Only an experimental study of ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone and ofloxacin on TMP healing showed ciprofloxacin/dexamethasone delays healing of experimental TMPs; however, isotonic sodium chloride solution control and ofloxacin-exposed TMPs healed at similar rates.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> There is no other evidence that ofloxacin accelerates eardrum repair per se.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Is a moist eardrum environment vital for healing regardless of the topical application of agents in solution?</p><p>Two previous studies have shown that neither closure rate nor closure time differed significantly between a low dose of growth factors and a PBS group, and it was recommended that the growth factor doses should be increased.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</sup> However, this may increase the risks of myringitis, otorrhoea, and other complications. In addition, long-term applications of high doses of growth factors may inhibit collagen synthesis, resulting in tympanic membrane reperforation and middle-ear cholesteatoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> It is important to note that an excessive middle-ear liquid environment may cause human ear discomfort and treatment interruptions or intermittent use of drops, thereby compromising healing. In this study, we constantly adjusted ear drops doses to ensure that the surface of the eardrum was moist, but not excessively dry or drenched.</p><p>Previous observations have suggested that moist TMPs healed more rapidly and completely than did dry wounds.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> Moisture prevents edge crust formation and outward epithelial migration. It also facilitates the actions of endogenous growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines, promoting epithelial cell and fibroblast growth and the establishment of a provisional wound matrix, accelerating, in turn, healing of the eardrum.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> We speculate that exogenous growth factors have minimal effects on eardrum healing; the moistness of the environment is the critical factor. Topical application of growth factors merely increases the local activities of endogenous factors, or remodels the biochemistry of spontaneous healing.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, an excess liquid (wet) environment impairs healing and damages surrounding tissue, triggering peri-wound maceration.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> A wet environment is associated with an increased incidence of middle-ear cholesteatoma.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> In addition, a recent experimental study demonstrated that an acidic pH environment speeded up the healing of traumatic TMPs by suppressing infection and reducing catabolic and proteolytic activities, and/or providing ongoing epithelization at the edges of the perforation. However, an alkaline pH delayed eardrum healing.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Ofloxacin ear drops constitute an acidic solution preparation.</p><p>None of our patients developed severe vertigo, external auditory meatus hyperkeratosis, or otomycosis. Some patients in the 3 test groups experienced ear discomfort and developed otorrhoea. The infection rates differed significantly among the 4 groups; the EGF and FGF-2 groups had higher rates of otorrhoea, and the infection rate in the ofloxacin drops group was lower. Perhaps because patients did not adequately control the numbers of ear drops, or because of individual differences in the structure of the EAC, the amounts of middle-ear liquid residue varied, triggering infections. However, ofloxacin has anti-inflammatory action. K&#x000e4;licke et al<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> found that topical growth factors enhanced infection of traumatic wounds. Surprisingly, infection did not inhibit TMP closure. A previous study found that secondary middle-ear infection did not compromise spontaneous healing of traumatic TMPs.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Most infected ears of all groups closed completely upon prescription of oral amoxicillin; neither the closure rate nor closure time of infected ears differed significantly among the 3 treatment groups in this study. In the observational group, none of the infected perforations had closed, rendering statistical analysis impossible. Previous studies have suggested that FGF-2 and EGF could reverse the inhibition of contraction caused by bacteria and indeed facilitated the healing of wounds damaged by bacteria.<sup>[<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> Other studies have reported that acute middle-ear infection actually induced TMP healing.<sup>[<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]</sup></p><p>The major limitations of our study are the lack of a saline control group and the absence of histological data. However, it is difficult to histologically examine the human eardrum. The use of saline alone to treat human TMPs is ethically problematic.</p></sec><sec><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Topical applications of EGF, FGF-2, and 0.3% (w/v) ofloxacin drops accelerated the closure of large human traumatic TMPs compared with conservative treatment. Surprisingly, neither the closure rate nor closure time differed significantly among the 3 treated groups. Topical application of 0.3% (w/v) ofloxacin drops aids in the healing of traumatic TMPs, and does not increase the rate of ear infections. Otolaryngologists should consider the drugs available, the economic circumstances of the patient, and the size of the perforation, to optimize treatment. In general, 0.3% (w/v) ofloxacin ear drops provide the most convenient treatment and should be considered in clinic for the treatment of traumatic TMPs. However, further experimental studies to demonstrate whether ofloxacin per se accelerates the healing of TMP will be interesting in the future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ANOVA = one-way analysis of variance, EAC = external auditory canal, EGF = epidermal growth factor, FGF-2 = fibroblast growth factor-2, HA = hyaluronidase, TMP = tympanic membrane perforation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Toner</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name><name><surname>Kerr</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name></person-group>
