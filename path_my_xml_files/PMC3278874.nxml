Indeed, emotion may be more primitive than cognition, and empirical data suggests that it is controlled by subcortical brain structures. It is well-established that emotions can affect many parts of the cognitive process, including attention-bias, memory,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] judgment, and decision-making.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Positive emotions, positive moods, and positive sentiments carry multiple, inter-related benefits. First, these good feelings alter people's mindsets. Experiments have shown that an induced positive affect widens the scope of attention,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] broadens behavioral repertoires,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and increases intuition[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and creativity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Second, good feelings alter people's bodily systems. Experiments have shown that induced positive affect, not only speeds the recovery from cardiovascular accidents following the effects of a negative effect,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] but also alters frontal brain asymmetry,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and increases immune function.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Third, good feelings predict salubrious mental and physical health outcomes. Prospective studies have shown that frequent positive affects predict (a) resilience to adversity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] (b) increased happiness,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] (c) psychological growth,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] (d) lower levels of cortisol,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] (e) reduced inflammatory responses to stress,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] (f) reductions in subsequent-day physical pain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] (g) resistance to rhinoviruses,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] and (h) reductions in stroke,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] and fourth, perhaps due to reflecting these effects in combination, good feelings may predict people's longevity. Several well-controlled longitudinal studies document a clear link between frequent positive affect and longevity,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] which is at least partially mediated by positive emotions, downregulating the effect of excessive or inappropriate sympathetic activation (stress, anxiety, or anger).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ruminative response to negative mood</title><p>Ruminative response to negative mood and other depressive symptoms are thoughts and behaviors that repetitively focus the individual's attention on his or her negative feelings and the nature and implications of those feelings.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Although many people feel compelled to ruminate about themselves and their problems when experiencing dysphoria and depression, converging empirical evidence suggests that such a coping style is associated with numerous deleterious outcomes. The most powerful evidence for the adverse effects of rumination comes from experimental studies that have recruited naturally dysphonic participants and induced them to ruminate in the laboratory (i.e., by instructing them to focus on their feelings, physical symptoms, and their characteristics) and then assessed these participants&#x02019; moods, cognitions, and behavior immediately after they have ruminated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] However, individual differences exist in the way people regulate their emotion. Women ruminated more than men.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] In addition, more concurrent depressive symptomatology, a large number of stressors, less perceived social support, optimism and neuroticism are related to more rumination.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Other influences contributing to preserve ratite self-focused processing and maintain emotional disorder consist of personality traits such as dispositional self-focus attention,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] and factors such as neuroticism, which may be related to the accessibility of negative self-knowledge and preference of emotion-focused coping strategies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Pathological worry</title><p>Repetitive negative thinking is a feature of most types of psychological dysfunctions. Depression is associated with rumination and anxiety for worry. Wells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] suggested that worry can be a form of coping. Even as, Brokovec and Inz[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] have emphasized that worry can serve as a cognitive avoidance function, which individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) use, to distract attention from a more distressing image. Davey[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] views worrying as involved in problem-solving under a condition of ascertaining. Worry has been defined by Wells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] as a chain of catastrophic thoughts that are predominantly verbal. It consists of contemplation of potentially dangerous situations and of personal coping strategies. It is intrusive and controllable, although it is often experienced as uncontrollable. Worrying is associated with a motivation to prevent potential danger. Worrying may itself be viewed as a coping strategy, but can become the focus of an individual's concern.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Physiological undoing</title><p>Beyond providing pleasant distractions, which put people's minds at ease, positive emotions also have a unique capacity to put people's bodies at ease. Negative emotions such as anger, fear, anxiety, even sadness and crying, arouse people's autonomic nervous systems, producing increases in heart rate, vasoconstriction, and blood pressure, as well as other changes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Laboratory experiments have shown that experiences of positive emotions can quell or undo the lingering cardiovascular effects of these negative emotions. In comparison with neutral distractions and sadness, positive emotions produce faster returns to baseline levels of cardiovascular activation, following negative emotional arousal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>It is important to note that the personal resources accrued through positive emotions are durable; they outlast the transient emotional states that lead to their acquisition. Consequently, the frequent incidental effect of experiencing a positive emotion is an increase in one's personal resources. Therefore, through experiences of positive emotions, people may literally transform themselves, becoming more creative, knowledgeable, socially integrated, healthy, and resilient. These various resources function as reserves that can be drawn on throughout life, to improve coping and odds of survival. Indeed, a study of the elderly found that those who expressed the most positive emotions in early adulthood lived up to 10 years longer than those who expressed the least positive emotions.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Study aims</title><p>To begin with, we have argued that numerous studies showing positive emotion can have an effect on an individual's function, but the present research wants to study the effects of positive emotion in preventing pathological worry and rumination from a metacognitive perspective. According to the metacognitive model, worry and rumination are maladaptive coping styles that cause emotional dysfunction and pathology and have more far-reaching deleterious effects associated with elaboration of self-knowledge and blocking adaptive restructuring. This research aims to study whether positive emotion decreases self-focused attention on negative emotion, as well as maladaptive coping strategies (worry and rumination). For this purpose, negative emotion was induced by manipulation (giving an examintation).</p><p>The major hypotheses in this study are as follows:</p><p>

That is the appropriate size of a sample for working with a group and the process of research, because the researcher should listen to the subjects and needs to give individual attention, which is time-consuming. There were two experimental groups and two control groups. The subjects did not know that they were being studied (the simple blind), while the researcher knew about the research situation and it could bias the results.

For this purpose and based on the research hypotheses, first, the mean, standard deviation, and other descriptive indices of research were computed. To study the effect of positive and negative emotion induction, the MANOVA analysis was employed. In order to compare worry and rumination scores of subjects, based on experiment and control groups, covariance analysis was used. In this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of positive and negative emotion on one clinical sample, so the pathological traits in the subjects were controlled using MMPI2. As mentioned earlier, rumination and worry were related to some individual traits such as neuroticism and self-focused attention (introversion),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] so these traits were controlled by using the factors of the NEO test, and they were also used for controlling differences related to gender; only girls were selected as subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Results concerning the descriptive statistics have been shown in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Mean and standard deviation of worry and rumination in pre-and post-tests</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-3-102-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Paired comparison of the level of worry of subjects according to their participation in groups, at the post-test stage</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-3-102-g002"/></table-wrap><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Bar mean diagram of remission of worry scores of subjects in pre-test and post-test</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-3-102-g003"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Mean bar-diagram of remission of rumination of subjects in the pre- and post-test</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJPVM-3-102-g004"/></fig><p>Hypothesis of this research studies the effect of inducing positive and negative emotions on worry and rumination caused by previous negative emotions (anxiety).</p><p>Results of MANOVA show that the differences among the four groups with regard to worry (F=8.17, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and rumination (F=12.28, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) are significant.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> shows paired differences between mean score of groups in post-test worry following controlling pre-test and personality traits scores.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> indicates, no significant differences can be detected in the level of rumination between experimental group 1 (group of negative emotion induction through sad movie) and the two control groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.05).

A key incidental outcome of this broadened mind set is an increase in personal resources: As individuals discover new ideas and actions, they build their physical, intellectual, social, and psychological resources, which fuel brain development. Similarly exploration increases knowledge and psychological complexity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Positive emotion broadens attention and cognition. Evidence supporting this claim comes from studies that have used global local visual processing paradigms to access biases in attention focus. Negative state-like anxiety, depression, and failure, predict local biases consistent with narrowed attention. However, positive states like well being and success predict global biases consistent with broadened attention.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>] Other experiments have shown that people with positive emotion are more flexible and creative.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In general terms, positive emotions enlarge the cognitive context, an effect linked to increase dopamine in the brain.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>] If positive emotions broaden attention and cognition, enabling flexible and creative thinking, they should also facilitate coping with stress and adversity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>] According to Wells and Matthews&#x02019; Self-Regulatory Emotional Function (S-REF) model[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] attention strategies, apart from the worry-based (rumination) strategies, the rest are central to emotional dysfunction. These strategies are self-focused processes leading to maladaptive processing routines that contribute to problem resistance and stress vulnerability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Therefore, important therapeutic aims should increase execution of attention and processing and interruption of repetitive self-attention processing. The findings show that induced positive emotion can be regarded as an intervention for interrupting self-focused attention and modifying the previous negative emotion.</p><p>This study has some limitations, such as: The researchers knew that they were doing research and this awareness and the differences in their personality traits and reactions to the participants could influence the result. Also the event that occurred during the intervention could bias the result.</p><p>The findings of the current research suggest that if positive emotion was induced by a movie, music, sport, entertainment, social facilities and supports, social communication, and so on, we could significantly reduce negative emotion following pathological effects. Some people respond to negative emotion by rumination and worry that leads to a sustained negative mood. Positive emotions influence health,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>] change attention from internal to external and new information, and broaden one's view, which provides a better solution to problems. These suggestions are especially useful to females, who ruminate and worry more.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>END NOTES</title><p>
