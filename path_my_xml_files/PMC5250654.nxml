</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is a non-receptor, cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase that is predominantly expressed in cells of hematopoietic lineage. It is an important mediator of immunoreceptor signaling in macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, and B cells.</p><p>In B lymphocytes, antigen-mediated stimulation of the B cell receptor (BCR) results in the recruitment and phosphorylation of various kinases, including SYK. Phosphorylation of SYK (pSYK) leads to the activation and amplification of downstream receptor signaling and likely plays a role in chemokine signaling and cellular responses such as proliferation, survival, differentiation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Uncontrolled BCR signaling via SYK has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several common B cell malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), marginal zone lymphoma, and B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Given the vital role of SYK in BCR signaling, inhibitors of SYK activity are an attractive therapeutic option for hematopoietic B&#x000a0;cell lymphomas and other non-Hodgkin&#x02019;s lymphoma histologies, where SYK inhibition would prevent BCR-mediated signaling and therefore prevent the uncontrolled growth of lymphoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>A number of molecules targeting the SYK pathway for allergic, autoimmune, and neoplastic disorders are currently in various stages of development. These include adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding site inhibitors (fostamatinib, CG14979, and P505-15), P-site inhibitors (C-61), antisense oligonucleotides, and small-interfering RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Clinical investigation of fostamatinib, the prodrug of SYK inhibitor R406, in B cell malignancies demonstrated responses in CLL/small lymphocyte leukemia (overall response rate [ORR] 55%), DLBCL (ORR 22%), MCL (ORR 11%), and FL (ORR 10%) following doses of 200 or 250&#x000a0;mg twice daily. Reported toxicities included diarrhea, nausea, hypertension, cytopenias, and fatigue, which limited dosing and have been partially attributed to off-target effects, including the inhibition of multiple kinases in addition to SYK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Entospletinib (GS-9973) is a highly selective and oral SYK inhibitor and is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for autoimmune and oncology indications. Entospletinib is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of SYK that disrupts kinase activity with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 7.6&#x000a0;nmol/L. A phase II study involving entospletinib 800&#x000a0;mg twice-daily oral administration in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41) showed a progression-free survival (PFS) rate of 70.1% (at 24&#x000a0;weeks), median PFS of 13.8&#x000a0;months, and an ORR of 61.0%. The most common treatment-emergent serious adverse events (AEs) included dyspnea, pneumonia, febrile neutropenia, dehydration, and pyrexia. Common Grade 3/4 laboratory abnormalities included neutropenia and reversible alanine aminotransferase/aspartate aminotransferase elevations. Overall, entospletinib demonstrated clinical activity in subjects with relapsed or refractory CLL with acceptable toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>This paper reports the results of the first-in-human (FIH) study conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of entospletinib in healthy volunteers following single- and multiple-dose oral administration. The data from this study provided the basis for subsequent testing of the safety and efficacy of entospletinib in cancer patients.</p><p>Further, this paper describes entospletinib pharmacokinetics following multiple-dose administration (doses of 100&#x02013;1200&#x000a0;mg twice daily) under fed conditions across additional healthy volunteer studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p>All study protocols were reviewed and approved by the local institutional review boards (all studies were conducted at Algorithme Pharma, Inc., Laval, QC, Canada). The studies were conducted in accordance with recognized international scientific and ethical standards, including but not limited to the International Conference on Harmonization guideline for Good Clinical Practice and the original principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki. These standards are consistent with the requirements of the US Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Part 312 (21CFR312) and the European Community Directive 2001/20/EC. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>The FIH study was a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single and multiple dose-escalation study, involving an oral tablet formulation of the mono-mesylate salt of entospletinib. Subjects received either single or multiple doses of entospletinib (or placebo) under fasted conditions (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>Entospletinib is a potent, highly selective, oral, small-molecule inhibitor of SYK that is being developed for the treatment of hematological malignancies. Entospletinib has greater than 14-fold selectivity for SYK versus other kinase targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and hence has the potential for an improved efficacy and safety profile in patients versus other SYK inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This paper reports the results of the FIH study conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of entospletinib in healthy volunteers following single- and multiple-dose oral administration under fasted conditions. Additionally, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics following entospletinib co-administration with food are presented.</p><p>Following single and multiple oral administration of entospletinib under fasted conditions, entospletinib concentrations showed a bi-exponential decline. Based on a terminal <italic>t</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> of ~9&#x000a0;h, entospletinib is suitable for a twice-daily dosing regimen. Entospletinib exposures increased in a less-than-dose-proportional manner at doses &#x0003e;200&#x000a0;mg, with exposures reaching a plateau at &#x0003e;600&#x000a0;mg twice daily. The solubility of entospletinib administered as a mono-mesylate salt is highly pH-dependent: its aqueous solubility is 3&#x000a0;mg/mL in pH 2 buffer but &#x0003c;0.001&#x000a0;mg/mL at pH &#x02265;3.0. As such, the absorption of entospletinib may be limited, particularly at high-dose levels, due to the pH-dependent solubility as it transits through the intestine during absorption and thus may explain the plateau in entospletinib exposures.</p><p>Further, there was an approximate 3- to 4-fold increase in entospletinib exposures following multiple doses that was greater than expected (~2-fold), given an average 9-h <italic>t</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>. Given a slight increase in <italic>t</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> between single and multiple doses, the accumulation may not be completely attributed to a non-linear systemic clearance mechanism (e.g., hepatic auto-inhibition), but is also likely due to increased extent of entospletinib absorption (e.g., auto-inhibition of intestinal metabolism/transport). Similar non-linear accumulation following multiple doses has been reported for other molecules (e.g., nefazodone; non-linear accumulation attributed to auto-inhibition of pre-systemic metabolism) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additional studies to characterize the disposition of entospletinib via metabolic/transporter-mediated pathways, and non-linear mixed-effects modeling-based population pharmacokinetic analyses are ongoing to elucidate the mechanism.</p><p>Food and food type can affect the pharmacokinetics of a drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]; therefore, entospletinib pharmacokinetics were evaluated following co-administration with a high-fat meal. A dose-dependent reduction in both the absorption rate (20&#x02013;70% reduction in <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> and <italic>t</italic>
<sub>max</sub> prolongation by ~2&#x000a0;h) and extent (20&#x02013;80% reduction in AUC) of entospletinib exposures was observed under fed conditions with comparable terminal <italic>t</italic>
<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>, suggesting a decrease in the total bioavailability of entospletinib without significant effect on total body clearance. The results may be explained by the pH-dependent solubility of the mono-mesylate salt, since food intake can increase pH in the gastrointestinal tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] (which appears to take precedence over the solubilizing effect of food on entospletinib).</p><p>The potency of entospletinib to inhibit SYK downstream of the Fc&#x0025b;R was determined in basophils. Crosslinking of the Fc&#x0025b;R by anti-IgE induces a phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) repeat in the Fc&#x0025b;R, thereby engaging and activating SYK. The resultant intracellular signaling can be monitored by an increase in the cell-surface expression of the activation marker CD63 in basophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, direct inhibition of pervanadate-induced SYK phosphorylation (at the Y525/526 autophosphorylation site) by entospletinib was evaluated in whole blood.</p><p>A good correlation existed between plasma entospletinib concentrations and the pharmacodynamic measurements; increasing entospletinib plasma concentrations resulted in greater suppression of CD63 expression/pSYK, with maximal inhibition observed at <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>. Furthermore, pharmacodynamic inhibition increased with doses of entospletinib up to 600&#x000a0;mg with comparable maximal inhibition at higher doses.</p><p>The estimated EC<sub>50</sub> values for inhibition of CD63 and pSYK were 429 and 110&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively. Therefore, at entospletinib doses of 600&#x000a0;mg twice daily or higher, the steady-state <italic>C</italic>
<sub>trough</sub> levels (approximately &#x0003e;1200&#x000a0;ng/mL) achieved would provide complete coverage of the pharmacodynamics EC<sub>50</sub> values throughout the 12-h dosing interval.</p><p>Based on the results shown previously, and considering the inter-individual variability, entospletinib 800&#x000a0;mg twice daily (fasted) was selected as the phase II dose to provide maximum drug exposure for subjects with malignant disease.</p><p>Overall, entospletinib was generally well-tolerated when administered as a single dose or in multiple doses. At higher doses, some subjects developed modest increases in indirect bilirubin, consistent with uridine 5&#x02032;-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)&#x000a0;1A1 inhibition (in vitro IC<sub>50</sub>&#x000a0;~&#x000a0;2.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Increases in bilirubin were not associated with other liver function test abnormalities. Increased transaminases were noted in six subjects, including two placebo subjects, and tended to be observed approximately 2&#x000a0;weeks after completion of the study drug. All elevated total bilirubin and transaminase levels returned to normal during follow-up.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Entospletinib exposures reached a plateau at 600&#x000a0;mg twice daily under fasted conditions, and provided &#x0003e;50% CD63/pSYK inhibition at <italic>C</italic>

Overall, entospletinib displayed an acceptable safety profile, supporting further clinical evaluation in cancer patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
