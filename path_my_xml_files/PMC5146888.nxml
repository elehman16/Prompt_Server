This pilot, multicenter, stratified, parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIa, feasibility clinical investigation will be performed in five Scandinavian intensive care units. Thirty-two subjects with early septic shock and organ failure, following adequate resuscitation, will be randomized to receive either: extracorporeal veno-venous hemoperfusion therapy with the LPS Adsorber or veno-venous hemoperfusion therapy with a placebo adsorber (without active LPS-binding peptide). Patients will be stratified by infection focus such that 20 subjects with an abdominal focus (stratum A) and 12 subjects with a urogenital focus (stratum B) will be included in a parallel design. Thereafter, an interim analysis will be performed and an additional 12 patients may be included in the study. The study is designed as adaptive a priori: the patients from this study can be included in a later phase IIb study. The aim of the study is to investigate the feasibility of LPS Adsorber therapy commenced early in the time-course of septic shock. The primary endpoint will be a characterization of all reported unanticipated serious adverse device effects and anticipated serious adverse device effects. Secondary outcomes are decrease in endotoxin plasma concentration, impact on clinical outcome measures and impact on inflammatory response by LPS Adsorber therapy, as well as detailed description of the relevant mediators bound to the LPS Adsorber.

Current management may be considered supportive only and consists mainly of effective antimicrobial therapy, removal or drainage of infections (source control) and support of failing organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Therefore, development of new treatment methods for sepsis and septic shock is crucial for medical, humanitarian and health-economic reasons.</p><p>Endotoxins are molecules found in the outer membrane of the cell wall in Gram-negative bacteria. They are potent activators of the inflammatory system through the innate immune system and are presumably the key triggers of the systemic inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Hence, attenuating the effect of endotoxins seems to be a logical and desirable strategy in the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock. However, so far the use of anti-endotoxin strategies has been disappointing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. On the other hand, adsorber therapy was proven beneficial in early sepsis patients due to intra-abdominal infections and added substantially to improved outcome in conjunction with conventional interventions. Improved outcome was associated with reduced endotoxin levels in blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that using adsorption membranes in the treatment of selected Gram-negative septic shock in the early phase, with a strictly defined time-frame since the onset of clinical symptoms, may offer therapeutic benefits. Several extracorporeal endotoxin-removal devices, based on various endotoxin-binding mechanisms, have been investigated with diverging results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Currently, at least one trial is investigating the effect of endotoxin removal with polymyxin B cartridges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Another endotoxin removal device based on a different concept is a novel, high-capacity adsorber system (from Alteco&#x000ae; Medical AB, Lund, Sweden) with a high-endotoxin-affinity-peptide endotoxin-binding mechanism (hereafter referred to as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Adsorber) that has been clinically available for some years. This adsorber putatively binds endotoxin and thus decreases endotoxin load in patients with Gram-negative sepsis. Case reports and series from patients with septic shock suggest that endotoxin removal could be achieved in clinical practice with LPS Adsorber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, no randomized controlled trial has investigated the potential benefits of this LPS Adsorber. LPS Adsorber is described as biocompatible and no specific side effects related to it have been reported.</p><p>We hypothesized that in patients with Gram-negative infections, early and extensive removal of endotoxin may limit the inflammatory response that characterizes septic shock. This LPS Adsorber can be used for endotoxin removal and, in this way, add to the currently available strategies for sepsis treatment.</p><p>The present clinical investigation aims to collect information on the feasibility and safety of LPS Adsorber therapy in patients with septic shock of presumed abdominal or urogenital origin. Secondary aims are to report the performance of the LPS Adsorber. Specifically, we wish to study the extent of endotoxin removal by the LPS Adsorber, its effects on organ failure development and the extent of organ support, as well as its possible impact on the inflammatory response.</p><p>This trial should contribute to new knowledge since it investigates a high-capacity peptide-binding-based endotoxin removal that can be run for longer periods and at higher blood flow that other endotoxin adsorbers. Moreover, unlike in other device trials, the LPS Adsorber will be compared to an identical LPS Adsorber cartridge without active LPS-binding peptide. Thus, a double-blinded randomized controlled trial will be possible to perform.</p><p>Finally, the ultimate objective of this pilot investigation is to provide the necessary information on the magnitude of the clinical effects of the LPS Adsorber, thus providing the basis for further investigations in a larger population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a pilot, multicenter, stratified, parallel, double-blinded, randomized, phase IIa, feasibility clinical investigation and is reported according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Subjects will be enrolled in accordance with an adaptive design, with an interim analysis allowing enrollment of additional patients until an adequate sample size is attained, to show the safety and the feasibility or lack thereof of LPS Adsorber therapy in the target patient population.</p><p>The study will be conducted in five general intensive care units (ICU) in Uppsala, Sweden, Bergen and Oslo, Norway, and Tampere and Kuopio, Finland. These ICUs will be screened around the clock to identify potential patients. Initially, 32 subjects admitted to the ICU with confirmed septic shock will be stratified in accordance with the origin of their suspected endotoxemia, i.e., 20 septic shock subjects with an abdominal focus (stratum A) and 12 subjects with a urogenital focus (stratum B) will be randomly allocated to the active LPS Adsorber group (Interventional Medical Device group, IMD group): current best practice in combination with LPS Adsorber therapy <italic>or</italic> placebo device group (control group): current best practice in combination with placebo adsorber therapy (identical LPS Adsorber cartridge without active LPS-binding peptide). The random allocation to either therapy arm in each stratum will be performed in a 1:1 ratio.</p><p>An interim analysis will be performed after all subjects in their corresponding stratum have completed their participation in the investigation to reveal whether 12 additional subjects are required.

Neither health care providers nor Steering Committee members, investigators or statisticians will have access to group allocation of subjects. The LPS Adsorber contains a designed synthetic peptide developed for endotoxin adsorption. The placebo comparator device differs from the LPS Adsorber only in that no peptide component (i.e, active component) has been attached to the matrix. Both the LPS Adsorber and the placebo device will be relabelled for the purpose of this clinical investigation. The investigational site(s) will be provided with emergency code break envelopes for all subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomization</title><p>Screening will be web-based. Patients are randomized to either the LPS Adsorber or placebo adsorber arms by being treated with a blinded cartridge on site starting with the lowest serial number.

This results in double-blinding, stratification by sepsis focus and randomization in blocks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to investigate the feasibility, safety and possible benefits of the LPS Adsorber in treating patients with septic shock with presumed endotoxemia of abdominal or urogenital origin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Secondary objective</title><p>The secondary objectives are:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To investigate the ability of the LPS Adsorber to reduce levels of endotoxin in plasma during and directly after treatment with the investigational device</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate the impact of the LPS Adsorber on clinical outcome</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate the impact of the LPS Adsorber on the inflammatory response in septic shock</p></list-item><list-item><p>To investigate the content bound to the LPS Adsorber in a subset of subjects after treatment end</p></list-item></list>

Given its role in triggering inflammatory responses, endotoxin could play a central role in inducing organ failure in Gram-negative sepsis. Endotoxin removal with an endotoxin-specific, high-affinity, high-capacity adsorber system is, therefore, an attractive therapeutic option. The LPS Adsorber used in this study fulfills these characteristics.</p><p>The key goal of this study is to identify patients who might benefit from endotoxin removal. This goal is achieved by including severely ill septic shock patients with presumed endotoxemia and initiating endotoxin removal therapy early. The objective of the ASSET study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of LPS Adsorber therapy and to provide data for further studies.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of patients started in September 2015.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p>Aspartate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CIP</term><def><p>Clinical investigation plan</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRRT</term><def><p>Continuous renal replacement therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>eCRF</term><def><p>Electronic Case Report Form</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIT II</term><def><p>Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia II</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICU</term><def><p>Intensive care unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMD</term><def><p>Interventional Medical Device</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LOS</term><def><p>Length-of-stay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MAP</term><def><p>Mean arterial pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RRT</term><def><p>Renal replacement therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAPS II</term><def><p>Simplified Acute Physiology Score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SIRS</term><def><p>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOFA</term><def><p>Sequential Organ Failure Assessment</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the TFS Trial Form Support AB for editing the protocol.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The study is sponsored by institutional grants from Uppsala University and by ALTECO Medical AB.
