effects of horseback riding (HR) and a dynamic (DHS) and static (SHS) horse riding
simulator (OSIM uGallop, Taiwan) on sitting ability of children with cerebral palsy.
[Subjects and Methods] Thirty children with cerebral palsy were recruited and randomly
assigned into three groups. Children received 30 minutes of exercise according to their
assigned group. The Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) and Gross Motor Function
Measure-66 (GMFM-66) sitting dimension were used to assess children in all groups both
before and after the interventions. [Results] Sitting abilities were significantly
improved after all interventions. Horseback riding showed the most improvement, followed
by the dynamic and static horse riding simulator groups. Horseback riding also showed a
significant improvement in the GMFM sitting dimension. [Conclusion] Horseback riding was
the best intervention for promoting sitting ability of children with spastic cerebral
palsy. However, a dynamic horse riding simulator can be a good surrogate for horseback
riding when horseback riding is not available.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Horseback riding</kwd><kwd>Horse riding simulator</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common disorder that causes physical disability in children
throughout life and begins in early childhood<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. More than half of children with CP have spasticity leading to
difficulties in controlling posture and movements required for adequate hand function and
learning<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Horseback riding is a
physical therapy intervention that aims to promote postural stability in children with
CP<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have indicated therapeutic
effects of horseback riding including improvement of postural stability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, increase of sensory inputs<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, decrease of muscle tone<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, increase of range of motion<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, facilitation of muscle synergy<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, and improvement of
postural muscle activities<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the
benefits have been widely reported, this intervention is often not available for most
children due to limited access to horses, unpredictable weather, relatively high cost, and
some children being reluctant to make contact with real horses. Therefore, the idea of a
dynamic saddle that imitates the movement of a riding horse by producing three-dimensional
movements similar to the horse walking pattern was suggested. Although the benefits of such
a dynamic horse riding simulator for children with CP have been reported<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, studies that have compared its effect
with that of horseback riding are scarce.</p><p>Assessment of subtle changes in sitting ability is required to monitor the effectiveness of
assigned interventions. The Segmental Assessment of Trunk Control (SATCo) is an evaluative
tool that examines sitting stability by means of level and type of trunk control<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The SATCo was created based on the idea
that upright trunk control involves functions from many biomechanical structures that
develop in a progressive manner. Thus, the SATCo evaluates trunk control level by the levels
of subunits, so called &#x0201c;functional segments&#x0201d;, including head, upper thoracic, mid-thoracic,
lower thoracic, upper lumbar, lower lumbar, and full trunk control. Each subunit assesses
three different aspects including static, active, and reactive control. According to Butler
et al., the interrater reliability and validity of the SATCo showed high correlation with
both the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) and the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM)
sitting dimension<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Instruction of using
SATCo has been published and no specific training was required. By using this test, specific
changes in sitting ability could be monitored by means of segments and types of control. For
assessing sitting ability by means of function, the Gross Motor Function Measure-66
(GMFM-66) sitting dimension is a standard measure generally used for clinical and research
purposes. Various methods of using and interpreting the GMFM have been provided to support
clinicians and researchers<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In order to detect the true outcomes gained from the provided intervention without the
interference of other factors, studies that focus on immediate therapeutic effects should be
used<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the immediate
effects of horseback riding (HR), a dynamic horse riding simulator (DHS), and a static horse
riding simulator (SHS) on sitting ability of children with spastic CP using a randomized
controlled trial. We hypothesized that HR would provide the best immediate effects compared
with the other two interventions; however, the imitated movements of a horse provided by the
DHS should at least provide better benefits than just sitting astride as in the case of the
SHS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty children, a sample size of 10 per group, were recruited from a rehabilitation

problems. A full explanation of the procedures was provided, and informed consent was
obtained from the parents or caregivers. This study was approved by the human research
ethics committee of Mahidol University.</p><p>One researcher was responsible for group assignment, assessment, and intervention in every
group. The participants, divided into three groups using stratified randomization by GMFCS
level, were assigned by drawing lots. Then, each child was pre-assessed with regard to
sitting ability by using the SATCo and GMFM-66 sitting dimension, respectively.</p><p>After pre-assessment, each child received an intervention according to his/her group
assignment. For the HR group, training was conducted by staff of the Faculty of Veterinary
Science, Mahidol University, who had experience in providing training for HR to children
with special needs. Three staff members including one who led the horse at a walk and two
who walked at the horse&#x02019; side ensured that the protocol was followed and that it was safe,
but they did not provide postural support to the child at any moment. The children were
placed on a saddle. They were instructed to hold a handle that was provided, and they always
wore a helmet while riding. The horse was led at a walk around an arena in the clockwise and
counterclockwise directions. The children were asked to actively adjust their postures. The
total horse riding time was 30 minutes. For the DHS group, the riding intervention was
administered with a mechanical horse riding simulator (OSIM uGallop, Taiwan). A monitor
playing an animated movie was placed in front of the machine to encourage the child&#x02019;s
attention throughout the riding session. The children were asked to sit astride comfortably
on a saddle and to hold onto a handle, and then the machine was turned on. The speed of the
machine was set at speed 1, which was approximately 60 cycles/minute. The children were
asked to actively adjust their postures. The training interval was 30 minutes. The examiner
and caregiver stood on either side of the child for safety throughout the riding session.
For the SHS group, the environment and setting were similar to those for the DHS group
except that the horse riding simulator was powered off throughout the training period. The
examiner and caregiver also accompanied the child in the same positions as described for the
DHS. The children were asked to sit astride the saddle and place their hands on a handle
while focusing on the monitor in front of them for 30 minutes.</p><p>After the intervention, the children in each group were reassessed within 10 minutes. Both
pre- and post-assessment data were collected by a pediatric physical therapist who had more
than 10&#x02005;years of working experience and was blinded to the group assignments. For the SATCo
assessment, the number of controlled segments for each type of control was determined for
three sitting ability outcomes including the static control score, active control score, and
reactive control score. For the GMFM assessment, the sitting dimension scores were
transferred to the WINSTEP software to convert the outcomes into a continuous scale using
Rasch analysis<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The final GMFM outcome
was called the sitting ability score.</p><p>The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows. A p-value of less than 0.05
was considered statistically significant. Since the SATCo data were not distributed
normally, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Kruskal-Wallis test were used for comparing
variables between before and after the intervention and among the three interventions,
respectively. The Mann-Whitney U test was applied for multiple comparisons of different
pairs of SATCo variables among groups. For the GMFM sitting ability score, analysis of
variance (ANOVA) was used for comparing changes across time and among groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>For the SATCo data, one child in the DHS group was excluded due to being fatigued and
noncooperative. Therefore, the total number of participants for the SATCo assessment was 29.
The within-group analysis for SATCo revealed significant differences between pre- and
post-intervention SATCo scores in all groups: the HR group showed significant differences in
static (p=0.038), active (p=0.026), and reactive control (p=0.006) scores; the DHS group
showed differences in active (p=0.034) and reactive control (p=0.034) scores; and the SHS
group showed differences only in the active control score (p=0.046). The between-group
analysis of SATCo scores was performed by subtracting the pre-intervention score from the
post-intervention score in each type of control. Only the reactive control score was
significantly different among the 3 groups (p&#x0003c;0.05). The results of the Mann-Whitney U
test with Bonferroni adjustment at p&#x0003c;0.0167 indicated that the reactive control score of
the HR group was different from that of the SHS group (p=0.004). No significant differences
were found between the HR and DHS groups or between the DHS and SHS groups.</p><p>There were no significant differences in the pre-intervention GMFM sitting ability scores
among the groups. However, the post-intervention scores revealed significant differences (F

(for the HR, DHS, and SHS groups), 2) machine or horse movements (for the DHS and HR
groups), and 3) the direct contact with a real animal (for the HR group).</p><p>Regarding sitting ability as measured by the SATCo, the children who received all three
stimuli (HR) showed improvements in static, active, and reactive control in sitting
positions. The children in the DHS group, who received no contact with real horses, showed
improvements in active and reactive control, whereas the children who received only the
astride sitting posture showed improvements in active control in sitting. When comparing the
groups, we found that the children in the HR group improved their reactive sitting control
the most, and this improvement was different from the improvement found in the SHS group.
The improvement of reactive control in the HR group was not different from that in the DHS
group. These results indicate that the reactive sitting control of children with spastic CP
could be improved through astride sitting on a moving saddle (DHS) or a real horse (HR). In
addition, sitting astride on a static saddle could improve active control in the sitting
position. Sitting astride a saddle could stretch the muscles of the lower extremities,
especially the adductor group, which always shows high muscle tension in children with
spastic CP. Prolonged stretching, e.g., 30 minutes, of lower extremity muscles can result in
decreasing spasticity<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>, and as a
consequence, an improvement in joint range of motion (ROM) can be observed<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, as a protective mechanism while sitting on a horse or a
mechanical horse riding simulator, children develop a strategy to prevent falling off and
for maintenance of their postures; therefore, body awareness in space is continuously
facilitated. In order to maintain their center of gravity (COG) within the base of support
while riding, children have to anticipate and compensate for their postural adjustments by
reducing COG displacement to remain safely on a moving surface. By shifting their body
weight in response to rhythmic movement, multiple sensory inputs and efferent motor outputs
from the CNS are constantly stimulated throughout a riding session in order to secure
balance and posture, eventually leading to an improvement in postural stability, equilibrium
reaction, and correction of upright alignment<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. These explanations therefore support the improvement of active and
reactive sitting control in the present study. For static sitting control, the outcomes
revealed that only the HR group showed significant changes in static control. The experience
of being in direct contact with a horse may play an important role in improving static trunk
control.</p><p>Regarding assessment of sitting ability by means of function, the pre-intervention GMFM
score did not differ between groups. After training, the GMFM sitting ability of children in
the HR group showed the most improvements and was significantly different from those of the
DHS and SHS groups. These outcomes are in agreement with previous research demonstrating
that horse riding provides benefits with respect to gross motor ability<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>; however, the
present study also shows that these benefits are greater than those derived using only a
dynamic or static horse riding simulator.</p><p>When comparing the HR and DHS results, one possible reason for the superiority of HR,
rather than just the use of a real animal, is the different quantity of sensory system
stimulation. In HR, the horse was led at a walk in several directions, such as straight
forward and turning left or right, and with different movement types such as unsteady speed
and walking patterns. The variety in horse direction and movement are believed to induce
more signals from proprioceptive and vestibular receptors through various postural
challenges. Although a mechanical simulator can produce three-dimensional movement that
mimic a horse walking<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, it cannot create the variety of movements of a riding
horse in its pre-set programs. In other words, a mechanical simulator creates a steady speed
and repeated movements similar to those of a horse walking straight ahead, but it does not
produce any directional challenge. Therefore, it creates the same postural challenge for the
rider at all times. In the DHS and SHS groups, improvements were found, but they were not
comparable with those of the HR group. The improvements in sitting function in these two
groups may have been due to decreasing the spasticity of the muscles around the pelvic and
hip joints, which consequently increased the pelvic ROM. In a study by Quint and Toomey
(1998) in which the pelvic angles of children with CP who received mechanical saddle and
static saddle training were compared, an improvement in tilted angles was found in both
groups, but it was more prominent in the mechanical saddle group<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. A static saddle also improves trunk extension, as
reported in study by Reid<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The DHS
group differed from the SHS group, as it was exposed to a 3-dimensional rhythmical movement
of the saddle. Therefore, we would have expected that aside the positive effects seen in the
SHS group, there should have been a further positive effect from the constant rhythmic
facilitation. However, this was not found in this study, and this might be due to the
limited training duration we used, as the immediate effects of the training were explored
after just a 30-minute session. In order to improve motor performance and sustain the
improvement, learning and practicing are key. Compared with the DHS, the positive effect of
muscle relaxation was not prolonged in the SHS group, and the sensory inputs and motor
outputs were not as highly stimulated as in the DHS group. Therefore, further examination of
the long-term effect of both training interventions is recommended for detection of possible
distinct performances.</p><p>As our primary objective was to explore immediate changes, an uncomplicated assessment tool
that would not require long duration of settings with a standardized measure was important.
Assessment of biomechanical changes, though give more specific details, requires long
duration to manipulate and it is not conveniently moveable. The assessment tools selected in
this study were standardized measurements. Although our method cannot give in-depth
quantitative details concerning how muscles activate or how the pattern of the COG changes
in response to an intervention, it provides sufficient functional outcomes to compare
alterations across time. The homogeneity of the children who participated in this study may
be both a strong and weak point. A strong point of the recruited participants is that they
all had the spastic diplegic type of CP, and thus no variations in the type of CP interfered
with the results of this study<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, this can also be considered a limitation, as the results of this study can be
interpreted with respect to only children with spastic diplegic CP and more specifically
those classified as GMFCS levels II-III. Herrero et al. found that children with less severe
CP can benefit from training more than children with more severe CP<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, future studies should compare the effect of
horseback riding and horse riding simulators on other types and severity levels of CP.</p><p>In conclusion, this study indicates high positive benefits of HR in children with CP.
Therefore, whenever possible, we recommended HR as the best intervention choice. However, if
the availability of horses is a problem, a DHS may be a good surrogate for horse riding.
Although the results showed that DHS was less beneficial than HR, it is believed that
combining DHS with the cooperation to increase somatosensory stimulation would induce
various HR-like effects. Examples of this in DHS training are setting various speeds of the
machine randomly, and motivating children to perform action-inducing multiple directional
challenge.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors sincerely thank Mrs. Kanjana Thipsook and the staff of the rehabilitation
