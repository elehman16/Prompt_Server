Yogic squats with specific hand position (<italic>Thoppukaranam</italic>), a physical act of worshiping the deity, are practiced throughout India (especially in the South). While practicing <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic>, devotees hold earlobes between thumb and forefinger with hands crossed in front of chest and perform repetitive squats. This is done 18 or 108 or 1008 times. General belief is <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> will bestow success in all endeavors. Further, it has been used as a form of punishment in schools. Even though not mentioned in any Vedic scriptures, it has been passed down as narration and is followed even today with great faith. Further, in Chinese Acupuncture therapy and Indian Ayurveda, earlobe is believed to contain energy meridians which correspond to the head. Moreover, in auricular therapy, ear is believed to correspond to whole body in shape of an inverted fetus curled in womb and the earlobe stands for the head.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Testimonial on super brain yoga&#x02212;a similar practice using the thumb and a finger to apply pressure to each earlobe while doing knee bends and taking breaths&#x02212;shows increased class participation, concentration, improved quality of academic performance and social skills in a sample of US school students.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] To our knowledge, there is no study to date using <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic>. Hence, current study examines the effect of traditional practice of <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> on cognitive and psychological states in healthy individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 36 undergraduate students from a residential Yoga University in Southern India were recruited for this study. The final sample comprised 30 volunteers (86.66% male), due to drop out. The reasons for dropout (a) not completed the orientation, (b) ill health and, (c) personal reason. Participants&#x02019; age ranged from 17 to 29 years with a mean age of 20.17 years (standard deviatio<italic>n</italic> =2.92). All reported having a normal or corrected vision. Those who had any history of psychological illness, heart disease, renal failure, recent surgery, joint pain, or any other debilitating condition, and unwillingness to participate in the study were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Design</title><p>This was a randomized self as control within-subjects design. Participants were assessed on 3 separate days in neuropsychology laboratory of the above university. Participants were counterbalanced randomly into three sessions: Baseline, control (squats), and yogic squats (<italic>Thoppukaranam</italic>) to minimize the order effect.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>ASSESSMENTS</title><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Sociodemographic questionnaire</title><p>A sociodemographic checklist was developed to document participants' basic information such as name, gender, age, level of education, and experience in yoga.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>d2 attention test</title><p>The d2 attention test is a timed test of selective attention and mental concentration.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The one-page test consists of 14 lines, each comprising of 47 characters of letters &#x0201c;d&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;p&#x0201d; with one to four dashes, arranged either individually or in pairs above and below the letters. The subject is required to scan across each line to identify and cross out all &#x0201c;d's&#x0201d; with two dashes. The subject is allowed 20 s per line. All other combinations of letters and dashes are considered irrelevant. In a series of tests-retests, and intervals of up to 40 months, d2 test indices, total number of items processed (TN), total performance (TN-E, where E is error), and concentration performance (CP) demonstrate satisfactory to good reliability (r &#x0003e; 70). Further, over a 5-h interval in adults, the test has shown good test-retest reliability.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>State trait anxiety inventory-short form</title><p>The state trait anxiety inventory-short form (STAI-SF) consists of two questionnaires of 20 items each. The first questionnaire measures state anxiety (how one feels at the moment); the second, trait anxiety (how one generally feels).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A standardized, short-form of STAI has been used for this study. STAI-SF consists of six items assessing the extent to which patients feel &#x0201c;calm,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;tense,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;upset,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;relaxed,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;content,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;worried&#x0201d; on a 4-point scale ranging from &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;very much.&#x0201d; Items consist of equal numbers of anxiety-present and anxiety-absent. Three items are scored in reverse order to avoid a response bias. The items were summed to produce a total score in which higher scores are related to greater anxiety. The six items STAI-SF demonstrated good reliability coefficient (r &#x0003e; 82).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>State mindful attention awareness scale</title><p>The SMAAS is a valid tool for measuring state mindfulness.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The scale is designed to assess the short-term or current expression of a core characteristic of mindfulness; this is a receptive state of mind and sensitive awareness of observing the present moment. The SMAAS draws items drawn from the trait form of the MAAS (e.g., &#x0201c;I'm finding it difficult to stay focused on what's happening in the present&#x0201d;). SMAAS has shown excellent psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha = 92).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants were briefed on the purpose and nature of the study. Confidentiality was assured as part of the research process. Eligible participants were briefed on the study and informed consent approved by the institutional ethics committee was obtained. Eligible participants underwent familiarization on the practice of <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> and squats for a period of 10 days. They were also familiarized with procedure of assessment tools. During baseline session, participants completed the psychological state and attention test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Experimental session (<italic>Thoppukaranam</italic>)</title><p>Participants practiced 108 rounds of <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic>. The procedure for <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> was to squat with specific hand position. The procedure for squat was a modified form of the Mayo Clinic's practice.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Instructions are as follows: Stand with your feet slightly apart, greater than shoulder width and toes pointing ahead. The hands cross over each other (left over right), maintaining a gentle pressure holding the earlobes throughout with thumb in front and the finger to the back. Slowly descend, bending through hips, knees, and ankles, and stopping when knees reach a 90&#x000b0;angle. Then return to the starting position. Keep the back in a neutral position and abdominal muscles tight. Do not flatten the curve of the lower back or arch back. Keep knees centered over feet while going down. Do not let knees roll inward or outward. Keep movements smooth and controlled with normal breathing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Control session (squats)</title><p>Subjects practiced 108 rounds of squats with the same instructions as <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> but with variation in hand positions.

Findings suggest that the practice of <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> has an immediate effect on selective attention and CP compared to baseline and squats. Further, <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> session shown enhanced mindfulness and reduced state anxiety compare to baseline. As per our knowledge, there is no previous report specific to <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> on cognitive function and psychological states for comparison. But the findings are consistent with anecdotes regarding the effect of super brain yoga, a similar practice.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The positive effect of physical activity on attention has been reported in previous research.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Studies also indicate that coordinated exercise increases one's attention.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The aspect of physical activity was consistent in both squats and <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic>. The component of holding the earlobes seen only in the practice of <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> may account for the significant improvement in attention scores. Overall, the reduction in state anxiety and increased present moment awareness may be cited as a possible mechanism for the improved performance. Further, the role of stimulating acupuncture points on earlobes may enhance attention performance.</p><p>While this study resulted in important findings, the results have to be considered in light of several limitations. Representation of males and females ratio was not equal and small sample size does not allow for generalization of the findings to a realistic population. Moreover, neither physiological measurements nor the lasting effect of intervention was assessed. Furthermore, the study used a mix of novice and long-term yoga practitioners who were part of an on-going residential yoga course. Therefore, it is unclear what effect the yoga practice had in influencing the participants&#x02019; performance and psychological states.</p><p>Though <italic>Thoppukaranam</italic> has been practiced throughout India, there has been no formal research studies carried out to understand the effect of the practice to date. This is the first attempt to study the effect of the practice. Future studies could measure physiological parameters using brain imaging techniques to understand the mechanism and fallout period of the effects. It is also recommended to include comparison of unguided individual practice across various age groups with varying needs such as students in primary, secondary, or tertiary level educational institutes as well as those with special needs, developmental and behavioral disorders.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We are especially grateful to S-VYASA Yoga
