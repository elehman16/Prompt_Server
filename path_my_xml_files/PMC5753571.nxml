Recent evidence demonstrates that not all patients with asthma have a typical type 2 (T2)-driven eosinophilic inflammation. These asthmatics have been called &#x02018;T2-low asthma&#x02019; and have a minimal response to corticosteroid therapy. Adjustment of corticosteroid treatment using sputum eosinophil counts from induced sputum has demonstrated reduced severe exacerbation rates and optimized corticosteroid dose. However, it has been challenging to move induced sputum into the clinical setting. There is therefore a need to examine novel algorithms to target appropriate levels of corticosteroid treatment in difficult asthma, particularly in T2-low asthmatics. This study examines whether a composite non-invasive biomarker algorithm predicts exacerbation risk in patients with asthma on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (&#x000b1; long-acting beta agonist) treatment, and evaluates the utility of this composite score to facilitate personalized biomarker-specific titration of corticosteroid therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">Patients recruited to this pragmatic, multi-centre, single-blinded randomised controlled trial are randomly allocated into either a biomarker controlled treatment advisory algorithm or usual care group in a ratio of 4:1. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients with any reduction in ICS or oral corticosteroid dose from baseline to week 48. Secondary outcomes include the rate of protocol-defined severe exacerbations per patient per year, time to first severe exacerbation from randomisation, dose of inhaled steroid at the end of the study, cumulative dose of inhaled corticosteroid during the study, proportion of patients on oral corticosteroids at the end of the study, proportion of patients who decline to progress to oral corticosteroids despite composite biomarker score of 2, frequency of hospital admission for asthma, change in the 7-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-7), Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ), forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV1), exhaled nitric oxide, blood eosinophil count, and periostin levels from baseline to week 48. Blood will also be taken for whole blood gene expression; serum, plasma, and urine will be stored for validation of additional biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">Multi-centre trials present numerous logistical issues that have been addressed to ensure minimal bias and robustness of study conduct.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02717689">NCT02717689</ext-link>.

The WHO has estimated UK disability adjusted life-years per 100,000 population for asthma to be greater than diabetes and breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In subjects with mild disease, currently available treatments work well but, in 10&#x02013;20% of patients with asthma, their condition is difficult to control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These patients consume 50&#x02013;60% of the healthcare costs attributed to asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and cost approximately five-times more than patients with mild stable disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This high morbidity and disproportionate use of healthcare resources reflects the considerable un-met need in this patient group, and their significance for healthcare providers.</p><p id="Par34">Asthma has been traditionally &#x02018;stratified&#x02019; on the basis of response to &#x02018;step-wise&#x02019; incremental treatment, with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy forming the cornerstone of this approach. However, more recently, asthma has been stratified on the basis of inflammatory phenotype to better understand disease heterogeneity with a view to developing biomarkers of therapeutic response and for better targeting of both new and existing treatments. Using sputum analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and more recently whole genome expression profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], it is clear that even in mild steroid-naive asthma approximately 50% of patients do not have a typical type 2 (T2)-driven eosinophilic inflammation, and are called &#x02018;T2-low asthma&#x02019; patients. Perhaps more significantly, on the basis of the normal diagnostic criteria for asthma, this T2-low group is indistinguishable from the typical &#x02018;T2-high&#x02019;/eosinophilic group. However, in the context of therapeutic response, the T2-low patients have a minimal response to ICS therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In severe disease, the T2-low profile is also prevalent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], and in case series of difficult-to-treat patients with asthma there is substantial evidence that inappropriate escalation of corticosteroid treatment is frequent, with significant morbidity due to systemic corticosteroid exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In a follow-up analysis of the largest &#x0201c;real-world&#x0201d; refractory asthma cohort to date in the British Thoracic Society Difficult Asthma Network in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] the most common therapeutic intervention in specialist centres was the addition of systemic corticosteroid treatment, with approximately 60% ending up on oral corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par35">Given the evidence that corticosteroid responsiveness is minimal in the absence of T2-driven inflammation, there is a need to examine novel algorithms to target appropriate levels of corticosteroid treatment in difficult asthma, particularly in patients with low T2 biomarkers. Patients with high T2 biomarkers are at risk of severe exacerbations (e.g. baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;45&#x000a0;ppb predicts frequent exacerbation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]), and in this group the key clinical question is whether this is because of non-adherence to inhaled corticosteroid treatment or whether they have relative corticosteroid-resistant T2-high asthma and require additional treatment with biological drugs that target T2 mechanisms (e.g. antibodies that inhibit interleukin (IL)-5 or IL-13 signalling). Previous studies in severe asthma have shown that titrating corticosteroids against sputum eosinophilia may be efficacious without increasing cumulative ICS burden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], but a sputum monitoring strategy has not been widely taken up in most secondary or tertiary care settings because it poses practical implications that make it difficult to deliver in the clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In a number of studies FeNO monitoring has not shown utility in disease management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Whereas improved disease outcome was demonstrated in mild asthma in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], the value of FeNO in managing corticosteroid adjustment in more severe disease is uncertain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Periostin is a secreted matricellular protein associated with fibrosis whose expression is upregulated by recombinant IL-4 and IL-13 in cultured bronchial epithelial cells. Measurement of serum periostin has been shown to be superior at identifying airway eosinophilia (defined as a composite of bronchial biopsy or sputum eosinophilia) than sputum alone or FeNO alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], although this was not seen in another study when looking at sputum eosinophilia alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">We have examined the value of a composite biomarker strategy using FeNO, blood eosinophils, and serum periostin together to predict exacerbation risk in the placebo arms of clinical trials with lebrikizumab (anti-IL-13) and omalizumab (anti-IgE) in patients taking at least 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g fluticasone propionate (FP) and a second asthma controller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].

Patient safety is monitored by documenting AEs and the procedures described below for expedited reporting. All AEs reported or observed during the study are recorded on the AE page in the electronic case report form (e-CRF).

SAEs suspected by the investigator to be associated with study procedures are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e. within 24&#x000a0;h after learning of the event). Given the hypothesis-generating nature of this study, the Sponsor may choose to conduct an interim efficacy analysis. The decision to conduct an interim analysis and the timing of the analysis will be documented in the statistical analysis plan prior to the conduct of the interim analysis. The interim analysis will be performed and interpreted by members of the Trial Management Group and RASP-UK Executive Management Team.

The RCR is a centrally administered group of facilities for the long-term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g. DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides). The purpose of collecting this sample is to determine genetic factors that may predict response to glucocorticoids, as well as to understand the relationship between heritable factors and response to any therapy typically used in the treatment of uncontrolled asthma, clinical features of uncontrolled asthma, or safety events. The DNA sample may also be useful in the discovery of new drug targets or to identify new biological pathways involved in asthma, developing biomarker or diagnostic assays and to establish the performance characteristics of these assays, and increasing knowledge and understanding of inflammatory diseases and their biology.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Schedule of study procedures. <italic>ACQ-7</italic> 7-item Asthma Control Questionnaire, <italic>AE</italic> adverse event, <italic>AQLQ</italic> Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire; <italic>BMI</italic> body mass index, <italic>BP</italic> blood pressure, <italic>(e-)CRF</italic> (electronic) case report form, <italic>FeNO</italic> fractional exhaled nitric oxide, <italic>SAE</italic> serious adverse event, <italic>Temp</italic> temperature</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2384_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><p id="Par94">An important exploratory objective of this study is to phenotype exacerbations in both arms.

The rationale for using the differential randomisation ratio is to allow adequate capture of exacerbation events in the biomarker arm, thus enabling phenotyping of exacerbations in this group. Randomisation is also stratified by asthma control (ACQ-7&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1.5 vs&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1.5) and use of &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; steroids during the past 12&#x000a0;months.

This will provide point-of-care clinical trial data capture, which assigns a unique identifier number at the time consent is given. All data are therefore anonymised and only linked to patient-identifiable data held securely and locally at the individual NHS clinical sites. This system ensures that all data points are completed at data entry and data entry errors are minimised. Data checking and cleaning and review will be performed prior to data lock and transfer into the knowledge management system.

Composition, roles, and responsibilities of these groups can be obtained by contacting the clinical monitors (Niche Science and Technology Ltd.). As a representative of the sponsor, Clinical Research Associates from this company visit the investigator and study facilities at periodic intervals, in addition to maintaining necessary telephone and email correspondence. The monitor maintains current personal knowledge of the study, including recruitment progress, through observation, review of study records and source documentation, and discussion of the conduct of the study with the investigator and staff. All aspects of the study are being carefully monitored by the sponsor or its designee for compliance with applicable government regulation with respect to current GCP and current standard operating procedures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>End of trial/early patient withdrawal</title><p id="Par101">The final study visit occurs 48&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation when all patients have a final assessment. At this visit, patients have blood samples collected for measurement of periostin levels and other on-study measurements (spirometry, ACQ-7, FeNO, PAXgene, and serum sampling). Exacerbations and any additional treatment in the final study month as well as other concurrent treatment are recorded. Subjects are also asked which treatment adjustment arm they were in during the study (biomarker versus standard care). The study will be considered complete with the last study assessment for the last patient participating in the study.</p><p id="Par102">Patients will be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the local PI or Chief Investigator (CI) should anything happen that would adversely affect their participation or clinical care or require them to have conflicting treatment, e.g. increased steroid use for inflammatory or haematological conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par103">As a multi-centre trial, there have been numerous logistical issues that have been addressed to ensure minimal bias and quality and robustness of study conduct. This study has been designed to be pragmatic and therefore more reflective of routine clinical management of patients with severe asthma, and this will enable the results to be more clinically relevant and applicable. In developing this protocol, the RASP-UK Consortium formed a public and patient representative group to gain input from patient representatives. Furthermore, patient representatives have been involved in ongoing review of participation and site issues.</p><p id="Par104">The pragmatic nature of this study necessitated a single-blind study design. In a normal clinical setting, patients who are managed according to their symptoms, lung function, and exacerbation history (i.e. the standard care arm in this trial) are advised of any changes to their corticosteroid treatment on the day of their visit with a clinician, whereas a biomarker-based strategy introduces a delay to this clinical decision. To mimic this within the study, the personnel performing the study visits must therefore be unblinded regarding treatment group allocation. However, automated algorithms are used for both arms to produce treatment advice that is intended to remove any individual clinician bias. All subjects receive the same follow-up advisory phone call after the study visit to advise that the biomarker data are available and have advised a reduction, increase, or maintenance of current treatment to ensure subjects remain blinded to the intervention.</p><p id="Par105">All centres within this study are being monitored by a Clinical Research Organisation (CRO) specialising in healthcare research delivery. Remote monitoring of data collection via the eCRF is also possible, permitting timely identification of incomplete or missing data and standardization of AE/SAE reporting. Furthermore all study co-ordinators have been provided with standardized worksheets reinforcing consistency in data collection.</p><p id="Par106">Recruitment to date has been variable across sites for numerous reasons, i.e. differences in patient demographics and disease presentation, variability of medical record keeping and access to historical spirometry assessments, staffing issues, and patient engagement in other pharmacological studies. Strategies to promote and increase recruitment have been employed, e.g. weekly emails to all sites with tips for successful recruitment practice for more actively recruiting sites, continual CRO engagement with individual sites to troubleshoot difficult pre-screening scenarios, and coordinator teleconferences to allow direct interaction between all coordinators. In doing so, discrepancies regarding reasons for exclusion at the pre-screening stage have been identified and resolved.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par107">Recruitment is currently active at all 12 sites.
