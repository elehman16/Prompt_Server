In the test group (10 patients), mucosa was treated with a PRF membrane. In the control group (21 patients), implantation was realized without soft tissue augmentation. Tissue thickness was measured at point of implant insertion (baseline) and at time of reentry after 3&#x000a0;months. Standardized digital radiographs were obtained for evaluation at time of implant placement, reentry after 3&#x000a0;months and at a 6-month follow-up. Data was analyzed by an independent examiner.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>After 6&#x000a0;months, all 31 implants were osteointegrated. Soft tissue augmentation with PRF led to a significant tissue loss.

Previous studies have shown that this process is characterized by a remodeling of the horizontal and vertical bone dimension with a range of 0.7 to 3&#x000a0;mm within the first year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>First attempts to reduce this loss of tissue focused on changes of implant shapes, implant surfaces, implant position, and abutment design. The concept of &#x0201c;platform switching&#x0201d; seemed to be the most promising step in this process. H&#x000fc;rzeler et al. and Vela-Nebot et al. reported a reduced loss of bone substance with platform-switched abutments when compared to regular abutments after a 6-month loading. Cochran et al. and Canullo et al. support this thesis, whereas Becker et al. could not report any histological differences between platform-switched and regular abutments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, initial bone modeling could not be fully avoided in the abovementioned studies.</p><p>A second approach to reduce bone loss is the altering of peri-implant soft tissue. Berglundh et al. showed that the peri-implant mucosa has many features in common with the gingiva around natural teeth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Around implants, a biological constant is formed comparable to the biological width, characterized by a thick epithelial layer of 2&#x000a0;mm and a suprabony connective tissue layer of 1&#x000a0;mm. Abrahamsson published similar results, showing that the dentogingival complex around implants ranges from 3.5&#x000a0;mm to 4&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Lindhe et al. reported that thinning or destruction of this tissue thickness leads inevitably to peri-implant bone resorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This implies that the existence of a minimum of peri-implant mucosa thickness is crucial for the long-term stability of the bone level.</p><p>Linkevicius et al. showed that the initial tissue thickness influences crestal bone changes around implants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. After 6&#x000a0;months, the group of patients with thin tissue (up to 2&#x000a0;mm) had a mean bone loss of 1.35&#x000a0;mm+/&#x02212;0.33 SD, whereas patients with normal tissue or thick tissue (3.1&#x000a0;mm and more) showed significantly less bone loss (0.32&#x000a0;mm+/&#x02212;0.44 SD and 0.12&#x000a0;mm+/&#x02212;0.52 SD, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>As a consequence, recent research focused on soft tissue augmentation of thin gingiva types prior to or simultaneous to implant insertion. Wiesner et al. published a significant gain of soft tissue by thickening the gingiva with a connective soft tissue graft harvested from the palate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Soft tissues at augmented sites were 1.3&#x000a0;mm thicker than on control sites and had a better pink esthetic score. However, this technically sensitive procedure did not lead to less peri-implant bone loss (0.8&#x000a0;mm in the grafted group, 0.6&#x000a0;mm in the non-grafted group after 1-year loading).</p><p>Lai et al. and Linkevicius et al. reported a successful vertical augmentation of soft tissue by using an acellular dermal matrix membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, Linkevicius showed that thickening with an allogenic membrane resulted in significantly reduced initial bone loss (0.21-mm bone loss in the augmented group, 1.17-mm bone loss in the control group after 1-year follow-up) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Another attempt to influence the peri-implant bone structures is the use of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF). This second-generation platelet concentrate described by Choukroun et al. is a fibrin matrix enriched with cytokines, circulating progenitor cells, and growth factors which can be used as a resorbable membrane in surgery. Studies show a constant release of growth factors such as PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) or TGF-b (transforming growth factor) for at least 1&#x000a0;week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] up to 28&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and proved its accelerating effect on the healing process. The application of PRF has been tested in various disciplines of dentistry so far. However, no data of vertical soft tissue augmentation with PRF has yet been published.</p><p>The aim of this randomized, controlled clinical trial was to evaluate whether the use of PRF is suitable for soft tissue thickening of the peri-implant mucosa and to assess the marginal bone level changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient selection</title><p>Patients aged 18+ who required an implant in the posterior mandible were eligible for this study.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>general contraindications to implant surgery</p></list-item><list-item><p>insufficient oral hygiene and periodontitis</p></list-item><list-item><p>patients with a history of severe periodontitis</p></list-item><list-item><p>bone augmentation required</p></list-item><list-item><p>smokers</p></list-item><list-item><p>substance abuse</p></list-item><list-item><p>uncontrolled diabetes</p></list-item><list-item><p>severe cardiovascular problems</p></list-item><list-item><p>treated or under treatment with intravenous amino-bisphosphonates</p></list-item><list-item><p>pregnant or lactating.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The study was conducted in accordance with the standards of the Declaration of Helsinki of 1983 and was approved by the ethics committee of the FEKI (Freiburger Ethik-Kommission International, Feki Code: 014/1210).

The randomization to control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) and test group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) was achieved using a sealed envelope system at time of surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Clinical procedure</title><p>All patients had to undergo a professional dental hygiene treatment in advance. One hour prior to surgery, patients were given an antibiotic single shot prophylaxis (600&#x000a0;mg clindamycin). PRF was obtained from each patient of test and control groups and treated according to the PRF protocol with an IntraSpin&#x02122; table centrifuge and collection kits provided by Botiss (Zossen, Germany).</p><p>After anesthesia with Ultracain&#x000ae; DS-forte (articaine&#x02009;+&#x02009;adrenaline 1:100,000), crestal, lingual, and buccal tissue thickness was tested using an endodontic micro-spreader (Spreader ISO 30, Dentsply Maillefer&#x000ae;) with a silicon stop (illustration <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The instrument part penetrating the soft tissue was measured with an endodontic longimeter. Measured data was rounded off to the nearest half millimeter (mm).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Illustration 1</label><caption><p>Measurement of tissue thickness with an endodontic micro-opener</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40729_2016_44_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>The initial preparation of the split-flap was carried out the same way in test and control groups using microsurgical instruments. After a crestal incision with a microsurgical blade (SM69, Swann Morton LTD&#x000ae;, Sheffield, England), the split-thickness flap was sharply prepared by elevating the area of the single tooth gap to the middle of the adjacent teeth. The periosteum was split to receive a tension-free adaption of the flaps (illustration <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Fully threaded titanium implants (Nobel Speedy Replace&#x000ae;, Nobel Biocare, Zurich, Switzerland) were inserted at bone level with primary stability. The implants varied in diameter (narrow platform 3.5&#x000a0;mm, regular platform 4.0&#x000a0;mm, wide platform 5.0&#x000a0;mm) and in length (10&#x000a0;mm, 11.5&#x000a0;mm, 13&#x000a0;mm) (illustrations <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>, and <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). For the further procedure, patients were now randomized by a dental assistant using a sealed envelope system. In the test group, the tissue was augmented with a PRF membrane using a double-layered technique. In the control group, the implant treatment was realized without mucosa thickening (illustrations <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>).

Choukron and his associates introduced this technique to implant dentistry to improve bone healing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. According to his studies, the natural fibrin framework protects growth factors from proteolysis, so they can stay active for a longer period (up to 28&#x000a0;days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). This leads to an effective neovascularization and an accelerated wound closing with less post-operative infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Though PRF has been tested successfully in surgical procedures with reference to hard tissue augmentation (sinus lift, socket preservation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and in the field of periodontal regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], publications of PRF usage in combination with soft tissue augmentation are rare and allow no real conclusion so far.</p><p>The first assumption that comes up is whether the higher tension on the flaps caused by the additional volume of the PRF membranes was adequately compensated. This can be clearly affirmed. Split flaps were expanded widely until the middle of the adjacent teeth. In addition to that, a very sensitive suture material was used to secure an adaption completely free of tension (illustration <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). The essential point that needs to be critically reviewed in this study is the insertion of PRF in combination with a split-flap technique. The bilayered insertion of PRF allows a better nutrition of the augmentation material itself and avoids higher peri-implant bone loss due to trauma and infection of the periosteum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, this highly technique-sensitive procedure requires much experience. Moreover, the initial thin mucosa is split into two extremely thin layers. A sufficient nutrition of the flap requires a minimum flap thickness of 0.8&#x02013;1.2&#x000a0;mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Since the blood supply of these flaps with reduced thickness cannot be provided only from the lateral, additional nutrition from the periosteum and the bone is necessary to maintain a livid flap. This may explain the punctual dehiscence above the implant itself, which occurred in all 10 test patients. According to the authors&#x02019; observations during this study, the nutrition problem coming up with the split-flap technique seems to be the crucial factor for the poor results with reference to soft tissue thickening.</p><p>With respect to marginal bone loss, it could be shown that there were no significant differences when comparing dimension of bone loss between test and control groups. The study of present research data shows, to the best knowledge of the authors, no other RCTs about tissue thickening with PRF and peri-implant bone loss. However, several studies focused on mucosa thickening with tissue grafts and assessed the marginal bone loss around implants. Hehn et al. and Wiesner et al. achieved a stable mucosa thickening by augmenting the initial situation with a tissue graft taken from the palate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Whereas Hehn could show a reduced bone loss after 12&#x000a0;months, Wiesner&#x02019;s results show no difference in bone loss between test and control sides.</p><p>A second technique is the use of membranes. Lai et al. postulated a successful, long-term stable augmentation by using an acellular dermal matrix (ADM group increased by 3.10+/&#x02212;0.64&#x000a0;mm at 12&#x000a0;weeks, control group increased by 0.30+/&#x02212;0.50&#x000a0;mm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Puisys et al. focusing on the coherence of membrane tissue augmentation and peri-implant bone loss show similar results. They came to the conclusion that initial soft tissue augmentation with an allogenic collagen matrix resulted in a long-term stable thickened mucosa. Furthermore, the bone loss around implants was significantly less when implants were placed in naturally thick tissue than in thin tissue. Bone loss 1&#x000a0;year after surgery around implants with a thin mucosa was 1.22+/&#x02212;0.08&#x000a0;mm bone loss mesially and 1.14+/&#x02212;0.07&#x000a0;mm distally. Around implants placed in a thick mucosa, it was 0.24+/&#x02212;0.06&#x000a0;mm mesially and 0.19+/&#x02212;0.06&#x000a0;mm distally. The attempt to thicken thin mucosa with an allogenic membrane resulted in highly reduced bone loss (0.22+/&#x02212;0.06&#x000a0;mm mesially and 0.20+/&#x02212;0.06&#x000a0;mm distally after 1&#x000a0;year) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>One limitation of this study is the standardized radiographic evaluation. This technique allows information about the peri-implant bone only on the mesial and distal but not on the buccal and lingual side. However, this fact is limiting most present studies focusing on the peri-implant bone level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Yet, the main limitation of this study is the small number of patients. For this reason, these findings cannot be generalized to soft tissue augmentation with PRF on this study alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Soft tissue augmentation with PRF using a split-flap technique cannot be recommended to alter thin gingiva types.
