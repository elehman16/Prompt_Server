Individual patient data were pooled into three groups by disease condition: diabetic peripheral neuropathy or postherpetic neuralgia (n=514), spinal cord injury (n=356), and fibromyalgia (n=498). Responders were classified as having a &#x02265;30% and/or &#x02265;50% reduction in mean pain score from baseline; once a patient responded, they were not scored subsequently (and were excluded from the responder analysis).

Similarly, a greater understanding of when the most common adverse events (AEs) emerge or worsen could aid physicians and patients, particularly in cases where anticipation of mild AEs could facilitate improved medication adherence. Researchers designing proof-of-concept studies for new pain conditions could be guided by information on how quickly a treatment effect with pregabalin could be observed. Such information could help researchers avoid conducting unnecessarily long proof-of-concept studies. This is important, as guidelines for improving assay sensitivity in chronic pain clinical trials recommend shorter durations for proof-of-concept studies in order to maximize assay sensitivity.<xref rid="b16-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> At the same time, shorter duration proof-of-concept studies would be less expensive and would reduce the exposure of patients to a potentially ineffective therapy.</p><p>This study aimed to investigate the treatment response over the first 6 weeks of clinical trials of flexible-dose pregabalin in all chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is an approved treatment option to determine when patients first respond to treatment and when new AEs emerge or worsen. In these trials, it was decided on a weekly basis over the first 3&#x02013;4 weeks of the trial if each patient&#x02019;s dose should be adjusted based on pain relief and AEs, after which patients completed the trial receiving their optimal dose. As the pregabalin dose was tailored to the patient&#x02019;s needs, this type of study design is a better representation of real-world clinical practice<xref rid="b17-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> than a fixed-dose design, used to establish, typically for regulatory purposes, an effective dosing range for a population rather than an individual.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a pooled analysis of patient level data from five randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, double-blind trials of flexible-dose pregabalin.

Similarly, the majority of the most common AEs in these trials had emerged within the first 3&#x02013;4 weeks.</p><p>The total proportion of responders to emerge within the first 6 weeks in this analysis was similar to the proportion of responders reported at endpoint in each of the trials included in this analysis. For instance, the proportion of 30% responders at endpoint reported in the FM trial included in this analysis was 40.4% with pregabalin and 30.6% with placebo.<xref rid="b24-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This is slightly lower than the proportion reported here, presumably as not all patients maintained a 30% response for the entire 15 weeks of the trial. Similarly, proportions of 30% responders at endpoint in the SCI (42% pregabalin, 16% placebo<xref rid="b5-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> and 45.7% pregabalin, 31.4% placebo<xref rid="b23-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and DPN/PHN (59.0% pregabalin, 37.1% placebo<xref rid="b20-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and 64.0% pregabalin, 52.0% placebo<xref rid="b21-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) trials were similar to the total proportion after 6 weeks in this analysis.</p><p>These data suggest that new proof-of-concept studies could be limited to as little as 3 weeks in duration as this time frame would be sufficient to capture the majority of responders and the most common AEs. For clinical practice, these data indicate that while most patients who will respond do so within the first 3&#x02013;4 weeks, smaller numbers of new responders continue to emerge at weeks 5 and 6. Physicians treating patients with therapeutic doses of pregabalin can expect that if a patient will respond, it will likely be within the first 4 weeks; however, in some cases, it may be worthwhile to continue treatment for 6 weeks. This finding is not dissimilar to the reported time to onset for some antidepressants when improvement in depression is the primary endpoint. For example, while most patients who will ultimately respond to fluoxetine treatment do so within the first 2 weeks, approximately 25% of patients who respond only do so after 4 weeks of treatment.<xref rid="b27-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Thus, if a patient has demonstrated a minimal or partial pattern of response to treatments for pain in the past, it would be important to observe the patient for a full 6 weeks on pregabalin, in order not to miss a pain response that could occur late in treatment.</p><p>DPN, PHN, neuropathic pain due to SCI, and FM are distinct diseases with only broad similarities as chronic pain conditions. This analysis looked at each of these conditions as they represent all of the chronic pain conditions for which pregabalin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a treatment option.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> As such, this analysis may offer guidance to physicians treating patients with pregabalin as an approved option. At the same time, the emergence of new responders and the majority of common AEs within 3&#x02013;4 weeks in each of the conditions included in this analysis will give greater confidence to researchers planning a proof-of-concept study of pregabalin for another chronic pain condition that they will be able to observe most responses within this time frame.</p><p>The IMMPACT (Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials) considerations for improving assay sensitivity in chronic pain clinical trials recommend shorter durations for proof-of-concept studies in order to maximize assay sensitivity.<xref rid="b16-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> At the same time, results from a proof-of-concept trial with too short a duration may become a limitation when it comes to designing a longer duration confirmatory trial.<xref rid="b16-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> As such, finding the appropriate length for a new proof-of-concept trial in chronic pain can be challenging. Any data that can guide the decision-making process would be of great benefit. These analyses support the use of a 3- to 4-week proof-of-concept trial for pregabalin in chronic pain conditions.</p><p>These analyses included pregabalin data only from studies and treatment arms with a flexible dosing design, as this design is a closer representation of the recommended approach in clinical practice where pregabalin should be carefully titrated to the highest tolerable dose.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b17-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The recommended dosing for pregabalin in the USA is up to a maximum of 300 mg/day for DPN, between 300 and 600 mg/day for PHN, up to a maximum of 600 mg/day for SCI, and between 300 and 450 mg/day for FM.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> For all conditions, it is recommended that treatment start at 150 mg/day and escalate to 300 mg/day within 1 week based on individual efficacy and tolerability.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Each of the trials in this analysis started with all patients receiving 150 mg/day before escalation to higher doses each week. As such, the emergence of 30% responders in this analysis after 1 week (15.0% with DPN/PHN, 19.0% with SCI, and 9.6% with FM) suggests a small degree of effectiveness of pregabalin, in some patients, before the optimal dose is reached. However, not all patients will respond to pregabalin at 150 mg/day, as also indicated here with higher numbers of responders at weeks 2 and 3. Current clinical guidelines support careful escalation to the highest tolerable approved dose,<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b17-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> with the reported average maintenance dose in the studies included in this analysis being &#x02265;370 mg/day.</p><p>Consistent with previous studies,<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b28-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> these analyses demonstrated that the most common AEs with pregabalin (somnolence and dizziness) typically emerge within the first 2 weeks. Other common AEs in these trials also tended to emerge within the 6 weeks of this analysis. One possible exception was increased weight in patients with FM (with 14 of 39 total instances<xref rid="b24-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> emerging in the first 6 weeks). This observation is consistent with previous analyses indicating that increased weight typically emerges following a longer period of pregabalin treatment (&#x0003e;56 days).<xref rid="b29-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>The ability to anticipate which AEs may emerge, and when, could potentially improve adherence to pregabalin, by managing patient expectations. Some observational studies of pregabalin have reported lower rates of AEs and this has been credited to ongoing discussions between physicians and their patients regarding potential AEs.<xref rid="b30-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It could be that this is related to a reduction in the patient&#x02019;s anxiety, which then alters how they would perceive the occurrence of a mild AE.<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>A prior analysis of 31 clinical trials of pregabalin in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain conditions demonstrated that the majority of incidences of some common AEs were transient and resolved prior to the end of their study.<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> For dizziness and somnolence, respectively, median times to resolution were 9.0 and 14.0 days, with 74.5% and 64.8% of incidences resolving prior to the end of the study.<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-303" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Although it was not a part of the current analysis, this suggests that the majority of cases of somnolence and dizziness would emerge, and then improve or resolve, within the first 4&#x02013;6 weeks of treatment.</p><p>The data in this analysis suggest that the majority of new responders and new AEs emerge within the first 3&#x02013;4 weeks of treatment with pregabalin. These data could advise researchers planning new proof-of-concept studies of pregabalin in pain conditions and also guide clinical management of patients with DPN, PHN, neuropathic pain due to SCI, and FM.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was sponsored by Pfizer.
