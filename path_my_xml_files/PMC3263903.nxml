Increased platelet activation in patients with diabetes is reflected by elevated levels of platelet microparticles, which are small circulating procoagulant vesicles shed from the platelet membrane upon activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Low-dose aspirin therapy is one of the cornerstones in the management of CVD; however, the preventive effect seems reduced in patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Aspirin inhibits platelet function by irreversibly acetylating a serine residue in cyclooxygenase-1, thereby grossly reducing the production of the platelet-activating and vasoconstrictive compound thromboxane A2. This is the most accepted effect of aspirin in terms of cardiovascular protection. However, aspirin also may influence coagulation through effects on thrombin generation, factor XIII activation, and fibrin network formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The fibrin network is an important part of the arterial thrombus, and its structure may influence the predisposition to atherothrombotic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). During thrombin activation, fibrinopeptides are released from fibrinogen, which polymerize and, in the presence of factor XIII, form a cross-linked fibrin network. The structure of the fibrin network is influenced by the environment in which it is formed and affects the fibrinolytic rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). A tighter and less permeable fibrin network, which is less susceptible to fibrinolysis, is formed in patients with manifest CVD or conditions associated with increased risk of atherothrombotic complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In previous studies, we have shown that patients with type 1 diabetes have reduced fibrin network permeability and that improved metabolic control is associated with increased fibrin network permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The altered fibrin network in patients with type 1 diabetes may in part be attributed to increased fibrinogen glycation, as shown in studies on fibrinogen purified from diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Treatment with aspirin increases fibrin network permeability in nondiabetic subjects, possibly through acetylation of lysine residues on plasma fibrinogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). However, the effect of aspirin on fibrin network permeability in patients with diabetes is unclear. Possible competition between acetylation and glycation on lysine residues in the fibrinogen molecule might contribute to the reduced preventive effect of aspirin in the management of CVD in patients with diabetes, and higher doses of aspirin might be required in these patients.</p><p>The primary aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of low- and high-dose aspirin treatment on fibrin network permeability in patients with type 1 diabetes. The secondary aim was to investigate the possible interaction between the treatment effects of aspirin on fibrin network permeability and glycemic control in these patients. Because platelet microparticles may influence the fibrin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and because aspirin has well-known effects on platelet function, we also measured plasma concentrations of platelet microparticles.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>A crossover study with randomization to receive a daily dose of 75 or 320 mg aspirin (Trombyl; Pfizer) was designed. The 4-week treatment periods were separated by a 4-week washout period. Investigations were performed at the start and the end of each treatment period. Compliance was checked through tablet counts.</p><p>A total of 24 patients (12 women) with good glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003c;7.4%) and 24 patients (12 women) with poor glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;8.4%) were recruited from the Division of Medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Eligible for the study were patients with type 1 diabetes between the ages of 30 and 70 years, without previous aspirin treatment, ongoing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory or anticoagulant treatment, or a history of macrovascular events. Data on retinopathy status was based on fundoscopic findings. All patients arrived at the laboratory in the morning after a 10-h fast. Clinical signs of peripheral neuropathy were investigated with tests of vibration and superficial sensation using a vibration fork (128 Hz) and monofilament (Semmes-Weinstein 5.07), respectively. Prevalence of albuminuria was assessed by urinary dipstick tests (Clinitek; Bayer HealthCare).</p><sec id="s6"><title>Fibrin network</title><p>The fibrin network structure was studied in citrated plasma samples by measurement of the permeability coefficient (<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>), as described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In brief, plasma samples were dialyzed and supplemented with CaCl<sub>2</sub> and thrombin to final concentrations of 20 mmol/L and 0.2 NIH/mL, respectively. The fibrin network permeability coefficient (<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>) was determined following percolation of a TRIS buffer through the formed fibrin clots at five different hydrostatic pressures. Low levels of <italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub> indicate reduced fibrin network permeability. The interassay coefficient of variation was 9.5%.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Platelet microparticles</title><p>Previously frozen platelet poor plasma was thawed and centrifuged at 2,000<italic>g</italic> for 20 min at room temperature.

Twenty-microliter samples were incubated for 20 min with Phalloidin-Alexa 660 (Invitrogen, Paisley, U.K.), lactadherin&#x02013;fluorescein isothiocyanate (phosphatedylserine exposure; Hematologic Technologies, Essex Junction, VT), and CD42a-PE (glycoprotein IX; Abcam, Cambridge, U.K.). Microparticles were measured by flow cytometry on a Beckman Gallios instrument (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) according to a modified method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). The microparticle gate was determined using Megamix beads (BioCytex, Marseille, France), which is a mix of 0.5-, 0.9-, and 3-&#x003bc;m diameter beads. Appropriate conjugate isotype-matched immunoglobulin with no reactivity against human antigens was used as a negative control to define the background noise of the cytometric analysis. The mean concentration of microparticles was calculated as follows: (microparticle counts &#x000d7; standard beads/liter)/standard beads counted (FlowCount; Beckman Coulter).</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Biochemical analyses</title><p>HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels were analyzed by the Mono S method using high-performance liquid chromatography (Variant II; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and are expressed in National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program equivalent values.

Furthermore, we found that the effect of high-dose aspirin on fibrin network permeability was more pronounced in patients with poor metabolic control.</p><p>The fibrin network structure seems important in the development of atherothrombotic events, because individuals at high risk of CVD, including patients with type 1 diabetes and nephrotic syndrome, as well as patients with manifest CVD, have a tighter and less permeable fibrin network structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Our previous studies in patients with type 1 diabetes have shown increased fibrin network permeability during treatments with subcutaneous continuous insulin infusion, statins, and dalteparin, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). These studies indicate that fibrin network permeability (<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>) is a functional variable suitable for intervention studies.</p><p>Aspirin alters the fibrin/fibrinogen properties and thereby influences the fibrin network structure, possibly through acetylation of the lysine residues in the fibrinogen molecule involved in cross-linking of fibrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). This cyclooxygenase-independent effect of aspirin may add to the antithrombotic effects of aspirin. Increased fibrin network permeability during aspirin treatment has been shown in healthy individuals at daily doses of 37.5, 75, and 320 mg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In the current study, no effect of low-dose aspirin treatment (75 mg) was found on fibrin network permeability (<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>) in patients with type 1 diabetes, whereas treatment with 320 mg aspirin increased <italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub> levels significantly. Our results thus indicate that patients with type 1 diabetes may require higher doses of aspirin to influence the fibrin network structure. This finding supports the hypothesis that diabetes is associated with a reduced response to aspirin compared with nondiabetic subjects and that higher aspirin doses, rather than the recommended low-dose treatment (defined as 75&#x02013;162 mg/day, according to the American Diabetes Association), are required in the management of CVD in patients with diabetes.</p><p>One plausible explanation behind the observed dose-dependent effect of aspirin on fibrin network permeability in diabetes is increased glycation of fibrinogen molecules in plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). It has been suggested that glycated fibrinogen may have reduced susceptibility to acetylation by aspirin, and competition between glycation and acetylation of fibrinogen amino groups has been observed in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In support of this theory, interaction between acetylation and glycosylation in lysine residues has also been indicated in studies on plasma albumin, as the glycosylation rate of lysine residues was inhibited during simultaneous incubation with aspirin and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). In the current study, however, subgroup analyses assessing the possible influence of glycemic control on the treatment effects of aspirin on fibrin network permeability did not support the theory of competitive inhibition between acetylation and glycation on plasma fibrinogen, since the effect of high-dose aspirin treatment was more pronounced in patients with poor glycemic control. Of note, the baseline <italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub> levels tended to be higher in patients with good glycemic control compared with patients with poor glycemic control (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Thus, aspirin might be too weak a modifier of the fibrin network to have a substantial impact on fibrin network permeability in diabetic patients with relatively high baseline <italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub> values, as in the patients with good glycemic control in the current study.</p><p>Plasma fibrinogen concentration, per se, also has a significant impact on the fibrin network structure, and, accordingly, the fibrinogen levels in the current study were inversely related to fibrin network permeability coefficient (<italic>K</italic><sub>s</sub>) levels at all investigation time points. Increased fibrinogen levels are an independent risk marker for CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and elevated levels are common in patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In line with earlier studies, we found significantly higher levels of plasma fibrinogen in patients with poor compared with good glycemic control.</p><p>Because platelet microparticles may influence the fibrin network formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and because aspirin has well-known effects on platelet function, we measured the plasma concentration of platelet microparticles in the current study. However, no effect of 75 or 320 mg aspirin was found on plasma concentrations of platelet microparticles. Thus, it is unlikely that the aspirin-induced increments of fibrin network permeability were mediated through effects on platelet microparticles.</p><p>We conclude that treatment with high-dose aspirin (320 mg) is required to increase fibrin network permeability in patients with type 1 diabetes. The observed lack of effect with low-dose aspirin may contribute to aspirin treatment failure in diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
