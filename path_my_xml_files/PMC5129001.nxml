The aim of the current trial is to assess the effectiveness of the Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure (HOME BP) intervention for the self-management of hypertension in primary care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The HOME BP trial will be a randomised controlled trial comparing BP self-management&#x02014;consisting of the HOME BP online digital intervention with self-monitoring, lifestyle advice and antihypertensive drug titration&#x02014;with usual care for people with uncontrolled essential hypertension. Eligible patients will be recruited from primary care and randomised to usual care or to self-management using HOME BP. The primary outcome will be the difference in mean systolic BP (mm&#x02005;Hg) at 12-month follow-up between the intervention and control groups adjusting for baseline BP and covariates. Secondary outcomes (also adjusted for baseline and covariates where appropriate) will be differences in mean BP at 6&#x02005;months and diastolic BP at 12&#x02005;months; patient enablement; quality of life, and economic analyses including all key resources associated with the intervention and related services, adopting a broad societal perspective to include NHS, social care and patient costs, considered within trial and modelled with a lifetime horizon. Medication beliefs, adherence and changes; self-efficacy; perceived side effects and lifestyle changes will be measured for process analyses. Qualitative analyses will explore patient and healthcare professional experiences of HOME BP to gain insights into the factors affecting acceptability, feasibility and adherence.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has received NHS ethical approval (REC reference 15/SC/0082). The findings from HOME BP will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications, scientific conferences and workshops. If successful, HOME BP will be directly applicable to UK primary care management of hypertension.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN13790648">ISRCTN13790648</ext-link>; pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PRIMARY CARE</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution><institution-id>http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP-PG-1211-20001</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study develops existing efficacious antihypertensive titration procedures into an online format.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Home and Online Management and Evaluation of Blood Pressure (HOME BP) combines medication intensification with lifestyle change and behavioural support.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study has been designed to facilitate implementation within a primary care context.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Blood pressure (BP) is a key risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the largest cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The health survey for England (2012) identified that &#x0223c;31% of men and 27% of women in England have hypertension,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> yet over one-third of all treated patients currently fail to reach national guidelines for BP control.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The mean BP in the UK currently ranks among the highest in Europe (27th/35), and the benefits of a population-wide reduction to levels seen in countries such as Denmark and Spain (which are among the lowest) would mean a 10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg systolic blood pressure (SBP) reduction.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> A 10&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg reduction in BP is estimated to lead to a 41% reduction in stroke and a 22% reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> New strokes affect over 120&#x02005;000 patients per annum in the UK, and stroke is the third leading cause of death and the most important cause of adult disability, representing 4.4% of direct National Health Service (NHS) costs (notwithstanding costs to social services, patients and carers).</p><p>Factors responsible for suboptimal BP control include those due to patients, physicians and the health system.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The key patient factors are adherence to medication and other health behaviours.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Clinical inertia is another key issue, whereby clinicians fail to intensify treatment, despite evidence of inadequate control. It is estimated that clinical inertia may account for almost 20% of the variance in BP control,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> with evidence suggesting that treatment intensification fails to occur in nearly half (45%) of consultations in which patients had a single BP reading above target, and around a third (36%) with two successive readings above target.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Lack of intensification may be due, in part, to the &#x02018;white-coat effect&#x02019;, where BP readings in clinic consultations are elevated in comparison to self-monitored home BP readings;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> awareness that clinic readings may be inaccurate may contribute to clinician and patient reluctance to implement medication changes. Even with self-monitoring of BP, clinical inertia can be profound.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>There is evidence that self-monitoring BP at home is useful in improving medication adherence, reducing therapeutic inertia and controlling BP,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> and research by our team and others has shown that sustained reductions in BP can indeed be achieved by linking self-monitoring to preplanned medication titration when hypertension is uncontrolled.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;21</xref> It can also detect and treat masked uncontrolled hypertension.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> While some evidence suggests that aggressive titration of antihypertensive medication without behavioural support is optimal for controlling BP,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> further evidence suggests that greater reductions in BP may be achieved by the addition of behavioural support for self-monitoring.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> This may be further facilitated when combined with efficacious lifestyle changes, such as weight reduction, sodium restriction and increasing physical activity,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> therefore HOME BP will combine all of these components.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Rationale and risk-benefits for the current trial</title><p>Increasingly widespread access to the internet and mobile phones<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> means that healthcare digital interventions (DIs) (also known as online interventions or computer-based health interventions within the literature) are accessible to the majority of patients and can be used to provide information and support at any time the patient needs it.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> DIs can empower patients by providing better access to personalised information and support for active involvement in treatment and self-management.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> A large meta-analysis found a small but significant positive effect of DIs on health-related behaviours,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> while a Cochrane review found evidence that computer-based health interventions for those with chronic health conditions significantly improved knowledge, health behaviours and clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> DIs have the potential to make significant savings by automating routine aspects of patient education, monitoring and support, freeing up health professional resources for when patients most need them.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> There is accumulating evidence that DIs can deliver better and more efficient healthcare in the context of hypertension,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> confirmed by a recent systematic review and meta-analysis undertaken by our team.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> Therefore, the HOME BP programme has been developed to incorporate previously identified effective intervention components (self-monitoring, preplanned medication titrations and behavioural support) delivered in an acceptable and feasible online format.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Study aims and research questions</title><p>The primary aim of the HOME BP trial is to assess the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of adding the HOME BP intervention (comprising the HOME BP online DI, self-monitoring, medication titration and lifestyle interventions with nurse support) into primary care for the self-management of hypertension in comparison to usual care.</p><p>Main research question:

Records of potentially eligible patients will be further screened by general practitioners (GPs) to remove participants known to meet exclusion criteria. Remaining potentially eligible patients will be invited by letter from the practice to attend a baseline clinic to establish eligibility, take consent, collect baseline data and randomise consented patients. Individuals not wanting to take part will be provided with a form to return should they wish to decline to take part in the trial. This will ask for basic demographic information and their reasons for declining, including an option not to give a reason if they prefer not to. The practice nurse (or other practice member as delegated by the lead GP) will have the option to follow-up invited patients by telephone after 1&#x02005;month without response. All patient identification prior to consent will be conducted independently of the research team to maintain confidentiality.</p></sec><sec id="s2b2"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Eligibility criteria will aim to capture adult patients with treated but uncontrolled hypertension managed in primary care who will be aged 18 or over, have a Read code for hypertension in the clinical record (confirming hypertension), a current prescription of antihypertensive medication and a mean BP reading (calculated from the second and third BP readings) of &#x0003e;140/90&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg taken during a baseline clinic appointment. Eligible patients will also be required to have access to the internet and be able to comprehend the website.</p></sec><sec id="s2b3"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Exclusion criteria will include an inability to self-monitor (eg, diagnosis of dementia), a mean baseline BP reading of &#x0003e;180/110&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (stage 3 hypertension requiring more urgent intervention than would be available in the trial), hypertension not managed by family doctor (the trial facilitates primary care titration of medication), prescribed more than three antihypertensive medications (ie, resistant hypertension), chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 4&#x02013;5 or CKD stage 3 not managed by the GP (likely to be under specialist care and requiring different BP targets), terminal disease or other condition which in the opinion of the family doctor makes them inappropriate to take part, pregnant or breast feeding, a history of proteinuria (albumin creatinine Ratio (ACR) &#x0003e;30&#x02005;mg/mmol) (different BP targets), postural hypotension (&#x0003e;20&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg systolic drop after 1&#x02005;min standing) (for whom intensification of BP medication may be inappropriate), atrial fibrillation (self-monitoring with oscillometric equipment not suitable), an acute cardiovascular event in the previous 3&#x02005;months (BP and antihypertensive medication may not be stable) or a household member already enrolled on the study (to avoid bias). Participants who are involved in any other BP research will not be able to take part in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b4"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either usual care or the HOME BP intervention with optional nurse support using the HOME BP online system. Minimisation will be used taking into account participants' baseline SBP, age, diabetes status and practice. Patients are randomised to the optimal group 80% of the time. Any random numbers the minimisation routine might need will be computer generated, therefore bypassing study team involvement.</p></sec><sec id="s2b5"><title>Participant flow through the study</title><p>At baseline, all patients will receive a consultation where informed consent will be taken, as well as clinical measures (confirmation of raised BP, height, weight) and medical history. Hypoglycaemic episodes in the last 6&#x02005;months will be recorded for diabetic patients. BP will be measured after 5&#x02005;min rest with a validated electronic automated sphygmomanometer (BP TRU BPM 200). Participants will be seated, and BP will be measured in their left arm unless there is a reason not to (principally lymphoedema or other medical condition). Six BP readings will be taken at intervals of 1&#x02005;min, with the mean of the second and third readings used for the primary outcome. Patients will complete demographic measures and baseline assessments at home via HOME BP online, following which automatic allocation to intervention or usual care group will be triggered. Patients will be immediately notified of their allocation through HOME BP online, confirmed by email or letter. Practice staff will also be notified of patient group allocation by email. Participants will be informed that the research team will have access to their personal and study data to stay in touch with them throughout the study.</p><p>Following randomisation, all patients will receive a BP medication review with a trained HOME BP prescriber (one or more GPs or nurse prescriber's nominated by the practice). For patients allocated to the intervention group, prescribers will be asked to select and agree an individualised medication titration plan (including three potential medication changes should BP remain above target). Participants allocated to usual care will receive a routine hypertension medication review. None of the study participants (patients or healthcare practitioners) will be blinded to group allocation. At 6-months and 12&#x02005;months after randomisation, all patients will be invited to a follow-up appointment with an independent research nurse. This may take place within the clinic or at a participant's home. Patients will be asked to not reveal their group allocation at this appointment, as research nurses completing the 6-month and 12-month follow-up appointments will be blinded to the patient&#x02019;s group. All follow-up BP measurements will be recorded no earlier than 2&#x02005;weeks before the follow-up date, and no later than 4&#x02005;weeks following the follow-up date at the 6-month follow-up. The follow-up period will be extended up to a maximum of 8&#x02005;weeks for the 12-month follow-up. Patient BP readings and clinical measures will be taken in the same way as baseline and follow-up questionnaires completed through HOME BP online. Participant flow through the trial is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012684F1">figure 1</xref>. Participants will be withdrawn from the study if they become no longer eligible to participate (eg, due to pregnancy). Participants who choose not to continue with the study will be offered the opportunity to continue self-monitoring only rather than withdrawing completely from the study, and asked if they would be prepared to attend follow-up appointments.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012684F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Participant flow through the HOME BP study.

We estimate that &#x0223c;15% of patients invited will attend a baseline screening appointment, with &#x0223c;50% ineligible due to low BP readings during the screening appointment. We also estimate that a further 50% may decide not to participate due to the online format of the intervention. Around 95 practices are therefore likely to be required in order to recruit the target number of participants (n=574).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>HOME BP intervention</title><p>The HOME BP intervention consists of HOME BP online (for patients and healthcare professionals), BP self-monitoring, medication titration procedures and optional behavioural support.

Target BP for all patients with diabetes will be &#x0003c;135/75&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (those with proteinuria and therefore lower targets are excluded). After the seven readings are entered in to HOME BP online, the mean BP will be calculated and feedback provided to the patient and the healthcare practitioners according to a traffic light system (developed from that used in previous medication titration procedures).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> These readings will be used to inform the medication titration procedure.</p></sec><sec id="s2c5"><title>Medication titration procedures</title><p>All HOME BP prescribers will receive a copy of the NICE hypertension guidelines<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> and will complete an individualised patient medication review at baseline for intervention group participants, where three potential medication changes will be selected and agreed with the patient. If a patient's mean BP readings are above target for two consecutive months, the medication titration procedure will be initiated by HOME BP online. Patients and practice staff will be informed by email that a medication change is recommended. The prescriber will be asked to implement the preplanned medication change and confirm this with the patient (or explain the reasons for non-implementation, if applicable). If patients decide not to initiate a medication change, the prescriber will receive information provided by the patient outlining the reasons for non-titration. When a recommended medication change is not initiated, an above target reading at the subsequent BP entry will again prompt a medication change recommendation from HOME BP online.</p><p>If patients take two BP readings that are too high (&#x0003e;180/110&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) or low (SBP &#x0003c;100&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg), they will be asked to repeat the measurement after 5&#x02005;min. If readings are still too high or too low, the HOME BP healthcare practitioners will be alerted by email and patients will be advised to make an appointment with the prescriber in the usual way within 3&#x02005;days. Decisions about patients' medication will remain at the prescriber's discretion at all times. If a mean target BP (ie, below target but SBP above 100&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) is entered into HOME BP online for three consecutive months, patients will be advised to reduce BP monitoring to once every 8&#x02005;weeks as their BP is currently well controlled. This will revert to monthly should subsequent mean BP rise above target.</p></sec><sec id="s2c6"><title>HOME BP behavioural support</title><p>Optional additional behavioural support for self-monitoring and lifestyle modifications will be available to all patients via the practice support providers, who will be trained in applying the CARE (Congratulate, Ask, Reassure, Encourage) approach (paper outlining this approach in HOME BP forthcoming). A face-to-face appointment is offered to all participants at 4&#x02005;weeks following randomisation and 1&#x02005;week after any lifestyle modifications are introduced, with an option for remote telephone or email support if preferred. A maximum of six face-to-face support sessions will be available if patients experience difficulties associated with self-monitoring or lifestyle change, and patients will have the option to email their support provider through HOME BP online at any point. Template-guided motivating and reassuring support messages will be sent by email from the support provider to all patients every 4&#x02005;weeks to encourage and reinforce patient adherence to monitoring, medication regimes and lifestyle changes (where applicable).</p></sec><sec id="s2c7"><title>Monitoring adherence</title><p>Automated email reminders will be sent to patients and healthcare practitioners at key milestones to promote adherence to study procedures. Adherence to titration procedures will also be monitored by the healthcare practitioners and study team to ensure changes have been enacted (or to understand why not).

The primary analysis will use general linear modelling to compare intervention and usual care SBP at follow-up adjusting for baseline BP, practice (as a random effect), BP target levels and gender. Analyses will be on an intention to treat basis with imputation. Secondary analyses will be reported for complete cases. No interim analyses will be performed. A sensitivity analysis will examine the potential effect of missing data using multiple imputation. Planned subgroup analyses will be of BP target groups, older versus younger (65 as threshold), men versus women and better controlled at baseline versus worse controlled at baseline (median SBP). Secondary analyses will use similar techniques to assess differences between groups in SBP at 6&#x02005;months, DBP at 6 months and 12&#x02005;months, medication use and quality of life. Additional analyses will examine patient and healthcare professional adherence to advice and study processes, website usage and support provision. Process analyses will be reported elsewhere, but will assess the impact of patient enablement and self-efficacy, symptom perceptions and medication beliefs on outcomes. These analyses will also examine the relationship between support uptake, engagement with healthy behaviour change and outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Economic analysis</title><p>TASMINH2<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> resulted in a 5.4&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg reduction in BP in self-management compared with usual care which was cost-effective with &#x000a3;1.6k per QALY for men and &#x000a3;4.9k for women. Thus if HOME BP results in the hypothesised difference of 5&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, then using the same cost-effectiveness model, it will be highly cost-effective&#x02014;unless of course the costs are much greater. The intervention cost in TASMINH2 was &#x000a3;105, which included the BP monitor, tele-monitoring connection and training costs (see table 2 in Kaambwa <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Key differences between the interventions in HOME BP and TASMINH2 have to do with the use of behavioural techniques in the former, including guidance about lifestyle change and support in making such changes as well as recommendations to change medications with recording of whether such changes were made and further reminders if not. HOME BP thus tests the intervention as delivered digitally and the additional value of behavioural support in self-management. To facilitate costing of the behavioural add-ons to self-management, the costing of the intervention in HOME BP as far as possible will separate these elements.</p><sec id="s2j1"><title>Economic analysis plan</title><p>A within trial analysis will estimate cost per unit reduction in SBP, the primary outcome, with adjustments in that outcome as described in the &#x02018;Statistical analysis&#x02019; section, including subgroups. Costs will include those due to the intervention, as well as those due to changes in medication, use of other relevant NHS resources and any costs borne by patients such as in diet and lifestyle. NHS and societal costs will be estimated and uncertainty explored in sensitivity analyses. To facilitate analysis of the difference between the intervention in HOME BP and that of self-management, the components and the cost of the intervention in HOME BP will be compared with that of TASMINH2.</p><p>These short-term results will provide input to a long-term cost-effectiveness model, based on that developed for TASMINH2, updated by subsequent work as relevant. Since these studies all show reductions in BP as cost reducing or highly cost-effective, this modelling will address the cost-effectiveness of the HOME BP-intervention versus usual care but also of the addition of the behavioural/digital element relative to paper-based self-management without that element. The HOME BP trial will collect data on numbers and types of antihypertensive prescriptions between arms.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Qualitative substudy</title><p>The qualitative interviews will seek to provide an in-depth understanding of the factors that may facilitate or diminish the acceptability of the HOME BP intervention, and adherence to implementation from the perspective of patients and healthcare professionals using HOME BP. Interviews and focus groups will be undertaken alongside participation and after participants finish the HOME BP intervention for patients in the intervention and usual care groups. Purposive sampling will be used to select patients from the intervention group by age, gender, socioeconomic status and level of engagement with the website to allow for a wide range of views and experiences of the HOME BP online and the HOME BP intervention. Open-ended inductive questions will be used to elicit user perspectives and experiences of the intervention and the support provided, allowing participants to freely describe their experiences and views in their own way and to focus on whatever is most salient to them. Focus group discussions and interviews will also be conducted with healthcare professionals who have been involved in the trial procedures or intervention delivery.
