Coronary heart diseases including acute coronary syndrome (ACS) account for 31% of all deaths.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Patients with ACS have an increased risk of future recurrence of cardiovascular and non-coronary atherosclerotic events.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Consequently, all patients post-ACS should be prescribed secondary cardiovascular risk reduction therapy also known as &#x02018;secondary prevention&#x02019;. Unless contraindicated, this therapy should be started in all patients with ACS before hospital discharge.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Internationally recognised clinical practice guidelines by the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA), European Society of Cardiology (ESC), and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), strongly recommend optimisation of secondary prevention drug therapies following ACS.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> According to the ACC/AHA guidelines, all patients with ACS should receive indefinite treatment with aspirin, a &#x003b2;-blocker, an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) or alternatively an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and a statin. In addition, a platelet P2Y12 receptor blocker (clopidogrel or prasugrel or ticagrelor) may be prescribed.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> These evidence-based recommendations are predicated on many studies that have demonstrated the benefits of using the quadruple combination of secondary prevention medications (antiplatelet, statin, &#x003b2;-blocker, and ACEI or ARB) at discharge.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Nevertheless, there is a corresponding documented evidence of underusage and of low adherence to secondary prevention medications among patients with ACS in many countries including the USA, Canada and Qatar.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;19</xref> Non-adherence to and early discontinuation of ACS secondary prevention medications are associated with an increased risk of subsequent adverse cardiovascular events, hospital readmissions and mortality.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;26</xref></p><p>The phase after hospital discharge is a vulnerable period and a critical one for patients with ACS.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Often, patients are left unprepared at discharge and many do not receive sufficient education about their discharge medications or treatment plan.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Evidence from the literature supports that restructuring the patient discharge process to include activities such as discharge medication reconciliation and counselling, and postdischarge monitoring and follow-up can decrease the frequency of these adverse outcomes.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29&#x02013;33</xref></p><p>Clinical pharmacists are well positioned to provide pharmaceutical care interventions as patients transition between different healthcare settings. Their role has been well defined by many professional organisations including the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP), the WHO, the European Society of Clinical Pharmacy (ESCP), and the American College of Clinical Pharmacy (ACCP).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref> For example, ESCP defines the role of clinical pharmacists as that which promotes the safe and appropriate use of medications with the aim of achieving the desired therapeutic outcomes.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In addition, many studies have demonstrated the impact of pharmacist interventions which include patient education at discharge and/or follow-up in decreasing the rate of preventable adverse drug events, hospital readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37&#x02013;39</xref> Undoubtedly, the incorporation of pharmacists into the CVD healthcare team can improve the usage of CVD medications<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and increase patient adherence to drug therapy. This can also potentially decrease the number of hospitalisations, ED visits and mortality.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>
<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The role of pharmacists in CVD management is well recognised by professional pharmacy bodies.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;36</xref> In particular, the ACCP and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement have developed a best practices model for pharmacist-based discharge counselling for patients with heart failure and myocardial infarction which targets, but not limited to, medication use, barriers for adherence and the patient's role in self-care.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>According to the WHO 2014 report, CVDs accounted for 24% of all deaths in Qatar.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Moreover, the annual report of Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) in 2009 indicated that the highest number of reported deaths in Qatar was attributed to diseases of the circulatory system. The medication taking behaviour of the quadruple evidence-based secondary prevention medications was previously assessed in a cohort of 31 ACS outpatients at the Heart Hospital (HH). The self-reported continuation rates for secondary prevention medications 6&#x02005;months after the last hospital discharge decreased from 100% to 77% for &#x003b2;-blockers, 90% to 79% for ACE inhibitors, 100% to 97% for statins and 84% to 52% for dual antiplatelet therapy. The most common reasons for medication discontinuation were patients' experiences of intolerable medication adverse effects, high number of prescribed medications at the time of discharge and the fear of experiencing a medication adverse effect.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> This creates a significant opportunity for the clinical pharmacists to improve CVD management and outcomes in Qatar.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Rationale</title><p>To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first in Qatar to assess the effectiveness of a clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention among patients with ACS on cardiovascular-related outcomes. If proven to be effective, this intervention will potentially be adopted in Qatar and other cardiology centres in the region to ultimately improve cardiac care and outcomes in patients with ACS and to decrease ACS-related healthcare resource usage. Furthermore, the study will act as a catalyst to develop standards for discharge and follow-up programmes for patients with coronary heart disease in Qatar and other developing nations.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>We hypothesise that an intensive structured clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention consisting of medication reconciliation and counselling at discharge and tailored follow-up postdischarge will decrease hospital readmissions, ED visits and all-cause mortality among patients with ACS at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months after hospital discharge when compared with &#x02018;no-pharmacist intervention&#x02019; or &#x02018;usual pharmacist care&#x02019;. We also hypothesise that the effect of the intensive structured pharmacist intervention will increase patients' adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention medications for recurrent cardiovascular events and will decrease treatment burden as perceived by the patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Objectives</title><p>This protocol describes a study that is currently being implemented at HH, one of the tertiary care hospitals under the HMC in Qatar.</p><p>The study is primarily aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention at discharge and tailored follow-up postdischarge on decreasing hospital readmissions.</p><p>The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention on: (1) decreasing ED visits, and mortality among patients with ACS; (2) improving patient adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention therapy; and (3) decreasing treatment burden as perceived by patients with ACS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is a prospective randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of a structured intensive clinical pharmacist-delivered intervention consisting of medication reconciliation and counselling at discharge and tailored follow-up postdischarge on: (1) hospital readmissions including cardiac-related hospital readmissions; (2) ED visits; (3) all-cause mortality including cardiac-related mortality; (4) adherence to evidence-based secondary prevention medications and (5) self-reported treatment burden.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Study arms</title><p>The study will have three arms: (1) &#x02018;control&#x02019; arm (control arm) which includes patients discharged during weekends or after the clinical pharmacists' working hours; (2) &#x02018;clinical pharmacist delivered usual care at discharge&#x02019; arm (usual care arm) which includes patients receiving the usual care at discharge by the clinical pharmacists and (3) &#x02018;clinical pharmacist delivered intensive structured intervention at discharge and tailored follow-up postdischarge&#x02019; arm (intervention arm) which includes patients receiving a structured discharge intervention in addition to two follow-up sessions (around 30&#x02005;min each) at &#x0223c;4 and 8&#x02005;weeks of discharge. The usual care delivered by cardiologists is similar across all the study arms and no modification of level of care was required by the present study.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Study site</title><p>The study is being implemented at HH, which is one of the new hospitals under the umbrella of the HMC. The centre is equipped with a 20-bed coronary care unit, a 12-bed cardiothoracic intensive care unit, a 24-bed surgical high dependency unit and 60 ward beds with continuous telemetry monitoring rooms. It provides inpatient and outpatient tertiary care services for more than 95% of the patients with ACS in Qatar.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Around 3000 patients with ACS are admitted to the HH annually. These patients receive their secondary prevention medications from the hospital's outpatient pharmacy with a nominal charge of about 150 QR (Qatar Riyal) per prescription refill.</p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Patients are eligible for enrolment into the study if they are at least 18&#x02005;years of age and are admitted to and discharged from any non-surgical cardiology service at HH with a diagnosis of ACS regardless of whether it is their first ACS attack or not. Patients will be excluded from the study if any of the following criteria is met: severe visual impairment, severe hearing impairment, inability to communicate in either English or Arabic, mental or psychiatric illness, delirium or severe dementia, cognitive impairment, incomprehensible speech, planned discharge to a location other than home (eg, long-term care facility, nursing home, other medicine units, etc), plan for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery during hospitalisation, plan to leave Qatar in the next 12&#x02005;months, and a terminal illness with a high likelihood of death in the next 12&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>Screening and recruitment of patients</title><p>Trained research assistants (RAs) will identify potential participants through reviewing the HH&#x02019;s medical records according to the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria. The RAs will approach identified participants, provide them with information about the study and obtain written informed consent, including permission to access the patient's medical records.</p><p>After obtaining the informed consent, the RAs will document through medical chart review and patient interview the patient's baseline characteristics including demographics and comorbidities such as age, gender, country of origin, type of ACS, education level, medical conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, renal dysfunction, obesity, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular accident, etc), past and current smoking status, current prescription and over-the-counter medications, clinical parameters (eg, most recent blood pressure, pulse rate, lipid profile, blood glucose, weight, height), and inpatient treatment modality (eg, medical management vs CABG vs percutaneous coronary intervention).</p></sec><sec id="s5f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>At HH on arrival to the ED, patients with ACS are usually allocated to different treatment teams by the triage nurse based on the capacity of the teams. These treatment teams are denoted by the letters A, B, C and D; typically, each team has a clinical pharmacist as a member. This inherent process of randomly allocating patients to treatment teams serves as the basis of randomisation in this study. First, consenting patients who happen to be allocated to the teams that have the intervention clinical pharmacists will be naturally considered in the intervention arm. Second, consenting patients who happen to be allocated to the teams that have the non-intervention clinical pharmacists will be considered in the usual care arm. Finally, consenting patients who are discharged on weekends and after the clinical pharmacists' working hours will be naturally randomised into the control arm.</p><p>Assigning patients to the different teams is the usual practice at HH. Allocation or selection bias is unlikely to happen in the study due to the fact that the clinical pharmacists have no role in patients' allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s5g"><title>Description of the intervention</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>&#x02018;Control&#x02019; <italic>arm</italic>: in this arm, patients will typically receive routine discharge instructions and medication information by nurses and/or treating physicians during hospital discharge.

If the patient in any study arm reports that a medication is discontinued by his/her physician, the physician will be contacted by phone or email to confirm and obtain the reason for the discontinuation. Patient will be considered adherent if the physician verified discontinuing the medication.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Administration of the Adherence to Refills and Medications Scale (ARMS).<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></p></list-item><list-item><p>Patients' adherence to all and to each individual prescribed secondary prevention medications for CAD as per the prescription refill records at the HH outpatient pharmacy covering the period from the patient hospital discharge until the day of outcome assessment. The patient will be considered adherent by pharmacy prescription records if the proportion of days covered (PDC) for each of the secondary prevention medications (&#x003b2;-blocker, aspirin, statin, ACEI or ARB if applicable) from discharge is larger than 75%. A PDC value of more than 75% is selected based on previous studies that assessed adherence in postmyocardial infarction patients.<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> If one of the medications is not prescribed at discharge, the PDC to only the prescribed medications will be used to determine the overall adherence. To be classified as having overall adherence, the patient must have a PDC&#x02265;75% for each medication. For example, if the patient's PDC for one of the medications is 80% but PDC for another medication is 50%, the patient would be classified as non-adherent. A patient will be considered non-adherent in case he/she is found non-adherent in any modality even if the same patient is found adherent by the other two modalities.</p></list-item></list></p></list-item><list-item><p>Treatment burden: will be assessed using the culturally adapted and translated Treatment Burden Questionnaire (TBQ).<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics between the three study arms will be compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for the numeric variables (such as age) and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables (such as gender). Alternative non-parametric tests will be used if needed. The primary analysis will involve comparing the main outcome of percentage of readmissions between the three study arms at 6&#x02005;months using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni's adjustment for the significance level will be used if needed. Logistic regression will be used to compute the unadjusted OR between the three groups (with the control arm being the reference group) along with 95% CIs. The number needed to treat (NNT) will be computed when significance is achieved in the main outcome between any two pairs of arms. This analysis will be carried out for the two time periods 3 and 12&#x02005;months. Secondary analysis will involve obtained adjusted OR for the primary outcome where adjustment is done for any imbalances deemed clinically important in demographic and baseline clinical variables between the study arms. In addition, the primary outcome will be adjusted for the possible clustering effect within each team using mixed effects regression analysis. Also the secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality and adherence will be analysed in a similar manner.</p><p>The treatment burden will be compared between the study arms using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test followed by multiple logistic regressions or one-way ANOVA followed by multiple linear regressions. Intent-to-treat principal will be used for the analysis. Two sensitivity analyses will be performed one using multiple imputations by chained equations for the missing data and the other using per protocol methodology. Also the effect of adherence on the primary analysis will be assessed by adding this variable to the multiple logistic regression models. Statistical analyses will be conducted using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences (IBM SPSS) V.22. In all analyses, the level of significance will be set at 5%. The sample size is based on the primary analysis of comparing the main outcome between the three study arms. Assuming that the 6-month readmission among the patients on the control arm is about 20% with 125 patients per arm, we will be able to detect an effect size of 0.025 between the three groups corresponding to an absolute decrease of 10% between the intervention arm and usual care arm and 9% between this latter group and the control arm with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Approximately 250&#x02013;300 patients are admitted to HH per month with ACS of which 10&#x02013;15% are discharged on weekends or after the clinical pharmacists' working hours. On average, length of stay of patients with ACS ranges from 72 to 96&#x02005;hours. The recruitment phase of the study is over 12&#x02005;months. Assuming that the RAs recruit 3 participants in each arm every week, the estimated sample size of 125 patients per arm would be achieved in 42&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s8a"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study is not without limitations. True randomisation of participants is not possible. Participants are allocated to the three arms by the triage nurse based on the capacity of the different teams. This is the most feasible and natural way of randomisation given the nature of practice in the study setting. Furthermore, the study involves only one hospital in Qatar; therefore, the study results may not be generalisable to other centres in the country. Nevertheless, HH is the main centre that offers cardiac services to Qatar's population which makes this limitation less concerning.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AZ was involved in drafting the protocol and is responsible for the treatment burden part of the project.
