DGF is a common complication of renal transplantation, and it negatively affects short- and long-term graft outcomes. Ischaemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is a prime contributor to the development of DGF. It is well established that complement system activation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IRI. Mirococept is a highly effective complement inhibitor that can be administered ex vivo to the donor kidney just before transplantation. Preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that Mirococept inhibits inflammatory responses that follow IRI. The EMPIRIKAL trial (REC 12/LO/1334) aims to evaluate the efficacy of Mirococept in reducing the incidence of DGF in cadaveric renal transplantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>EMPIRIKAL is a multicentre double-blind randomised case-control trial designed to test the superiority of Mirococept in the prevention of DGF in cadaveric renal allografts, as compared to standard cold perfusion fluid (Soltran&#x000ae;).

The enrolment will take approximately 24&#x000a0;months, and patients will be followed for 12&#x000a0;months. The primary endpoint is DGF, defined as the requirement for dialysis during the first week after transplantation. Secondary endpoints include duration of DGF, functional DGF, renal function at 12&#x000a0;months, acute rejection episodes at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months, primary non-function and time of hospital stay on first admission and in the first year following transplant.

DGF has traditionally been defined as the requirement for dialysis within the first week after transplantation, although more than 10 definitions have been recorded in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Approximately one third of all kidney transplants will develop DGF with this proportion rising to 50% when the organ is retrieved by donation after circulatory death (DCD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. DGF is associated with higher rates of acute rejection and with reduced long-term kidney survival even in patients who did not undergo rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this regard, strategies to prevent IRI and the subsequent development of DGF are of paramount importance for improving renal graft outcomes.</p><p>The reperfusion of the ischaemic kidney induces a proinflammatory reaction in which activation of the complement system plays a central role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Complement-depleted or deficient animals exhibit reduced post ischaemic acute renal failure and chronic nephropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Recent studies have indicated that locally synthesised complement components play a more important role in activating local inflammatory processes and mediating graft immunogenicity than complement components from the systemic circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The central step in complement activation is the cleavage of C3 to C3b by C3 convertase. Membrane-bound C3b binds to activated factor B and forms the C3 alternative pathway convertase enzyme, resulting in further C3 cleavage to C3b. The primary trigger is now believed to be the lectin pathway, followed by amplification through the alternative pathway, both pathways converging on the central component C3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This ultimately leads to C5a- and C5b-9-mediated injury of the renal tubule, and C3a- and C5a-mediated enhancement of the recipient immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In vivo protection against aberrant complement activation is prevented by the natural regulators of complement activation (RCAs), which can be membrane bound (e.g. CD35 &#x02014; also known as CR1 &#x02014; CD46 and CD55) or soluble (e.g. factor H). RCAs act via two mechanisms: one by inhibiting C3 and C5 convertases by accelerating their decay and the other by acting as cofactors for factor I-mediated proteolysis of C3b/C4b to the inactive iC3b and C3d and C4d respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Microarray analyses of human renal graft biopsies before transplantation have shown a negative correlation between complement gene expression and graft function in the early (2&#x02013;3 days) and late (2&#x02013;3 years) post-transplant period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Of note, the duration of cold ischaemia was positively associated with the level of complement gene expression. This relationship was previously demonstrated in a mouse renal isograft model where intrarenal C3 mRNA level increased in relation to the duration of cold ischaemia time (CIT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Intriguingly, in this model, local C3 &#x02014; mostly produced by the tubular epithelium &#x02014; was essential for complement-mediated reperfusion damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Together, these mechanisms provide a rationale for local therapeutic manipulation of C3 function during early transplantation in order to improve the short- and possibly longer-term outcomes of renal grafts. The local control of complement activation would have the advantage of providing graft protection whilst avoiding the systemic abrogation of the complement system and the consequent impairment of recipient immune defences.</p><p>Mirococept (APT070) is a highly effective complement inhibitor which is derived from human CR1 (CD35). It consists of three functional units: the terminal three domains of CR1 which contain its biological activities, a membrane-associating peptide and a membrane-inserting myristoyl group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The last two units permit the binding to and insertion into the cell membrane. Mirococept is unique in that it is engineered to bind to cell surfaces in bulk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and can block the complement system at the C3 level. It does not inhibit proteases generally, and its action is restricted to the complement system.</p><p>Mirococept has been shown to inhibit complement activation and the subsequent inflammatory reaction in a variety of experimental diseases that are associated with complement activation such as rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], Guillain-Barre syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], intestinal ischaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], myocardial ischaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and kidney transplantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We previously developed a strategy to administer Mirococept in the donor kidney, thereby avoiding any undesirable consequences from systemic complement inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. After being administered to the kidney ex vivo, via the renal artery, Mirococept localises to the graft endothelial and epithelial cells. In a rat transplant IRI model we showed that local inhibition of complement activation within the graft by Mirococept reduced complement-mediated injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Specifically, Mirococept reduced inflammatory injury and allograft rejection, thus improving graft function in the short (throughout the first week) and long term (20&#x000a0;weeks). As these results were obtained after the relatively short ischaemia time of 30&#x000a0;min, we further evaluated Mirococept efficacy in a rat renal transplantation model of prolonged cold ischaemia (16&#x000a0;h). Similarly to our previous findings, Mirococept reduced ischaemia reperfusion damage and inflammation by inhibiting complement activation at the C3 level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It also increased the number of donor organs that survived after transplantation by at least twofold.</p><p>The safety of Mirococept has been documented by preclinical, phase I and phase IIa clinical studies (see section on <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">Safety evaluation and recording of adverse events</xref>). Moreover, in the phase IIa clinical trial where Mirococept or placebo (Pbo) was administered to the kidney ex vivo before transplantation, a trend was observed toward lower creatinine in the Mirococept group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The aim of the current trial is to provide further evidence supporting the efficacy of Mirococept in preventing DGF in cadaveric human renal transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a multicentre, double-blind, randomised case-control trial, designed to test the superiority of Mirococept in the prevention of DGF in cadaveric renal allografts, as compared to standard cold perfusion fluid (Soltran&#x000ae;). Patients will be randomised to treatment or Pbo, and randomisation will be carried out in blocks and stratified by centre, type of donor, i.e. Donation after Circulatory Death (DCD)/Donation after Brain Death (DBD), and whether the organ has been machine pumped. Immunosuppression therapy, antibiotic and antiviral prophylaxis will be administered as per local centre protocols. In order to estimate the dose-response curve and obtain the minimum effective dose (MED), we will use an adaptive design known as the cumulative cohort design (CCD) for dose finding, first described by Ivanova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In most cases this adaptive design is more powerful and effective in finding differences against Pbo and in estimating the dose-response curve, compared to an equal allocation design. This is because the adaptive procedure successfully assigns more patients to Pbo and the target dose, i.e. the MED. Reporting conforms to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) checklist (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Selection of participants, recruiting and consent</title><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>.

However, as Mirococept is administered to the kidney ex vivo and is cytotopic, i.e. cell membrane associated, very little is expected to enter the systemic circulation. The safety of Mirococept has been demonstrated in preclinical studies as well as in phase I and II clinical trials. In the phase I randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study, doses of up to 100&#x000a0;mg given to healthy men as a single intravenous (IV) infusion were tolerated well. There were seven dose levels, 2, 5, 10, 20, 40, 70 and 100&#x000a0;mg, and six subjects participated in each dose level, four subjects receiving active drug and 2 receiving Pbo. There were no deaths or SAEs and the number of treatment-related AEs was low up until the 100&#x000a0;mg Mirococept dose. With 100&#x000a0;mg IV infusion there were increased events in three out of four subjects receiving the active medication. For this dose level, the most common complaints were general disorders (fatigue, headache) and nausea with one occurrence of pyrexia. The lack of any consistent pattern in the AEs for doses lower than 100&#x000a0;mg Mirococept indicated good tolerability. There were no treatment-related changes in vital signs or clinical laboratory parameters. The plasma elimination half-life in healthy subjects was approximately 3&#x000a0;h, and for doses below 10&#x000a0;mg there was no apparent inhibition of systemic complement activation. A pilot phase II study conducted in 12 patients using a dose of 10&#x000a0;mg of Mirococept perfused into donor human kidneys which were then transplanted also showed that this agent and mode of administration was well tolerated. More than 80% of the drug was retained in the graft and no inhibition of circulatory complement was detected. The starting dose level of 10&#x000a0;mg was based on animal data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and was found to be safe in phase I and pilot phase IIa studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In the present protocol, we do not expect more than approximately 20% of the maximum dose administered to the graft to reach the systemic circulation. At the doses proposed (5&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mg), this exposure lies in the range of 1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mg of drug. Therefore, we do not consider drug-related AEs to be likely.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="Sec18"><title>Basic power calculation</title><p>We will consider the use of Mirococept superior to standard cold perfusion if the upper boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the absolute DGF risk difference includes the minimum considered clinically significant (10%). All calculations have been made presuming an absolute risk of DGF of 35% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and thus expecting it to drop to at least 25% in the treatment group.</p><p>Using an asymmetric two-sided group sequential design, with 80% power and 5% type I error [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the maximum sample size is 283 transplant pairs, a total of 566 patients. Based on this sample size calculation, we used a total sample size of 560 to perform a simulation study under different scenarios of dose response to optimise the performance of the adaptive design and determine the dose allocation rules (results given in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The power to detect differences in the response between the accumulated Pbo patients and the dose to which the largest number of patients were allocated was above 0.80 for three out of the four scenarios of dose response, where the fourth scenario was one where there was no effect. Under the absence of an effect, only 5% of the simulated trials found a significant effect, which is consistent with a 5% type I error.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Interim analysis and dose allocation</title><p>As discussed earlier, patients will be recruited in cohorts of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;80 with a maximum number of 7 cohorts. Five possible doses will be assessed: 5&#x000a0;mg, 10&#x000a0;mg, 15&#x000a0;mg, 20&#x000a0;mg and 25&#x000a0;mg. The adaptive allocation will be based on a <italic>t</italic> test-like statistic that compares the difference between response (accumulated) at the current dose with the mean response at Pbo plus our target difference 0.10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In brief, the current dose is repeated if the current estimated difference in responses between dose and Pbo (scaled by the variance) is close to the target 0.10, and changed if otherwise (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>: recruitment cohorts). Simulation studies (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) showed that the following allocation rules provided optimal performance:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>

</p><p>Note that a <italic>t</italic> statistic&#x02009;=&#x02009;0 implies a difference in the rate of DGF between the drug and Pbo groups of 0.10, the minimum clinically significant; a positive <italic>t</italic> statistic implies that the difference in DGF rate between Pbo and the drug is larger than 0.10, and a negative <italic>t</italic> statistic implies that the difference is lower than 0.10.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Final data analysis</title><p>The main analysis of the primary endpoint will consist of a logistic (binary) regression to examine whether the use of Mirococept as compared to standard cold storage, in the context of other relevant covariates, influences the risk of DGF. The same procedure will be applied to binary secondary endpoints. A linear regression will be used for secondary endpoints measured on a continuous scale (e.g. GFR), using a log transformation when the distribution deviates from normality or for time measures (e.g. duration of DGF). For the analysis of graft survival, the comparison between the two groups will be carried out using hazard ratios calculated from a Cox proportional-hazards model, adjusted by the relevant covariates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Handling of missing data in secondary outcomes</title><p>It is expected that approximately 10% of patients could be lost to follow-up, due to drop-out or transfer to other centres. For time-to-event outcomes, survival analysis will be used, and patients lost to follow-up will be classified as censored. For binary and continuous endpoints we will first check whether patients lost to follow-up differ significantly from the rest in their clinical characteristics, expecting absence of differences. Subsequently, the analyses will first be performed with the available data and then be repeated after carrying out imputation of the data missing due to loss at follow-up. This may add power to the statistical test, but the direction of the effect should not differ significantly from that observed without imputation.</p><p>The study may also be stopped for futility before the maximum sample size is reached. Simulation results show that, in the absence of effect, the adaptive allocation reaches the maximum dose quickly. <italic>p</italic>-value cut-offs to stop for futility will be applied starting from the interim analysis after two consecutive cohorts on the maximum dose (25&#x000a0;mg).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the last two decades the incidence of DGF has significantly increased, probably due to the use of expanded criteria donors (ECDs) and DCD donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As discussed earlier, this common complication of renal transplantation is associated with detrimental effects on both short- and long-term graft outcomes as it is linked to increased rates of acute rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. To date, there is no established pathway-specific approach for the prevention and treatment of DGF. Over the last decade, considerable progress has been made in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the pathogenesis of acute kidney injury that frequently leads to DGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In this regard, various interventions for the prevention and treatment of DGF are currently under evaluation in the preclinical and clinical settings. These interventions can be divided into organ-directed techniques (e.g. machine perfusion of the donor kidney, use of different preservation solutions) and recipient-directed treatments. Recipient-directed treatments include the ischaemic preconditioning of the recipient, vasodilatory agents, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic agents and different induction immunosuppression regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the administration of these compounds in the recipient&#x02019;s systemic circulation would entail the risk of serious adverse reactions. In contrast, kidney delivery techniques have the advantage of selectively inhibiting the local inflammatory processes of IRI, and at the same time they minimise the risk of systemic side effects.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial to implement this innovative method of ex vivo administration of a cytotopic complement inhibitor (Mirococept) in renal transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>The first participant was randomised on 29 October 2015.
