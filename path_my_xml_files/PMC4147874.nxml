The PRESTA (Psoriasis Randomized Etanercept STudy in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis) study, a randomized, double-blind, two-dose trial, examined the efficacy of etanercept treatment in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and PsA and the main results have been presented previously. This analysis examined employment status, job duties and sick days, pre-defined endpoints in PRESTA, among this patient population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;752) were randomized to receive etanercept 50&#x000a0;mg twice weekly (BIW; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;379) or 50&#x000a0;mg once weekly (QW; n&#x02009;=&#x02009;373) for 12&#x000a0;weeks by subcutaneous injection. All participants then received open-label etanercept 50&#x000a0;mg QW for 12 additional weeks, while remaining blinded to the randomization. A pharmacoeconomic questionnaire was administered at baseline, week 12 and week 24 of treatment. The questionnaire included employment status and changing job responsibilities and sick time taken due to psoriasis or PsA. The statistical methods included analysis of covariance, <italic>t</italic>-test, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test and McNemar&#x02019;s test. Last-observation-carried-forward imputation was used for missing data.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Employment was at least maintained from baseline to week 24 in both dose groups (56% [BIW/QW] and 60% [QW/QW] at baseline, 61% and 60%, respectively, at week 24). Among employed participants, the proportion of patients whose job responsibilities changed due to PsA decreased significantly from baseline to week 24 (17&#x02013;23% to 5&#x02013;8%; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Similar results were seen with job responsibility changes due to psoriasis (11&#x02013;14% to 4%; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The number of monthly sick days also decreased from baseline to week 24 (2.4&#x000a0;days for both treatment groups to 0.7 (BIW/QW) and 1.1 (QW/QW); p&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.03 for each). No significant differences between the treatment groups were observed for any economic endpoint at any time point.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>For patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and PsA, etanercept treatment resulted in reducing job responsibility changes due to disease and in reducing sick time.

Last-observation-carried-forward was used for imputation of missing values. Within-group changes from baseline in proportions were tested using McNemar&#x02019;s test; changes from baseline for continuous endpoints were tested using t-tests. Between-group comparisons of proportions were tested using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test; ANCOVA was used for between-group comparisons of continuous endpoints.</p><p>Stepwise logistic regression or linear regression analyses were conducted on predictors of employment outcomes at weeks 12 and 24. Separate models were run for those employed and not employed at baseline because follow-up questions about employment characteristics were only asked if the patient indicated that they were employed. The following parameters were included in models used for patients employed at baseline: age, gender, duration of psoriasis, duration of arthritis, treatment, baseline change of job responsibilities (yes or no) for psoriasis, baseline change of job responsibilities (yes or no) for arthritis, baseline sick days, baseline weekly hours worked. For those not in employment at baseline, only age, gender, duration of psoriasis, and duration of arthritis were included as the other information was not available.</p><p>The PRESTA study was designed and performed according to the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice and according to the version of the Declaration of Helsinki that was in place during the time the study was conducted.</p><p>The protocol and its amendments received independent ethics committee or institutional review board approval and regulatory review and approval before site initiation and recruitment of patients (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).

positively associated at week 12 with the number of hours worked at baseline (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) and negatively associated at week 24 with the number of sick days at baseline

The probability of changing job responsibilities due to PsA was negatively associated with baseline hours worked at week 12 (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005) and week 24 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and also positively associated with older age at week 24 (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Baseline sick days and fewer weekly hours worked at baseline were predictive of more sick days recorded at week 12 and week 24 (all p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). In patients not employed at baseline, the probability of becoming employed at weeks 12 and 24 was lower for older patients and females. Duration of psoriasis and duration of psoriatic arthritis were not predictive of employment, changing job responsibilities or sick days at either week 12 or 24.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the PRESTA trial, treatment of psoriasis and PsA patients with etanercept over 24&#x000a0;weeks resulted in maintenance of employment in both treatment groups. Patients in the higher dose group had statistically significant improvements in the proportions employed, but the baseline proportions of employed patients were lower than in the 50&#x000a0;mg QW/QW dose group. In addition to the percentage of patients remaining employed, the number of hours worked each week improved slightly but not significantly. The majority of senior patients (aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) were not employed, suggesting they were retired and not seeking work. Among the working age patients (aged &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years) the group who were not employed had more severe disease relative to the employed group. The percentage of employed patients from Europe who were &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years old in this study (61.2%, 95% CI: 57.2% &#x02013; 65.1%) is slightly less than the percentage employed in the overall population in the European area who were aged 15 to 64 at the end of 2006 (65%) and 2007 (66%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>One of the strengths of this study is that the pharmacoeconomic questionnaire could distinguish between employment changes due to skin disease symptoms versus arthritis symptoms. In both treatment groups, a larger proportion of patients reported changing job responsibilities due to arthritis symptoms than due to psoriasis symptoms. The proportion of patients who had to change jobs for either reason decreased significantly from baseline to the end of the study.</p><p>There was a &#x0003e;47% reduction in sick days after 12&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. These data are comparable with a previous study that looked at treatment of active PsA with etanercept over 24&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Unlike the current study, those investigators observed a nonsignificant decline in missed work days (absenteeism for any reason) from 0.7&#x000a0;days per 2&#x000a0;weeks at baseline to 0.3&#x000a0;days per month after 2&#x000a0;years of treatment (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3436).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that patients with PsA have an elevated rate of work disability relative to normal populations, consistent with our findings at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, etanercept treatment of PsA has been seen to result in impediments to labor (paid or unpaid) declining significantly over 2&#x000a0;years (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Our study did not look specifically at impediments to work, but the data indirectly support the previous research.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The PRESTA study was not designed to specifically study employment. Furthermore, the pharmacoeconomic questionnaire used in the PRESTA study has not been validated in other clinical trials. At the time this study was conducted, work productivity questionnaires, including the Work Productivity and Activity Index for psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and for rheumatoid arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] were not widely used. Although the pharmacoeconomic questionnaire has not undergone extensive validation, the results are similar to other work productivity instruments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The pharmacoeconomic questionnaire can also be viewed as having face validity &#x02013; the quality of prompting patients to provide the appropriate information. Both arms of PRESTA involved treatment with etanercept, thus comparisons with placebo were not available. However, one might expect employment to decline slowly for patients with PsA given the cumulative damage to joints that can occur. The lack of a placebo arm in PRESTA raises the possibility that some of the improvement observed with etanercept treatment could be due to regression to the mean although the lack of association between disease duration and employment outcomes reduces the likelihood that this problem was the primary determinant of these results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>For patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and PsA, etanercept provides economic value, in part, by reducing changes in job responsibilities and missed work days.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BIW: Twice weekly; DLQI: Dermatology Life Quality Index; EQ-5D Utility: EuroQol &#x02013; 5 Dimension Utility index; EQ-5D VAS: EuroQol &#x02013; 5 Dimension visual analog scale; HAQ DI: Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index; mITT: Modified intent-to-treat; PASI: Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; PsA: Psoriatic arthritis; QW: Once weekly; SD: Standard deviation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>RLB, TW, LM, and RP were employees of Pfizer Inc during the PRESTA study and subsequent analyses.
