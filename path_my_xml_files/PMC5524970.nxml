Thus we evaluated the safety of two different doses of topically administered autologous APOSEC, the secretome of apoptotic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in healthy male volunteers with artificial dermal wounds. Ten healthy men were enrolled in a single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 trial. Two artificial wounds at the upper arm were generated using a 4-mm punch biopsy. Each participant was treated with both topically applied APOSEC and placebo in NuGel for 7 consecutive days. The volunteers were randomized into two groups: a low-dose group (A) receiving the supernatant of 12.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs and a high-dose group (B) receiving an equivalent of 25&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs resuspended in NuGel Hydrogel. Irradiated medium served as placebo. The primary outcome was the tolerability of the topical application of APOSEC. All adverse events were recorded until 17 days after the biopsy. Local tolerability assessment was measured on a 4-point scale. Secondary outcomes were wound closure and epithelization at day 7. No therapy-related serious adverse events occurred in any of the participants, and both low- and high-dose treatments were well tolerated. Wound closure was not affected by APOSEC therapy.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The global incidence of non-healing wounds is soaring due to increasing prevalence of diabetes and obesity. These wounds are a major cause of morbidity, have a negative impact on quality of life, and result in enormous costs for the health care system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Although several highly expensive products are on the market, the process of wound healing takes a long time and is often incomplete, entailing amputation in severe cases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Many approaches to new therapies have been investigated over the last decades, but no sufficient therapeutic option yet exists. Wound healing involves a complex interplay of various cell types as well as cellular and biochemical events. This process depends on a supply of oxygen, nutrients, and growth factors. Diabetic patients have an impaired vasculature, which results in reduced blood perfusion to the wound area, leading to decreased migration of inflammatory cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. However, inflammatory cells are an essential part of chronic wound healing, acting in both beneficial and harmful ways<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. The application of stem cells, genetically modified cells, or paracrine factors on chronic wound areas has led to encouraging results, regarding wound healing<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. A paper by Holzinger <italic>et al</italic>. showed that topical application of activated, autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) effectively initiated epithelialization of ulcerated, dermal wounds and that wound closure was present in 92% of patients after 60 days, compared to standard therapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. In particular, paracrine factors are being considered as a promising option because they provide pro-angiogenic and anti-apoptotic mediators for cell proliferation and migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. To advance Holzinger&#x02019;s &#x0201c;activated PBMC-based therapy,&#x0201d; we applied the cell-free secretome of apoptotic PBMCs, the <sc>apo</sc>ptotic PBMC <sc>sec</sc>retome (APOSEC), produced according to good manufacturing practice (GMP) guidelines. APOSEC contains a myriad of cytokines, lipids, proteins, exosomes, and vasoactive substances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. To increase the secretory output of PBMCs, we induced apoptosis via ionizing radiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">In a recent publication, we reported positive effects of APOSEC on angiogenesis and skin regeneration in a mouse wound-healing model and in a clinically more relevant porcine third-degree burn model<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Further approaches in preclinical models revealed that the secretome of PBMCs attenuates hypoxic injury in acute and latent myocardial infarction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>, spinal cord injury, and stroke<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Additionally, APOSEC augments de novo secretion of antimicrobial peptides<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> and attenuates experimental myocarditis by inducing caspase 8&#x02013;dependent CD4 T cell apoptosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. These promising preclinical data encouraged us to initiate the production of APOSEC for human application under the auspices of the Austrian Agency for Food and Drug Safety (AGES) (AGES-Nr. INS-480102-0013-007). APOSEC as a drug substance has been classified as &#x0201c;biological&#x0201d; and can be applied in a personalized manner (autologous) or in an allogeneic approach (pooled product). This first clinical trial using autologous APOSEC was approved by the certified authority (AGES) to explore its safety and tolerability in artificial skin wounds in healthy, male participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design and study population</title><p id="Par5">This study was a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-finding phase 1 trial to assess the safety and tolerability of two different doses of autologous APOSEC in artificial dermal wounds.

First, sterility testing of the final product was performed. Second, induction of apoptosis was determined before irradiation and after cultivation of the cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis using the FITC Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, US). Third, concentrations of IL-8/C&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;CL8 (C&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;C-motive-chemokine 8), EGF, and TGF-&#x003b2; were determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to verify successful production of APOSEC according to GMP definitions. The fourth part of quality control was endotoxin, mycoplasma and sterility testing of the final product. Cell culture supernatant samples were additionally screened for herpes contamination via polymerase chain reaction. AGES approved APOSEC as a test product according to current guidelines of the Austrian Drug Registration and Administration Act (AGES INS-480102-0013-007).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Evaluation of adverse events</title><p id="Par16">Adverse events were documented if reported by study participants or observed by physicians.

This disease causes in our society an ever increasing financial and psychological burden - for both, patients and the health care system<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par28">In particular, cell-based therapies are a rapidly expanding sector in wound closure treatments. For example, the application of cellular 3D fibroblast constructs (Dermagraft) (Shire Regenerative Medicine, San Diego, CA) received market authorization in multiple countries after Phase 3 trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. With regard to the cataclysmic consequences of bacterial infection for wound regeneration and healing, in severe cases involving non-remediable tissue impairment necessitating amputation, this particular attribute emphasizes the clinical potential of APOSEC <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par32">Results from a murine wound-healing model, as well as a porcine third-degree burn model have already indicated the effectiveness of topical application of PBMC-derived paracrine factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

All of these features are most desirable for wound healing, but it is a fact that the PBMC secretome is a mixture of paracrine factors containing multiple pro-angiogenic proteins, lipids, and exosomes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. From our point of view, the observed effects are not attributable to a single factor but to the combination of different components of APOSEC. This hypothesis has already been corroborated by Lichtenauer <italic>et al</italic>., who selectively blocked different factors, including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and IL-8, and failed to attenuate the biological activity in selected potency assays<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Thus, the identification of a single mechanism of action (MOA) remains challenging because on the one hand, we deal with a complex composition of paracrine factors, and on the other hand, we deal with a plethora of biological effects. Based on our long lasting research in the effect of PBMC secretome (APOSEC) we feel that the search for &#x0201c;the target&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;the MOA&#x0201d; in skin regeneration is not feasible<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par33">Before the &#x0201c;off the shelf&#x0201d; drug substance of allogeneic APOSEC enters regulatory approval, multiple requirements must be met by a drug developer. These are stability studies, development of validated potency assays, and the completion of incremental and repeated dose toxicology studies in two animal species.</p><p id="Par34">All of these manufacturing and regulatory hurdles must be accomplished before a transition into the clinic will become reality. In addition to a positive verdict of the internal reviewer board (IRB), trial registration and approval of national and super national regulatory agencies are mandatory.</p><p id="Par35">Only a proof of concept phase II study will show whether scientific insights generated at our surgical research laboratory will find its translation in the treatment of non-healing wounds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
