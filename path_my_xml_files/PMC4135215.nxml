patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) in young adults and lower extremity biomechanics.
[Subjects] This experiment was carried out with sixty (24 men and 32 women), who are
normal university students as subjects. [Methods] All subjects underwent 3 clinical
evaluations. For distinguishing the intrinsic PFPS from controls, we used the Modified
Functional Index Questionnaire (MFIQ), Clarke&#x02019;s test and the Eccentric step test. Based on
the results of the tests, subjects who were classified as positive for 2 more tests were
allocated to the bilateral or unilateral intrinsic PFPS group (n=14), and the others were
allocated to the control group (n=42). These two groups were tested for hamstring
tightness, foot overpronation, and static Q-angle and dynamic Q-angle. These are the four
lower extremity biomechanic, cited as risk factors of patellofemoral pain syndrome.
[Results] The over pronation, static Q-angle and the dynamic Q-angle were not
significantly different between the two groups. However, the hamstring tightness of the
PFPS group was significantly greater than that of the controls. [Conclusion] We examined
individuals for intrinsic patellofemoral pain syndrome in young adults and lower extremity
biomechanics. We found a strong correlation between intrinsic PFPS and hamstring
tightness.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hamstring</kwd><kwd>Patellofemoral</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patello Femoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS), which is known to be the most common of knee joint
injuries, is a disease with the primary complaint of pain in the front of the knee, and is
one of the most common in the knee complaint of young age groups<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. PFPS tends to occur more in young adults showing with high
activity, and occurs with the highest incidence, 25%, in the 10&#x02013;35 years, the cause of this
disorder has not yet been exactly determined<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. PFPS is a disease that has intrinsic, external and internal
factors; that is, potential and external risk factors of PFPS are said to be present in
sports activities or sports training habits, problems of surrounding environments, and
through incorrect use of appliances, etc, as well as internal potential risks due to
individual physical characteristics and psychological tendencies<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been suggested that the patella is highly affected
by its surrounding structures and has high instability, and that the instability of the
patella appears to be higher in young adults with high activity than in other age
groups<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>PFPS is generally caused by knee dysfunction increasing pressure in the patellofemoral
joint contact area due to transformed gliding between the patella and femoral trochlear
notch. PFPS is associated with various biomechanical characteristics of the lower extremity,
and potential risk factors are: abnormal form of the feet; functional weakness of hamstring
and quadriceps muscle of the thigh and the gastrocnemius; shortening of the iliotibial
tract; generally weakened joints; excessive quadriceps angle; patellar compression or
tilting; and abnormal reaction velocities of the vastus lateralis and vastus medialis
oblique<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Different biomechanical
factors of the lower extremity limbs have been studied as potential risk factors of PFPS for
a long time, but there is a debate over how much each factor affects PFPS, and more detailed
studies are needed<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. PFPS for a prolonged
period in young adults tends to develop into degenerative arthritis of the patellofemoral
joint, and symptoms of degenerative arthritis in old age can be predicted. Given this, early
diagnosis of PFPS is very important, and PFPS can be fully prevented before surgical
intervention is needed via early diagnosis<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we identified PFPS in university students with various physical
characteristics through PFPS diagnosis, and then studied the correlation of PFPS with risk
factors that may affect PFPS in terms of the dynamics of the lower extremity, as identified
by previous studies, to provide the basic data for the prevention and appropriate treatment
of PFPS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 60 normal adults who satisfied the selection criteria. In
this study, the subjects were 18 to 25-year-old university students. Subjects were excluded
if they had any lower limb pathology, neuropathology or any history of previous knee
surgery. This was a cross-sectional study, which conducted three kinds of PFPS diagnostic
evaluation, the Modified Functional Index Questionnaire (MFIQ), Clarke&#x02019;s test, and the
Eccentric step test. Subjects who tested positive in more than two kinds of evaluation
(n=14) were classified as the group showing intrinsic PFPS symptoms in one or both
knees<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the remainder (n=42) were
allocated to the normal group. Four subjects were excluded they refused to participate in
the experimental measurements. We performed four kinds of biomechanical analyses of the
lower extremity that have previously been identified as risk factors of PFPS: shortening of
the hamstring muscle, hyperpronation of the feet, and the static quadriceps angle and
dynamic quadriceps angle tests. Correlations between intrinsic PFPS symptoms and the 4
variables were investigated. The biomechanical analyses were performed by skilled physical
therapists. MFIQ is a measurement tool consisting of 10 questions with a rating scale
response. Higher scores indicate more serious problems and the lowest possible score is 0
points. Shortening of the hamstring muscle was measured by measuring the angle of straight
leg raised hip joints with a goniometer, and the results of navicular drop test were
measured using a graduated ruler. A camcorder was used to measure the dynamic quadriceps
angle while descending stairs with one leg bent at the knee and the other leg straight. A
SONY DCR-SR 300 (Japan) camcorder was used for the measurement.</p><p>For Clarke&#x02019;s test, the subjects lay comfortably on their backs. Then, the experimenter
placed one hand on the patella and instructed the subject to contract the quadriceps femoris
muscle while he pushed down on the patella. If pain was felt while performing this action,
the subject tested positive<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the
eccentric step test, the subjects stood barefoot on a 15&#x02005;cm high step. The subjects were
instructed to &#x0201c;stand straight on the step and very slowly lower one leg&#x0201d;. If one leg was
performed successfully, the subject repeated the procedure with the other leg.</p><p>The Navicular Drop Test (NDT) is a method of measuring excessive pronation of the subtalar
joint of the feet and it can measure excessive pronation of the feet through the difference
in the positions of the navicular bone between without supporting body weight and with
supporting body weight<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. For the hamstring
tightness test, the examiner manually lifted the subjects&#x02019; legs into the straight-leg-raise
position. The angle was measured using a goniometer at the outer surface of the pelvis. The
measurement was carried out 3 times and the average value was calculated<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. To measure the static Q-angle, the
subjects stood without shoes with their knees straight in a comfortable position while
looking straight ahead. After marking the mid-patella, ASIS, tibial tuberosity, we measured
the quadriceps angle, the angle between the line connecting the mid-patella and ASIS, and
the line connecting the center of tibia tuberosity and the patella<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In the dynamic Q-angle measurement, the subjects stood on a 15-cm step, looking ahead and
set their feet apart at shoulder width in a comfortable position. Then, the feet were
aligned in parallel and the knees straightened. Markers were attached to the ASIS,
mid-patella, and the tibial tuberosity of the subjects. When descending from the step on one
leg, the subjects took care that the heel on the step. The procedure was repeated it three
times for each leg. The data were recorded and analyzed using a motion analyzer (Prosuite
ver4.5.2.0, Dartfish, Switzerland). The motions were analyzed together with the images
recorded by the camcorder.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 software was used for statistical analyses. For MFIQ scores, the results
of Clarke&#x02019;s test and the eccentric step test, and the general characteristics of the
intrinsic PFPS group and normal group, frequency analysis and descriptive statistics were
conducted. The significance of differences between the groups were examined using the
independent t-test, and Spearman&#x02019;s correlation analysis was carried out to determine
correlations of intrinsic PFPS with shortening of the hamstring muscle, navicular drop test,
static quadriceps angle and dynamic quadriceps angle, which are often used to determine
intrinsic PFPS group. A significance level of p=0.05 was used.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The general characteristics of subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameters</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IPFPS (n=14)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CG (n=42)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender Male/Female (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5/9 (35.7/64.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19/23 (45.2/54.8)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height, cm</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.4 (9.9)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.1 (8.3)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight,&#x02005;kg</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.0 (15.9)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57.64 (9.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, years</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.1 (3.2)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.9 (2.6)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are n (%) or mean (SD).

symptoms at all.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup> In the past,
congenital abnormality of the knee articular cartilage or subchondral bone, inappropriate
treatment for small damage of the knee, or racial differences were assumed to result in
PFPS<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in modern times, the
potential symptoms of PFPS appearing broadly in the knee joints are considered dependent on
various lower extremity biomechanical differences. Witvrouw et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, conducted a 2&#x02005;year follow-up study of potential risk
factors of PFPS using students in a physical education and found that significant
differences were shown in the hamstring muscle and quadriceps femoris muscle
flexibility.</p><p>In our present study, 56 healthy university students were tested for PFPS, and 14 subjects,
equivalent to 1/4 of all subjects, tested positive for 2 or more items in 3 reliable PFPS
clinical evaluations. These subjects were classified as the group with symptoms of intrinsic
PFPS. The hamstring muscle of the intrinsic PFPS group was found to be significantly shorter
than that of the normal group (p&#x0003c;0.05). The imbalance of an agonist generally affects the
relation with an antagonist and shortening of the hamstring muscle results in weakening of
the quadriceps femoris muscle; therefore, imbalance of the hamstring-quadriceps muscles
causes PFPS<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, shortening of the
hamstring muscle means extra power is needed from the quadriceps femoris muscle when
extending the knee. This increases the reaction force on patellofemoral joint and causes
pain<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the test results of NDT for the group with intrinsic symptoms of PFPS
deviated from the normal values, with greater hyperpronation in the intrinsic PFPS group
than in the normal group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Excessive
pronation of the feet is a factor in musculoskeletal disorders, and reduces the medial
longitudinal arch and extends the posterior tibial muscle, calcaneonavicular ligament and
plantar fascia, resulting in increased internal rotation of the thigh<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, as the quadriceps angle increases and the reaction
force at the patellofemoral joint increases, internal rotation of the tibia occurs at the
same time, affecting the patellofemoral joint and causing pain<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further,
excessive pronation of the feet may cause a difference in lower extremity length. Such
malalignment of the lower extremity would create imbalance and pressure on the
patellofemoral joint and influence the appearance of PFPS symptoms.</p><p>Many studies have reported that an excessive quadriceps angle is correlated with PFPS
symptoms<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. If the quadriceps angle exceeds 15 degrees, valgus of the knee
appears, and peak knee valgus is also expected to contribute to PFPS through excessive
pressures on the knees<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>According to our experimental results, neither the static quadriceps angle nor the dynamic
quadriceps angle of the group with symptom of intrinsic PFPS show a statistically
significant difference from the normal group. However, the quadriceps angle exceeds 15
degrees, so secondary risk factors due to an excessive quadriceps angle need to be
considered.</p><p>In this study, we examined the correlation between biomechanical characteristics of the
lower extremity affecting intrinsic PFPS in general university students with various
physical characteristics including intrinsic PFPS symptoms. In addition to the four
biomechanical parameters selected and analyzed in this study, there are still many
controversial biomechanical factors affecting PFPS. Measuring femoral anteversion is
considered to be useful for identifying patients with intrinsic PFPS symptoms. Also, studies
of correlations of lifestyle, height of heel, sports activities, etc. with students feeling
pain in the patellofemoral joint are considered to be meaningful.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Baker</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Bennell</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Abnormal knee joint position sense in individuals with
