The results showed no difference in erectile function between the two groups. The authors concluded that there is no evidence that sildenafil provides long-term erectile function for patients, while on medication, but also stated that larger trials are required to examine the effectiveness of sildenafil for the prevention of ED.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Pisansky <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> recently published a large placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized trial (<italic>n</italic> = 242) to assess the efficacy of tadalafil once-daily in maintaining erectile function in patients undergoing radiation therapy for localized prostate cancer (clinicaltrials.gov, Identifier NCT 00931528). Almost two-thirds of the patients received EBRT; in almost all the patients intensity-modulated techniques (median total dose 78 Gy) were applied. One-third received low-dose rate BT (LDR-BT) with iodine 125 or palladium 103 (145 Gy or 125 Gy, respectively). Patients on hormonal treatment were excluded. Patients received tadalafil 5 mg or placebo starting within 1 week after initiation of EBRT or the same day as LDR-BT for 24 weeks. Two hundred and twenty-one patients were evaluable. The primary outcome was spontaneous erectile function at 28&#x02013;30 weeks after radiotherapy was started (i.e. 4&#x02013;6 weeks after tadalafil was stopped). The patient was considered to maintain erectile function without the study drug at week 28&#x02013;30 if he answered &#x0201c;about half of the time&#x0201d; or more (score 3&#x02013;5) to question 1 of the IIEF: how often were you able to get an erection during sexual activity?<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> 79% and 74% of the participants assigned to the tadalafil group or to placebo maintained spontaneous erections, respectively, showing a difference of 5% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.49), at primary end-point. Although patients younger than 65 years seemed to maintain erectile function more frequently than older patients, the difference did not reach a statistically significant difference. The same was found for EBRT versus LDR-BT. At 1 year similar results were found: 72% of the patients who received tadalafil versus 71% who received placebo maintained erectile function (<italic>P</italic> = 0.93). The authors are to be congratulated to help answer the important question whether a PDE5i, in this case daily tadalafil, can be advised for the prevention of ED in patients undergoing radiation therapy, after being confirmed effective in about half of the patients to treat ED following radiotherapy for prostate cancer.</p><p>The strengths of the trial are the multicenter distribution, covering different types of medical practices, the use of standardized, modern radiation techniques and doses, the use of validated questionnaires, and the assessment of other aspects of sexual functioning than erectile function only.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>I wonder whether question 1 of the IIEF is the right choice to evaluate erectile function. Getting an erection does not mean that this is rigid enough for penetration (question 2) and whether this is maintained during sexual performance (question 4). Another possible limitation might be the relatively short administration of the study drug; 24 weeks might be too short to prevent penile fibrosis as a consequence of radiation therapy. We can speculate that a PDE5i, by increasing nightly, spontaneous, and voluntary erections, might improve oxygenation of the corporal bodies and therefore preserve endothelial and cavernosal function. This could prevent fibrosis occurring in the first 6&#x02013;12 months after radiotherapy by restoration and preservation of nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation in the irradiated corporal bodies and maintain erectile function of patients undergoing radiation therapy. Because of the extended period of effectiveness, tadalafil, which lasts up to 36 h after intake, might have advantages above other PDE5i because of its prolonged and continuous enhancement of vascular responsiveness.</p><p>It has been written (and discussed) a lot in the literature about the role of PDE5i in the penile rehabilitation process for patients after radical surgery for prostate cancer.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Trials assessing the efficacy of PDE5i to prevent ED in patients undergoing nerve-sparing prostatectomy have shown disappointing results. For example vardenafil taken one-nightly for 9 months improved erectile function during the active drug treatment when compared with placebo, but this effect was terminated when the drug was stopped.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Unfortunately, the results of the tadalafil prevention trial,<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> similar to the one with sildenafil,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> do not allow us to advice patients to take PDE5i to prevent ED when undergoing radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer. Nevertheless, it is important to inform patients that such drugs are effective in about half of the cases to treat ED, with limited side-effects.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref
