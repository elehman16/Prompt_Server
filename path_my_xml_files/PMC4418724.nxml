The pathogenesis of BPD is multifactorial resulting in chronic inflammation of the airways that results in a simplified lung structure [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. To date, despite antenatal steroids, vitamin A, and caffeine being suggested as beneficial agents for BPD prevention, BPD is still the most common adverse outcome after preterm birth and the use of post-natal steroids as potent anti-inflammatory drugs is still under study [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Recent evidence suggests a net benefit of postnatal glucocorticoid therapy when administered shortly after the first week of life to premature infants with early and persistent pulmonary dysfunction [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Similarly, in a recent Cochrane review, late steroid therapy after 7 days of life for chronic lung disease was suggested to reduce neonatal mortality without significantly increasing the risk of adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].Therefore, it is necessary to develop new strategies for the prevention of BPD.</p><p>Chronic inflammation can be maintained by different triggers which promote transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Transcription factors target gene transcription after activation and recruit transcriptional co-activators and chromatin-remodeling enzymes that allows subsequent inflammatory gene expression [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The transcription of genes is mainly made possible by rearrangement of the chromatin structure by histone methylation and deacetylation, which are all epigenetic modification [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Epigenetic regulation of inflammation has therefore several components. Changes in histone acetylation are involved in induction of pro-inflammatory genes in human lung cells. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are expressed and activated in an abnormal fashion in inflammatory diseases and, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors show anti-inflammatory effects [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Differentially-regulated chromatin remodeling pathways were reported in umbilical cord samples of infants who developed BPD by altering HDAC ratio, resulting in histone hypoacetylation. This suggests the use of HDAC inhibitors for the prevention of BPD development [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, current therapies of BPD do not modulate the epigenetic compound of chronic inflammation.</p><p>A candidate drug for this purpose is Valproic acid (VPA), an HDAC inhibitor that is clinically used as an anti-epileptic and mood-stabilizing agent. VPA is an HDAC inhibitor of class I, as well as class II histone deacetylases [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] which results in anti-inflammatory properties by reducing transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This effect was shown in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced septic shock model where VPA attenuated multiple organ dysfunctions by ameliorating histopathological lung injury, preventing pulmonary inflammation by reversing the reduction in histone H3 acetylation in lung tissue [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>However, to the best of our knowledge, no experimental study has investigated VPA&#x02019;s effectiveness in neonatal hyperoxic lung injury. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible preventive effect of VPA in a neonatal rat model of hyperoxic lung injury and the involvement of HDAC inhibition in VPA&#x02019;s effect. We used a rat model in which neonatal exposure to hyperoxia induced lung simplification resembling the lung structure of patients with BPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Animals and experimental design</title><p>The study was approved by Experimental Animal Ethics Committee of Gulhane Military Medical Academy (Ankara, Turkey, Permit number: 2011&#x02013;6) and the experiments conformed to the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications No. 80&#x02013;23) revised 1996 and EC Directive 86/609/EEC.</p><p>Sprague-Dawley rats with dated pregnancies were housed in individual cages with free access to water and food. Pups born with spontaneous delivery to Sprague-Dawley pregnant rats were pooled, randomized, and delivered back to nursing dams.

A total of 40 pups born to 4 dams were divided into 4 groups from each dam as follows: normoxia group (subjected to room air containing 21% O<sub>2</sub> and received saline), normoxia+VPA group (subjected to room air containing 21% O<sub>2</sub> and received VPA), hyperoxia group (subjected to 95% O<sub>2</sub> and received saline), and hyperoxia+VPA group (subjected to 95% O<sub>2</sub> and received VPA).</p><p>Experiments began immediately after birth and continued throughout P10 as described previously [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nursing dams were rotated between hyperoxia and room air-exposed pups every 24h to prevent oxygen toxicity. In pups subjected to hyperoxia, continuous 95% O<sub>2</sub> exposure was achieved in a Plexiglas chamber (70x60x30 cm) by a flow-through system. The oxygen level inside the Plexiglas chamber was monitored continuously with a Ceramatec (MAXO2) oxygen analyzer. Carbondioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration was kept below 0,5% using a gas monitor (Apex, BW Technologies, Lincolnshire, IL).

The effect of VPA was in part mediated by epigenetic modulation of inflammation. We conclude that VPA treatment exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic effects in hyperoxic lung injury model in neonatal rats.</p><p>Chronic inflammation is the hallmark of hyperoxic lung damage and BPD, which were shown to alter HAT/HDAC ratio, resulting in histone hypoacetylation [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Given the problems associated with the use of post-natal steroids for the prevention of BPD with respect to long term neurodevelopmental outcome, we successfully tested a different approach of epigenetic modulation for post-natal chronic pulmonary inflammation. Recent data established that VPA might lead to hyperacetylation of histones by directly inhibiting HDACs. Since histone acetylation and deacetylation might play an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung diseases [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], HDAC inhibitors were already suggested to provide protection against lung fibrosis to altered gene expression after hyperacetylation [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Therefore, we used VPA for this purpose and showed that VPA affected acetylation process in the lung, prevented apoptosis, and decreased inflammation.</p><p>VPA attenuated hyperoxic lung injury by improving the histopathological score and preserving alveolarization in the present study. Our data are in accordance with a previous report which showed that VPA improved histopathological injury in lung, liver and kidney, and ameliorated multiple organ dysfunction caused by LPS induced septic shock [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, we showed that VPA significantly increased lamellar membrane protein expression and mean radial alveolar count as an evidence for the preservation of alveolarization in hyperoxic lung injury. The structural changes were associated with elevated expressions of TGF&#x003b2;3 and SMAD2 proteins in lung tissue samples of rat pups exposed to hyperoxia and these elevations were restored by VPA treatment which is in line with clinical data where increased levels of TGF&#x003b2; isoforms in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of preterm infants were associated with the severity of BPD [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In addition, our data showed that VPA decreased apoptosis by reducing both the number of TUNEL (+) cell count and active caspase-3 expression in lung tissue. Exposure of neonatal rat lung to hyperoxia resulted in apoptosis which was associated with the early rise in pro-apoptotic proteins that overcome the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-2 [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Although the protective effects of HDAC inhibitors in experimental models of inflammation were found to be associated with increased expression of bcl-2 protein family, the precise mechanism of this up-regulation has not been defined [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. We had similar findings in our study in which VPA administration increased bcl-2 expression in neonatal rats subjected to hyperoxia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present data on the effect of VPA on bcl-2 expression in a neonatal rat model of hyperoxia. The mechanism by which VPA administration increased bcl-2 expression in neonatal rats under hyperoxic conditions is yet to be determined. On the other hand, the effect may involve a regulation by p53. It was shown in cancer cells that the tumor suppressor p53 induces apoptosis by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as well as the pro-apoptotic bax protein [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, recent studies report a direct effect of HDAC inhibitors on p53, again in cancer cells [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Accordingly, HDAC inhibitors induce p53 expression, which in turn inhibits the expression of bcl-2 to promote apoptotic death in certain cancer types. However, we found in our study that VPA administration increased the expression of the anti-apoptotic bcl-2 while decreasing the expression of the pro-apoptotic Caspase-3 protein. Therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that the regulation of bcl-2 in hyperoxic lung may be different from that in cancer cells. Nevertheless, our study was not designed to unravel the mechanism of bcl-2 regulation by VPA which must be investigated by future studies. All these results suggest that protective effect of VPA on fibrotic tissue remodeling involves reduction of TGF&#x003b2;/SMAD expression and also apoptosis. The positive impact of VPA on alveolar lung development and apoptotic mechanisms must be evaluated in future studies.</p><p>The structural benefit was associated with preserved GSH-Px and SOD activities and reduced tissue MDA content, MPO activity and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines suggesting that one of the mechanisms by which VPA prevents hyperoxic lung injury is enhancement of antioxidant activity and reduction of lipid peroxidation and inflammation. Similarly, VPA showed protection from lung inflammation by decreasing serum IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; levels, as well as MPO activity significantly in pulmonary tissue by amelioration of lung damage in a rat model of septic shock [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or acute lung injury [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The systemic effects on pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations may have resulted in one of the most interesting effects of VPA. VPA promoted growth in the rat pups that were exposed to hyperoxia. Since malnutrition is known to worsen BPD by compromising lung growth [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], we consider VPA as an interesting candidate for the prevention of BPD. However, it is difficult to translate experimental studies into clinical setting [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. First of all, our study is limited with the lack of data on antenatal steroids, the effects of which on epigenetic regulation, lung growth, inflammation and TGF-&#x003b2; signaling have not been taken into account in our model. Although the effect of antenatal steroids on epigenetic mechanisms in the lung is not known, intrauterine inflammation induced TGF-&#x003b2; signaling was shown to be inhibited by antenatal steroids [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. It was also reported that the order of exposure to inflammation or maternal steroids had large and different effects on fetal lung maturation [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, future studies are warranted that aim to investigate the role of antenatal steroids on epigenetic changes in lung development. Second of all, VPA is a potent drug which has been shown to induce cognitive deficits and the risk of autism after in utero exposure [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, VPA in neonates may lead to progressive hyperammonemia, cerebral edema, and diminished level of consciousness and these potential adverse effects hamper the clinical usage of VPA in this high risk group [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, on the other hand, VPA has been used in neonates with refractory convulsions [<xref rid="pone.0126028.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Therefore, experimental and clinical data regarding the safety of VPA usage in neonates are required before its clinical applicability. In addition, postnatal VPA usage in clinical care warrants long term neurodevelopmental outcome studies in neonates.</p><p>In conclusion, VPA treatment improved alveolarization by preserving histopathological structure, radial alveolar count and lamellar body membrane protein expression in the alveoli as well as it reduced fibrosis, TUNEL(+) cell counts, active Caspase-3 expression and inflammation, and enhanced antioxidant activity while decreasing lipid peroxidation in the hyperoxic lung. In addition, VPA reduced HDAC activity and enhanced acetyl-histone H4 protein expression in the injured lung tissue suggesting the involvement of the inhibitory action of VPA on HDAC activity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that showed preventive effects of VPA, a HDAC inhibitor, in a neonatal rat model of hyperoxic lung injury and reduced body growth. Our data suggest that VPA may be beneficial in treatment of hyperoxic lung injury in preterm infants in case its effectiveness and safety is proven in human studies.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0126028.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
