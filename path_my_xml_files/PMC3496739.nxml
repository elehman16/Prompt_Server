Pavlovian conditioning, on the other hand, is thought to be one major underlying psychobiological mechanism for placebo responses in medicine <xref rid="pone.0049031-Enck1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>We have previously shown that sex differences in overall susceptibility to (motion-induced) nausea are well established <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, that nausea symptoms can be readily evoked following a Pavlovian conditioning procedure in healthy participants <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> and in patients <xref rid="pone.0049031-Stockhorst2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and that this is more effective in females than in males <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In contrast, males responded stronger to suggested symptom worsening (&#x0201c;nocebo responses&#x0201d;) not only in a nausea paradigm <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> but also in pain and placebo analgesia experiments <xref rid="pone.0049031-Flaten1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In these experiments, we were so far unsuccessful eliciting symptom improvements (placebo responses), while in contrast symptom worsening (nocebo responses) were much easier to provoke. This may have in part be due to the fact that we selected participants susceptible to motion that have a history of motion sickness symptoms in their past, and such participants may be less likely to develop expectancies of improvement with strong nauseogenic stimuli. In fact there is some indication in the literature that placebo suggestions may produce opposite effects due to disappointment when the stimulus onset indicates that the applied drug may not be sufficient to suppress intestinal symptoms <xref rid="pone.0049031-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The balanced placebo design <xref rid="pone.0049031-Rohsenow1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> has been proposed to differentiate between the true drug and placebo effects in comparison to the confounding of drug and placebo effects in drug arms of randomized placebo-controlled drug trials <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>With this study we aim to determine whether a) ginger has an antiemetic effect in our nausea paradigm (rotation-induced motion sickness), b) whether information provided on having received ginger or placebo prior to testing would affect ginger-modulated nausea, and c) whether there is a difference in subjective symptoms, behavioral measures and objective assessment of physiological (gastric) functions.

Compliance with the fasting instruction was controlled with a glucose stick.</p><p>After placing cutaneous electrodes for the electrogastrogram (EGG) on the surface of their skin above the stomach (see below), participants were seated in a rotation chair as previously described <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. After 15 min of baseline EGG recording, they took the ginger/placebo capsules followed by another 15 min of EGG recording. For the next 45 min participants filled out questionnaires (Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire (MSSQ) <xref rid="pone.0049031-Golding1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>) with continued EGG recording before the rotation procedure started. Immediately prior to the rotation procedure, participants were informed about the received medication according to the balanced placebo design (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049031-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Immediately before rotation participants were blindfolded and rotated in a standardized fashion for 5 runs of 2-minute duration each with 1-minute interruptions in-between as described previously <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Rotation speed was set at 120 degrees/sec, and participants were instructed by a loudspeaker to move their head up or down every 10 sec, as previously described <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Participants could interrupt the head movements if nausea occurred, and they could stop the rotation procedure entirely if severe nausea occurred, but were encouraged to continue the next run until 5 runs had at least been started. Head movements are essential for the development of the so-called Coriolis effect during which participants experience an illusionary tumbling movement of their body that leads to nausea symptoms <xref rid="pone.0049031-Probst1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. If head movements are stopped symptoms do not increase further. Therefore, the number of head movements (HM) performed as well as the total rotation time (RT) were noted as separate behavioral outcome measures.</p><p>Prior to the rotation, at each interval between two runs, immediately after termination and 15 minutes following termination symptom ratings (between 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;none and 5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;maximal) were taken on a 7-item symptom list asking for the presence or absence of nausea-associated symptoms (vertigo, headache, nausea, urge to vomit, tiredness, sweating, stomach awareness), as previously described <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.

The EGG was recorded with a sampling rate of 5 Hz (Filter settings: band-pass filter with a low cutoff of 0.014 Hz and a high cutoff of 0.34 Hz both with 12 dB per oct roll-off) and stored for off-line analysis.</p><p>Recordings were screened visually for artifacts. Criteria for artifacts were signals with improbable amplitudes (+/&#x02212;1000 &#x000b5;V) for myoelectrical activity of the stomach and fast and sudden onset that did not fit to the surrounding signals. Three segments of at least 5 min length (pre drug, post drug 1, post drug 2) from baseline recordings, and one from the post rotation period (post rotation) were selected for analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0049031-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Selected EGG data were analyzed with a Fast Fourier Transformation procedure (FFT) (custom software using Prime Factor FFT for Windows, version 3.03, Alligator Technologies, Costa Mesa, CA, USA) and a spectral resolution of 0.25 cycles per minute (cpm). A frequency range between 2.5 to 3.75 cpm was regarded as normal gastric activity (normogastria) and a range between 4.0 to 9.75 cpm as tachygastria. We then calculated the percentage spectral power from the total range of 0.75 to 15.0 cpm (for detailed information see <xref rid="pone.0049031-Stem1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>) and computed the ratio between the percentage of the normogastria and the tachygastria band as indicator for nausea. Ratio values above 1 indicate normal gastric activity and values below 1 indicate increased tachygastria. The interruption of the normal 3 cpm activity of the stomach and a shift towards tachygastria has been repeatedly associated with nausea, e.g. induced by rotation chair or vection drum <xref rid="pone.0049031-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Stem2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Statistics</title><p>Equal distribution of demographics and other characteristics among the four experimental groups prior to intervention (baseline data) were tested by 2&#x000d7;2 ANOVAs and Chi-Square tests (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0049031-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Because in previous studies we had observed substantial sex differences on the subjective response <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, we balanced the experimental groups for participant&#x02019;s sex. To control for experimenter effects, groups and participant&#x02019;s sex were balanced for the two experimenters and they were included in post-hoc analyses. Possible confounding variables were experiences with motion sickness (MSSQ), expectancies about own susceptibility to nausea and about ginger effects, and baseline cortisol levels.</p><p>Different from previously published work <xref rid="pone.0049031-Valussi1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Lien1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0049031-Matthews1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, ginger had no antiemetic effect on any of the outcome measures in our rotation chair procedure. Also, the ginger information per se was not effective in preventing or reducing motion sickness or in affecting behavioral and physiological measures. These results seem to be stable since they were not influenced by any of our covariates such as previous experiences with motion sickness (as measured by the MSSQ), by the expectancy of ginger effects, or by salivary cortisol levels.</p><p>The missing effect of ginger may be explained by the higher intensity of stimulation that we used in this study (5&#x000d7;2 minutes instead of 5&#x000d7;1 minute as in most previous studies) and that may have been too strong to be overcome by a weak antiemetic.</p><p>Furthermore, suggestions did not affect the outcome measures. Participants were informed about the antiemetic effects of ginger in the informed consent form, and the suggestion to have received ginger (or placebo) was provided by a short sentence written on a piece of paper that participants found in an envelope directly prior to the rotation procedure. At this point of time, they possibly did not remember the whole information about the effects of ginger, the suggestion maybe was too brief, and there was not enough time to develop positive expectations before rotations started.</p><p>So far, our results agree to the study by Levine et al. <xref rid="pone.0049031-Levine1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> as they did not find any differences between their control group which were told they received a placebo and their positive-expectancy group which were told they received an antiemetic pill. Unfortunately, they did not report analysis of the sex of participants or experimenter(s).</p><p>However, a few published studies have shown significant sex differences in the susceptibility to nausea <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> as well as in the placebo and nocebo response both in nausea <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen3" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and pain <xref rid="pone.0049031-Flaten1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Aslaksen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. We therefore included the sex of participants in our analysis but group differences remained insignificant.</p><p>To control for experimenter effects, participants were randomly and balanced assigned to two experimenters (AM, JS). Post-hoc analyses of experimenter effects revealed a highly significant interaction with drug, information, and participant&#x02019;s sex for behavioral measures in men only. When male participants received ginger there were no effects of information or experimenter on head movements, but when they received placebo they were susceptible to an interactional effect of information given and experimenter: They performed more head movements with the ginger information provided by the female experimenter and with the placebo information provided by the male experimenter.</p><p>Such complex interactions have not yet been described in the literature about nausea and have to be taken with great care, as we did not systematically vary the experimenters but employed only two (of different sex): The effect therefore might as well represent &#x0201c;personality&#x0201d; of the two experimenters rather than their sex. Furthermore, this was a post-hoc analysis to explore further mechanisms in expectation-induced placebo effects in nausea and sample sizes became small. In the light of its implications for further experimental and clinical studies, however, these results are of interest.</p><p>This complex interaction comprises two important issues in placebo research: Firstly, the question whether drug and placebo effects are additive or not <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and secondly, sex differences in expectancy induced placebo effects and psychosocial interactions with experimenters, e.g. <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Aslaksen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Weimer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Kirsch <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> raised the question whether placebo effects in drug groups are as high as in placebo groups in clinical trials and suggested the balanced placebo design for further investigation as it allows separating the true drug effect from the placebo effect. Balanced placebo design studies with everyday-drugs like nicotine showed that expectancy effects more often occurred in placebo groups than in &#x0201c;drug&#x0201d; groups, e.g. <xref rid="pone.0049031-Juliano1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and a recent study with an analgetic revealed that this is particularly true for male participants <xref rid="pone.0049031-Butcher1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In our study expectancy effects in men did not occur when ginger was given and we saw a small effect of ginger in the electrogastrogram in men only. As far as known, no differences in the pharmacological effect of ginger between women and men have been found by now. Another explanation could be that women&#x02019;s behavior is stronger connected to their symptoms than men&#x02019;s behavior as the found correlations would indicate.</p><p>Differences between female and male patients or participants are often described as &#x0201c;gender&#x0201d; effects in studies but psychometric assessment of gender have rarely been conducted, and physiological appearance of participants or self-reports of sex are used. Gender and sex differences in pain perception and processing are well documented in the literature and are assumed to be associated to gender role socialization <xref rid="pone.0049031-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A similar interactional effect of participant&#x02019;s and experimenter&#x02019;s sex on behavioral but not on subjective measures &#x02013; like in our study &#x02013; was found in a study comparing effects of sex and status of experimenters with a ice-water test by employing two experimenters for each condition <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kallai1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>: Male participants could place their hand longer in ice-water with a female compared with a male experimenter, and female participants could tolerate ice-water longer with a male experimenter compared with a female experimenter, but there was no such interaction for subjective pain intensity <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kallai1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Published data on sex differences in placebo and nocebo responses are rare and in part controversial, as we have shown in a review recently <xref rid="pone.0049031-Weimer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, and this refers to both experimental and clinical data. We concluded that sex differences in the placebo response occur predominantly because of psychosocial interactions between participants and experimenters, and not because of physiological differences between women and men <xref rid="pone.0049031-Weimer1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.</p><p>Flaten et al. <xref rid="pone.0049031-Flaten1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> were the first to describe that placebo analgesia may as well be affected by the sex of the participants: In their ischemic pain paradigm, only males responded to the suggestion of pain decrease during a placebo analgesia procedure <xref rid="pone.0049031-Flaten1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, but in this case all experimenters were females. To explore the relationship between placebo analgesia and sex of participants and experimenters further, they employed three male and three female experimenters to study placebo analgesia in healthy participants, half males and females <xref rid="pone.0049031-Aslaksen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. They again found reduced (heat) pain reporting in male participants only when the experimenters were females, and this placebo analgesia was not associated with changes in autonomic activity allowing them to conclude that the observed gender/sex effects on placebo analgesia may be mediated by psychosocial factors. This was further supported by a study <xref rid="pone.0049031-Aslaksen2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> showing that the placebo analgesia response seen in men only was mediated by anticipatory stress response that was stronger in men than in women when expecting placebo analgesia. In contrast, another study by the same group <xref rid="pone.0049031-Aslaksen3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> with four female and four male experimenters showed that male participants reported higher placebo analgesia to male experimenters compared with female experimenters. Interestingly and in line with studies about pain perception in general <xref rid="pone.0049031-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kallai1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, male participants reported lower overall pain to female experimenters than to male experimenters. The authors concluded that the experimenter&#x02019;s sex might not be systematically related to placebo analgesia but maybe his/her behavior <xref rid="pone.0049031-Aslaksen3" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, these studies consistently revealed that male participants were more prone to placebo effects by suggestions than women as it has also been shown for nausea in a previous study from our group <xref rid="pone.0049031-Klosterhalfen4" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>These studies allow concluding that the results of our study reported here may be due to complex psychosocial factors rather than to &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d; sex differences. This is further supported by the fact that behaviors (RT, HM) rather than subjective symptom reports (SR) appear to be sensitive to such psychosocial modulation.</p><p>An explanation for higher susceptibility to suggestions in men may originate in classical gender role socialization whereby men intend to impress women with their behavior <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kallai1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and are often socially punished by their male peers when deviating from &#x0201c;tough&#x0201d; male behaviors <xref rid="pone.0049031-Myers1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In case of symptoms they are willing to endure a situation in general, and especially when additional symptom reduction is suggested. This furthermore could explain the discrepancy between effects in behavioral and subjective measures. Whether this effect is more pronounced with a female or a male experimenter is probably due to personality of the actual experimenter or due to specific participant-experimenter interactions. This hypothesis still has to be investigated in further studies.</p><p>Specific and unspecific physiological measures &#x02013; gastric myoelectrical activity and salivary cortisol &#x02013; appear neither be sensitive to detect such social interactions that were found for behavioral measures, at least not with our experimental paradigm. The results however show &#x02013; as predicted &#x02013; a decrease in normal gastric activity and an increase in tachygastria with rotation onset and even before, as described in the literature <xref rid="pone.0049031-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Stem2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0049031-Meissner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. We also found a moderate effect of ginger in slowing this ratio-shift towards tachygastria in anticipation of the rotation, although the shift ultimately occurred in a similar manner as placebo in response to the rotation procedure. Again this may have been due to the intensity of the stimulus applied.</p><p>A few other limitations of our study need to be acknowledged. One is that participants were appointed to the laboratory either at 8.00 or at 10.30 a.m., and significantly different cortisol levels at these two time points could not only explain the differences in baseline expectancy levels but also subsequent nausea experience, as we have shown in another experiment <xref rid="pone.0049031-Meissner1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, controlling for saliva cortisol levels had no influence on results but balancing groups for the time of investigation may be a prerequisite for future studies. Another limitation is that our sample size has only been sufficient to detect a large but not a moderate effect in the balanced placebo design. Furthermore, we did not intend to study gender/sex differences and experimenter effects, not to speak of their gender/sex. Whereas post-hoc calculation revealed a sufficient sample size to detect a moderate effect in the four-factorial MANOVA (analysis with the software G*power: Cohen&#x02019;s f<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.15, alpha&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.05, and power&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.95 revealed a total n of 62), small cells made the results less robust and difficult to generalize. Therefore, our data must be taken as preliminary and providing first evidence for a complex social interaction between the gender/sex of both experimenters and participants when it comes to placebo (and nocebo) responses in experimental nausea. As social interactions between participants and experimenters could affect every placebo response and therefore occur in nearly every experimental and clinic trial, further investigations are of importance.</p><p>We here used the so-called &#x0201c;balanced placebo design&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0049031-Rohsenow1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> that has been proposed to better separate drug effects from placebo effects than conventional double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled drug trials as it allows to separate the &#x0201c;true&#x0201d; drug effect (drug given but told to have received placebo) from the compound &#x0201c;drug plus placebo&#x0201d; effect when chances to receive the drug are 50% <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kirsch2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. The &#x0201c;additive model&#x0201d; that is underlying all current drug testing has received increasing criticism <xref rid="pone.0049031-Kirsch1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In addition to its deceptive nature <xref rid="pone.0049031-Miller2" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> that is inherent to all placebo research, its major disadvantage is the fact that participants are informed about the drug they have received prior to the testing of its effects, and this may cause mistrust and irritation in usually well-informed human participants, such as students at medical schools. We have recently <xref rid="pone.0049031-Enck2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> proposed an alternative design for this purpose (called the balanced cross-over design) to prevent such bias in data collection that can neither be ruled out nor appropriately controlled for otherwise. However, while this model requires independent validation, the balanced placebo design was successfully employed in the current study to uncover complex interactions of the sex of participants and experimenters on behavior outcomes.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0049031-Valussi1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
