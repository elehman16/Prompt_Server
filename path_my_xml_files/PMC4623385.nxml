Single, escalating doses of ch-mAb7F9 over the range of 0.2 to 20&#x000a0;mg/kg were administered to 42 subjects who were followed for 147 d. Safety was measured by physical examinations, adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory testing. Serum ch-mAb7F9 concentration and immunogenicity analyses were performed. There were no serious adverse reactions or discontinuations from the study due to adverse events. No trends emerged in the frequency, relatedness, or severity of adverse events with increased dose or between active and placebo treated subjects. Ch-mAb7F9 displayed expected IgG pharmacokinetic parameters, including a half-life of 17&#x02013;19 d in the 3 highest dose groups and volume of distribution of 5&#x02013;6 L, suggesting the antibody is confined primarily to the vascular compartment. Four (12.5%) of the 32 subjects receiving ch-mAb7F9 were confirmed to have developed a human anti-chimeric antibody response by the end of the study; however, this response did not appear to be dose related. Overall, no apparent safety or tolerability concerns were identified; a maximum tolerated dose was not reached in this Phase 1 study. Ch-mAb7F9 therefore appears safe for human administration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>addiction</kwd><kwd>chimeric antibody</kwd><kwd>first in human</kwd><kwd>healthy volunteers</kwd><kwd>methamphetamine</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibody</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="1"/><table-count count="4"/><ref-count count="20"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p>adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub></term><def><p>area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>C<sub>max</sub></term><def><p>maximum concentration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTCAE</term><def><p>Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CL</term><def><p>clearance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p>electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDA</term><def><p>Food and Drug Administration</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLP</term><def><p>good laboratory practice</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HACA</term><def><p>human anti-chimeric antibodies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>K<sub>D</sub></term><def><p>dissociation constant</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mAb</term><def><p>monoclonal antibody</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>METH</term><def><p>(+)methamphetamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>t<sub>1/2</sub></term><def><p>apparent terminal half-life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Vd</term><def><p>volume of distribution</p></def></def-item></def-list></sec><sec sec-type="intro" id="s0001"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are no medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of methamphetamine (METH) abuse and dependence disorders, which is a substantial barrier to successful treatment. Anti-METH monoclonal antibody (mAb) medications are a potentially groundbreaking pharmacologic methodology for treating METH use and addiction. Chimeric anti-METH mAb, ch-mAb7F9 (IgG<sub>2&#x003ba;</sub>; METH K<sub>D</sub> = 7&#x000a0;nM), is the first anti-METH mAb to be developed and successfully tested in non-METH-using human volunteers.</p><p>MAbs and active vaccines against METH, cocaine, and nicotine have all shown potential for reducing central nervous system (CNS) effects such as horizontal locomotion and self-administration in animal models.<xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1-5</sup></xref> Anti-METH mAbs reside in the blood and extracellular fluid compartments where they bind METH with such high affinity that they rapidly redistribute METH from its sites of action in the brain and other organs into the blood stream.<xref rid="cit0006" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6-8</sup></xref></p><p>MAbs offer specific advantages as a drug abuse therapy. Compared with other immunotherapies such as vaccines, mAbs necessarily do not require the function of the user's immune system to work, making them appropriate for immunosuppressed patients, including those with HIV/AIDS or autoimmune conditions. The protection against the effects of METH afforded by mAbs is immediate and does not require the 6&#x02013;12 weeks needed for vaccines to establish an immune response. Most importantly, a mAb will have the same general characteristics, i.e., affinity for METH, in every patient. MAbs are also advantageous over small molecule medications because mAbs are not likely to be addictive or interrupt normal neurotransmitter function, and they have a much longer half-life, which improves patient compliance.</p><p>MAbs could also be effective adjunctive therapies in established behavioral treatment paradigms such as contingency management because they should not interfere with learning of lifestyle changes. Integration of ch-mAb7F9 into these programs is expected to improve the drug user's decision-making ability. For instance, reducing the value of METH use through reduction of pleasurable or reinforcing effects may help widen the gap between the reward for abstinence and the consequences of continued use (see related discussion in refs <xref rid="cit0009" ref-type="bibr">9,10</xref>). As suggested by preclinical efficacy studies, an anti-METH mAb is likely to reduce the peak and duration of the high,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> thereby reducing the value of METH use. Given the larger difference between the value of the abstinence reward vs. the value of the high, the choice for abstinence may be easier to make.</p><p>No other anti-METH mAb has progressed as far as ch-mAb7F9 in clinical development. The potential human efficacy of ch&#x02011;mAb7F9 is demonstrated by important in vivo preclinical studies with its murine parent antibody, mAb7F9, which show that it is long-acting,<xref rid="cit0012" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> reduces METH-induced locomotor activity in rats in an overdose model,<xref rid="cit0011" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> and decreases METH-induced locomotor activity in rats 2 weeks after repeated mAb treatment was discontinued.<xref rid="cit0013" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> The development of ch-mAb7F9 from mAb7F9, preclinical studies demonstrating that ch-mAb7F9 retains the specificity and ability to alter METH pharmacokinetics like mAb7F9, and GLP preclinical safety testing results were reported previously.<xref rid="cit0014" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> Together these data supported the initiation of this first-in-human study of ch&#x02011;mAb7F9.</p><p>This was a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending single-dose safety and tolerability study of ch-mAb7F9 administered as an intravenous infusion to healthy volunteers. Forty-two subjects were treated in 5 dose groups ranging from 0.2 to 20&#x000a0;mg/kg ch&#x02011;mAb7F9, with 10 of the 42 subjects receiving normal saline as a placebo control.

</p><p>Of 216 reported AEs, corresponding Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) severity was graded as follows: 3 events as Grade 4 (life-threatening), 6 events as Grade 3 (severe), 47 events as Grade 2 (moderate), and 160 events as Grade 1 (mild). There was no apparent trend in increased CTCAE grade severity with increased dose or between active- and placebo-treated subjects. The Grade 4 AEs (2 active, 1 placebo) were all elevations in blood creatine phosphokinase levels that lasted approximately 7 d and were considered unrelated to the ch-mAb7F9; all resolved with no treatment.</p><p>Of the 3 events in 2 subjects considered by the Investigator as related to study medication, the infusion reaction (Grade 3) and bronchospasm (Grade 2) occurred in the same subject. The infusion reaction began 72 minutes after the initiation of the infusion with the complaint of &#x02018;very slight itching&#x02019; in the back of the throat. No other symptoms were noted upon examination, vital signs were stable, and the infusion continued. At 20 minutes after the infusion reaction onset, a single wheeze was noted when the subject took a deep breath. The infusion was then stopped; about half the dose had been administered. A separate subject experienced an AE of proteinuria (Grade 1) considered related to the study drug. Both subjects with related AEs were in the same dose group (2&#x000a0;mg/kg ch&#x02011;mAb7F9); thus increasing the dose did not result in more AEs considered related to study medication.</p><p>Overall, no trends or clinically meaningful changes were observed in most clinical laboratory analytes throughout the study. Transient increases in mean creatine phosphokinase values were noted in all treatment groups. Treatment-emergent AEs associated with abnormal laboratory values in 4 (12.5%) or more overall active-treated subjects included increased blood creatine phosphokinase, decreased hemoglobin, increased aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, decreased white blood cell, and proteinuria; however, the frequency of events was similar or greater in placebo-treated subjects compared with active-treated subjects overall.</p><p>There were no trends or clinically meaningful changes noted in mean or median vital sign data throughout the study. Changes in vital signs that were reported as treatment-emergent AEs included 1 event each of presyncope (0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg) and hypertension (placebo) and were considered by the investigator as moderate in severity and not related to study medication.</p><p>There were no trends or clinically meaningful changes in mean or median 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) values. However, a slight increase in frequency of clinically noteworthy 12&#x02011;lead ECG values was observed with increased dose, although the frequency was highest in the placebo group. There were no subjects with QT, QTc, QTcB, or QTcF values above 480&#x000a0;ms or with increases following dosing in QT, QTc, QTcB, or QTcF greater than 60&#x000a0;ms.

In the semi-logarithmic presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f0001"><bold>Fig. 1</bold></xref>), the terminal portion of the concentration-time profiles for the 3 higher doses appear to be parallel, providing evidence that the rate of elimination was similar across these dose groups. The terminal portion of the concentration-time profile for the 2 lower doses is somewhat steeper compared to that of the 3 higher doses. With these lower doses, the serum concentrations fell below the limits of quantitation early in the time course and the terminal portion of the concentration-time profile may not be adequately defined.

</p><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters are summarized by dose group in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t0003"><bold>Table 3</bold></xref>. A 100-fold increase in dose from 0.2&#x000a0;mg/kg to 20&#x000a0;mg/kg resulted in an approximate 120-fold increase in mean AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> and an approximate 100-fold increase in mean C<sub>max</sub> across this same range of doses. Dose proportionality was assessed based on whether the 90% confidence interval constructed for the estimate of the slope of the linear relationship between exposure and dose was contained within the interval (0.95, 1.05). For C<sub>max</sub> this criterion was met, thus demonstrating this parameter increased in a dose-proportional manner across this range of doses. The 90% confidence interval for the slope for C<sub>max</sub> was (0.979, 1.05). The 90% confidence interval for this slope for AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> (1.02, 1.07) fell just above the upper limit of this interval. Although the statistical criteria were not met for this parameter, a visual inspection of mean AUC<sub>(0-inf)</sub> versus dose shows this parameter increased in a general dose&#x02011;proportional manner as well.

This ascending-dose design, with enrollment of subjects into higher dose groups only after the lower dose group was determined to be safe and well-tolerated, is a standard design for evaluation of multiple dose levels in Phase 1 studies because this design helps minimize risk to subjects receiving an investigational new drug.

Like ch-mAb7F9, raxibacumab and tefibazumab both have half-lives of approximately 3 weeks.<xref rid="cit0017" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17,19</sup></xref> Pagibaximab is somewhat longer at 33&#x000a0;days<xref rid="cit0020" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and c&#x003b1;Stx2 is shorter at 8.6 d<xref rid="cit0018" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref> The long ch&#x02011;mAb7F9 elimination half-life could be a substantial improvement over many small molecule medications used to treat METH users. Because of its 18-day half-life, ch&#x02011;mAb7F9 dosing should be no more frequent than every 3 weeks, which will increase compliance for motivated patients. Additionally, the volume of distribution was reported for 3 of the mAbs and ranged from approximately 5.25&#x02013;7 L, which is also similar to that reported here for ch&#x02011;mAb7F9. As expected based on the intentional design of ch-mAb7F9 with IgG<sub>2</sub> human constant domains, ch&#x02011;mAb7F9 has typical human IgG pharmacokinetic parameters. Altogether, these results suggest that ch-mAb7F9 is safe and can be maintained at predicted levels needed for efficacy; thus, the clinical evidence supports further development of ch-mAb7F9.</p><p>There are potential risks to moving forward with testing of ch-mAb7F9 in METH-abusing patients. One possibility is that ch-mAb7F9-treated subjects will attempt to surmount the binding capacity of ch-mAb7F9 for METH by self-administering larger doses of METH, which may accumulate in the blood or tissues and result in unexpected peripheral toxicity. Further, the safety of ch-mAb7F9-METH complexes remains to be studied thoroughly in GLP toxicology studies. Significant discussions with FDA about such concerns have resulted in an outline of nonclinical studies necessary to support the initiation of the next clinical study, a proposed safety study in METH-using subjects of the interaction between ch-mAb7F9 and METH.</p><p>Following completion of the required nonclinical studies, a risk mitigation plan will be developed to maximize the safety of the planned Phase 1b study as much as possible. In this later study, inpatient METH-using subjects will receive a single dose of ch-mAb7F9 followed by a series of METH challenges at weekly intervals. The primary objective will be to determine the safety of the interaction between METH and ch&#x02011;mAb7F9.</p><p>These early studies of a therapeutic mAb provide results that may be broadly applicable to other immunotherapies in development for treating drug abuse. For instance, studies of mAbs can define minimum effective serum antibody concentrations and possibly affinity values, yielding specific targets for the design of effective active vaccines. However, because of ongoing improvements in technology, costs of production for a mAb therapy are likely to decrease, enhancing the feasibility of this approach. By showing proof-of-concept and outlining a development pathway with a high affinity anti-METH mAb, these and the upcoming studies of ch-mAb7F9 will further enable development of immunotherapies for treating METH use and improve the options for treating this unmet need.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0004"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0004-0001"><title>Study design</title><p>This Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, ascending intravenous single-dose study was approved by the MidLands Independent Review Board (protocol number TOA62936, clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01603147).
