hormone levels in normal elderly people who were taught horseback riding for 8 weeks.
[Subjects] Subjects were classified into an exercise group (n=10) and control group
(n=10). [Methods] The two groups, horseback riding exercise group of 10 and control group
of 10, were each tested for 15 minutes, 3 times, over 8 weeks. Post-exercise tests were
implemented in both groups in the same way as pre-study tests. [Results] The horseback
riding group showed a significant difference in the pre- and post-exercise serotonin and
cortisol levels. Additionally, serotonin and cortisol levels showed significant
differences between the two groups. [Conclusion] Serotonin and cortisol levels
significantly increased in the experimental group, suggesting that horseback riding
exercise is effective for improving the levels of these hormones.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Hormone</kwd><kwd>Exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>Horseback riding</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Horseback riding is a treatment that stimulates a unique 3-dimensional movement by using a
horse, and it is a part of special physical therapies that improve movement to control body
balance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. One of the effects of
horseback riding is to transfer the 3-dimensional movement, which is very similar to pelvic
tilting, to the pelvis of the person who is riding the horse<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Riding exercise influences parts of the body that are not affected
by other existing exercises, recruiting the agonistic deep muscles that contract and relax
to maintain balance<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Riding exercise is
being reviewed not only for its physical effects, but also for its social and mental
effects. This is because riding involves physical interactions between patients and horses
and promotes social activities among riders, who must communicate with surrounding people,
including managers<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Little information
exists on horseback riding as a physical therapy modality, and even less research has been
conducted on whether riding exercise is beneficial in elderly persons and how this exercise
affects them. This study aimed to investigate the effect of riding exercise on hormone
levels in normal elderly people who were taught horseback riding for 8 weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 20 elderly persons who each gave written informed consent for
participation in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups: a horseback riding
exercise group of 10 and a control group of 10. Tests were performed on all subjects for 15
minutes, 3 times, over 8 weeks. Post-exercise tests were implemented in both groups after 8
weeks in the same way as pre-study tests. The study compared the horseback riding exercise
group (age 69.53 &#x000b1; 3.23 yrs, height 157.60 &#x000b1; 8.73&#x02005;cm, weight 58.76 &#x000b1; 7.89&#x02005;kg, body mass
index 23.64 &#x000b1; 2.27&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with the control group (age 69.73 &#x000b1; 3.49 yrs, height
158.47 &#x000b1; 6.76&#x02005;cm, weight 59.20 &#x000b1; 6.66&#x02005;kg, body mass index 23.61 &#x000b1; 2.59&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and
checked the influence of hormone levels and background EEG on the relative alpha power
index. Jeju horses, which are used to give riding experiences to visitors at Rehabilitation
Center-affiliated horse-riding course, were used for this study. These horses are healthy,
well-accustomed to surrounding environments, well-trained for a long time, and tame. They
also have even strides. Study subjects wore safety helmets, vests, and boots. They sat on
the horses and performed 5-minute exercises at a walking speed (110 m/min). Because the
subjects were all senior citizens, the study was performed at the horses&#x02019; slowest walking
speed. The &#x0201c;walk&#x0201d; is the slowest of horses&#x02019; gaits, and is performed with a 4-foot stepping
motion from the right back foot to the right front foot, and from left back foot to left
front foot. During this time, an instructor led the horse by the bridle and an assistant
supported the test participant, holding him or her by the leg on the right side of the
horse, to facilitate the rider&#x02019;s movement and prevent falls from the horse.</p><p>Hormone analysis was implemented by Clinical Laboratory, analyzing the concentrations of
serotonin and cortisol. The blood sample was collected in a serum-separating tube, which did
not contain ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and was centrifuged at 3,000&#x02005;rpm for 5 minutes.
Serum serotonin analysis was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography, and serum
cortisol analysis was performed using chemiluminescent immunoassay. All experiments were
reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Kangwon National University.
Pre-intervention and post-intervention data were examined using the paired t-test within
each group of subjects and the independent t-test between the groups. The level of
significance was chosen as 5% for all statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The horseback riding group showed a significant difference (p&#x0003c;0.05) in the pre- and

decreased depression in teenagers with emotional disorders<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, 51 children with attention deficit disorder and
severe emotional disturbances participated in horseback riding exercises for 18 months, and
their behavioral deficits and depression improved<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, horseback riding exercise was reported to influence
behavioral and emotional changes in children with autism<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The exercise has also been reported to be helpful for the relief of
symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder when compared with other existing animal-assisted
therapies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, horseback
riding exercise is being reviewed not only for its physical effects, but also for its social
and mental effects. We conducted a research study of older adults to evaluate their hormone
levels and brain waves in relation to horseback riding exercises.</p><p>The results of the study demonstrated a significant difference between pre- and
post-exercise serotonin levels in the horseback riding exercise group (p&#x0003c;0.05). This is
consistent with the results of a previous study that showed that serotonin levels in a group
of individuals with mental disorders increased during 12 weeks of horseback riding
exercises<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes in serotonin levels
can differ depending on various environmental conditions, exercise level of the subject, and
intensity and type of exercise. The frontal lobe controls exercise, language, intelligence,
reasoning and emotion; and serotonin, through its effects on the frontal lobe, can
facilitate sympathy and communication. The exact mechanism for the effect of aerobic
exercise on serotonin is unknown, but it is arguable that exercise can upgrade the serotonin
level, thus affecting feeling, sleep, and arousal<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In our study, the horseback riding exercise group showed significantly different pre- and
post-exercise cortisol levels (p&#x0003c;0.05). Cortisol levels can vary depending on exercise
intensity and study conditions<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>;
exercise of low or moderate intensity over a short time span showed either no difference or
a decrease in the cortisol level, whereas short-time high-density exercise showed a decrease
in the cortisol level<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the intensity and amount of exercise increase, the
cortisol concentration in blood is thought to change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea Grant funded by the
