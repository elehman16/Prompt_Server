hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) among high risk women undergoing intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This randomized clinical trial study was performed from March 2015 to February 2017.
One hundred and twenty six women undergoing ICSI who were at high risk of developing OHSS (having over 20
follicles of &#x0003e;12 mm), were randomized into two groups. The first group received cabergoline 0.5 mg and the second
group received quinagolide 75 mg every day for 7 days commencing on the day of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
(GnRH) agonist administration. Then OHSS symptoms as well as their severity were assessed according to standard
definition, 3 and 6 days after GnRH agonist administration. Ascites were determined by trans-vaginal ultrasound.
Other secondary points were the number of oocytes and the number of embryos and their quality. Quantitative and
qualitative data were analyzed using Student&#x02019;s t test, and Chi-square or fisher&#x02019;s exact test, respectively. A P&#x0003c;0.05 was
considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The incidence of severe OHSS in the quinagolide-treated group was 3.1% while it was 15.8% in
cabergolinetreated subjects (P&#x0003c;0.001). Ascites were less frequent after treatment with Quinagolide as compared to cabergoline
(21.9 vs. 61.9%, respectively) (P=0.0001). There was no significant statistical deferences between the two groups
in terms of mean age, number of oocytes, metaphase I and metaphase II oocytes, and germinal vesicles. There was
a significant difference between cabergoline and quinagolide groups regarding the embryo number (P=0.037) with
cabergoline-treated group showing a higher number of embryos. But, the number of good quality embryo in quinagolide-treated individuals was significantly higher than that of the cabergoline-treated group (P=0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quinagolide seems to be more effective than Cabergoline in prevention of OHSS in high-risk patients

be a life-threatening complication of assisted reproduction 
treatment (ART) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The incidence of OHSS varies 
between 6 and 12% based on the studied population 
and classification of disease; also, severe cases have an 
incidence of 2-4% (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). OHSS is characterized by the 
presence of multiple luteinized cysts within the ovaries 
that induce ovarian enlargement and increase capillary 
permeability with enhanced fluid shift to the third space 
(<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Recent findings have introduced vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) as the mainstay for increased capillary 
permeability (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). OHSS has a broad spectrum of 
clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe symptom. 
Subjects with mild disease presented with enlargement 
of ovaries, lower abdominal pain and discomfort, 
temporary nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal 
distention. Persistent toxic symptoms or the presence of 
ascites indicates a progressive OHSS that requires treatment 
(<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). </p><p>Raised serum estradiol levels to concentrations of 
&#x0003e;2,500 pg/mL, and observations of large numbers of
small and intermediate-sized ovarian follicles, are signs 
of high risk necessitating to proceed with great caution (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Administration of cabergoline, a dopamine agonist as 
a prophylactic agent is associated with significant reductions 
in the incidence of symptoms and signs of moderate 
to severe OHSS. This drug inhibits vascular endothelial 
growth factor 2 phosphorylation (VEGFR-2) (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) 
and decreases the incidence of OHSS and cycle cancellation 
rate without having any adverse effects on gestation. 
Quinagolide (Norprolac&#x02122;) is a non-ergot extract 
and dopamine agonist with a chemical structure similar to 
apomorphine. Binding of quinagolide to D2 dopamine receptors 
on the lactotroph cells in the anterior pituitary decreases 
adenylyl cyclase activity, reduces the intracellular 
cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and inhibits prolactin 
excretion (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The specificity of quinagolide for D2-type 
dopamine receptors diminishes its side effects compared 
to dopamine agonists (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have indicated that quinagolide effectively 
reduces the development of OHSS (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Therefore, 
the aim of the present study was to compare the 
quinagolide and cabergoline effects in preventing severe 
OHSS in high risk female patients who undergo intracytoplasmic 
sperm injection (ICSI), and to evaluate quinagolide&#x02019;s 
effect on the oocyte and embryo quality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The present study was a parallel single-blind randomized 
clinical trial (IRCT2016053128187N1) with a 
1:1 allocation ratio, recruiting 126 patients, who had undergone 
assisted reproductive procedure and were at risk 
of severe OHSS. The patients were randomly allocated 
to one of the study groups according to a random allocation 
sequence generated by a statistician using a computer 
software. The sequence was built through generating 
block size of 4.</p><p>The study was conducted in Infertility and Reproductive 
Health Research Center and Imam Hussein Medical 
Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, 
Tehran, Iran, from March 2015 to February 2017. The project 
was approved by the Ethics Committee (IR.SBMU.
RETECH.REC.1395.542) and institutional review board 
of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, 
Iran, and it was initiated after obtaining written informed 
consents from all participants. Randomization on 
the day of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist 
administration was based on a computer-generated 
random list which determined the random allocation of 
the subjects into the two groups.</p><p>Selection and randomization of the patients were 
performed by a nurse, using a series of sequentially 
numbered sealed envelopes; therefore, the sequence of 
allocation was hidden. The study was single-blinded, 
because the physicians were blind to the treatment 
group, but the patients were aware of the management 
option (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig .1</xref>).</p><p>In this study, patients of 20-40 years old, who had 20 
oocytes and serum estradiol levels of &#x0003e;3000 pg/ml on the 
day of GnRH agonist injection during ICSI cycles, were 
recruited. The inclusion criteria were being at high risk 
of developing OHSS and not having hepatic dysfunction, 
hypertension and a history of syncope. All participants 
underwent controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) 
with gonadotropin/GnRH-antagonist protocol. Ovarian 
stimulation using recombinant-follicle-stimulating hormone 
(FSH, GONAL-f, Serono, Switzerland) was started 
on day 3 of cycle at a dose of 150 IU per day. </p><p>Transvaginal ultrasound was performed every 3 days to 
examine the follicular development. Also, serum estradiol 
levels were measured every 2-3 days using radioimmunoassay 
method. After 5 days of stimulation, when at least 
two follicles with diameters of 14 mm were observed, 
GnRH antagonist (Cetrotide, Merk, USA) or (Orgalutran, 
Organon, the Netherlands) was started with a daily dose 
of 0.25 mg until administration of GnRH agonist. Final 
oocyte maturation was triggered when at least two follicles 
with diameters of at least 17 mm were observed, 
using a single intramuscular injection of 0.2 mg GnRH 
agonist (Decapeptyl, Ferring GmbH, Germany). Oocytes 
were collected 36-38 hours later using transvaginal-
guided follicle aspiration. All embryos were frozen after 
fertilization through ICSI. On day of GnRH agonist administration, 
patients were randomized using computer-
generated random tables into two groups.</p><p>The first group comprised of 63 women, was treated with 
0.5 mg cabergoline (Dostinex&#x02122;, Pfizer, USA) every day 
for 7 days and the second group comprised of 63 women, 
was treated with quinagolide 75 mg (Norprolac&#x02122;, Ferring, 
Denmark) every day for 7 days. Diagnosis of OHSS 
as well as determination of its severity was performed according 
to Golan&#x02019;s classification (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), on days 3 and 6 after 
GnRH agonist administration. The patients vital signs 
and weight were recorded at each visit. Transvaginal ultrasound 
was used to measure the ovarian volume and estimate 
the volume of pelvic free fluid. Data were extracted 
from the Checklist, clinical and laboratory notes and ultrasound 
reports. Age, body mass index (BMI), number of 
retrieved oocytes, number of metaphase . and II oocytes 
and germinal vesicles, number of embryos and number of 
high quality embryos were all recorded in specified data 
sheet. All patients were checked for any related symptoms 
or side effects of cabergoline and quinagolide.</p><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>This was a randomized clinical trial study. To detect 
20% difference in OHSS rates that is considered significant 
(<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) with a power of 80% and a=0.05, 63 patients 
in each group were needed. Statistical analysis was done 
using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL USA). Effect 
size for comparing two means was determined by computing 
the mean difference between the two groups, and 
then dividing the result by the pooled standard deviation, 
according to Cohen&#x02019;s d effect size. So, it is likely to have 
a negative effect size. However, if just the magnitude was 
important, we could take the absolute difference so that 
the effect size would be positive (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Quantitative data 
were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD. Quantitative and qualitative 
data were analyzed using Student&#x02019;s t test, and Chi-
square or fisher&#x02019;s exact test, respectively. A P&#x0003c;0.05 was 
considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 130 women were recruited into the study. 
Four women were omitted from the research due to 
various reasons including declining to participate, 
having hypertension, hepatic dysfunction, or history 
of syncope, and discontinuing the treatment or loss to 
follow-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig .1</xref>). The mean age of the patients in cabergoline 
and quinagolide groups were 31.05 &#x000b1; 5.2 and 
31.63 &#x000b1; 4.4 years old, respectively. There was no significant 
differences between the mean ages of the two 
groups. Also, the two groups were not significantly different 
in terms of other major demographic characteristics 
such as type of infertility, menstrual cycle pattern, 
BMI and duration of infertility (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). There was 
significant differences between quinagolide and cabergoline 
groups regarding the incidence of OHSS (22.2 
vs. 47.6%, respectively) (P=0.001).</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig.1</label><caption><p>Flowchart of the trial.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Int-J-Fertil-Steril-12-1-g01"/></fig><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p> Clinical and hormonal characteristics of patients in two groups of patients entering the study</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable </th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quinagolide n=63</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cabergoline n=63</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">P value</th></tr><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (Y)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.63 &#x000b1; 5.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.05 &#x000b1; 4.4</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.503</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass index (BMI)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.4 &#x000b1; 3.8</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.5 &#x000b1; 3.2</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.174</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Type of infertility</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Primary</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (31.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (33.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.762</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Secondary</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (15.8)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (17.46)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.762</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cause of infertility</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Female factor</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (4.76)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (3.17)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.644</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Male factor</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (17.46)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 (15.87)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.644</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Both (male+PCOS)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (6.34)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (7.93)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.644</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;&#x000a0;Unexplained</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 (1.58)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 (3.17)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.644</td></tr><tr><th colspan="4" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Data are presented as mean + SD or n (%).

the Quinagolide group (3.1% in quinagolide-treated group 
vs. 15.8% in the cabergoline-treated group, P&#x0003c;0.001). Ascites 
were less frequent after treatment with quinagolide as 
compared to cabergoline (21.9 vs. 61.9%, P=0.0001). Also, 
ascites paracentesis was significantly lower in quinagolide 
group compared to cabergoline group (10.9 and 27%, respectively, 
P=0.021). Hematocrit and hemoglobin were 
significantly lower after treatment with quinagolide as 
compared to cabergoline (P=0.045 and 0.034, respectively) 
and admission rate was significantly lower in quinagolide 
group compared to cabergoline (3.1 vs. 22.2%, P=0.001, 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). There was no statistically significant deferences 
between the two groups in terms of gastrointestinal symptoms, 
estradiol levels on the day of agonist administration, 
the number of oocytes, metaphase I and metaphase II oocytes 
and germinal vesicles. The number of embryos in cabergoline 
group was significantly higher in comparison to 
the quinagolide group (17.23 vs. 15.00%, P=0.037), but the 
number of good quality embryos in quinagolide group was 
significantly higher than the cabergoline group (P=0.001, 
<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>OHSS is a life-threatening complication induced by 
ART which is more frequently observed when a strong 
ovarian response occurs (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). This strong ovarian response 
is characterized by development of several ovarian follicles 
and high levels of serum estradiol (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Prophylactic 
administration of cabergoline and quinagolide as dopamine 
agonists, is associated with a significant decrease in 
incidence of signs and symptoms related to moderate or 
severe OHSS (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>This prospective randomized study showed that risk of 
OHSS is more markedly reduced following administration 
of quinagolide at a dose of 75 mg compared to cabergoline 
at a dose of 0.5 mg among high risk patients. In our study, 
the incidence of severe OHSS in quinagolide-treated group 
was significantly lower compared to that of cabergoline-
treated group. Kamel et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) compared quinagolide 75 
mg with cabergoline 0.5 mg in prevention of OHSS among 
high-risk patients undergoing <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF). </p><p>Patients received drugs for 8 days starting from the day 
of human chorionic gonadotropin injection. The number 
of patients who developed OHSS was similar in the two 
groups, which was not consistent with our findings. Busso 
et al. (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 
trial, evaluated different doses of quinagolide in prevention 
of early OHSS. Their findings showed that quinagolide 
when given at three dose (50, 100, 200 mg/day), was effective 
in reducing the incidence of moderate and severe 
OHSS from 4-12% to 0-2. Their results were similar to 
ours regarding the incidence of moderate OHSS after prophylactic 
administration of quinagolide at the dose of 200 
mg/day and severe OHSS at the dose of 50 mg/day. </p><p>According to our results, the number of patients with ultrasound 
evidence of ascites within the 6 days after GnRH 
agonist administration, was significantly reduced in quinagolide 
compared to cabergoline-treated group. Similarly, 
Baumgarten et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) in a randomized controlled prospective 
study on role of quinagolide in preventing OHSS 
among high risk ICSI patients, showed that the number 
of patients with ultrasound evidence of ascites within the 
initial 8 days after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 
administration, was significantly lower in quinagolide-
treated group than control group.</p><p>In our study, admission rate was significantly reduced 
in quinagolide-treated group as compared to cabergoline-
treated group. Kamel et al. (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) found that hospitalization 
rate is similar in cabergoline and quinagolide-treated 
groups which was contrary to our results.</p><p>We found no significant statistical differences between 
the two groups in terms of the number of oocytes, metaphase 
I and metaphase II oocytes, and germinal vesicles. 
Although the number of embryos in cabergoline-treated 
group was significantly higher compared to quinagolide-
treated group, the number of good quality embryos in quinagolide-
treated group was significantly higher than that of 
the cabergoline-treated group. Kili&#x000e7; et al. (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) evaluated the 
effects of cabergoline in prevention of OHSS in women at 
risk undergoing IVF treatment cycles and showed that in 
cabergoline-treated group, total number of embryos, number 
of total good quality embryos, and the fertilization rate 
were significantly higher than control group. In this study, 
cabergoline and quinagolide administration had no negative 
impact on oocyte and embryos numbers and their quality 
which was consistent to previously published data.</p><p>In our study, there was no statistically significant differences 
were observed between the two groups in terms of 
gastrointestinal symptoms. Busso et al. (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) noted that upper 
gastrointestinal symptoms, especially nausea and vomiting, 
were more frequent following administration of quinagolide 
compared to placebo, especially when quinagolide 
was given at high doses. One important limitation of the 
present study was the small sample size. In this regard, the 
small number of patients restricts the generalizability of the 
results of the present study. Advanced trials with adjusted 
doses are therefore required. There was also some potential 
sources of bias including interactions with other drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quinagolide seems to be more effective than cabergoline 
in preventing OHSS among high-risk patients undergoing 
ICSI. Further studies should be performed to compare 
quinagolide and cabergoline to achieve a firm conclusion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was financially supported by Infertility and
