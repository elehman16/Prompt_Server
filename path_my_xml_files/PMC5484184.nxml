Although the guidelines recommend methylphenidate for deficits in attention and processing speed after TBI, there are no guidelines for mental sequelae treatment after TBI.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup></p><p>Methylphenidate, which acts on the dopamine and noradrenergic systems, is known to block the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine into presynaptic neurons. It has been used for treating narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Moreover, it has been reported to have controversial therapeutic potential against TBI-associated neurological sequelae.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> In addition, it has been shown to have an effect on patients with TBI with cognitive impairment by affecting the speed of mental processing.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, its pharmacological properties are similar to those of amphetamines. However, its exact mechanism of action for treating TBI mental sequelae is still unknown, although a previous study reported that it might act via activation of the brainstem arousal system, cortex, and subcortical structures.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup></p><p>Currently, no existing randomized controlled trial has tested the effect of methylphenidate in patients with mental sequelae after TBI. In this study, we compared the effect of methylphenidate with that of placebo in patients with TBI in China. We tested the hypothesis that methylphenidate reduces mental fatigue and improves cognitive functions in patients with TBI.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This study was designed as a 30-week double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled trial. It was approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of The People's Hospital of Yan&#x02019;an and The People's Hospital of Ningxia from January 2014 to December 2016. Thirty-six patients with TBI with mental sequelae, including mental fatigue and cognitive impairment, were recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention group or placebo group in a 1:1 allocation ratio. All participants met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. In addition, written informed consent was obtained from all the included patients.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>All subjects with TBI were recruited through the clinic at the department of neurosurgery at The People's Hospital of Yan&#x02019;an and The People's Hospital of Ningxia from January 2014 to December 2016. All eligible patients were evaluated by clinical evaluation, physical examination, and brain computed tomography. After screening, the subjects were randomized to either the intervention or placebo group. All investigators were trained before this study.

Patients recruited to the intervention group received methylphenidate (flexibly titrated from 5&#x0200a;mg/d at the beginning, then gradually increased by 2.5&#x0200a;mg/d until reaching 20&#x0200a;mg/d).

It found that methylphenidate reduces mental fatigue and improves cognitive functions with long-term methylphenidate treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Although this study did not involve any type of control intervention,<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> its finding is consistent with the present study in showing that methylphenidate can reduce mental fatigue and improve cognitive outcomes in patients with TBI. Another reported study with a small sample size investigated the effects of methylphenidate and sertraline compared with placebo on various neuropsychiatric sequelae associated with TBI.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> It found that methylphenidate and sertraline had similar effects on depressive symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> However, methylphenidate seemed to be more beneficial in improving cognitive function and maintaining daytime alertness.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</sup> In addition, methylphenidate also offered better tolerability than sertraline. Two literature reviews also assessed the effect and safety of methylphenidate for treating subjects with TBI.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Of those, one demonstrated that methylphenidate is likely to improve memory, attention, concentration, and mental processing; however, its effects on behavior have not been determined.<sup>[<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> The other one reported the positive effects of methylphenidate for enhancing vigilance-associated attention.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> However, no significant positive impact was noted on the facilitation of memory or processing speed.</p><p>In the present study, patients with TBI in the intervention group showed a significant decrease in fatigue and an improvement in cognitive outcome, compared to patients in the placebo group. This suggests that methylphenidate had a positive effect on mental fatigue and cognitive functional outcomes. In addition, this study also demonstrated that methylphenidate could improve depression in patients with TBI.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, although this study was a randomized placebo-controlled trial, its sample size was quite small, which may affect the results. Second, differences in the severity of the clinical symptoms between the 2 groups may have affected the outcomes, such as cognitive functions, though no differences were found at baseline. Third, other factors, such as the area of brain injury, cognitive difficulties, and psychiatric history, that were not investigated might also affect the outcome measurements.</p><p>This study showed that methylphenidate treatment in patients with TBI improved not only fatigue and cognitive functions but also depression. Further randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes are still needed to verify these results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BDI = Beck Depression Inventory, BP = blood pressure, MMSE = Mini-Mental State Examination, TBI = traumatic brain injury.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no funding and conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bruns</surname><given-names>J</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name><name><surname>Hauser</surname><given-names>WA</given-names></name></person-group>
