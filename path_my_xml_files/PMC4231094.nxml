Secondary outcomes were abstinence during follow-up, engagement in treatment (i.e. completing the induction period), retention and satisfaction with the explanations provided by the physician.

Despite this, access to methadone remains limited because of the risk of overdose during induction, especially in countries where the need for methadone is even greater.</p><p>While access to buprenorphine in primary care has been possible since 1996 thanks to its safety profile <xref rid="pone.0112328-Carrieri1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Auriacombe1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, methadone induction in France, as in most countries, is currently possible only in specialized centers caring for substance dependence (located in <italic>ad hoc</italic> sites or in hospitals) (hereafter specialized care or SC). In France these centers can refer patients to PC only after the end of methadone induction, i.e. when methadone doses are stabilized (after at least 14 days).</p><p>The specific model of care for regulating methadone induction can greatly influence its safety as the risk of overdose during the induction phase remains a major concern. Internationally, the regulations governing the extent to which methadone induction (i.e. until dosage stabilization) is authorized in primary care (PC) differ considerably. For example, methadone induction in PC is legal in the UK, in Switzerland and in Canada under different models of care. In contrast, France, the United States but also other countries have no such system currently in place.</p><p>This means that in the many geographic areas underserved by SC, opioid-dependent individuals seeking treatment have no access to methadone. To tackle this situation, one of the objectives of the French public health authorities' national strategic plan for prevention and care of Hepatitis was to consider using primary care as an entry point for methadone treatment, based on the results of a pragmatic trial. The trial, entitled Methaville, was designed both to evaluate the feasibility of methadone induction in PC and to compare outcomes in participants randomized into PC induction with those randomized into SC induction. Being a pragmatic trial, the objectives were to verify the feasibility and acceptability of the PC induction model to physicians and patients, and also to show that the main patient outcome (street-opioid abstinence after one year of treatment) and secondary outcomes (abstinence during follow-up, engagement in treatment, retention in treatment and satisfaction with the explanations provided by the physician) were all comparable between both induction arms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112328.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0112328.s002">English protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>The Methaville ANRS trial is registered with the French Agency of Pharmaceutical Products (AFSSAPS) under the number 2008-A0277-48, the European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials: Number Eudract 2008-001338-28, the ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00657397 and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Register ISRCTN31125511.

All individuals provided written, informed consent before participating in the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Physicians and Participants</title><p>In this multicenter, pragmatic, randomized trial, for each study site we selected an SC physician and nearby PC physicians who already had field experience in care for opioid dependence and/or training in care for drug dependence, and who were willing to participate. Only PC physicians with patients potentially eligible for enrollment in the study were selected because if methadone induction in PC is officially adopted in France in the future, only PC physicians meeting the above criteria will be targeted by authorities as methadone prescribers. Ten sites in four geographic areas (North, North-Eastern, South-Western and South-Eastern France) were included, with each site having at least one SC and one PC physician. These four geographical areas were chosen to better target the different types of populations who would benefit from access to methadone in primary care, as each geographical area is characterized by different drug markets and drug user practices/needs. Physicians (in PC and SC) enrolled opioid-dependent individuals who were randomized to start methadone either in PC or in SC.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were chosen to target a population representative of drug users needing/seeking methadone treatment in France as follows: aged over 18 years old, seeking care for opioid dependence and not prescribed methadone for at least one month or receiving buprenorphine but needing to switch to methadone for medical reasons (side effects, treatment misuse, etc.). Non-inclusion criteria were similar to those in other studies involving methadone prescription in PC <xref rid="pone.0112328-Fiellin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Strain1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> as follows: could not be reached by phone for an interview and screening positive for opioids/benzodiazepines/alcohol triple co-dependence, as assessed by the MINI <xref rid="pone.0112328-Sheehan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> (as this condition exposed participants to a high risk of overdose <xref rid="pone.0112328-Brands1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Kerr1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>) and finally, for women, being pregnant.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study design</title><p>The first visit took place when a patient seeking care for opioid dependence or needing to switch treatment from buprenorphine to methadone went to see a PC or SC physician participating in the trial. After providing consent to participate the patient was randomized into the PC or SC arm by this physician. To make patient randomization feasible, each site had one SC with at least one PC physician in the nearby vicinity. All PC and SC physicians involved underwent a one-day training course both to standardize methadone induction practices according to trial guidelines and to acquaint them with trial procedures <xref rid="pone.0112328-Roux2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Trial guidelines stipulated that the starting dose should be on average 30 mg and not exceed 40 mg, with 10 mg increases every 2&#x02013;4 days thereafter until dose stabilization.

Thereafter, supervision was required only for patients who were deemed to be at risk of overdose.

Accordingly, arm changes (PC to SC or SC to PC) were not considered as deviations from the protocol. Further details and the pre-trial phase of the protocol are described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0112328-Roux2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data sources and outcomes</title><p>The following 5 sources provided study data: a pre-enrollment medical questionnaire, a medical questionnaire at each scheduled visit (enrolment (M0), months 3, 6 and 12, respectively M3, M6 and M12), a short self-administered questionnaire (completed during scheduled visits), a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) (conducted just after each scheduled visit) lasting no more than 30 minutes, and when available, urine rapid tests <xref rid="pone.0112328-Roux2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Abstinence from street-opioids at M12 was chosen as the primary outcome. Abstinence during the course of treatment, engagement in treatment, retention in methadone maintenance treatment and patient satisfaction with the explanations provided by the physician were secondary outcomes. The primary outcome, abstinence from street opioids during the previous month, was measured using a validated question <xref rid="pone.0112328-Darke1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, administered during phone interviews by trained non-judgmental staff. This question was also answered in the medical interviews at enrolment, M3, M6 and M12.</p><p>Methadone dose was defined as the number of mg/day of methadone prescribed by the physician for each patient at each medical visit.</p><p>Engagement in treatment was computed in those randomized to each specific arm as the proportion of patients who actually started methadone and remained in the trial until the stabilization of dosages (i.e. until the end of induction). Follow-up participation rates, i.e. participants who continued participating in study interviews until M12, were computed for each arm.</p><p>Retention in methadone maintenance treatment was defined, only for patients who actually started methadone treatment, as the time between the first day of methadone induction and the last known date that the patient was still receiving treatment. For individuals still on methadone at M12, retention was set at 12 months.</p><p>A 5-point Likert scale measured patient satisfaction with the explanations provided by his/her prescribing physician during CATI at M6 only. This outcome was then dichotomized (very satisfied vs. other).</p><p>There were three main reasons to justify the choice to use patient self-reported street-opioid use as the primary outcome. The first reason was to avoid introducing measures which would not reflect routine practices in the field of care for drug dependence in France (for example neither urine tests nor hair analysis are routinely performed). These alternative measures would have been negatively affected by several missing values. Furthermore, any cases with complete values would most likely have been biased, as urine testing is currently performed at the discretion of the physician if he/she is doubtful about patients' drug use. The second one was to place the patient at the center of the study and consider his/her self-reported experience with treatment (satisfaction with the explanations provided by the physician) as a major outcome. This choice reflects the work in other trials involving drug users and in other fields of medicine where patient's reported outcomes are considered as main outcome measures <xref rid="pone.0112328-Coons1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Third, patient self-reports are valid as PC physicians rely on them in clinical practice <xref rid="pone.0112328-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>We chose the endpoint at M12 for the trial phase on the basis that any comparison between arms would not be significant enough immediately after the induction phase or indeed at M3, and that any possible benefit could be confirmed after one year of treatment.</p><p>The outcomes used in this pragmatic trial were those typically used in trials assessing the efficacy of a treatment for opioid dependence <xref rid="pone.0112328-Fiellin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Strain1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The only difference here is that they were used to assess methadone effectiveness (and not efficacy) by induction arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Safety issues</title><p>To ensure safety during induction, we implemented a wide range of strategies minimizing overdose risk in the trial's model of care, including a one-day training session for PC physicians, strict supervision of participants when they took their doses at the pharmacy during treatment initiation, and fostering strong collaboration between all the health professionals involved in the study, including pharmacists (shared-care model) <xref rid="pone.0112328-Weinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.

It was deliberately designed as a pragmatic trial <xref rid="pone.0112328-Bouvenot1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Vray1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, i.e. having a real-life context to ensure external validity and to provide information about methadone effectiveness, irrespective of the induction site. It was also designed to provide recommendations about the possible authorization of methadone induction in primary care in France.</p><p>The main result of the trial is that induction in primary care is feasible, as patients in primary care are not less likely to be abstinent from street opioids compared with those inducted in specialized care. Another interesting result is that PC appears to be more attractive for opioid-dependent individuals, first because patients randomized into primary care were more likely to accept treatment than those randomized in specialized centers. Secondly patients who were inducted (after randomization) in primary care were more likely to engage in treatment and report greater satisfaction with medical information provided by their physician. Furthermore, this study highlighted that once methadone treatment was started, retention in treatment was similar in both arms. These last two results reflect the two main criteria generally used for assessing the effectiveness of treatments for opioid dependence - namely retention and non-medical opioid use &#x02013; and confirm the comparable effectiveness of PC and SC over one year.</p><p>Similar results were found in a previous pragmatic trial comparing maintenance in primary care and specialized care. That trial also showed comparable outcomes and better satisfaction with treatment in the primary care maintenance arm <xref rid="pone.0112328-Fiellin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Wittchen1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Keen1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>Engagement in treatment was significantly lower in specialized care than in primary care, with early discontinuation rates significantly higher in the former group. This may be directly attributable to the specific French context, where access to buprenorphine already exists in primary care <xref rid="pone.0112328-Auriacombe1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Indeed, previous pragmatic trials for other treatments involving primary care <xref rid="pone.0112328-Fransen1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> have highlighted that strong patient engagement is related to the high motivation of physicians enrolled in the trial. This was also the case for physicians who accepted to participate in the present trial. Indeed this is the population of physicians which will be targeted if methadone induction becomes authorized in France.</p><p>In addition, it is important to note that the results of this trial by and large are consistent with those found in previous literature <xref rid="pone.0112328-MacGowan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This shows that patients receiving methadone in primary care have comparable treatment responses in terms of retention and opioid use.</p><p>Using primary care as an entry point for opioid dependence care (and also for associated comorbidities) has greatly contributed to the scaling-up of treatment for opioid dependence in countries such as the UK. Even more importantly it helps &#x0201c;normalize&#x0201d; care for drug users. The availability of buprenorphine in primary care has partially contributed to &#x0201c;normalize&#x0201d; care for drug users in France as it means they can initiate a treatment option for opioid dependence &#x0201c;free-of-charge&#x0201d; like any other patient, and do so in structures which also provide care for other medical conditions to the general population.</p><p>As the French public health authorities were particularly concerned by the overdose risk during induction, the design of the trial proposed a specific model of care for methadone induction in PC in order to maximize safety. Individuals inducted in PC were over-represented in order to better detect possible overdoses during induction in the PC arm. As it happened, no overdoses were observed during induction, confirming previous results about the importance of a shared-care model to minimize such a risk <xref rid="pone.0112328-Weinrich1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The strengths of this study lie in the following three key points: first the identification of physicians who will likely be authorized to induct methadone by public health authorities; second the choice of a population of patients which was highly representative of individuals seeking care for opioid dependence in France (non-inclusion criteria were based exclusively on clinical practice criteria to control the risk of overdose); third, the adoption of a flexible treatment protocol where patients could choose to change arm after induction reflecting current clinical practice in France.</p><p>One reason why equity of access to methadone and buprenorphine is important in France is because primary care physicians regularly have to manage persistent buprenorphine-injection practices and associated complications <xref rid="pone.0112328-DelGiudice1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which are often a consequence of inadequate dosage prescription <xref rid="pone.0112328-Roux3" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> or patient dissatisfaction with treatment. For this reason it is important for France to also consider patients who need to switch from buprenorphine to methadone for medical reasons. Despite the wide availability of generic buprenorphine in France, switching from buprenorphine to methadone in primary care could result in reduced costs for care of opioid dependence. However, methadone is likely to present more drug-drug interactions than buprenorphine for those on HIV or HCV medication. Consequently, before starting methadone in patients already receiving such medication, physicians should know how to modify methadone doses accordingly. This is why primary care physicians involved in the present trial received training and appropriate guidelines for all possible drug-drug interactions with methadone treatment, together with guidance about the differences between starting methadone in buprenorphine patients compared with methadone induction in street-opioid users.</p><p>A substantial portion of the participants starting methadone in SC switched from buprenorphine to methadone. This is the usual treatment chain for opioid-dependent patients in France. This is not so frequent in other countries. However, switching in France is impossible in areas underserved by specialized centers for substance dependence (i.e. non-urban areas) where general methadone initiation is not available.</p><p>Although methadone induction is already possible in primary care in some countries including the UK and Switzerland, no previous trial has compared methadone outcomes over one year as a function of the site of induction. The randomization of a specific model of care for drug users has already been performed in other trials <xref rid="pone.0112328-Fiellin1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-OConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Gibson1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> which had similar public health objectives.</p><p>The population targeted in this trial is representative of those seeking care for opioid dependence in France <xref rid="pone.0112328-CadetTarou1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> and in other countries where similar models of specialized care are available <xref rid="pone.0112328-McCowan1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0112328-Schwartz2" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However it is difficult to say to what extent these results remain valid in countries where access to opioid maintenance treatment is not free for drug users. Nevertheless, the study was performed according to standard international guidelines <xref rid="pone.0112328-Fareed1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0112328-Soyka1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> in order to make our results as relevant as possible for other contexts.</p><p>Among the limitations of the trial, the need for physical proximity between the primary care physician and specialized centers obliged us to target areas where patients' need for methadone was already being substantially met by the specialized centers rather than underserved areas. This resulted in slowed enrolment rates and the enforced extension of the duration of enrolment period. Certainly a larger sample size and longer follow-up would have provided long term comparisons and increased the study's power, but this was not feasible both because of the practical reasons outlined above and cost reasons. The possible effect of heterogeneity between sites (i.e. sites with more than one PC physician versus sites having only one) was tested as a random effect factor in mixed models but was not found to be significant. It is possible that a larger sample size could have altered these results. However, it was important to represent different site sizes (i.e. those with different numbers of participating PC physicians) in the trial for external validity reasons.</p><p>Today, many governments of countries with HCV and HIV epidemics driven by drug use are still reluctant to introduce or scale up methadone treatment using alternative models of care, even though such an approach would be cost-effective, especially for controlling HIV and HCV <xref rid="pone.0112328-Wolfe1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>The model used for primary care in this study may be of interest in other settings where access to methadone is needed for HIV and HCV prevention purposes. However, it is important to remember that our results strongly depend on the specific context of France where primary care already plays an important role in engaging patients in treatment for opioid dependence.</p><p>In conclusion, methadone induction in primary care is feasible and acceptable for both physicians and patients. It is as effective as induction in specialized care in reducing street-opioid use and ensuring engagement and retention in treatment for opioid dependence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0112328.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
