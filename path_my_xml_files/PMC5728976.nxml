Several anesthesiologists use this agent for the induction of general anesthesia. However, a high dosage is related to hypotension and/or bradycardia, with possible underlying mechanisms including the negative inotropic or peripheral vasodilation effects of propofol.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the use of propofol for the induction of anesthesia in patients with susceptible comorbidities can lead to the occurrence of serious and dangerous cardiovascular complications.</p><p>Previous studies reported that opioids or benzodiazepines used in combination with propofol provided additive or synergistic effects that could decrease the required dose of propofol for several procedures.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Midazolam is a benzodiazepine commonly used as a pretreatment agent to decrease anxiety and improve patient satisfaction levels.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Remifentanil is an opioid used for intraoperative pain control. Pretreatment with remifentanil can decrease injection pain<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> and provide hemodynamic stability during the induction period.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> However, the required bolus dose of propofol for loss of consciousness during induction in patients who receive pretreatment with remifentanil or midazolam remains unclear. Furthermore, the effects of premedication with remifentanil or midazolam on the patient's hemodynamics have not been elucidated.</p><p>Therefore, in this randomized controlled trial, we investigated and compared the effects of no pretreatment, remifentanil pretreatment, and remifentanil plus midazolam pretreatment on the 95% effective dose (ED<sub>95</sub>) of propofol for loss of consciousness during induction.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (approval no: 2015-0183-004) of Gangnam Severance Hospital, Seoul, Korea and registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02536690). A total of 124 patients (age, 20&#x02013;50 years) scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in this study. Patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of III or IV, those with a history of adverse effects caused by the study drugs, and those with a body mass index of &#x02264;20&#x0200a; or &#x02265;30&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent from all the patients, we randomized them into 3 groups using a computer-generated randomization table.</p><p>Before transfer to the operation room, an 18-gauge intravenous catheter was inserted at the patient's basilic vein and 5&#x0200a;mL/kg of 0.9% normal saline was infused before the induction. Intravenous glycopyrrolate 0.2&#x0200a;mg was administered as premedication to all the patients. In the operating room, the patients were monitored with electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, noninvasive blood pressure measurements, and multigas analysis.</p><p>Each patient received intravenous propofol after 5&#x0200a;minutes of preoxygenation. In Group P (Propofol), no additional drug except propofol was used for the induction. In Groups PR (Propofol-Remifentanil) and PMR (Propofol-Midazolam-Remifentanil), remifentanil 0.25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg/min was intravenously infused from the start of preoxygenation until 2&#x0200a;minutes after propofol administration. In Group PMR, intravenous midazolam 0.05&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg was additionally administered 1&#x0200a;minute after preoxygenation.</p><p>After the predetermined dose of propofol was administered, loss of the eyelash reflex and verbal response was assessed for 2&#x0200a;minutes. Induction success was represented by loss of both the eyelash reflex and verbal response. Other cases were considered failures.</p><p>The dose of propofol used for each patient was determined according to the success or failure of induction in the previous patient using a modified biased coin up-and-down method.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> The initial dose was set as 1.0&#x0200a;mg/kg for each group; this was the least successful hypnotic dose of propofol in a previous study.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> If induction failed in 1 patient, the dose for the next patient was increased by 0.25&#x0200a;mg/kg. If induction was successful in 1 patient, the dose for the next patient was determined by a randomly selected card from a total of 19 cards. With a probability of 1/19, the dose for the next patient was decreased by 0.25&#x0200a;mg/kg, and the same dose was administered with a probability of 18/19.</p><p>The mean blood pressure (MBP), heart rate (HR), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) of all the patients were recorded at baseline, before propofol administration, and 1 and 2&#x0200a;minutes after propofol administration.

The results indicated that the required hypnotic dose of propofol was lower when the patients received pretreatment with remifentanil or both remifentanil or midazolam. However, MBP and HR decreased more with pretreatment than without pretreatment.</p><p>Some studies have reported the propofol dose-sparing effects of remifentanil and midazolam. The findings of our study were consistent with the findings of these previous studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Pretreatment with remifentanil during induction has some advantages. The optimal dosage of remifentanil pretreatment can offer hemodynamic stability during maneuvers in the induction period, including laryngoscopy and intubation,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and it was also shown to have protective effects on organs in animal studies.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> In addition, it is reported that remifentanil pretreatment can prevent pain caused by propofol injection. A few studies used target-controlled infusion to investigate the hypnotic dose of propofol when combined with remifentanil and the effects of combined treatment on hemodynamics.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> Target-controlled infusion requires special equipment that needs time to be set up. In addition, this technique may not be accurate in situations where several drugs are used in combination, particularly in the induction period.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> In clinical practice, several clinicians administer the study drugs according to the patient's weight. Therefore, we designed this study using weight-based calculations for the drug dose.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that propofol should be administered at lower doses in the elderly or when used in combination with other agents.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> Nevertheless, several clinicians still use an induction dose of up to 2.5&#x0200a;mg/kg (ED<sub>95</sub> of propofol), even when midazolam or remifentanil are administered for premedication and analgesia during the induction period.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> A possible reason could be the lack of clinical data on the ED<sub>95</sub> of propofol when used in combination with midazolam or remifentanil. The findings of our study suggest that the ED<sub>95</sub> of propofol can be decreased in patients who receive pretreatment.</p><p>Although we were able to lower the propofol dose for loss of consciousness by remifentanil pretreatment with or without midazolam, the decrease in MBP and HR was greater with pretreatment than without pretreatment. Remifentanil is often used to induce hypotension during surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> The decrease in blood pressure is thought to be due to a decrease in the regional vascular tone.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> However, remifentanil is known for better maintenance of hemodynamic stability and the cerebral blood flow compared with other currently used opioids,<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> although the decrease in blood pressure becomes more conspicuous when it is administered in combination with propofol.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> In the present study, blood pressure did not decrease until propofol was administered in Groups P and PR, whereas it began to decrease before propofol was administered in Group PMR. Midazolam does not usually decrease blood pressure when used alone.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> The decrease in MBP observed before propofol administration in Group PMR in the present study can be attributed to a decrease in anxiety induced by midazolam.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> However, because the initial MBP of the study subjects was in the normal range of 88.2 mm Hg, there is a possibility that midazolam synergized with remifentanil to cause the decrease in blood pressure.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> Further studies would provide a more clear understanding of the interaction between the 2 drugs.</p><p>Bradycardia is commonly caused by remifentanil,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> probably because of vagal or chronotropic effects. However, the exact mechanism remains unclear.<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> In the present study, HR did not decrease until propofol was administered in Groups P and PR, although it decreased after the administration of propofol. In Group PR in particular, HR decreased more sharply compared with that in Group P, suggesting that the chronotropic effects of the 2 drugs are synergistic. In contrast, in Group PMR, HR decreased from the early stages, before propofol administration. However, there was no significant difference in HR between Groups PMR and PR at 2&#x0200a;minutes after propofol administration. This was probably caused by blunting of the HR decrease due to incomplete anxiolysis in the early induction period in Group PR.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup></p><p>This study has several limitations. First, because endotracheal intubation requires a much higher dose of anesthetic compared with the dose required for loss of consciousness, we used an inhalation agent and muscle relaxants after loss of consciousness to obtain deeper analgesia and muscle relaxation for intubation. Therefore, the response to stimuli such as tracheal intubation and hemodynamic changes during surgery could not be investigated. Second, relatively healthy adult patients were enrolled in our study. Because patients may have different sensitivity to the drugs by their age, the result of this study may not be well applicable to the elderly. Considering that the hemodynamic changes can be more devastating in elderly patients, further research on elderly patients seems necessary.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>The effective dose of propofol for loss of consciousness could be decreased by 21% and 47% when remifentanil pretreatment was used without and with midazolam, respectively.

These findings suggest that the combination of remifentanil with or without midazolam may have no benefit on hemodynamic stability during induction using propofol.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Ms Jung Hwa Hong for her statistical analysis of the study data.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ANOVA = analysis of variance, ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, BMI = body mass index, CI = confidence interval, ED<sub>95</sub> = 95% effective dose, HR = heart rate, MBP = mean blood pressure, SpO<sub>2</sub> = oxygen saturation.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fassl</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>High</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name><name><surname>Stephenson</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
