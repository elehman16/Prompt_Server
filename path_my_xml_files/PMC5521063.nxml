Nevertheless, as adherence to a low-sodium diet is poor, interventions regarding habit changing should be of a motivational nature in order to develop the ability of overcoming obstacles regarding sodium-restriction behavior.</p><p id="Par2">The present study aims to describe the protocol and randomization of a clinical trial design in order to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention based on Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DSRQ) scores. The effectiveness measures are the DSRQ score variation and reduction in urinary sodium values from baseline to after 2 and 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par3">This parallel, randomized clinical trial will include 120 participants, recruited and randomized as follows: 60 of them to be allocated to a sodium-restriction educational intervention group whose results are based on the DSRQ application; and the other 60 allocated to a control group with usual care. Educational orientation and usual care sessions will be conducted once a month for a period of 6&#x000a0;months. Both spot urine collection &#x02013; estimating sodium intake &#x02013; and the DSRQ will be applied at the baseline, in the eighth week and at the end of the follow-up.

According to a meta-analysis, sodium-intake restriction has shown effectiveness in reducing blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Even salt-restriction diets, such as DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and the Mediterranean diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], were associated with a decrease in blood pressure levels. The guidelines to reduce salt intake to 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;g/day should, therefore, have a major effect on blood pressure, but a further reduction to 3&#x000a0;g/day will have an even greater effect and should become the long-term target for population salt intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">In contrast, evidence has demonstrated that there is an increased risk of cardiovascular disease events and deaths associated with 24-h urinary sodium excretion of less than 3&#x000a0;g/day in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals. However, high-sodium intake (greater than 6&#x000a0;g/day) was associated with an increased risk in individuals with hypertension. These data suggest that lowering sodium intake is best targeted at populations with hypertension who consume high-sodium diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, current evidence suggests a recommendation for moderate sodium intake in the general population (3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;g/day), targeting the lower end of the moderate range among those with hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">According to hypertension treatment guidelines, a daily intake of approximately 3.7&#x000a0;g/day (1500&#x000a0;mg of sodium) is recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, a reduction of 2.0&#x02013;4.6&#x000a0;g/day of salt can result in clinically significant lower systolic blood&#x000a0;pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, low-sodium diet adherence is poor, since most patients are asymptomatic and present difficulties in adopting and perceiving the benefits of reduced sodium intake, usually considering them too restrictive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Also, there is no measure considered as &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for assessing treatment adherence, making the perception of nonadherence difficult for health professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Interventions for behavior change should develop motivation to achieve goals such as reducing salt addition during meal preparation as well as the consumption of salty food; besides that, health professionals should consider the need to incorporate strategies to improve the necessary skills to overcome obstacles related to salt-intake-restriction behavior; thus, help transforming intention into action and strengthen such intentions by improving the perception of self-efficacy and habit change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Only providing information about food to be avoided would not be enough to change this behavior, it is also necessary to help patients find out other kinds of food, replacing salty aliments with a healthier diet but with the same level of dietary pleasure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Thus, a hedonic change to lower salt levels may be achieved by gradual exposure to food with low-salt content, resulting in a reduction of the salty taste threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, simple advising, though in clinical environments and administered in each visit, tends to show low efficiency; moreover, even in intensive counseling, only 20 to 40% of the participants in clinical trials of sodium restriction reduced their consumption to below the maximum recommended limit of 2300&#x000a0;mg/day (100&#x000a0;mmol/day) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">The Dietary Sodium Restriction Questionnaire (DSRQ) was developed due to the lack of instruments for measuring low-sodium diets among patients with heart failure (HF), in order to improve adherence to a low-sodium diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This questionnaire aims to help identify facilitators and barriers to adherence to a low-sodium diet, which is useful in clinical practice in order to guide the development of interventions for patient education and counseling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">Adherence to a lifestyle modification program, in order to modify health behavior, is very difficult because there are many barriers to behavioral change, such as knowledge about the disease, health beliefs, relationships with health professionals, as well as a variety of social and environmental factors, including financial difficulties, lack of transportation, and long periods of waiting in hospitals and clinics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p id="Par20">This study aims to describe the protocol and randomization of the clinical trial design in order to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention based on DSRQ scores.

Concluding, educational programs that are carefully designed have the potential to produce the desired results, such as low-sodium diet adherence in patients with HF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">For any health recommendation to be successful it is necessary to overcome behavioral barriers to dietary change and the influence of interindividual variation in dietary response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. However, it is not yet clear what theoretical basis is the best to select intervention methods and strategies; nevertheless, TPB is the theory most used to understand and predict health behaviors, including food-related behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. According to TPB, behavior is a function of intention to act and the perception of control over behavior, the intention being determined by three variables: attitudes related to behavior, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">People with higher perception of their capabilities usually perceive the difficulties as problems to be experienced and not as threats to be avoided; on the other hand, people who are hesitant regarding their own capacities, perceive difficult tasks as threatening, and thus, the more confident that the person is in their ability to follow a healthy and low-sodium diet, the more likely they are to follow this recommendation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec22"><title>Potential biases</title><p id="Par55">This study has some limitations. It is difficult to target a specific behavior concerning salt intake because salt can originate from several natural sources or be added to food during cooking or food processing. The instrument is self-reported, and self-reported behavior measurements can present a range of bias such as data credibility. The open-label design can introduce some potential for biases and the sample size limits the external validity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par56">Participant recruitment of this randomized clinical trial begun in November 2015.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par69">
