Eating slowly significantly lowers meal energy intake and hunger ratings. Despite this knowledge, obese individuals do not implement this behaviour. We, thus tested the hypothesis of changing eating behaviour with an intra-oral medical device leading to constant weight reduction in overweight and obesity.</p><p>Six obese patients (6 men, age 56 &#x000b1; 14, BMI 29 &#x000b1; 2 kg / m<sup>2</sup>) with increased CVRF profile were included in this prospective study. All patients had been treated for obesity during the last 10 years in a single centre and had at least 3 frustrate evidence-based diets. Patients received a novel non-invasive intra-oral medical device to slow eating time. Further advice included not to count calories, to avoid any other form of diet, to take their time with their meals, and to eat whatever they liked.</p><p>This device was used only during meals for the first 4 to 8 weeks for a total of 88 [20&#x02013;160] hours. Follow-up period was 23 [15&#x02013;38] months. During this period, patients lost 11% [5&#x02013;20%] (p&#x0003c;0.001) of their initial weight. At 12 months, all patients had lost &#x0003e;5%, and 67% (4/6) achieved a &#x0003e;10% bodyweight loss. In the course of the study, altered eating patterns were observed. There were no complications with the medical device. Of note, all patients continued to lose weight after the initial intervention period (p&#x0003c;0.001) and none of them had weight regain.</p><p>With this medical device, overweight and obese patients with a history of previously frustrating attempts to lose weight achieved a significant and sustained weight loss over two years. These results warrant the ongoing prospective randomised controlled trial to prove concept and mechanism of action.</p><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> German Clinical Trials Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/ictrp/search/en/">DRKS00011357</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>CSL received an honorary fee from Peter von Seck for analysis of the data and preparation of the manuscript for to cover expenses.

Obesity is a significant public health problem [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], resulting in a heightened risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other illnesses [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The abundance and permanent availability of high-caloric food and the habitual sedentary lifestyle on the background of evolutionary engraved and perinatally imprinted physiological response patterns are key factors for individual and global weight gain.</p><p>Consequently, rectifying this imbalance by caloric restriction and increased physical activity form the basis in the management of evidence-based interventions of obesity [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, although programs including dietary restrictions, physical activity and behaviour modification can and do lead to weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], over the long term, the majority of individuals regain the weight they have lost [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Weight stability after weight reduction programs requires profound and permanent changes in lifestyle and eating behaviour [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Not only is weight regain frustrating for the individual, weight fluctuation is also an independent predictor for disease burden [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite the prevalence of evidence-based diets and programs, losing weight and preventing weight regain in overweight and obesity remains a serious challenge. It is apparent that the effects of diet and exercise interventions alone are not sufficient to support long-term maintenance of a reduced weight [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Obesity can be regarded as a neurobiological disease with a psychological element. The mechanisms underlying flawed eating behaviour are complex. Several physiologic adaptations after voluntary weight loss favour weight regain. These involve appetite-related hormones [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], the complex neuro-hormonal system, hedonic and reward circuits, and changes in energy expenditure. [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The restraint theory provides an attempt to synthesise the behavioural, cognitive and affective components of the food intake process [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Unusual eating patterns are proposed to develop as a result of the stress associated with the demands of continual self-control [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], with food intake determined by a balance between the desire to eat and the aspiration to diet. [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. That is, cognitive processes override physiological hunger and satiety cues [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Over the long-term, the more powerful emotions may override cognitive control and result in over-eating, which is often seen in individuals after consequent dieting.</p><p>With the acceleration of obesity rates and few effective obesity treatment options, new strategies addressing changes of eating behaviour are urgently needed. Successfully maintaining weight loss requires a permanent change of behaviour.</p><p>We thus tested that hypothesis that a relatively short period of using an intraoral device to change eating behaviour in overweight and obesity could lead to a constant and long-lasting weight reduction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This was a prospective investigator-initiated, open-label therapy trial to test an innovative oral medical device designed to reduce chewing area (patent application DE102012015839A1, EP000002695588A1, US-Application no. 13/961,024). The study was conducted in a single centre in a specialist practice from July 2012 to January 2015. Recruitment of patients was from July 2012 to August 2014 Patients with clinical indication for weight reduction were prospectively recruited to test the intraoral device. Sponsor of this study were the physician and patent holder and the collaborating orthodontist. The physician conducted the study together with assisting personnel. He took no part in analysis or preparation of the manuscript. All study participants gave written informed consent. This study in accordance with the Helsinki convention and was approved by the locals Ethics Committee (FF 1/2015) Landes&#x000e4;rztekammer Hessen (Frankfurt, Germany). The study has been registered in the German Clinical Trials Register on 8.12.2016 and has been assigned the number DRKS00011357.

Exclusion criteria were participation in a weight reduction programme during the last 6 months prior to this study, weight fluctuation of &#x02265; 5% over the last year, uncontrolled eating behaviour, clinical or biochemical evidence for the presence of concomitant chronic inflammatory disease, presence of any other significant uncontrolled medical condition or any other treatment known to alter appetite or weight, obesity due to secondary disorders, inability to understand the consent form, participation in or consent to participate in another study, malignant disease, wearing dental prosthesis, less than 10 teeth /jaw with maximally mild to moderate periodontal disease, and poor oral/dental health (as confirmed by the trial dentist).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Study protocol</title><p>Patients who fulfilled the above-mentioned inclusion and exclusion criteria were sent to the orthodontist (consultant to the project) for baseline testing and preparation of dental impressions using a purpose-designed kit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174528.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The device was custom-made for each individual from the individual&#x02019;s dental impressions. When needed, the orthodontist adjusted the tool to ensure that it fit securely prior to commencement of use. Patients were advised to refrain from using the device if they felt any problems and to consult the orthodontic at their earliest convenience. On the day of device dispensation (day 1), each participant attended the practitioner for a consultation and baseline measurements. Participants were encouraged to use the device for all meals. Further advices included to strictly avoid sweetened or sugary drinks, avoid any cognitive control over their eating behaviour and to eat what they felt was best for them: in other words, to refrain from any conventional caloric-restricted diet or meal supplements, to eat when and what they liked, to take their times with their meals, savouring every bite and eating mindfully [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and to take up physical activity only if they felt like it. Patients were advised to use the device for all meals for the first 8 to 12 weeks (Phase I). They were told not to use the device thereafter (Phase II), but allowed to place the box with the device next to them when eating for remembrance.</p><fig id="pone.0174528.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0174528.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0174528.g001"/></fig><p>Participants attended follow-up appointments in the practice at weeks 2, 4, 6, 12, and at months 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30 and 36.

Additionally, the duration of the single bite in the mouth should be extended to intensify the tasting of the food. Thereby the device aims to promote mindful eating and a long-lasting change in eating behaviour.</p><p>The design of the intraoral device consists of two thermoplastic splints made of Polyethylenterephthalat-Glycol (PET-G) for the upper and lower jaw <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174528.g002">Fig 2</xref>). On top of each splint a smooth layer made of Polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) is formed, which reduces the occlusal surface in centric jaw occlusion. Additionally, a linear increase with a width of about 3mm over the upper premolars and molars further reduces the chewing area. Thus, the occlusal surface is reduced to about one fourth of its original surface. The completely smooth surface of the splint that covers the lower jaw further restricts the chewing process by inhibiting the interlocking of dental cusps. The device is inserted immediately before ingestion of food and is removed afterwards.</p><fig id="pone.0174528.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0174528.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Medical device on dental model.</title><p>(A) Splints are almost invisible on the front teeth of the upper and lower jaws.

Supine blood pressure was measured in the left arm. Venous blood samples were taken at baseline and after 3 and 6 months, as clinically indicated, to assess plasma glucose, insulin, haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. These samples were taken after an overnight fast. Concomitant medication was assessed at baseline and changes monitored throughout the study.</p><p>To exclude participants with uncontrolled eating behaviour, volunteers were screened for uncontrolled eating behaviour using the German version of the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. A questionnaire, specifically designed for this study, assessed participants&#x02019; acceptability of the intraoral device, eating rates, food choices, comfort, appetite, and meal size throughout Phase I.

Changes of eating behaviour and appetite following the meals were assessed by comparison of the individual questionnaires from day 2 with baseline. Food intake motivation after the respective test meals was assessed with the use of a paper version of the VAS, completed directly afterwards on a 100-mm line. The scales assessed: hunger (How hungry do you feel at this moment?), desire to eat (How strong is your desire to eat at this moment?), fullness (How full does your stomach feel at this moment?), and motivation to eat (How much food do you think you could eat at this moment?).

The probability is 80 percent that the study will detect a relationship between the independent and the dependent variables at a one-sided 0.05 significance level, if the true change in the dependent variables is 2.484 units per one standard deviation change in the independent variable in a test to find an association if the dependent variable is affected by the treatment. This is based on the assumption that the standard deviation of the dependent variable is 2.</p><p>Statistical significance was assumed if a null hypothesis could be rejected at p&#x02264;0.05.

Our data indicate that this weight loss is a result of a sustainable change in eating behaviour. What&#x02019;s more, the approach of this therapy strongly contrasts with contemporary weight loss strategies in that all patients were instructed to eat whatever they liked.</p><p>Treatment of obesity includes food consumption because this is the primary source of caloric intake and manipulating eating behaviour thus is a primary target. Commonly, weight loss strategies to fight individual and populations overweight and obesity include behaviour modification, pharmacotherapy, meal replacements, and more drastically, gastric bypass surgery, or gastric balloon. Despite proven short- and medium-term weight reduction of these evidence-based programs, rapid weight gain is a serious health problem [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] for the majority of patients trying to lose weight.</p><p>All patients with increased cardiovascular risk profile who were included in our study had increases in weight despite previous evidence-based strategies to reduce weight over the last years. Participants all lost weight in the first phase, when they used the device for their meals and reported to have changed both the size of their meals as well as the choice of food consumed during this first acute phase of only a few weeks. To verify this finding, an acute experiment was conducted in a subgroup of patients, where patients showed prolonged eating duration, increased awareness of food composition and feelings of satiety, although they had eaten smaller meals when eating with the device. Satisfaction and compliance with the medical device in our study was acceptable after initial discomfort and no adverse events occurred.</p><p>Thus, this device is different from other medical intra-oral devices that attempt to prevent an individual from eating but do not change eating behaviour.</p><p>There is a strict relationship between bite size and food intake [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] as well as oral health status and involuntary weight loss [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. First experiences have been made with intraoral medical devices to restrict food consumption in obesity. An oral volume restriction device modified the subjects&#x02019; bite size, but this was not associated with changes in food consumption, hunger or satiety feelings [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Overweight patients lost weight during a short follow-up period of 4 months with an oral restriction device [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], however data from long-term follow-ups are not available. Two other approaches to prevent obese patients from overeating were wiring of jaws and intermaxillary fixation. [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Both procedures achieved significant initial weight loss, but when the devices were removed weight was regained [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Another group studied a tongue patch for impeding swallowing combined with a low-calorie diet. Within the very small number of patients available for follow-up, 84% of patients maintained their initial weight loss during 3 months to 4 years [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] with high drop-out rates.</p><p>The change of eating behaviour translated into sustained weight loss in the consecutive months in the second phase during long-term follow-up, where the patients continuously lost weight without using the device. During long-term follow-up, all of the patients in our study significantly lost weight in a range defined as effective program [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Complex neurophysiological changes during cognitive control and unusual eating patterns of individuals have been identified as strong inducers of weight regain. Our approach to help overweight and obese patients to lose weight thus used this knowledge to change their behaviour and allow them to eat what they pleased. Our patients were not simply forced to eat slowly, but given the opportunity to savour [<xref rid="pone.0174528.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and indulge each and every bite. Thus, the two competing goals&#x02014;namely, the aspiration to diet induced by cognitively inhibiting chronic self-control and the desire to eat with pleasure seem reconcilable by the use of this simple medical device.</p><p>This study has several limitations, such as the small number of 6 patients, the retrospective design of long-term follow-up with limited phenotypic data at inclusion and the long recruitment period as well as the lack of a control arm. We cannot exclude the possibility that patients have been included in this study who previously failed to reduce weight because of cravings caused by the sensory deprivation of monotonous diets.</p><p>Thus, a more powerful study is now conducted with a large number of patients in a prospective, randomised, controlled multicentre trial. This is to prove the concept and the underlying mechanism. Since the majority of patients will regain weight after conventional dieting, our approach may prove a serious alternative treatment for obesity in obese and overweight patients for whom evidence-based options have failed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174528.s001"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>TREND statement.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174528.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174528.s002"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>English translation of the German Study protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174528.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174528.s003"><label>S3 File</label><caption><title>Approval of the local ethics committee.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174528.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0174528.s004"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>German Study protocol.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0174528.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Kerstin Amelung-Knurr, Rainer H Maurus and Renate Litsch for expert technical assistance.</p><p>Information has previously been presented on the following international meetings: 31<sup>st</sup> meeting of the German Obesity Association (DAG) 2015</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0174528.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Organization WH. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.Who.Int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/">http://www.Who.Int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/</ext-link>. 2014.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0174528.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Finkelstein</surname><given-names>EA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Khavjou</surname><given-names>OA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Trogdon</surname><given-names>JG</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Pan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Sherry</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
