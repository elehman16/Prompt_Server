            <p><italic>Objective:</italic> Ampicillin plus sulbactam, an irreversible 
            &#x003b2;-lactamase inhibitor, was compared to cefoxitin
          in the treatment of women with acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) with and without
        inflammatory mass(es).</p>
    <p><italic>Methods:</italic> Participation in an open, prospective, randomized clinical trial was 
    offered to all women given the clinical diagnosis of acute PID who required inpatient therapy. 
    <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> were sought in cervical and endometrial 
    samples and aerobic and anaerobic species were sought in endometrial samples prior to 
    treatment initiation. Treatment was given on at least 4 days and until women were afebrile for at 
    least 48 h. Daily examinations were performed to assess response to therapy and safety. Only 
    women in whom <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> was identified were discharged from the hospital on oral 
    doxycycline to be taken for 10&#x02013;14 days.</p>
    <p><italic>Results:</italic> One hundred twenty-four women were evaluated for safety; 
       117 (94%) were evaluated for efficacy. Demographic characteristics were similar for women in 
       each treatment group. <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> was recovered from 59% and <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> was 
       recovered from 42% of study subjects. Inflammatory masses were identified in 35/76 (46%) 
       women given ampicillin/sulbactam and 17/41 (41%) women given cefoxitin. Ampicillin/sulbactam 
       cured 75 ,of 76 women (98.7%) [95% confidence interval (CI) 92.9&#x02013;100.0%] and cefoxitin cured 37 
       of,41,omen (90.2%) (95% CI 76.9&#x02013;97.3%) in that treatment regimen.</p>
       <p><italic>Conclusions:</italic> Overall ampicillin/sulbactam was more effective (<italic>P</italic> = 0.05) than 
       cefoxitin, due to superior efficacy in infection complicated by inflammatory mass(es).35/35 vs. 
       12/17 cured; <italic>P</italic> =  0.007).</p>
