Breast pain during breastfeeding is a common problem that interferes with successful breastfeeding leading to exclusive abandonment of breastfeeding.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT1">1</xref>) Over the years, numerous strategies for the treatment of this problem have been employed such as kangaroo care, fluid limitation, binding the breasts or wearing a tight brassiere, hot and cold compresses, and application of cabbage leaves. Very few researches have been conducted tomonitor the effect of cabbage leaves on breast engorgement with inconclusive and conflicting results. A study on the efficacy of cabbage leaves can contribute to provide evidence for introducing this intervention in clinical practice; thus, we conducted the present study.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>We carried out a quasi-experimental study, using a time series, nonequivalent control group design, with multiple institutions of treatment in the postnatal ward at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi; we conducted the study in 60 subjects between May 2006 and December 2006.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Postnatal mothers with breast engorgement</p></list-item><list-item><p>Willingness to participate in the study</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Mothers with allergy to sulfa drugs and cabbage</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mothers with soft breasts; mothers receiving lactation suppressants</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mothers with infection in the breasts, breast abscess, mastitis, broken skin of breasts, bleeding or cracked nipples</p></list-item></list><p>The subjects were enrolled based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and informed consent was then obtained from them. The identification data and obstetric characteristics of each subject were recorded in a validated subject data sheet. The study was conducted in two phases. In the first phase, first 30 mothers in the control group were administered alternate hot and cold compresses. Alternate warm moist sponge cloths and cold compresses were applied to the engorged breasts; the cloths were replaced frequently after 1&#x02013;2 min. This process was continued for 20 min. The temperature of water for hot compress ranged between 43&#x000b0;C and 46&#x000b0;C, and that for cold compress ranged between 10&#x000b0;C and 18&#x000b0;C as assessed by alotion thermometer. After the completion of the first phase, the next 30 mothers in the experimental group were administered cold cabbage leaf treatment for relieving breast engorgement. Cabbage leaves were refrigerated in the freezer for approximately 20&#x02013;30 min prior to the procedure. Cold cabbage leaves were placed inside the women's brassiere for 30 min. Both the treatments were performed three times a day for two continuous days. This method was applied six times on each subject. The duration of each intervention was 30 min. The pre- and posttreatment scores of breast engorgement and pain were recorded after each treatment session. Breast engorgement was measured using a six-point breast engorgement scale,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>) and the pain score was assessed using a numerical rating pain scale. The data obtained was processed in MS Excel sheet. The statistical analysis was performed using the software STRATA.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The two groups were homogeneous with regard to alldemographic and obstetric variables as analyzed by chi-square and Fisher's exact test except for breastfeeding for which adjusted analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEE) was performed. By using the student,s <italic>t</italic> test, no difference was noted between the groups with regard to the pretreatment scores of breast engorgement and pain. GEE was used to compare the correlated responses for the posttreatment scores for both the outcome variables between the two groups and to compare the pre- and posttreatment scores within the groups. Both the treatments, i.e., hot and cold compress and cabbage leaves, were effective in decreasing breast engorgement and pain in postnatal mothers (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.001) as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>.
