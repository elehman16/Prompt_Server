The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) practice guidelines, the European Head and Neck Society&#x02014;European Society for Medical Oncology&#x02014;European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (EHNS-ESMO-ESTRO) clinical practice guidelines, and the Japanese practice guidelines in head and neck cancer (version 2013) recommend that high-risk patients with oral cancer, oropharyngeal cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, or laryngeal cancer should receive postoperative chemoradiotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, neck recurrence and distant metastasis can occur after postoperative chemoradiotherapy, and outcomes remain unsatisfactory. A meta-analysis did not provide convincing evidence of any benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Given the current situation, it would be meaningful to have an effective oral preparation that could be used for adjuvant chemotherapy on an outpatient basis.</p><p>Tegafur/uracil (UFT, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and S-1 (TS-1, Taiho Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) are oral agents that are effective against SCCHN. UFT combines tegafur with uracil in a molar ratio of 1:4. Tegafur, an anticancer prodrug, is metabolized to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Then, 5-FU is rapidly degraded by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in blood. Uracil inhibits DPD and thereby maintains high concentrations of 5-FU [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. S-1 is a fluoropyrimidine preparation that combines tegafur with gimeracil and oteracil potassium in a molar ratio of 1:0.4:1. Gimeracil in S-1 is a DPD inhibitor that is 180 times more potent than uracil in UFT, allowing high concentrations of 5-FU to be maintained [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Oteracil inhibits the phosphorylation of 5-FU in the gastrointestinal mucosa, thereby reducing gastrointestinal toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Two phase II studies of S-1 performed in Japan in patients with advanced or recurrent head and neck cancer (or both) respectively obtained response rates of 46.2% and 28.8% with acceptable toxicity [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>A phase III study of S-1 in postoperative patients with gastric cancer (Adjuvant Chemotherapy Trial of TS-1 for Gastric Cancer [ACTS-GC]) showed that S-1 improves overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), as compared with surgery alone [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Furthermore, in pancreatic cancer, S-1 was superior to standard therapy with gemcitabine in terms of OS in an adjuvant setting [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>As for UFT, phase III clinical study has been performed in patients with SCCHN. After curative surgery, patients were assigned to a control group, which received surgery alone, or to a UFT group to assess treatment effectiveness. Although there was no difference between the groups in OS or disease-free survival (DFS), the distant metastasis control rate was significantly higher in the UFT group [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>The present ACTS-HNC (Adjuvant Chemotherapy with S-1 after Curative Treatment in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer) study was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of S-1 as compared with UFT as control treatment in patients with SCCHN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0116965.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0116965.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Study Design</title><p>The ACTS-HNC study was a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, 2-arm, parallel-group phase III study.

DFS, RFS, and OS curves were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The treatment groups were compared with log-rank tests stratified according to the stratification factors, except for institution. To assess treatment efficacy, a Cox proportional-hazards model was used to estimate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to evaluate differences in the incidences of grade 3 or grade 4 adverse events.

A meta-analysis by Pignon et al. did not provide convincing evidence of any benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Induction chemotherapy followed by radical therapy is expected for improvement of OS. However, no phase III trials have showed OS advantage of induction chemotherapy [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To our knowledge, the present study is the first phase III trial to demonstrate that adjuvant chemotherapy improved OS in patients who received curative treatment for stage III, IVA, or IVB SCCHN, as compared with a control group.</p><p>At time of planning this study, there was no standard treatment for SCCHN after curative therapy. Placebo was initially considered the best control treatment for a phase III trial of S-1. As mentioned in the Introduction section, however, the rate of distant metastasis was significantly lower in the UFT group (7.9%) than in the control group (14.6%, P = 0.034) in a previous multicenter study performed in Japan [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. UFT was therefore been used for adjuvant therapy in many hospitals in Japan. Moreover, continuation of UFT treatment was requested by investigators from many hospitals when we designed the protocol and we realized that UFT was community-based standard therapy in Japan. UFT was therefore designated as control treatment for Japanese ethical reasons.</p><p>Although the DFS curve was consistently higher in the S-1 group than in the UFT group in our study, the primary end point of significantly better DFS in the S-1 group was not met. On the other hand, S-1 significantly improved OS as compared with UFT. One reason for the difference in OS may be that the incidence of distant recurrence was lower in the S-1 group (HR for distant metastasis, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.42 to 1.20]) than in the UFT group, most likely contributing to better survival in the S-1 group (<xref rid="pone.0116965.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). Local and cervical lymph-node recurrence can sometimes be secondarily treated curatively by salvage therapy. However, secondary curative treatment of lesions in patients with distant metastasis remains difficult. Patients with distant metastasis have been reported to have poorer outcomes than those with local recurrence [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Therefore, prevention of distant recurrence is very important. After the study treatment was discontinued, 85 patients (33.5%) in the UFT group and 88 patients (35.1%) in the S-1 group received subsequent therapy, with no difference between the groups. Although it is difficult to explain why OS, but not DFS or RFS, was significantly better in S-1 group, adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 appears to beneficially affect survival. Because assessments were presumed to be conducted during the same intervals in each arm, we believe that the impact of assessment interval on the results for DFS was minimal. However, a potential negative impact on DFS of using a predefined assessment interval of every 3 to 6 months, rather than every 6 months, cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The treatment completion rate in our study was 58.3% in the UFT group and 43.4% in the S-1 group. The rates of the following grade 3 or higher adverse events were significantly higher in the S-1 group: leukopenia (5.2%), neutropenia (3.6%), thrombocytopenia (2.0%), and mucositis/stomatitis (2.4%). Although the incidences of these adverse events were not high, S-1 was withdrawn at the discretion of the attending physician in 52 patients, suggesting that grade 2 or lower nonhematologic toxicity might have influenced the continuation of treatment. In a phase III study (ACTS-GC) in patients with gastric cancer, the rate of completing 12 months of treatment with S-1 was 65.8%, which was higher than the rate in our study. In addition, S-1 improved OS and RFS, as compared with surgery alone [<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Our results suggest that the low-grade adverse events might have negatively affected compliance in patients with SCCHN, possibly leading to the relatively low treatment completion rate in this study.</p><p>Among factors potentially affecting survival in head and neck cancer, the presence of human papilloma virus (HPV) infection is known to be a determinant of outcomes in patients with oropharyngeal cancer[<xref rid="pone.0116965.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Because this fact was not known at the time of planning our study in 2006, we unfortunately did not confirm the status of HPV infection in our subjects. However, because the primary tumor site was used as a stratification factor in our study, the proportions of patients with oropharyngeal cancer were similar in the treatment groups.</p><p>The main finding of our study was that single-agent chemotherapy with S-1, administered on an outpatient basis, improved OS after curative therapy as compared with the control group. Our results suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 is one of the treatment options after curative therapy for locally advanced SCCHN. We anticipate that further evidence from controlled clinical studies will establish adjuvant chemotherapy after curative treatment as a new treatment strategy for patients with SCCHN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s001"><caption><title>S1 CONSORT Checklist</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s002"><caption><title>S1 Protocol</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s003"><label>S1 List</label><caption><title>List of IRB or IEC.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Criteria for temporary treatment withdrawal.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s005"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Criteria for treatment resumption.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s006"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Criteria for dose reduction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s006.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s007"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>Levels for UFT dose reduction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s007.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116965.s008"><label>S5 Table</label><caption><title>Levels for S-1 dose reduction.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116965.s008.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The results of this study were presented in part at the ASCO Annual 2013 Meeting, Chicago, Illinois, May 31-June 4, 2013.</p><p>We are indebted to the late Professor Mamoru Tsukuda, who played a pivotal role in this study and deserves special thanks for his great contribution.
