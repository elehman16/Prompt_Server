On Day 5, 120 lactating Holstein cows were
randomly assigned to a control group (n = 63) or GnRH group treated with 100 &#x003bc;g of GnRH agonist (n = 57). On Days 3, 5, 7, and 14, each cow underwent ultrasound examination to measure the blood flow area (BFA) and time-averaged
maximum velocity (TAMV) at the spiral arteries at the base of the corpus luteum using color Doppler ultrasonography. Cows with a corpus luteum diameter &#x02265; 20 mm (n = 120) received embryo transfers on Day 7. The BFA values in the
GnRH group were significantly higher than those in the control group on Days 7 and 14. TAMV did not differ between these groups. According to receiver operating characteristic analyses to predict pregnancy, a BFA cutoff of 0.52
cm<sup>2</sup> yielded the highest sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (90.5%) on Day 7, and BFA and TAMV values of 0.94 cm<sup>2</sup> and 44.93 cm/s, respectively, yielded the highest sensitivity (97.1%) and specificity (100%)
on Day 14 in the GnRH group. The areas under the curve for the paired BFA and TAMV in the GnRH group were 0.058 higher than those in the control group (0.996 and 0.938, respectively; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In conclusion,
GnRH treatment on Day 5 increased the luteal BFA in recipient cows on Days 7 and 14, and improved the accuracy of pregnancy prediction on Day 14.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Blood flow area</kwd><kwd>Color Doppler ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>Corpus luteum</kwd><kwd>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone</kwd><kwd>Time-averaged maximum velocity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Pregnancy diagnosis is an invaluable tool for reproduction management in dairy cows [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Estrus is a well-defined period that occurs once every 18&#x02013;24 days in non-pregnant cows. In general,
pregnancy diagnosis is conducted in cows &#x02265; 35 days after artificial insemination (AI) based on the membrane slip technique by transrectal palpation [<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Since the 2000s, the development of
portable ultrasonographic machines has enabled identification of successfully pregnant cows by scanning the uterus and ovaries to visualize the embryonic vesicle and corpus luteum (CL) as early as 26&#x02013;28 days post-AI [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>In Holstein cows, the milk production per cow has increased steadily due to a combination of improved management, better nutrition, and intense genetic selection in the last decade [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However,
high production causes a longer interval from parturition to first visual estrus [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], weak signs of estrus [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and a decrease in the duration of estrus
[<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, estrus detection has become more complicated in the Holstein cows. Early pregnancy diagnosis increases reproductive efficiency, especially identifying non-pregnant cows before they
return to estrus, thereby enabling careful observations of estrus behavior, detecting estrus, and rebreeding at the subsequent estrus. However, reliable and practical methods have not yet been developed for diagnosis before the estrus
cycle.</p><p>In addition to the morphological observations of tissues and organs obtained by brightness (B)-mode ultrasonography, color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) has provided new information regarding blood flow, and it has been applied in
horses and cattle since the 1990s [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The mammalian CL necessary for conception has one of the highest blood flow rates of any tissue or organ [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The blood vascular bed of the developing bovine CL is supplied by a spiral artery that branches directly from the ovarian artery [<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. After ovulation,
blood vessels from the theca interna invade the cavity of the relevant follicle and form a network that supplies the luteal cells. This neovascularization is necessary for the delivery of luteal steroids to the general circulation and
for providing the circulating substrate, which is used by the luteal cells for progesterone (P<sub>4</sub>) biosynthesis [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous studies indicated that the blood flow area (BFA) and/or
blood flow velocity in a CL are closely associated with the plasma P<sub>4</sub> concentrations throughout the estrous cycle, thus advancing CDUS a powerful tool for evaluating the CL function [<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, recent studies have employed CDUS in practical applications for pregnancy diagnosis [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, the BFA of the CL measured by CDUS during early pregnancy is higher in pregnant than non-pregnant
dairy cows at Days 19&#x02013;21 post-insemination [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In addition,
evaluating the luteal blood flow provides a quick, reliable, and consistent test, especially for early detection in non-pregnant cows at Days 20&#x02013;21 after AI [<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, some studies have suggested that evaluating the luteal BFA alone is not sufficient for early pregnancy diagnosis because of its low specificity and sensitivity [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In our previous study, we successfully selected recipient cows with a high probability of conception on Day 7 and early pregnancy prediction on Day 14 using the luteal BFA and time-averaged
maximum velocity (TAMV) of the spiral artery [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. We found that the luteal BFA was significantly higher in pregnant cows than non-pregnant cows on Days 7 and 14, and the TAMV of the spiral
artery was also significantly higher in pregnant cows than non-pregnant cows [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Moreover, we found that BFA was an appropriate pregnancy predictor on Day 7, and the paired BFA and TAMV were
reliable for pregnancy prediction on Day 14 in recipient cows [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), a neuropeptide released from the hypothalamus, has a central role in the reproductive function in mammals [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Endogenous GnRH triggers the release and
synthesis of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The secretions of FSH and LH increase acutely after the administration of a GnRH agonist in the same manner as
the effect of endogenous GnRH [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Many angiogenic factors produced by the CL, such as vascular endothelial
growth factor A (VEGFA) and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), regulate angiogenesis in the developing CL [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In addition, FSH and LH are involved in the regulation of angiogenic factors,
and thus in vascular development in the human CL [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Therefore, it is highly likely that the administration of a GnRH agonist will increase the
vascularity of the CL and affect the accuracy of pregnancy prediction based on luteal BFA and TAMV. However, the effects of GnRH treatment on luteal vascularity have not been analyzed previously.</p><p>The current study assessed the effects of GnRH treatment on Day 5 on the luteal blood flow and the accuracy of pregnancy prediction in recipient cows. In particular, we addressed the following questions: 1) whether the changes in the
CL morphology and luteal blood flow differed in control and GnRH treatment groups; and 2) whether the accuracy of pregnancy prediction was increased by GnRH treatment.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and herd management</title><p>The current study was conducted using a commercial Holstein Friesian dairy herd in the Miyagi Prefecture, Japan, with a mean number of 60 lactating cows from December 2013 to January 2016.

checked after calving based on visual observations (mounting and standing behavior) and transrectal palpation. The cows had normal estrous cycles and were &#x02265; 50 days postpartum (137.58 &#x000b1; 7.17 days). Body condition scores (BCS) were

In addition, Murakami
<italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] suggested that the pregnancy rate in recipients with a CL diameter &#x02265; 20 mm was higher than that in recipients with smaller CL diameters. Therefore, 120 cows
with CL diameters &#x02265; 20 mm on Day 7 were subjected to transcervical ET by the same investigator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). ET was conducted on Day 7 after ultrasound examination and blood sampling for the
plasma P<sub>4</sub> assay, as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>. Fresh embryos (n = 48) or embryos thawed from a frozen state (frozen-thawed; n = 72), recovered from superovulated Japanese Black cows,
were transferred into the uterine horn ipsilateral to the CL-bearing ovary using a flexible transfer catheter (Mo-No.4, Misawa Medical Industry, Kasama, Japan). All embryos used in the present study were quality grade 1 and
developmental stage 4 according to the International Embryo Transfer Society (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iets.org/">http://www.iets.org/</ext-link>) classifications.</p></sec><sec><title>Ultrasound examination using CDUS</title><p>Transrectal ultrasound scanning using CDUS was performed on each cow before blood sampling on Days 3, 5, 7, and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). On Day 5, the GnRH group was scanned before GnRH treatment
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). The morphologies of the original CL and largest follicle (LF) were evaluated using a B-mode portable ultrasound machine equipped with a 7.5-MHz linear array transducer (MyLab
five; Esaote SpA). The areas of the CL and LF were measured at the maximum diameter. In addition, the morphology of an accessory CL was evaluated in the GnRH group on Day 14. The BFAs of the original and accessory CL were
evaluated using the color-flow Doppler mapping mode at the maximum diameter. The ultrasound imaging settings (B-mode frequency: 7.5 MHz; total gain: 70%; color-flow Doppler mapping frequency: 6.6 MHz; pulse repetition frequency:
1.4 KHz) were standardized and remained constant in all examinations. The original and accessory CLs, luteal cavity, CL tissue, LF areas, and BFA were calculated according to the method described by Kanazawa <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Blood velocity of the spiral artery was measured at the CL base where spiral artery enters the CL. To identify the spiral artery, pulse Doppler probe was oriented according
to the longitudinal axis of the ovary (from the mesovarian to proper ligament poles). Subsequently, the probe was set to visualize the spiral artery at the CL base. Since the spiral artery spins, the blood flow images at the CL
base were relatively easily captured. Blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained and recorded during three cardiac cycles to determine TAMV by placing the Doppler sample volume over the maximum color intensity of the spiral
artery at the base of the CL and switching on the pulsed Doppler mode. Generally, no correction is made for the interrogation angle because the interrogation angle for small vessels cannot be determined [<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the current study, the operator confirmed the interrogation angle of the spiral artery and sought the Doppler signals with the highest achievable amplitude as reported in the previous studies [<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Therefore, TAMV could be measured at an appropriate interrogation angle (ranging from 20 to 60 degrees) in
the current study. In addition, we measured TAMV three times and used the average of those as TAMV values. Furthermore, the LF location on Day 7 in the control group and the accessory CL location on Day 14 in the ovary relative to
the original CL (ipsilateral or contralateral) were observed. Pregnancy diagnoses were performed on Day 30 using a portable ultrasound system equipped with a 7.5-MHz rectal transducer (Tringa V linear; Esaote SpA, Genoa, Italy) to
measure the fetal heartbeat.</p></sec><sec><title>Collection of blood sample and plasma P<sub>4</sub> assay</title><p>Blood samples were collected by coccygeal venipuncture into a vacutainer tube containing sodium heparin (TERUMO, Tokyo, Japan) during each ultrasound examination (Days 3, 5, 7, and 14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.

critical points: (1) using only Holstein Friesian dairy cows; (2) selection on Day 7 based on the CL diameter (&#x02265; 20 mm); and (3) using the paired BFA and TAMV measured by CDUS instead of BFA alone. To refine this new technique for
pregnancy prediction and diagnosis further, we attempted to use GnRH, which might increase the blood flow (BFA and TAMV) indirectly, in recipient Holstein cows.</p><p>We evaluated the effects of the GnRH treatment (Day 5) on the morphology and blood flow in the original CL as well as the plasma P<sub>4</sub> concentration, where we particularly focused on the luteal BFA and TAMV before (Days 3,

However, the GnRH treatment did not cause any changes in the TAMV when we compared the GnRH and control groups throughout the
experimental period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, the TAMV values of the GnRH and control pregnant groups were comparable on Days 7 and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_006">Fig. 6</xref>). These
results indicate that the GnRH treatment mainly increases the luteal BFA in pregnant cows and that the changes in BFA were not synchronized completely with those in TAMV. We suggest that TAMV did not increase markedly because
dilation of the spiral artery also occurs as the blood supply to the CL increases.</p><p>We have previously reported that BFA was an appropriate pregnancy predictor on Day 7, where a BFA cutoff value &#x02265; 0.43 cm<sup>2</sup> yielded the best sensitivity (79.4%) and specificity (75.0%) [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The ROC curve, which is defined as a plot of the test sensitivity as the y coordinate <italic>versus</italic> its 1-specificity or false positive rate as the x coordinate, is used widely and it is an effective method
for evaluating the performance of diagnostic tests [<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Therefore, we performed ROC analyses to determine the cutoff value and found that BFA was also the most appropriate predictor on Day 7
in the GnRH group (<xref rid="pdf_001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3B</xref>). A BFA cutoff value &#x02265; 0.52 cm<sup>2</sup> yielded the best sensitivity and specificity among all the cutoff values for any data
obtained on Day 7 in the GnRH group (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>), thereby indicating that GnRH treatment increased the accuracy of pregnancy prediction (sensitivity = 3.9% and specificity = 15.5%) on Day 7
compared with our previous study [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, when we evaluated the difference between the two ROC curves obtained from the control and GnRH groups using the unpaired DeLong&#x02019;s test [<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], no differences were observed in the AUC for BFA between the GnRH and control groups (<xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Based on
these results, we suggest that the GnRH agonist treatment on Day 5 does not significantly improve the accuracy of pregnancy prediction using the luteal BFA as an indicator on Day 7.</p><p>Our previous study showed that the paired BFA and TAMV were the most appropriate predictors on Day 14, and the best cutoff value at a pregnancy probability of 60.0% (obtained by substituting the data for a pregnant sample with BFA
= 0.63 cm<sup>2</sup> and TAMV = 50.6 cm/sec in the regression equation) yielded a better tradeoff of sensitivity (85.3%) and specificity (91.7%), thereby indicating that the paired BFA and TAMV was reliable for pregnancy prediction
on Day14 [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. According to the ROC analyses, we found that the paired BFA and TAMV was also the most appropriate predictor on Day 14 in the GnRH group (<xref rid="pdf_001" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 3D</xref>). The best cutoff value at a pregnancy probability of 58.3% (obtained by substituting the data for a pregnant sample with BFA = 0.94 cm<sup>2</sup> and TAMV = 44.93
cm/sec in the regression equation) yielded a better tradeoff of sensitivity and specificity (<xref rid="tbl_004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>), thereby indicating that the GnRH agonist treatment increased the pregnancy prediction
accuracy (sensitivity = 11.8% and specificity = 8.3%) on Day 14 compared with the results obtained in our previous study [<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, the AUC values for the BFA and TAMV in the GnRH group
were significantly higher than those in the control group (<xref rid="tbl_005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). These results indicate that the GnRH treatment on Day 5 significantly improved the accuracy of pregnancy prediction on
Day 14. This improvement in the pregnancy prediction was obviously caused by the increased differences in the BFA values for the GnRH non-pregnant and GnRH pregnant groups on Day 14, because the GnRH treatment on Day 5 specifically
increased BFA in the GnRH pregnant group, but not in the GnRH non-pregnant group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_005">Fig. 5</xref>).</p><p>GnRH triggers the release and synthesis of LH and FSH [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Several distinct cell types are distributed in the bovine CL, such as small and large luteal cells, vascular endothelial cells, and
pericytes [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. More than 50% of the cells in the mature CL comprise vascular endothelial cells and adequate angiogenesis is essential for normal luteal development [<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The CL produces many angiogenic factors such as VEGFA and FGF2, which are the major factors that regulate angiogenesis in the developing CL [<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. FSH and LH are involved
in the regulation of angiogenic factors, and thus in human CL vascular development [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. F&#x000e1;tima <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] indicated that FSH increases the protein expression levels of VEGFA, FGF2, and their receptors in bovine luteal and granulosa cells. Thus, the increased BFA in the GnRH group on Days 7 and 14 may have been
caused by elevated FSH or LH levels promoting vascular development after GnRH treatment. Beindorff <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reported that the luteal BFA increased at 1 h after the
administration of human chorionic gonadotropin in non-lactating and non-bred cows on Day 7 (Day 1 = ovulation), but they subsequently returned to the baseline levels. Human chorionic gonadotropin acts in a similar manner to LH by
binding LH receptors on small luteal cells in sheep [<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the administration of the GnRH agonist acutely increases FSH as well as LH, which are involved in the regulation of angiogenic
factors. Therefore, different changes in the luteal BFA were thought to be observed in the current study. Interestingly, on Day 5, the luteal BFA in the pregnant cows was already higher than that in the non-pregnant cows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This result indicates that the CL of the cows that will be pregnant has high blood flow compared with the non-pregnant cows before GnRH treatment. For the above-mentioned reasons,
after GnRH treatment, it is predicted that the amounts of LH and FSH that reach the luteal cells in the CL with high vascularity are higher than in the CL with low vascularity; consequently, the luteal BFA increase of the pregnant
cows occurs.</p><p>The LF area was lower in the GnRH group than the control group on Days 7 and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2F</xref>). In addition, the incidence of an accessory CL on Day 14 was 96.5% in the GnRH group. This result
agrees with that obtained in a previous study where the induction rate of an accessory CL was 93% [<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. After administration of the GnRH agonist, the LH concentration increased acutely (LH
surge), which was followed by ovulation 26&#x02013;34 h later [<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. GnRH treatment on Day 5 or Day 6 caused ovulation of the first-wave DF with a diameter &#x02265; 10 mm in response to LH, with the formation
of an accessory CL [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Thus, the decrease in the LF area may
have been caused by ovulation of the first-wave DF due to an LH surge after GnRH treatment.</p><p>In the current study, we observed no increases in the plasma P<sub>4</sub> concentrations and pregnancy rates due to the GnRH treatment (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig.
2C</xref>). The results of GnRH effects on the P<sub>4</sub> concentrations and pregnancy rates using cows that were inseminated or received ET are inconsistent [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>,<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Some studies have clearly shown that the plasma P<sub>4</sub> concentrations increased between Days 11 and 16 (Day 0 = estrus) in Holstein heifers and cows administered GnRH on Day 5 [<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In contrast, Sterry <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] showed that GnRH treatment on Day 5 (Day 0
= AI) did not affect the plasma P<sub>4</sub> concentrations from Day 5 to Day 19. In addition, Nishigai <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] also failed to observe an effect on the blood P<sub>4</sub>
concentration when the recipient cows were treated with GnRH on Day 6 (Day 0 = estrus), and suggested that the blood P<sub>4</sub> concentration was not affected by the accessory CL because the original CL secreted abundant
P<sub>4</sub>. On the other hand, some reports indicated a positive effect on pregnancy rate with elevating plasma P<sub>4</sub> concentrations [<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="r52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In contrast, Ellington <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] reported no significant improvement in the pregnancy rate of GnRH treatment compared with untreated controls. Further
investigations of the relationship between GnRH and its reactivity with plasma P<sub>4</sub> for pregnancy are needed in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated that GnRH treatment on Day 5 increased the luteal BFA on Days 7 and 14, and improved the accuracy of pregnancy prediction in recipient cows on Day 14. Portable color Doppler machines have recently
increased in popularity. Therefore, evaluating the luteal blood flow after GnRH agonist treatment may be useful for early pregnancy diagnosis after ET under field conditions. However, the BFA values may vary depending on the
sensitivity and settings of the ultrasound machine. Therefore, the BFA values reported in the current study might not be comparable to those obtained using other ultrasound machines. Further studies are required to investigate the
correlations between luteal blood flow, angiogenic factors such as VEGFA and FGF2, and gonadotropins (FSH and LH) after GnRH agonist treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pdf_001"><caption><title>Supplementary Files</title></caption><media xlink:href="jrd-63-389-s001.pdf" mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1408" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported in part by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries (grant number REP-1003).
