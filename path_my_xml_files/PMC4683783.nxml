This led to the establishment of Childsmile, a national programme designed to improve the oral health of children in Scotland. One element of the programme promotes daily tooth brushing in all nurseries in Scotland (Childsmile Core). A second targeted component (Childsmile Nursery) offers twice-yearly application of fluoride varnish to children attending nurseries in deprived areas. Studies suggest that fluoride varnish application can reduce caries in both adult and child populations. This trial aims to explore the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of additional preventive value fluoride varnish application compared to Childsmile Core.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Protecting Teeth@3 Study is an ongoing 2&#x000a0;year parallel group randomised treatment as usual controlled trial. Three-year-old children attending the ante pre-school year are randomised (1:1) to the intervention arm (fluoride varnish &#x00026; treatment as usual) or the control arm (treatment as usual). Children in the intervention arm will have Duraphat&#x000ae; fluoride varnish painted on the primary tooth surfaces and will continue to receive treatment as usual: the core Childsmile Nursery intervention. Children in the treatment as usual arm will receive the same series of contacts, without the application of varnish and will also continue with the Childsmile Core intervention. Interventions are undertaken by Childsmile trained extended duty dental nurses at six-monthly intervals. Participants receive a baseline dental inspection in nursery and an endpoint inspection in Primary 1 at the age of 5 years old.</p><p>We will use primary and secondary outcome measures to compare the effectiveness of Duraphat&#x000ae; fluoride varnish plus treatment as usual with treatment as usual only in preventing any further dental decay. We will also undertake a full economic evaluation of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.

Amendment number 4, Protocol version V2.3, 31st July 2015. Duraphat has been considered to be an Investigational Medicinal Product for the purposes of this trial. The notification from the MHRA is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; the study has been given the EUDRACT number 2012-002287-26. All investigators and key trial personnel will complete biennial Good Clinical Practice training.</p><p>In 2005 the Scottish Government set out its policy on addressing the poor oral health of Scottish children. A series of reports had highlighted persistently high rates of dental caries with significant inequalities in oral health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], low rates of NHS dental registration for young children (35&#x000a0;% of 0&#x02013;2 year-olds in 2004) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and extremely limited preventive activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The 2005 Scottish Government Report &#x0201c;An Action Plan for Improving Oral Health and Modernising Dental Services in Scotland&#x0201d; announced what was to become the Childsmile oral health improvement programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The aim was to shift the balance of care towards more preventive and anticipatory care and target the early years in an attempt to promote health improvement from a young age. Programme development was founded on the principles outlined in the Ottawa Charter for Health Promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Two Childsmile Demonstration Programmes were subsequently established in 2006, one in the East and one in the West of Scotland, with a targeted approach to improving the oral health of young children. Both were to run initially for 3 years, in order to allow the Programmes to evolve as a result of ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and stakeholder feedback. The Programmes complemented a national toothpaste/toothbrushing scheme set up a few years previously, whereby free toothpaste/toothbrush packs are distributed to every child in Scotland on at least six occasions during their first 5 years and free daily toothbrushing offered to every 3 and 4 years old child attending nursery schools in Scotland. The toothbrushing programme is also available to primary one and two children in schools situated in disadvantaged areas of National Health Service (NHS) Boards across the country. This programme, which became Childsmile Core, built on pre-existing local NHS Board-based toothbrushing initiatives, and enabled standardisation across the country with national procurement of the toothbrushing supplies and the publication and implementation of national standards for toothbrushing programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In nursery schools - the setting for the present study - Childsmile Core promotes daily tooth brushing, backed up with free dental packs containing fluoride toothpaste (circa 1000&#x000a0;ppm&#x000a0;F), toothbrushes and advice leaflets, fruit and freely available water. Children in nurseries in deprived areas are also offered twice-yearly application of fluoride varnish from the time they start nursery under the Childsmile Nursery programme. In the period December 2006 to July 2011 168,000 Duraphat applications were completed under this programme, with no reported significant adverse events.</p><p>However, it is important to ascertain the additional preventive value fluoride varnish application in nursery schools may bestow over and above that gained from the Childsmile Core activities described above. There is some evidence from quasi-experimental data at the population level that the Childsmile Core intervention on its own has indeed improved the oral health of children in the Greater Glasgow area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The study will establish whether fluoride varnish will deliver benefits which are additional to those of the Childsmile Core Programme.</p><p>A systematic Cochrane Review of fluoride varnish application (Marinho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] concluded that this treatment reduced worsening of caries (known as a 'prevention fraction') in the primary dentition by 33&#x000a0;%, as measured by the 'd<sub>3</sub>mfs' score for deciduous teeth (number of decayed (at the dentine level), missing and filled surfaces). At the 'd<sub>3</sub>mft' level (decayed missing and filled teeth), the amount of prevented disease was possibly larger with an estimate of 53&#x000a0;%. Most of the studies included in the review were from populations with regular use of fluoride treatments, especially toothpaste.</p><p>On the one hand it is known that many deprived children in Scotland have not been using fluoride toothpaste in the past, but on the other hand the Childsmile programme should be addressing this problem. Perhaps a 33&#x02013;53&#x000a0;% reduction in worsening of dmfs/dmft is a reasonable estimate of how much fluoride varnishes could achieve in a deprived population in the West of Scotland. However, the Cochrane review was only based upon nine trials, and only two of these looked at the deciduous teeth of 3 and 4 year olds. The 'numbers needed to treat' varied from 3.7 in low caries populations to 1.6 in higher caries populations.</p><p>A number of relevant studies have been published since the 2002 review. A randomised controlled trial by Skold et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] involved Swedish schoolchildren being assigned different frequencies of varnish treatment, across three different levels of dental risk including a 'high risk' group. This study demonstrated a prevention fraction for varnish at six-monthly intervals of 69&#x000a0;% in high risk areas, 66&#x000a0;% in medium risk areas, and only 20&#x000a0;% in low risk areas. Although of great interest the study is of secondary school children aged 13 to 16&#x000a0;years, so does not answer the specific questions addressed in the present study. A German study reported by Borutta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]) appears to be closer to the proposed study. The aim was to assess the caries inhibition effect of fluoride varnishes among preschool children with high caries risk though an examiner-blind, clinically controlled 2-year study with 200 randomly selected 2- to 4-year-olds. As with the present study, four varnish applications were offered. The study reports a caries reduction level of 57&#x000a0;% for the fluoride varnish compared with controls. However there is no reference to the study taking place within an established prevention programme as represented by Childsmile Nursery in the present study.</p><p>A third RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] investigated the preventive effect of fluoride varnish in primary school children aged around 7 years old. Randomisation was at the school year level with either Primary 2 or Primary 3 receiving fluoride varnish treatment. The percentage of children with increased caries was high in both intervention (53&#x000a0;%) and 'treatment as usual' group (50&#x000a0;%). Weaknesses in this study include the 'clustered within the same school' design (which could have encouraged compensatory action to improve dental health in control classes), blinding limited to the evaluator, and difficulties recruiting children with a high risk of caries.</p><p>A recent trial involving schoolchildren in the North West of England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] also failed to find any evidence of effectiveness of fluoride varnish in a public health programme. However, the North West England trial was undertaken in older children (aged 7&#x02013;8 years old), while the present study focuses on 3 and 4&#x000a0;year olds. In addition the small amount of varnish used in the North West England trial (3 applications of 22,600&#x000a0;ppm fluoride varnish per year for 3 years) applied to permanent molars may have been insufficient to provide effective dental caries prevention. Finally, the present study takes place within the Childsmile programme of supervised nursery toothbrushing for children from more deprived areas who may be more at risk of developing caries.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study rationale &#x02013; hypothesis</title><p>In nursery schools - the main setting for the present study &#x02013; the Scottish Government&#x02019;s Childsmile Core programme promotes daily tooth brushing, backed up with free dental packs containing fluoride toothpaste (circa 1000&#x000a0;ppm&#x000a0;F), toothbrushes and advice leaflets, fruit and freely available water. Children in nurseries in deprived areas are also offered twice-yearly application of fluoride varnish from the time they start nursery. It is important to ascertain the additional preventive value this may bestow over and above that gained from the Childsmile Core activities described above. The study will establish whether fluoride varnish will deliver benefits which are additional to those of the Childsmile Core Programme.</p><p>The null hypothesis is therefore that the dental health (measured by d<sub>3</sub>mft score) of children in the fluoride varnish arm of the study is no better after 18&#x000a0;months of varnish application than that of the children in the TAU arm. The alternative to the null hypothesis is that there will be a significantly lower increase in the d<sub>3</sub>mft scores of children in the fluoride varnish arm than that found in the d<sub>3</sub>mft of children in the TAU arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Duraphat fluoride varnish plus treatment as usual (TAU) with TAU only in preventing any further dental decay. The primary endpoint for each individual child is whether or not there has been any occurrence of new caries lesions over the 2 year period, as measured by any increase in d<sub>3</sub>mft at 2 years of follow up compared to the d<sub>3</sub>mft at baseline (d<sub>3</sub>mft is dental decay as measured by the dmft scale in the dentine).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This protocol was peer reviewed by the national evaluation board of the Childsmile Programme, which was set up by the funder (Scottish Government) to have oversight of all research and evaluation that is associated with the programme. The design is described diagramatically in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.</p><fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the PT@3 Study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12903_2015_146_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study population</title><p>Eight hundred five children will be recruited into each of the two arms of the study. They will be identified in approximately 50 nursery schools in the NHS Lothian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Fife and Tayside Health Board areas. Nursery schools selected for this study will serve children likely to be at a higher than average risk of caries (e.g., because the nursery school serves a population from postcode areas with a SIMD score indicating higher social deprivation). The sample is 3-year-olds attending participating nursery schools. Eligibility regarding absence of contraindications will be assessed by enquiries to parents and schools prior to study entry. Routine Childsmile information on fluoride varnish will be used, as well as the study information from a specially designed &#x02018;participant information sheet&#x02019; (PIS).</p><p>Eligible participants will be randomised (1:1) to receive Duraphat &#x000ae; fluoride varnish plus TAU or TAU only. Randomisation will follow the baseline dental examination by a study dental practitioner, and will take place via a telephone call to the Interactive Voice Response System (IRVS) at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow. Blocks of four and two will be used within each nursery school, so that for every four/two children each of the two treatments will be allocated equally. Because the blocking is done at each nursery separately we will not necessarily complete the last block at each of the schools (i.e., when the target number of subjects in each treatment group has been reached). Members of the Extended Duty Dental Nurse (EDDN) teams undertake the randomisation of participants and are allocated a Personal Identification Number (PIN) by the RCB and trained in the use of the IVRS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Provision of a signed informed consent form from a parent or legal guardian.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Children in the first year of nursery school (known as the &#x02018;ante pre-school year&#x02019;).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Every eligible child in participating nurseries will be invited to join the study, irrespective of the SIMD ranking of their own postcode.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Children with or without pre-existing cavities, as the cavity can be treated through the usual primary care dental service (i.e., as part of &#x02018;treatment as usual&#x02019;).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Children with contraindications for the Duraphat varnish i.e., hypersensitivity to colophony and/or any other constituents.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A history of bronchial asthma requiring hospitalisation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>History of allergic episodes requiring hospital admission.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Identification of participants and consent</title><p>Once the head teacher has given permission, an information sheet and consent form will be given or sent to the parents or guardians of every ante pre-school child. The participant information sheet makes clear the duration of the trial and that participation is voluntary and that the parent or guardian can withdraw their child at any point. Child home postcodes from the school registration rolls will be linked to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) to ensure any potential participation bias can be analysed, and to ensure outcomes can be assessed by deprivation.</p><p>Children will not be approached for consent/assent due to their young age. Informed consent will be obtained directly from the parents/guardians by members of the study team at their child&#x02019;s nursery, at the consenting visit which will take place at least 24&#x000a0;h after the distribution of the PIS. Trial staff will also ask consenting parents and guardians to complete a contraindications checklist (adapted from the Childsmile Consent Form for Toothbrushing &#x00026; Fluoride Varnish [version 7.1]). The checklist will screen children for the contraindications for Duraphat&#x000ae; varnish (listed above). All checklists with information on possible contraindications will be assessed to decide if the child should be excluded from the trial. On the day of the dental inspection any child showing distress or verbal or non-verbal signs of extreme reluctance will be excluded from the study if the dentists feel that continuing with the inspection would cause the child further distress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Withdrawal of subjects</title><p>Immediately prior to the 6, 12, and 18 Month interventions, parents/guardians will be requested to update information on contraindications to Duraphat&#x000ae; varnish. Parents/guardians will be sent a self-complete version of the Contraindications checklist (adapted from the Childsmile Consent Form for Toothbrushing &#x00026; Fluoride Varnish [version 7.1]) and a covering letter. The checklist will again screen children for the contraindications for Duraphat&#x000ae; varnish listed above. The covering letter makes it clear that the checklist must be returned if the child has developed any contraindications in the period following the previous intervention, so we can exclude that child from the intervention. All returned checklists will be assessed by the trial dentist who will decide if the reported contraindication for Duraphat&#x000ae; varnish requires that the child be withdrawn from the study.</p><p>Parents who withdraw their child will be asked, if appropriate, to agree to their having the end-of-study dental examination, in order to make best use of information already collected on that child. Children who leave a trial nursery school during the study, but remain in the local area, and go on to attend a local primary school will receive an endpoint dental inspection. The parents/guardians of these children will be informed of the inspection.</p><p>Any adverse reactions to the fluoride varnish (e.g., mucositis, allergic reaction etc.), whether noted by Childsmile staff or reported by parents or school, will be entered into the Case Report Form by the study dental nurse or dental health support worker. All recorded adverse reactions will be reviewed by the site Principal Investigator. Details of adverse reactions will be assessed against the criteria for expedited pharmacovigilance reporting to the MHRA and Research Ethics Committee. If any immediate adverse reaction is suspected, the varnish can be easily removed by toothbrushing, rinsing and spitting. Any child with a suspected immediate adverse reaction will be permanently withdrawn from the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study schedule</title><p>Up to six visits are involved for children who are retained throughout the study. The first will be to complete the baseline dental inspection. This is followed by randomisation and the first of four intervention/TAU visits by the study Childsmile team to the nursery school, spaced roughly six months apart. The final visit is to undertake an endpoint dental inspection to re-inspect the child in year 1 of their primary school. Neither children nor parents are required to make special visits to a clinic or other study base. Where possible, visits 1 and 2 will be combined: i.e., if logistics allow, the first varnish/TAU intervention will be completed after the baseline dental examination and the subsequent randomisation.</p><sec id="Sec11"><title>Visit 1/visit 2: Examination/randomisation/0&#x000a0;month intervention visit(s)</title><p>At this visit study staff will confirm eligibility before the baseline dental examination is carried out by a study dental practitioner (e.g., signed consent form is in place, enquiry form regarding contraindications is complete and the child has no obvious temporary infections or injuries which would lead to exclusion on the day). Completion of CRF containing dental examination data.</p><p>All children receive treatment as usual (TAU), namely supervised toothbrushing in the nursery. Randomisation will take place via a telephone call to the IRVS at the Robertson Centre for Biostatistics. As soon as possible following randomisation, the study Childsmile team will perform a brief oral check, depending on randomisation they either get a &#x0201c;sham&#x0201d; fluoride varnish application (applicator brushing teeth with no fluoride varnish on it) or they get the active treatment involving application of fluoride varnish. The dental nurse will record treatment arm in order to ensure consistency of treatment throughout the sequence of visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Visit 3: 6 Month (+/- 3 months) intervention visit to nursery school</title><p>In the week prior to the visit parents will be sent the contraindications checklist and covering letter (detailed above). If the parents are aware of any contraindications this checklist will be returned to the nursery school. On arrival at the nursery school the study dental team will ascertain if any checklists have been returned. If no exclusion criteria are identified, the study dental team will again either apply fluoride varnish, or deliver TAU, including a brief oral check, as dictated by the original study arm allocation. As before, children with temporary conditions (e.g., cold sores, abrasions, or systemic illnesses) will not have FV applied, but will remain in the study. Children absent at this or subsequent visits will also continue in the study unless actively withdrawn by a parent or following assessment of any adverse reaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Visit 4: 12 Month (+/- 3 months) intervention visit to nursery school</title><p>Procedures as for Visit 3 above.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Visit 5: 18 Month (+/- 3 months) intervention visit to nursery school</title><p>Procedures as for Visit 3 above.

Each 1&#x000a0;ml of Duraphat&#x000ae; Dental Suspension contains 50&#x000a0;mg sodium fluoride which is equivalent to 22.6&#x000a0;mg of fluoride. The protocol treatments will be applied at six monthly intervals for 18&#x000a0;months i.e., baseline, and at 6&#x000a0;months, 12&#x000a0;months and finally 18&#x000a0;months post-baseline (all timings +/- 3 months).</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Rationale for chosen treatment schedule</title><p>The treatment schedule chosen is in line with current practice guidelines (Guideline 83. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]) and the approved summary of product characteristics.</p><p>A 0.25&#x000a0;ml dose of Duraphat&#x000ae; dental suspension contains 5.6&#x000a0;mg of fluoride. The toxic dose of fluoride ingestion is estimated at 75&#x000a0;mg for an average sized 3&#x000a0;year old weighing 15&#x000a0;kg, so such a child would have to swallow 2 whole cartridges to ingest a toxic amount. Any child suspected of swallowing excessive levels should be given lots of milk to drink and transferred to the local A&#x00026;E Department for a gastric lavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>A child in the study may receive fluoride varnish up to a maximum of four times a year (twice in study applications and twice from their own dentist if their practice is participating in their Childsmile Practice programme.) This represents a total dose of 22.6&#x000a0;mg of fluoride spread over four applications per year, and is well within the Scottish Dental Clinical Effectiveness Programme&#x02019;s (SDCEP) clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and is within the safe limits for both acute toxicity levels and chronic ingestion resulting in fluorosis. Even if the child were to receive two doses on the same day, there would be no risk of toxicity as two doses would give the child 11.3&#x000a0;mg of available fluoride, still well within the dose safety margin. There would also be very little chance of fluorosis as, after the age of 4 years, most of the adult teeth have already calcified. A dose of 25&#x000a0;mg four times per year is within the SDCEP&#x02019;s clinical guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Investigational product administration</title><p>The procedure will follow the standard practice of the Childsmile Nursery programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and will be detailed in full in the study management procedures.

The safety assessment reduces the possibility of children with oral/facial infections being included. Any child with any abnormality of the lips, face or soft tissues of the mouth will be excluded from fluoride varnish treatment scheduled for that day. Children who are showing obvious signs of systemic illness e.g., colds, 'flu, chicken pox etc. will also be excluded on that day. An extra-oral and intra-oral assessment will be conducted. Thereafter, the teeth and gums will be checked for signs of infection starting with the upper right and then moving to the upper left, lower right and finally the lower left. If the risk assessment is negative the fluoride varnish will be applied. Children who have signs of decay will still have the fluoride varnish applied as it may help protect from further decay and it will familiarise the child to dental treatment.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Treatment</title><p>Starting with the upper right side, the cheek will be retracted with a finger or mirror and the canine and molars dried with a cotton roll. With the cotton roll in place, a small amount of Fluoride Varnish will be applied to the contact points of the canine and molars and to the occlusal surfaces of the molars. The same procedure will be repeated for the upper left quadrant and lower quadrants. The remaining varnish will be applied to the labial surfaces of the canines and incisors. The dental nurse will then complete a check to ensure that all equipment is removed from the mouth and disposed of in line with current procedures.</p><p>If the child becomes upset or protests during any part of the procedure, then the procedure will be halted, and only resumed if the child can be reassured and put at ease. If any immediate adverse reaction is suspected, the varnish can be easily removed by toothbrushing, rinsing and spitting. Children who miss one or more of the treatments are still eligible to receive any remaining treatments. Children with an incomplete record of treatments or contacts will be retained in the study, even if all treatments and contacts are missed.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Study supplies</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Supply of study treatment</title><p>Commercially available UK supplies of Duraphat&#x000ae; Dental Suspension will be used in the study.
