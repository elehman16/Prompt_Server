If this balance is disrupted, demineralization will progress, leading to a deterioration of the tooth structure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Caries initiation is associated with demineralization of the subsurface tooth enamel. Calcium and phosphate are lost from the subsurface enamel, resulting in the formation of a subsurface lesion. At this early stage, the caries lesion is reversible via a remineralization process involving the diffusion of calcium and phosphate ions into the subsurface lesion to restore the lost tooth structure. As several studies had demonstrated that milk-based products appeared to have anticariogenic properties in animal models, attention was focused on identifying the specific milk-based agents that were responsible for the &#x02018;anticaries effect&#x02019;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] The concept of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate as a remineralizing agent was first postulated in 1998. CPP-ACP nanocomplexes are derived from bovine milk protein, casein, and calcium and phosphate. A number of subsequent studies have demonstrated CPP-ACP to have anticariogenic activity in laboratory, animal and human <italic>in situ</italic> experiments.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Modern prospective caries studies require the measurement of small changes in a tooth's mineral content, especially in a single caries lesion. One recent technique is scanning electron microscopy with an energy dispersive X-ray analysis attachment. It is a microanalytical technique that is employed to quantitatively estimate the amounts of mineral in a given tooth sample.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The anticariogenic activity of CPP-ACP has led to its incorporation into food products and dental products as a new tool in the fight against dental caries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the remineralization potential of casein phosphopeptide-amorphous calcium phosphate paste on enamel subsurface lesions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Ninety enamel specimens, 4 mm &#x000d7; 4 mm &#x000d7; 1 mm in size, were prepared from the buccal surfaces of extracted human molar teeth using a low-speed diamond disc.

GC Tooth Mousse is a water-based, lactose-free creme containing 10% w/w Recaldent CPP-ACP. When CPP-ACP is applied in the oral environment, it will bind to biofilms, plaque, bacteria, hydroxyapatite, and soft tissue, localizing bioavailable calcium localizes and phosphate.</p><p>CPP-ACP thus, localizes ACP on the tooth surface, and buffers the free calcium and phosphate ion activities, helping to maintain a state of supersaturation with respect to the enamel by suppressing demineralization and enhancing remineralization.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The CPP has a substantial ability to stabilize calcium phosphate in solution. The peptide was found to bind 21 calcium and 14 phosphorus ions per molecule.</p><p>ACP nuclei spontaneously form in neutral and alkaline supersaturated calcium phosphate solutions. It is proposed that the peptide binds to the forming ACP nanoclusters, producing a metastable solution and preventing ACP growth to the critical size required for nucleation and phase transformation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] A 1.0% w/v CPP solution can stabilize 60 mmol/L CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 36 mmol/L sodium phosphate at pH 7.0 to form colloidal amorphous calcium phosphate-CPP nanocomplexes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>The remineralization process involves diffusion of calcium and phosphate ions through the protein/water-filled pores of the carious surface enamel into the body of the enamel lesion. Once in the body of the enamel lesion, these calcium and phosphate species increase the activities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, thereby increasing the degree of saturation with respect to hydroxyapatite.</p><p>The formation of hydroxyapatite in the lesion would lead to the generation of acid and phosphate, which would diffuse out of the lesion along a concentration gradient. By stabilizing calcium phosphate in a metastable solution, the CPP facilitates high concentrations of calcium and phosphate ions, which can then diffuse into the enamel subsurface lesion. The CPP will also maintain high activities of the free calcium and phosphate ions during remineralization through the reservoir of the bound ACP. By being in dynamic equilibrium with free calcium and phosphate ions, the bound ACP will maintain the concentrations of the species involved in diffusion into the lesion. Furthermore, dissociation of the CPP-bound ACP will be facilitated by the acid generated during enamel remineralization. This would explain why CPP-supported, metastable calcium phosphate solutions are such efficient remineralizing solutions, as they would consume the acid generated during enamel lesion remineralization by generating more calcium and phosphate ions, thus maintaining their high concentration gradients into the lesion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, a paste type formulation of CPP-ACP was used. Patients can use this kind of oral hygiene paste just like tooth paste with tooth brushes and also apply the paste with cotton slabs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>EDX has been used for elemental analysis at the ultrastructural level. It is a microanalytical technique that is used in conjunction with SEM wherein SEM does the structural analysis and the elemental analysis is done by EDX. The principle is based on the energy emitted in the form of X-ray photons when electrons from external sources collide with the atoms in a material, thus generating characteristic X-rays of that element. When the sample is bombarded by the electron beam of the SEM, electrons are ejected from the atoms on the specimen's surface (secondary electrons). A resulting electron vacancy is filled by an electron from a higher shell, and an X-ray is emitted (characteristic X-rays) to balance the energy difference between the two electrons. The EDX X-ray detector measures the number of emitted X-rays vs. their energy. The energy of the X-ray is characteristic of the element from which the X-ray was emitted. A spectrum of the energy vs. relative counts of the detected X-rays is obtained and evaluated for qualitative and quantitative determinations of the elements present in the specimen using a computer-based program.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>The results of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that 10% CPP-ACP paste remineralized subsurface lesions in human enamel. The remineralization was maximal in the samples kept for 35 days, thus, it could be said that the remineralization was dose-dependent. The results of this study were consistent with the proposed remineralization mechanism of CPP-ACP and are in accordance with the one obtained by Reynolds who demonstrated that CPP-stabilized calcium phosphate solutions remineralized subsurface lesions in human enamel <italic>in vitro</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>According to Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic> . Hegde <italic>et al</italic> .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] and Oshiro <italic>et al</italic> .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] the inorganic components contained in high concentrations in CPP-ACP acted to enhance remineralization of the enamel. This is consistent with the results of the present study.</p><p>Enamel specimens treated with CPP-ACP paste revealed slight changes in their morphological features. The surface morphologies of the specimens in the study groups showed no apparent differences among the different storage periods. This is in accordance with the study conducted by Oshiro <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:</p><p>
