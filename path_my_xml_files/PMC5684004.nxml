and body weight of wearing a near-infrared light belt around the abdomen. [Subjects and
Methods] Twenty-eight obese female subjects participated in this experiment. For
measurement of body composition, an impedance-style body fat analyzer was used. The
experimental group performed treadmill walking 3 times per week for 12 weeks while wearing
an activated near-infrared belt around the abdomen. The near-infrared belt was composed of
light-emitting diodes having wavelengths of 630&#x02005;nm, 830&#x02005;nm, 880&#x02005;nm, and 956&#x02005;nm. [Results]
The analysis of abdominal circumference indicated that the abdominal circumference of the
experimental group was reduced in post-test measurements compared to pre-test.
[Conclusion] This investigation showed significant reductions in abdominal circumference,
abdominal fat percentage, fat mass, and body-mass index for the experimental compared to
the control group, suggesting that changes in body composition can be enhanced when
near-infrared radiation is applied to the abdomen during walking.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Body composition</kwd><kwd>Blood test</kwd><kwd>Near-infrared light</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Obesity is emerging as a serious social problem in modern society. Obesity causes various
diseases by excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. Most notably, as the obesity level
increases, the risk factors for and morbidity of cardiovascular disease increase<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Obesity has also been identified as a major
health risk factor, increasing the risk not only for hypertension, type 2 diabetes,
dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, liver dyslipidemia, and endocrine disorders, but also affecting
the individual&#x02019;s mental health and well-being<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Until now, most studies on the treatment of obesity have focused on solving the imbalance
of metabolic function and the approach is usually through dietary and exercise
therapies<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, even if exercise
with a relatively low risk of side effects is performed, it can still lead to side effects
such as ligament injuries and arthritis, depending on individual characteristics and
athletic abilities<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, there has
been increasing interest in attempting to treat obesity using non-invasive near-infrared
radiation. Near-infrared radiation (NIR) is light existing between visible-spectrum rays and
mid-infrared rays, longer than a visible ray and shorter than a mid-infrared ray, with a
wavelength of 0.72 to 1.6 &#x003bc;a.</p><p>In a prior study, obese adolescents, wearing an abdominal band that radiated near-infrared
rays, performed aerobic exercise for 50 minutes 3 times a week for 4 weeks. It was found
that body-mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and fat level were significantly more
decreased in the group who were treated with both aerobic exercise and NIR, compared to
those who only had aerobic exercise<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, Mecrea et al. investigated the effect of water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) on local
fat reduction during moderate bicycle ergometer endurance exercise, and found greater
decrease in the circumferences of waist, hip, and both thighs in the wIRA group relative to
the control group<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study used the
method of distant irradiation while subjects were using the ergometer. While suggesting the
positive influence of the NIR on reducing obesity, these studies have a limitation of low
practicality. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate changes in abdominal fat,
body fat and BMI when middle-aged females with a high abdominal obesity rate performed
treadmill exercise wearing a band equipped with 630-nm, 830-nm, 880-nm, and 956-nm
near-infrared LEDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-eight female participants whose age ranged from 50 to 65 with a mean age of
56.75&#x02005;years, mean height of 156.26&#x02005;cm, (Standard Deviation (SD), 2.82), mean weight of
74.67&#x02005;kg (SD, 7.46), and BMI over 29&#x02005;kg/m), were recruited from several fitness centers in
Daegu, South Korea. Participants were assigned to either the exercise group (n=14) or the
control group (n=14) using a purposive sampling method. All participants gave informed
consent prior to the experiment in accordance with the ethical standard of the Declaration
of Helsinki.</p><p>Body fat percentage, abdominal fat percentage, and BMI were measured using an Inbody 3.0
(bioelectrical impedance fatness analyzer GIF-891DH, Inbody, Kilwoo, Korea). Abdominal
obesity of the participants was identified using the waist/hip circumference ratio of
&#x02265;80&#x02005;cm, which was suggested by the WHO West Pacific Region in 2000. The thickness of fat of
the participants was measured with a skinfold caliper (Idass, England) at three areas
including at thigh, finger, and upper arm.</p><p>To measure total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides, nurses performed blood sampling for all
participants. On the day of the experiment, 5&#x02005;ml of venous blood was collected at the
cubital fossa from each participant after more than 30 minutes&#x02019; rest. Samples were analyzed
at Daegu Clinical Testing Center.</p><p>This study was carried out with a walking program at 60% of maximum heart rate (HRmax 60%),
performed at Kyungpook National University&#x02019;s fitness center 3 times a week for 12 weeks. As
the experimental treatment, walking was performed on a treadmill using the wireless heart
rate monitor, X-trainer (Polar Ambulatory heart-rate monitor, Polar, Port Washington, NY,
USA). In order to maintain the target heart rate (HRmax 60%), participants went through a
one-week adaptation process supervised by the exercise prescriber, so that they would
understand and learn correct posture and ergonomic movements for walking. The 12-week
walking exercise program was devised based on the study by Hiatt et al<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. A pedometer (YAMASA, EM-180, Japan) was distributed to each
participant for precise recording of the amount of walking exercise each day. The
experimental group performed treadmill walking while wearing an activated near-infrared belt
around the abdomen. The near-infrared belt was composed of light-emitting diodes having
wavelengths of 630&#x02005;nm, 830&#x02005;nm, 880&#x02005;nm, and 956&#x02005;nm.</p><p>The Control group wore the abdominal belt, but it was inactivated and hence free of
near-infrared rays; this group performed the same amount of treadmill walking as the
experimental group. A 2 (group) &#x000d7;2 (pre- and post-) ANOVA with repeated measures on the last
factor was carried out. Dependent variables were body composition factors (abdominal
circumference, abdominal fat percentage, BMI, fat mass, body fat) and blood components
(total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides). Post hoc analysis
using Bonferroni was performed to determine where the significant differences were located.
Statistical data were analyzed using the SPSS 21.0 program, and the statistical significance
level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The analysis of abdominal circumference indicated that the abdominal circumference of the
experimental group was reduced in post-exercise measurements compared to pre-exercise
(p&#x0003c;0.001). In the analysis of abdominal fat ratio, the interaction between group and
measurement time (pre- or post-exercise) was also significant (F (1, 26)=8.67, p&#x0003c;0.01).
Post-hoc test results showed that the abdominal fat rate in the experimental group was
reduced in post-test measurements compared to pre-exercise (p&#x0003c;0.001). The analysis of BMI
revealed that BMI in the experimental group was reduced in post-exercise compared to
pre-exercise (p&#x0003c;0.001). In the analysis of fat mass, the interaction between group and
measurement time was also significant (F (1, 26)=32.16, p&#x0003c;0.001). Post-hoc test results
showed that fat mass in the experimental group was reduced in post-exercise measurements
compared to pre-exercise (p&#x0003c;0.001). Body fat percentage analysis showed that fat mass
percentage in the experimental group was reduced in post-exercise measurements compared to
pre-exercise (p&#x0003c;0.001) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

near-infrared light-emitting belt around the abdomen on the reduction of local body fat and
BMI index. As a result of analyzing body changes (abdominal circumference, abdominal fat
percentage, body fat mass, body fat percentage, body-mass index), the experimental group who
performed walking with the near-infrared belt showed significant reduction in abdominal
circumference, abdominal fat percentage, fat mass, and body-mass index compared to the
control group, suggesting that changes in body composition can be enhanced when
near-infrared rays are irradiated into the abdomen during walking. The results of the
present study support the previous studies that reported that near-infrared application had
a significant effect on lipolysis<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, the study by Ali et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
supports the results of the present study, reporting that obese adolescents showed a
significant decrease in waist circumference, body fat percentage, and body-mass index
compared to the control group when near-infrared rays were irradiated into the abdomen
during aerobic exercise. The changes in body composition found in the present study may be
due to the following: Several studies have shown that near-infrared light penetrates
relatively deeply into the brain and tissues<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is assumed that the near-infrared rays would be
transmitted to the adipose tissue under the abdominal skin and generate heat, which would
help break down adipose tissue. Hamblin and Demidova also support this study by claiming
that when adipose tissue is irradiated with near-infrared rays, energy is generated to cause
lipolysis<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Analysis of blood lipids (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol,
triglyceride) showed no statistically significant difference between the experimental group
and the control group. These results are consistent with the study of Mntrol et al. which
found that there was no difference between an experimental group and a control group in
total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides when obese women were
treated with physical activity and near-infrared irradiation. However, though it is
considered statistically insignificant in the scope of this relatively small study, a
decrease in total cholesterol of 7.3&#x02005;mg/dl and LDL cholesterol of 2.4&#x02005;mg/dl in the
experimental group after 4 weeks would seem to be meaningful figures<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study can be summarized as follows: The combination of near-infrared treatment and
walking showed a positive effect on weight loss and abdominal fat loss. In general, adipose
tissue is not easy to break down by exercise alone. In this respect, this study shows that
irradiation of the body with near-infrared rays during walking can help to break down
adipose tissue. The limitation of this study is that a possible placebo effect in the
exercise group was not controlled. In future studies, investigation of multiple variables
such as obesity levels, age groups, and sex in combination with various types of exercise is
suggested.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Jauch-Chara</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Oltmanns</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Obesity&#x02014;a neuropsychological disease?
