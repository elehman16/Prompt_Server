Usually, local anesthesia with lidocaine is used as a standard procedure. Lidocaine is associated with systemic side effects, allergies, a quick pass through the placenta, and neonatal toxicity.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation through the skin (TENS) is a nonpharmacological method of pain relief. TENS acupuncture is actually a modified method, which provides pain relief with electrical stimulation of the nerves.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The main mechanism of TENS is unclear.</p><p>However, TENS induced analgesia has been explained by several theories including the gate control, the endorphin-mediated pain relief, and the diffuse noxious inhibitory controls theory, however, the gate control theory of pain is one of the most common mechanisms.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The electric current generated by TENS activates large afferent fibers. Thus, TENS creates a dorsal horn inhibitory nerve stimulation or endorphins releasing or both. In addition, TENS prevents the transmission of pain by activating the descending inhibitory system.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Benefits of using TENS for pain relief include being noninvasive, no undesirable side effects, nontoxic, long-term use, and simplicity of the technique.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Gate control theory of pain, irritation of the skin through a needle, pressure, and massage can stimulate the nerve impulses to the spinal cord fibers to transmit. Consequently, it can immediately inhibit pain transmission gates and decrease pain.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, the present study aimed to compare TENS and local infiltration of 1% lidocaine on episiotomy complication in primiparous women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="material|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>A randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial was conducted from March to July 2011 at the antenatal clinic and post-delivery ward in Social Security Organization Hospital, Khorramabad, Lorestan, Iran.</p><p>A pilot study with 10 participants was carried out to calculate the sample size. Sample size was estimated through a simple sample equation, with power of 80% and standard deviation of 1.00. The sample was calculated as 40 participants in each group. The inclusion criteria were age of 18&#x02013;35 years, prim parity, cephalic presentation, mediolateral episiotomy, and non-use of sedatives over the last 6 hours before labor. The exclusion criteria included labor progress disorders, prolonged second stage of labor of &#x0003e;2 hours, extended episiotomy of &#x0003e;5 cm, conversion of the wound to a 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> grade rupture, abnormal vaginal bleeding, shoulder dystocia, placenta retention leading to the manual removal of placenta, hematoma, symptomatic external genital infections, clear neonatal malformation or abnormality in neonates, and no need for episiotomy.</p><p>The study was blinded to women and the data analyzing team, however, it was not blinded to investigators. Regarding anesthesia during episiotomy cutting, all participants received 5 cc of local infiltration of 1% lidocaine at the time of fetal crowning. In addition, TENS electrodes (Med 400, Novin Company, Iran) were placed on acupuncture points; He Gu is the 4<sup>th</sup> point on the Large Intestine meridian and shenmen. Previous studies have confirmed the effect of He Gu acupressure on labor[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and episiotomy pain.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In addition, the effect of acupuncture in shenmen point has been confirmed in a previous study.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The TENS group received TENS with 100 Hz; 250 &#x000b5;s, the output range was 15&#x02013;20 mm amplifier from crowning to the end of the episiotomy repairing.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] However, they did not receive additional does of 1% lidocaine.</p><p>In the 1% lidocaine group, even though TENS electrodes were placed on both He Gu and shenmen acupuncture points, the patients did not receive any waves from the TENS electrodes. The participants in this group received 10 cc of local infiltration of 1% lidocaine before episiotomy repair.</p><p>The participants were blinded and randomly assigned to the groups. In addition, participants in both the groups received an equal of 1% lidocaine before episiotomy cutting. TENS electrodes could be installed at the same time and same location for participants in both the groups, therefore, the only difference between interventions was the waves in the TENS group while there were no waves in the 1% lidocaine group. Further, 1% lidocaine group received 10 cc of 1% lidocaine whereas a double dose was not injected in the TENS group. Hence, it can be claimed that the differences between the results in the two groups is due to the differences in the type of interventions.</p><p>Data were collected using a demographic questionnaire, REEDA scale, and VAS by a trained ward midwife.</p><p>REEDA scale includes 5 variables of redness, edema, ecchymosis, discharge, and approximation of wound edges. Each variable was scored between 0 and 3. The total score was calculated by summing the scores of 5 variables, ranging between 0 and 15; higher scores indicated less wound healing.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] A study has confirmed the reliability of the REEDA scale (<italic>r</italic> = 0.89) in Iranian population.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Perineal pain intensity was measured in participants using VAS. Women were asked to score their pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain) in the VAS.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] A study has confirmed the reliability of VAS (<italic>r</italic> = 0.676) in Iranian population.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>After completing the demographic questionnaire and pregnancy-related forms, the participants were transferred to the delivery ward. All participants lay in the lithotomy position as soon as the active phase of the labor started. The participants were randomized into two equal groups (TENS and 1% lidocaine) of 40 participants in each group. Randomization was carried out at the obstetric triage unit using a random-number chart and opaque, sealed, consecutively numbered envelopes as they did in a previously conducted randomized study.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The primary outcomes were pain intensity while episiotomy cutting, start of the episiotomy repairs, during the episiotomy repair, end of the episiotomy repairs, and 1, 6, and 12 h after the end of the episiotomy repair. The secondary outcomes included the REEDA scale variables as redness, edema, ecchymosis, discharge, and approximation of wound edges.</p><p>Permission was obtained for this study from the deputy of research as well as the ethics board of the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (Grant No: 347; 2007).</p><p>Data were analyzed in the program SPSS version 16.0 (IBM Cor., Armonk, NY, USA).

The main point is that the safety of TENS has been confirmed in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>We find that both TENS and 1% lidocaine has been reduced the episiotomy incision edema intensity in study participants. In addition, the effect of TENS in reducing edema was higher compared with 1% lidocaine. This difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). In line with our results, a randomized controlled trial reported that any participants treated with TENS experience the swelling and edema in their perineum period.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Several studies showed that massage in the acupuncture points, especially the He Gu and Shenmen stimulate endorphins and relieve pain. On the other hand, massage in acupuncture points induces the cortisol secretion, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, it can be stated that the secretion of cortisol, is one of the influencing factors for further reduction of edema in the TENS group compared to the lidocaine group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The TENS and local infiltration of 1% lidocaine have similar effects on pain relief at the episiotomy cutting, the start of the episiotomy repair, and end of the episiotomy repair; however, the pain relief of both interventions was different during the episiotomy repair.
