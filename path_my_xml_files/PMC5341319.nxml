Following tooth extraction, dimensional changes of the residual alveolar ridge are inevitable. At the time of tooth extraction, preexisting pathologies such as periodontal disease and periapical lesions hastens the process of bone resorption.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Within first 6 months of tooth extraction, alveolar ridge loses its height and width by &#x02265;50%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Thus, to maintain the bone volume necessary for optimal functional and esthetic outcome of a dental implant, ridge preservation is the need of hour. Placement of various graft materials inside freshly extracted socket is advocated by multiple studies as a &#x0201c;ridge preservation technique.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Literature has reported alveolar ridge preservation using autogenous, allogeneic, xenograft, and alloplast graft materials.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] For most favorable results, an ideal bone graft should have the properties of osteoconduction, osteoinduction, and osteoproliferation.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Out of all the available options, allografts, xenografts, and alloplasts demonstrate only osteoconduction (except demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft which is osteoinductive). Whereas autogenous bone possesses all three properties; thus, it is still considered as the gold standard. However, the risk of infection at the donor side, limited availability, and marked resorption are few shortcomings of autogenous bone graft.</p><p>Autogenous dentin graft was developed and clinically applied in Korea from 2008 onward.

It is a prospective study having 4 months follow-up period. Radiographically and statistically significant differences were found in both the experimental groups. This was assessed based on the primary outcome variables such as a change in mean width and height of alveolar ridge, as well as histological healing pattern.</p><p>A separate <italic>in vitro</italic> study was conducted prior to clinical trial to establish the efficacy of sterilization protocol for ATG. Available data have used various inorganic acids such as nitric acid or HCl with varying concentrations for chemical sterilization.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Since its residues come in contact with human tissues, we preferred to use an organic acid, i.e., lactic acid. After rigorous experimental trials of various concentrations and exposure periods, 1N lactic acid for an exposure period of 15&#x02013;20 min was found to be efficacious. The graft particles were thoroughly washed for 60 s to remove traces of residual lactic acid prior to incubation. Even after 48 and 72 hours of incubation in nutrient broth (Hi-Media Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Mumbai, India), the absence of turbidity confirmed optimal microbial inhibition.</p><p>Significant resorption and healing of &#x003b2;-TCP particles are expected in 3&#x02013;6 months after its placement.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Most of the &#x003b2;-TCP gets biodegraded by both osteoclastic activities subsequent to the particle disaggregation and/or chemical dissolution of the molecule in the calcium and phosphate components followed by replacement with healthy bone.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] ATG resorbs within 4&#x02013;6 months after grafting. The remodeling process with new bone formation continues up to 1&#x02013;2 years.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Based on these references, a 4 months follow-up period was selected for the current study.</p><p>CBCT scans were taken on the day of extraction immediately after grafting procedure and after 4 months posttreatment. CBCT scan being three dimensional in nature has helped us to evaluate changes in alveolar bone in all possible dimensions and measure them precisely. After 4 months posttreatment, the mean width change was highest for ungrafted sites followed by &#x003b2;-TCP sites, and it was least for ATG sites. The change in mean width was statistically significant when ATG-grafted sites were compared with other grafted sites (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). When vertical bone resorption was compared, at ATG sites mean height showed consistently least reduction with respect to &#x003b2;-TCP and ungrafted sites. This change in alveolar height was statistically significant for ATG sites (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>Literature has provided evidence in support to the fact that ridge preservation procedures reduce the bone dimensional changes compared with extraction without ridge preservation procedures.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, systematic review demonstrates, in spite of employing evidence-based ridge preservation techniques, a complete prevention of vertical and horizontal bone resorption is an unpredictable event.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The results of this study are in accordance with these findings as there was some loss of ridge width and height in both the experimental groups despite performing ridge preservation technique. Thus, ridge preservation procedures do not result in complete dimensional stability but are designed to reduce the loss of ridge dimension compared to sites left to heal naturally after tooth extraction. In our study, within the ridge preservation groups, ATG sites showed consistently minimum vertical, as well as horizontal bone resorption, as evidenced by least change in alveolar width and height 4 months after therapy.</p><p>From a histological standpoint, ATG particles were surrounded by vital bone with areas of resorption. This is consistent with a study done by Kim <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the &#x003b2;-TCP group, the degree of new bone formation was generally moderate and newly formed bone was immature in nature. It was surrounded by varying degree of osteoid material and in one case, mild inflammatory infiltrate was observed.</p><p>The possible explanation for better results with ATG is validated by various <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal studies which have demonstrated its biocompatibility, osteoinductive, and osteoconductive potential.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In addition, clinical studies have shown its use in reconstructive periodontal surgery with superior results.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Murata reported the first clinical case of sinus augmentation using auto-dentin as a bone graft material. Interestingly, dentin and bone are almost similar with respect to composition. They consist of body fluid (10%), collagen (18%), noncollagenous proteins (2%), and hydroxyapatite (HA) (70%) in weight volume. According to Urist in 1965, demineralized dentin matrix and demineralized bone matrix contain mainly type-I collagen with growth factors such as bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and fibroblast growth factors. These bioactive molecules are thought to contribute to osteoinduction and osteoconductive property of human tooth as a graft material.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Mineral content wise, tooth consists of low-crystalline HA and possibly other calcium phosphate minerals such as &#x003b2;-TCP, amorphous calcium phosphate, and octacalcium phosphate which is quite similar to human bone tissues.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Kim <italic>et al</italic>. indicated that the content of autogenous tooth is quite comparable to that of autogenous cortical bone.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Hence, properties like these might explain the better results imparted by ATG.</p><sec id="sec2-12"><title>Limitations</title><p>The study is pilot in nature. Additional studies are needed to validate these findings using larger sample size. Additional research needs to be conducted to differentiate osseo-remodeling properties of dentin, cementum, and enamel. Longer duration of evaluation will give more predictable results and would confirm its stability. In addition, more studies are needed to evaluate the effect on implants placed in ATG-grafted alveolar ridge preservation sites in terms of their osseointegration and stability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The clinical outcome of alveolar ridge preservation procedure is satisfactory with no reported complications. The study is able to validate the need of alveolar ridge preservation technique in maintaining height and width of residual alveolar ridge after extraction. ATG has shown more promising results as compared to &#x003b2;-TCP in achieving minimum volumetric alveolar bone loss when it is grafted immediately in postextraction socket. Histologically, it has shown to facilitate new bone formation. This resorbable material allows most predictable, consistent, and reproducible bone regeneration. Derived from an extracted human tooth, it is the most easily available and cost effective material. Thus, rather than disposing extracted teeth as biomedical waste, they can be used as an autogenous graft material and serve as a better alternative to most of the conventional graft materials. Further randomized clinical trials are needed to establish its regenerative potential in various periodontal defects.</p><sec id="sec2-13"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-14" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>The authors wish to thank Mr. Pradeep K.
