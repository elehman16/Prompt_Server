Literacy and health literacy are distinct but overlapping constructs that impact wellbeing. Interventions that target both could improve health outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial with a qualitative component. Participants are 300 adults enrolled in basic language, literacy and numeracy programs at adult education colleges across New South Wales, Australia. Each adult education institute (regional administrative centre) contributes (at least) two classes matched for student demographics, which may be at the same or different campuses. Classes (clusters) are randomly allocated to receive either the health literacy intervention (an 18-week program with health knowledge and skills embedded in language, literacy, and numeracy training (LLN)), or the standard Language Literacy and Numeracy (LLN) program (usual LLN classes, specifically excluding health content).</p><p>The primary outcome is functional health literacy skills &#x02013; knowing how to use a thermometer, and read and interpret food and medicine labels. The secondary outcomes are self-reported confidence, more advanced health literacy skills; shared decision making skills, patient activation, health knowledge and self-reported health behaviour. Data is collected at baseline, and immediately and 6&#x000a0;months post intervention. A sample of participating teachers, students, and community health workers will be interviewed in-depth about their experiences with the program to better understand implementation issues and to strengthen the potential for scaling up the program.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Outcomes will provide evidence regarding real-world implementation of a health literacy training program with health worker involvement in an Australian adult education setting. The evaluation trial will provide insight into translating and scaling up health literacy education for vulnerable populations with low literacy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?ACTRN=12616000213448">ACTRN12616000213448</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12889-016-3034-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Literacy</kwd><kwd>Health literacy</kwd><kwd>Adult education</kwd><kwd>Shared decision making</kwd><kwd>Numeracy</kwd><kwd>Health disparities</kwd><kwd>Minority health</kwd><kwd>Underserved patients</kwd><kwd>Social inequality</kwd><kwd>Social disadvantage</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LP130100480</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCaffery</surname><given-names>Kirsten J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1029241</award-id><award-id>1034912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McCaffery</surname><given-names>Kirsten J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Sian K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Low literacy and health literacy</title><p>Health literacy is commonly defined as the <italic>capacity to acquire, understand and use information in ways which promote and maintain good health</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As with general literacy, health literacy skills can be described and measured at different levels: &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; (the health skills required to function in everyday situations), &#x0201c;communicative/interactive&#x0201d; (more advanced skills to extract information, discriminate between different sources of information and derive meaning) and &#x0201c;critical&#x0201d; (the ability to critically analyse information) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Health literacy involves the capacity to <italic>use</italic> health information, not simply to obtain it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>To the extent that health literacy involves engaging with written information, it is strongly influenced by language, literacy and numeracy (LLN); hence some commonly used measures of health literacy (e.g. REALM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], TOFHLA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) measure recognition and use of health vocabulary. Individuals with limited literacy skills are less likely to engage in preventative healthcare, are more likely to develop chronic illnesses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and, once developed, experience greater difficulties managing those illnesses and often die earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In Australia, up to 60&#x000a0;% of adults lack basic health literacy skills to understand health-related materials, such as instructions on a medicine label [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Estimates of low health literacy in Europe (47&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and the US (36&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] are similarly high. Building health literacy is a priority in Australia and internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Closely aligned with emerging interest in population heath literacy has been a growing recognition of the value of Shared Decision Making in health care. Shared Decision Making occurs when patients and health professionals work together to jointly make decisions about a patient&#x02019;s health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It is a cornerstone of high quality healthcare and now endorsed by major health organisations internationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Research shows that patients who share health decisions have higher health knowledge, more accurate risk perceptions, reduced difficulty with decision-making [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and in some circumstances show improved clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Shared Decision Making and involvement in health care generally may be viewed within Nutbeam&#x02019;s conceptual framework as &#x0201c;communicative&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;critical&#x0201d; health literacy. Yet there has been relatively little effort to support Shared Decision Making for adults with low general literacy and it has not been incorporated into health literacy programs to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There is a need to both develop and test health literacy interventions that support Shared Decision Making for adults with lower levels of general literacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Health literacy interventions</title><p>Partnerships between health and education agencies offer promise in building health literacy in the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], especially if they collaborate to access hard-to-reach groups and develop strategies to improve both health literacy, and general language, literacy, and numeracy (LLN) skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The field of adult literacy has been cautious about integrating health content into adult education programs due to concerns that teachers may lack the expertise and confidence to deliver topics about health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This is changing, although rigorous evaluations are lacking.</p><p>In the US, the Health Literacy Study Circles is a program providing teachers tools to develop health-related units, lessons and action plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The program as part of a broader intervention has been reported to increase students&#x02019; health-related knowledge and self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Three &#x02018;health literacy&#x02019; style programs have been run in adult education settings and evaluated in randomised trials in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Although published work has indicated some degree of success of these programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], only one was published in a peer reviewed journal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] making it difficult to ascertain how effective these programs have been. The one published study, a trial of a community-based health literacy/English as a Second Language program was targeted at Hispanics in the United States. It showed promising increases in health-related verbal fluency (using the TOFHLA) in the health literacy arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] immediately post intervention but there was no further follow up and measures focused on a functional health literacy only.</p><p>A UK based program that embedded health content into adult basic education was the <italic>Skilled for Health</italic> program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. It found that health content helped to engage and retain socially disadvantaged adult learners and participants reported improved understanding about health and healthier behaviours (diet, exercise and smoking). However, improvements in specific health literacy skills were not directly assessed and health literacy and health behaviour outcomes were measured by self-report. Additionally the study did not use a randomised design and lacked a control group for rigorous comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The Australian health literacy program</title><p>We aim to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention similar to Skilled for Health, adapted for an Australian context using a randomised trial design, with outcomes assessed immediately post intervention and at 6&#x000a0;months to determine whether any health literacy gains are retained.</p><p>A novel addition to the program in this study is the development and inclusion of a Shared Decision Making component (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]). This seeks to teach students about the concept of Shared Decision Making (i.e. teaching them that there are often different test and treatment options, that they have a choice between options, and that they have the right to ask questions); provide education about probability and risk, (i.e. how to understand the outcomes and likelihood of different options); and develop self-efficacy to express preferences and be actively involved in health decisions. Specifically, we introduced the AskShareKnow questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] to students (What are my options? What are the possible benefits and harms of those options? How likely are each of those benefits and harms to happen to me?) as a generic Shared Decision Making tool to help achieve these aims. The AskShareKnow questions have been shown to increase the amount and quality of information about treatment options provided by family physicians and increase Shared Decision Making behaviours in consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], and the demonstration of these questions via a short video clip in a clinic waiting room was found to be a feasible approach to increase question asking in health care consultations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>The population of adults attending basic LLN classes in Australia comprises two distinct groups: native English speakers (mostly Australian-born) who may have experienced a range of learning disabilities, did not complete school, or are retraining as a condition of their unemployment benefits; and (migrants) from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (CALD) who may fit any or none of the above conditions. Some of these migrants are highly-educated, but have poor (oral and/or written) English skills; others may have never attended school. The challenge is to develop a program flexible enough to cater to the different needs of these populations and deliver measureable differences in health literacy outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study objectives</title><p>This is a cluster randomised controlled trial that aims to evaluate a best practice model to:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>Deliver improvements in health literacy, confidence in health skills, Shared Decision Making, and knowledge about health and healthy behaviour, through a health literacy education program.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Demonstrate improved engagement in learning (through higher attendance at classes) and greater enrolment in further adult education classes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Assess feasibility for delivery in a variety of locations (metropolitan, regional, and remote).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The health literacy program will be compared to a standard adult language, literacy and numeracy (LLN) program which would be expected to achieve some improvements which extend to health literacy outcomes also.

There are 10 Institutes of TAFE in NSW &#x02013; each one will be invited to join the study for a full (18-week) semester, and to contribute at least one matched pair of classes delivering the same TAFE course (in the same or different location).</p><p>All students enrolled in each participating class will be invited to participate in the study during the first class. To assist recruitment, the researchers (KM, SM, DM) created a video introducing themselves and explaining the purpose of the study.</p><p>Participating classes will be basic LLN courses corresponding to Level 2 (basic/beginner) of the 5-level Australian Core Skills Framework (ACSF). The ACSF describes performance on the 5 skills of learning, reading, writing, oral communication, and numeracy, and is assessed by TAFE teachers at student enrolment. Each TAFE course has a designated code, and specifies LLN learning outcomes that students must achieve. For relevant course codes, a &#x0201c;mapping&#x0201d; document produced by a TAFE coordinator indicates which units of the health literacy program cover each LLN competency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation</title><p>At enrolment, students will be allocated to classes following normal TAFE procedures. Classes will be randomised centrally into &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;standard LLN&#x0201d; groups by the University of Sydney team. At campuses holding only one class participating in the study, all enrolling students will be allocated to that class. At larger metropolitan campuses with more than one participating class, students will be randomised into classes on enrolment day, by selecting an &#x0201c;odd&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;even&#x0201d; paper ticket.

Allowing for 15&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up, we aim to recruit 150 participants in each arm (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;300 in total; 15 pairs of classes of approximately 10 students per class). This sample size will also be sufficient to detect a difference in retention of at least 20&#x000a0;% between the intervention and standard LLN group, with 80&#x000a0;% power. Due to the unpredictability of TAFE enrolments, unequal cluster sizes are assumed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Procedures</title><p>The program will be delivered by adult literacy teachers -with support from community health workers in the health literacy arm to assist with health-related content. All (health literacy and standard LLN) teachers will be trained in study procedures by University of Sydney researchers, and supplied with a study manual outlining rationale, procedures and timelines. Baseline measures will be taken on entry into the program and the short-term follow-up assessment will be conducted on completion of the program. Assessments will be split over several teaching sessions to spread student workload and delivered face-to-face by the adult literacy teacher (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

In the process of doing so, it seeks to build partnerships between health and education agencies to find new ways to deliver targeted health messaging to these difficult-to-access populations. The evaluation trial will provide insight into translating and scaling up health literacy education for vulnerable populations with low literacy, including linguistically and culturally diverse adults, and durability of any observed gains. We hope that the results of this trial will influence policy makers to open pathways for health and education agencies to work together to serve the needs of these disadvantaged populations &#x02013; which may reduce some of the costs to the community of limited health literacy.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Registration details</title><p>The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (registration no.
