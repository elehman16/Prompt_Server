However, little is known about the experiences of this group of patients participating in mindfulness interventions. This paper sets out to explore the perspectives of patients with IBD recruited to a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) about the intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a qualitative study nested within a parallel two-arm pilot RCT of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for patients with IBD, two focus group interviews (using the same schedule) and a free text postal survey were conducted.

Participants saw MBCT as a therapeutic and educational initiative that transformed their relationship with the illness. The inclusive process and shared experience of MBCT alleviated the sense of social isolation commonly associated with IBD.

The disease affects around 250,000 patients in the UK and around 28 million people worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The two main types are Crohn&#x02019;s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. IBD incidence and prevalence are increasing with future prevalence likely to be considerably greater than at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. To date, there is no cure for the disease and the main focus is on maintaining remission and keeping relapse at bay, managed primarily by medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, patients with IBD are at increased risk of surgery and other complications.</p><p>The symptoms experienced by both CD and UC are very similar and very distressing. They include and are not exclusive to acute abdominal pain and gut spasms, vomiting, malnutrition, fever, fatigue, diarrhoea and rectal bleeding. These symptoms are potentially disabling and can cause severe impact on both physical and psychosocial wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In fact, around 30&#x000a0;% of these patients suffer from moderate to severe psychological distress and have difficulties in coping with their illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This distress is not only because they have to deal with the symptoms described above, but because they often experience fear and humiliation as a result of faecal incontinence, which has a profound effect on family, work, social life and identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In addition, they have to deal with the sense of loss of control, feeling &#x02018;dirty and smelly&#x02019; and feeling they are unable to fulfil their potential at work and in sexual relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, the steroidal treatments can often induce side effects such as weight gain and mood swings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], which might require treatment with antidepressants. Consequently, the proportion of anxiety and depression among these patients is not related to the disease severity, but to their level of perceived stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>There is a considerable body of research investigating the relationship between perceived stress and mindfulness. A number of studies have reported a negative correlation between perceived stress and mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Mindfulness or mindful awareness is the core skill taught in mindfulness-based interventions such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). MBCT combines cognitive therapy with MBSR (a programme developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn initially for patient with chronic medical conditions) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. MBCT is an 8-week, facilitator-led, group-based psychological intervention. In addition to the 2-h weekly group sessions, there is a guided home practice component for up to 45&#x000a0;min a day. Within the 8&#x000a0;weeks, participants practice a series of mindfulness meditation, cognitive behavioural therapy and stretching exercises within the group and at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. During the programme, participants become more aware of their body sensations, thoughts and emotions and their interrelatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This process of cultivating awareness enables participants to explore the change (shift) in their perception and learn how to recognise certain maladaptive thinking patterns and behaviours and replace them with more helpful ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance recommends MBCT as a preferred psychological therapy for recurrent depression and chronic worry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated effectiveness of MBCT for patients with depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">24</xref>], chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">25</xref>], fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">26</xref>] and chronic fatigue syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">27</xref>]. In addition, there is an encouraging early evidence about the use of mindfulness-based interventions in either patients with CD or UC in improving depression and anxiety scores and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">29</xref>]. However, little is known about the perceptions of this group of patients about any perceived therapeutic benefit of mindfulness-based interventions and particularly MBCT. Thus, this embedded qualitative study is the first of its kind in its investigation and is aiming to close such an evidence gap.</p><p>This paper reports the findings from two focus groups and free text survey. This nested study together with a pilot RCT is part of a wider developmental and feasibility work for a full-scale RCT testing if MBCT can be used in IBD patient care as an adjunct therapy. This is in line with the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for development and evaluation of complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">30</xref>], which recommends that such a process evaluation, nested within a trial, can provide an insight into why an intervention works and how it can be optimised for patient benefit.</p><p>Nested design is when one methodology (for example qualitative) is placed within the framework of another (for example quantitative) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">31</xref>].The pilot RCT, where this qualitative study was nested, was a parallel two-arm, exploratory pilot RCT (MBCT treatment, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22 versus wait-list control group, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) with three assessments (baseline, post-treatment and 6-month follow-up). The full protocol of the pilot RCT and its results are reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">33</xref>].</p><p>Although the nested RCT designs across the health and social sciences are rising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], there is still some criticism over using this design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The criticism is mainly due to researchers not having sufficient and adequate guidance of how to deal with issues intrinsic to nesting qualitative methods within an RCT framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Recently, such guidance has been developed by O&#x02019;Cathain et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] for maximising the impact of qualitative research in feasibility and pilot randomised controlled studies (RCT). This qualitative study fits with the above guidance, and the focus groups and survey from the nested qualitative study were included as an important element of the pilot study to provide a better understanding on how acceptable the MBCT programme is for this group of patients.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>This qualitative study aimed to explore the perspectives of patients with IBD recruited to a pilot RCT of MBCT about the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ), a 32-item checklist (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) for interviews and focus groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], was used to guide the structure of this paper.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>COREQ 32 checklist</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>No</th><th>Item</th><th>Guide questions/description</th><th>Response</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">Domain 1: Research team and reflexivity</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Personal characteristics</td></tr><tr><td>1.</td><td>Interviewer/facilitator</td><td>Which author/s conducted the interview or focus group?</td><td>Mariyana Schoultz Clinical Academic Fellow at University of Stirling PhD Candidate (conducted focus groups).</td></tr><tr><td>2.</td><td>Credentials</td><td>What were the researcher&#x02019;s credentials? e.g. PhD, MD</td><td>Leah Macaden Lecturer University of Stirling PhD.</td></tr><tr><td>3.</td><td>Occupation</td><td>What was their occupation at the time of the study?</td><td>Gill Hubbard Reader University of Stirling PhD.</td></tr><tr><td>4.</td><td>Gender</td><td>Was the researcher male or female?</td><td>All 3 researchers are female.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">5.</td><td rowspan="2">Experience and training</td><td rowspan="2">What experience or training did the researcher have?</td><td>MS had a qualitative research training through the PhD and have previously conducted qualitative research.</td></tr><tr><td>LM and GH are both qualitative researchers.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4">Relationship with participants</td></tr><tr><td>6.</td><td>Relationship established</td><td>Was a relationship established prior to study commencement?</td><td>The participants were not acquainted to the researchers prior to the study commencements.</td></tr><tr><td>7.</td><td>Participant knowledge of the interviewer</td><td>What did the participants know about the researcher? e.g. personal goals, reasons for doing the research</td><td rowspan="2">The participants knew that the intent of the evaluation was to identify benefits and barriers encountered in order to make improvements to the MBCT programme.

</p><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants and setting</title><p>All patients that participated in the qualitative study had consented at baseline to participate in both parts: the pilot RCT and the qualitative study. All participants were recruited from two Scottish NHS boards covering city and rural areas in the north of Scotland. Recruitment took place at outpatient gastroenterology clinics through letter of invitation or in person while attending outpatient clinic. Potential participants were given details of the studies and invited to participate in both parts. At recruitment point, all participants had symptoms in remission. Participants were eligible to participate in the qualitative study if they had completed post intervention assessments. Invitation to the eligible participants with details about the focus groups was made by letter or telephone (depending on their preference).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>As mentioned above, this qualitative study was nested within a parallel two-arm pilot RCT of MBCT for patients with IBD. The pilot RCT had three assessment points: at baseline, post intervention and 6-month follow-up. All participants who completed the post intervention assessments from both arms were invited to participate in the focus groups as well as to complete a free text postal survey. Further details about the full design of the pilot RCT is published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Data collection</title><p>Qualitative data was gathered through two focus groups and a postal survey involving patients with IBD participating in a pilot randomised controlled trial exploring the use of MBCT. The focus groups were audio-recorded and took place at a university campus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Focus groups</title><p>The focus groups aimed to explore and understand the views and experiences the participating group of patients had about the 8-week MBCT intervention. Both focus groups examined potential benefits and barriers of MBCT. A facilitator familiar with the aims of the qualitative study and the pilot RCT facilitated both focus groups. Two focus groups lasting approximately 60&#x000a0;min each were conducted with each focus group following the same predesigned topic schedule in order to maintain the methodological consistency. The topic schedule was based on the questions used in the free text survey. A full topic schedule is presented in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. The schedule reflected the specific acceptability questions set out in the pilot RCT protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and guided by the MRC guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] to determine how well the intervention was received by the target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In addition, a wide literature search on psychological interventions identified a range of issues related to expectations, benefits, barriers, availability and length of programme. The topic guide was piloted with volunteering colleagues. Travel expenses were reimbursed for all participants. The first focus group took place a week after the MBCT follow-up assessments were completed, consisting of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11 participants (four from the MBCT intervention arm and seven from the control arm). The second focus group took place 3&#x000a0;weeks later and comprised of <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7 participants (six from the MBCT intervention arm one from the control arm). All participants self-selected to participate into the first or the second focus group depending on their availability and convenience and consented to the discussions being audio-recorded.</p><p>Focus groups have long been recognised as a purposeful interaction for generating data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and were used in this study because they created an opportunity for participants to reflect on their responses, which cannot be captured in a questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In addition, using focus groups is particularly useful when investigating not only <italic>what</italic> participants think about a topic, but also <italic>why</italic> participants think in that particular way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Survey</title><p>A cross-sectional postal survey was sent to all the participants following completion of post intervention assessments. The survey consisted of a series of questions including free text to give opportunity to participants to express their perceptions about their experiences of the MBCT programme. The questions used in the survey mirrored those of the focus group topic themes (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Participants then sent the completed and anonymised survey (containing only study ID number) in a self-addressed prepaid envelope back to the researcher. A reminder to complete the survey was sent after 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>Survey research is the most common method of collecting data in health and health service research, designed to provide a snapshot of how things are at a specific moment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It is a tool that can be used when describing attitudes, experience and behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which fits with this study research question. The survey was used in addition to the focus groups to maximise response from participants about MBCT, particularly from those living remotely and to validate the results from the focus groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Analysis</title><p>Two researchers (MS, LM) analysed the data, one of whom was involved in conducting the focus groups. The focus groups were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Respondent validation was undertaken during focus groups to ensure rigour with data collected. Data were analysed using a thematic analysis framework approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. This approach is a rigorous method that provides a structure for qualitative data to be organised and coded and for themes to be identified. Initially, the first three phases of familiarisation with data, generating initial codes and searching for themes among codes were done independently by the two researchers for the survey and the focus groups separately. This is referred to as an investigator triangulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The researchers then met to discuss their findings for the initial analysis. All initial codes and themes were compared and any differences rectified. The researchers then extracted the core themes and went through the next three phases of reviewing themes, defining and naming themes for the survey and the focus groups. Before producing the final report of key themes and sub themes (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), triangulation of data was performed between the survey and focus groups. The data and investigator triangulation was performed to enhance confidence in the ensued findings as well as to reduce the uncertainty of interpretation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Overview of themes and subthemes derived from the focus groups and survey</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Main themes</th><th>Subthemes</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="3">Benefits from MBCT</td><td>MBCT as a healing/therapeutic process</td></tr><tr><td>MBCT as an educational process</td></tr><tr><td>MBCT as an inclusive process</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Barriers for MBCT</td><td>Time</td></tr><tr><td>Travel</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">Expectations about MBCT</td><td>Open</td></tr><tr><td>Fixed</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Participants noticed that the intervention offered alternative methods for dealing with anxiety, poor sleep, pain and depression (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quotes 1, 2 and 3) and insight into gaining more control over the management of their symptoms (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 5). Being able to relax and regain control over symptoms is something that is very important for patients with IBD as dealing with pain and other daily symptoms brings on anxiety, depression and poor sleep for many of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. These are normally managed by medications, which often have side effects and further issues. Being able to learn techniques that will ease the pain, help to relax, feel calmer and have a better sleep, while not having to rely on medications, is something that more than a few described as essential to therapeutic gain.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Benefits quotes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">MBCT as a healing/therapeutic process</td></tr><tr><td>Quote no.</td><td>Codes</td><td>Quote</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Easing the pain</td><td>&#x02018;..it's, it&#x02019;s mostly painkillers that I&#x02019;m on &#x02014; I&#x02019;ve hardly used any in the last eight weeks, hardly any at all, so em&#x02026;&#x02019; (P014)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Antidepressant/de-stress and pain relief</td><td>&#x02018;The short meditation technique is a great way to control yourself-where anti-depressants can cause bigger issues to the user/stress, helps you to relax and ease the pain away&#x02019; (P010)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Better sleep, sense of peace</td><td>&#x02018;I feel calmer, and the brain feels less rushed, em you&#x02019;ve just got a more inner sense of peace..

</p><p>Many patients with IBD worry about how they would deal with a flair up (symptom exacerbation) if it happens and often become either anxious or depressed about it. Participants found the intervention helpful (both emotionally and on a practical level) in dealing with their worry, anxiety and depressive thoughts. They found the programme particularly useful in changing their unhelpful habitual behaviours such as spiralling downward into depressive thoughts with more helpful ones, but also providing them with a respite from their anxiety and a way of dealing with crisis (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quotes 4, 6 and 7).</p><p>Moreover, due to the nature of the disease, food or relationship with food is often a challenging aspect. These patients often cannot keep food down due to vomiting which brings a lot of fear and anxiety related to food and eating. This contributes to further malnutrition in addition to the malnutrition caused by inflammation of the gut. Thus, for some, like participant P016, restarting to enjoy eating was a significant therapeutic experience (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 8).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Educational process</p><p>Some of the participants saw the intervention as an educational process. There was a prevailing perception of learning to self-care as a result of the intervention as described by participants&#x02019; quote (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 9). The learned techniques that facilitated self-care and coping were seen through the awareness and recognition when it was time to slow down or even stop before becoming too unwell (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quotes 10 and 11). The realisation of being able to take control of their body and relinquishing the state of &#x02018;auto pilot&#x02019; transformed the relationship with self and the illness (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 13). For another participant, the transformation was through the learned acceptance of the illness, by timely recognition of mental and physical exhaustion (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 12).</p><p>Participants agreed that the applications of the skills learned through MBCT are transferrable and applicable to different everyday situations. They found that MBCT gave them the tools which can be used in different ways and be applied to everyday living while dealing with cramps, stress and other daily frustrations (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quotes 14, 5 and 15).</p><p>One noteworthy example of &#x02018;everyday&#x02019; application of the mindfulness skills was described by a patient who normally struggled with using the MRI scanner (IBD patients often need scans to check changes in the bowel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]), but using one of the techniques from the class helped the participant cope with the event better (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 16).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Inclusive process</p><p>And finally, some of the participants saw the intervention as an inclusive process that facilitated peer support and a supportive environment that resulted in general feeling of inclusion and less isolation.</p><p>Participants believed that the MBCT intervention for patients with IBD provided them with an opportunity for peer support in an inclusive and supportive environment. Their view was that the peer support ascended from shared experiences of participating together in group-based exercises, shared experience of similar diagnosis and shared experience of learning in an environment where they felt safe to express their emotions without being judged. For example, one participant identified that the sense of support in the group was of a great value for them (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 17). Another participant described the sense of support from the peers as being in a &#x02018;little club&#x02019; where you can feel free to be yourself (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quote 18).</p><p>For many participants, not being judged and being left to be themselves in the group made them feel free and comfortable and increased their sense of inclusion and belonging (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quotes 19 and 20). Consequently, even though the MBCT programme is not a talking therapy, and some participants say very little, the programme offered an opportunity where participants could tap into support from their peers by just being there. For others, it was a confidence booster or a platform where they felt a part of an inclusive and supportive group in which they were free to express themselves and felt less isolated in their illness because of it (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>, quotes 21, 22 and 23).</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Difficulties and barriers for mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</title><p>Although participants focused on the benefits largely in their discussion, there was a part of the discussion that explored barriers that they faced in accessing or attending the MBCT programme. Within this theme, the largest focus was on &#x02018;time&#x02019; and management of time. While for some participants it was difficult to allocate the time for attending the class after work, for others it was the time required to do the home practice component (homework) of the programme. &#x02018;Homework&#x02019; was a component of the programme where participants were encouraged to reinforce the MBCT skills through regular practice. Some of the participants recognised their difficulty in juggling work and family life together with the programme and identified that as a barrier (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, quote 1). Others struggled managing to find time for homework and they recognised the effort it takes to fully participate in the programme (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, quotes 2 and 3).<table-wrap id="Tab5"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Difficulties and barriers quotes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Time as a barrier</td></tr><tr><td>Quote no.</td><td>Quote</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>&#x02018;It was quite difficult having it from 5.30 to 7.30 because that&#x02019;s when most people will eat especially when you are coming straight from work ..and It&#x02019;s difficult to get time off off work for doing something like this but erm&#x02026;&#x02019; (P003)</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>&#x02018;..but the homework was hard, .. hard to find the time sometimes &#x02026; but I do, I really enjoy the support &#x02026;&#x02019; (P017)</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>&#x02018;Finding the time to do the homeworks sort from week three and onwards.it got quite(pause).. week three and four was quite intense erm..&#x02019; (P003)</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>&#x02018;it was difficult to fit in all the homework&#x02019; (P007)</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>&#x02018;yea&#x02026;some talking..just..(laugh) but also felt coz&#x02026;I also felt &#x02026;erm&#x02026;its taking ,we were having to find time for ourselves.

</p><p>In contrast to the benefits of MBCT where participants recognised that slowing down and finding time for oneself is an integral part of staying well, they also recognised that the key aspect of the programme of finding time was quite difficult. While some participants viewed time as a barrier, there were others who recognised this barrier but worked towards making time for MBCT practice (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, quotes 4 and 5). Other participants recognised that to get the full benefit of the programme, they somehow had &#x02018;to shift&#x02019; the way they perceive time and create or find the time in the day to do the home practice (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, quote 6).</p><p>While in discussion about time as a barrier to MBCT and home practice, one participant notably acknowledged a key point that perhaps others did not recognise, and that is the personal commitment to make time (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, quote 7).</p><p>When talking about time as a barrier, some participants recognised that finding time for practice was related to the attitudes towards committing time for the practice. They talked about time as an investment into wellbeing, that can be very rewarding and about learning to prioritise daily activities in order to create time for home practice (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, quotes 8 and 9).</p><p>In addition to the time barrier, travel and distance were difficulties recognised by some. While there were a number of participants that lived rurally, only a small number of participants (two) acknowledged the travel and distance as a barrier to attending the programme. One participant recognised that it could be difficult to travel a distance for some, especially in the winter periods (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">5</xref>, quote 10).</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Expectations about mindfulness-based cognitive therapy</title><p>Literature suggests that clarifying patients&#x02019; expectations is associated with engagement and health outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. When participants were asked what their expectations about MBCT were, there were a range of responses. More so, the type of expectations participants had about the MBCT programme seemed to determine their insight and engagement into the programme, and therefore influence their perception about benefits or barriers with MBCT. When looking at the participants responses about expectations, their responses were either very open with very little expectations or very specific and fixed ones. For example, many participants talked about the importance of being open minded before the programme and the willingness (attitude) to go into it with no fixed expectations, such as curing the illness (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref>, quotes 1, 3, 4 and 5).

</p><p>On the other hand, there were participants that described their expectations related to the MBCT programme as more specific and fixed.

Thus, learning to respond mindfully to changing life situations and loss has enabled the participants to see stressful events such as their condition, rather than as defining characteristics of their identity. This is particularly noteworthy for patients with IBD, because some of their symptoms such as faecal incontinence and lack of bowel control could lead to loss of self-worth and exacerbate further stress and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. In addition, through the programme, participants learned that some of their previous habitual responses to stress and symptoms were not always helpful, and therefore, they attained skills that enabled them to change those patterns into more helpful ones. This fits with a proposed mechanism of mindfulness where participants are able to see things from a completely different perspective as a result of the &#x02018;shift&#x02019; in perception that happens in the meditation practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Both the versatile nature of the skills and their transferability into everyday situations acquired through MBCT were viewed as critical benefits by the participants to continue the use of mindfulness.</p><p>The shared experience/peer support sub theme has been previously highlighted in IBD and mindfulness literature. Sharing a similar diagnosis can often create a sense of community for the participants, which could alleviate the sense of social isolation commonly experienced by many patients with chronic conditions, including patients with IBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This is particularly important for patients with IBD, as their condition is hidden and they often appear well to others. However, it was very clear in this study that while the shared diagnosis benefit might have attracted participants to partake in the study, the experience of learning together to manage their symptoms in a non-pharmacological way and in a non-judgmental and supportive environment added to the benefit of peer support role and their motivation to stay in the programme. The participants themselves described the importance and value of the group experience as an aid to the therapeutic process and gain. The process of participants sharing their experience of the meditation journey as well as the process of group cohesion growth noted here is been seen in groups of other supportive expressive therapies in IBD and mindfulness-based therapies in other chronic conditions patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. This is particularly interesting since the format of the programme is mainly experiential rather than sharing and talking.</p><p>The largest participant focus in the barrier theme was on time or management of time, particularly with home practice. The other barriers identified were travel and distance. It was noted that there was a contrast between the benefits where participants acknowledged the necessity of finding time to listen to the body and its needs through practice; participants also reported that finding time for practice for some of them was very difficult. What is striking that one of the participants clearly pointed out that the attitude of commitment was an integral part in finding or creating time for practice. This attitude of commitment is at the core of the mindfulness practice teaching itself. According to Jon Kabat-Zin, attitudes involve intention and intention sets the stage for the mindfulness practice. Thus, the attitude is described as &#x0201c;the soil in which you will be cultivating your ability to calm your mind and to relax your body, to concentrate and to see more clearly&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Closely connected to the attitude topic is the theme of expectations. Patient expectations in a healthcare setting are a set of beliefs concerned with the treatment/intervention and the outcomes of the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Expectations about interventions have been seen to be associated with engagement and health outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] and therefore influence the perception about benefits or barriers of the intervention. Open and more positive expectations have been linked to better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. This is linked to the mechanisms involved in producing the placebo effect or patients&#x02019; belief about outcome can be a powerful predictor of actual outcome or benefit of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Patient expectation measures should be incorporated into future trials.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Qualitative analysis of participants&#x02019; perceptions and experiences of MBCT for IBD provided within a pilot RCT is novel and has not been explored before. This study was nested within a parallel two-arm pilot RCT examining the use of MBCT for patients with IBD. The data was obtained from participants with a wide range of age, education and social background and geographical area.</p><p>The findings from this qualitative study are consistent with and supplement the quantitative data findings from the pilot RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] which showed that depression and anxiety improved at post intervention and 6-month follow-up from baseline in the intervention arm. The findings of this study extend the findings of the pilot in few ways. First, the perceived benefits of the MBCT intervention that participants experienced and discussed in the qualitative study supplements and warrants the recommendation of the pilot RCT for a future full scale RCT exploring the effectiveness of MBCT in IBD. Second, the findings about barriers about the MBCT intervention should be considered in the recruitment process for a full RCT and might be able to ameliorate the higher than expected drop-out rate from the pilot RCT. And last, the findings from the qualitative study about participants&#x02019; expectations should be regarded in a future full RCT: patient expectations should be explored and patient expectations measures should be incorporated into such a trial at baseline and follow-ups. This could improve treatment recommendations for effective methods of fostering positive expectations that can ultimately improve health outcomes.</p><p>A limitation is that the study had a small sample. As with any qualitative study, the findings of the study cannot be generalised beyond this group of participants, who are unique in their characteristics. However, although the attained benefits of practice and recognised barriers of MBCT for these participants may not be replicated by every patient with IBD, they are certainly possible. The clinical implications of the findings suggest that MBCT could be an acceptable and beneficial intervention for people with IBD and could help them cope better with the disease and symptom management.</p><p>Findings also suggest that this intervention may not be appropriate for everybody. Participants&#x02019; reports about their initial expectations of the MBCT programme suggest those to be highly important in influencing their experience of the programme and ultimately the therapeutic gain. Participants with fixed expectations and attitudes may need individual support at the start to fully gain the benefits of the programme and should be considered at a point of recruitment.</p><p>Because researchers are not immune to their own assumptions about stress, depression and meditation, participants&#x02019; own words and phrases were used to allow the reader to make their own judgments about the trustworthiness of the analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The findings from this study have provided evidence around patient experiences using MBCT in IBD which has not been explored before. The analysis has given an insight into what is important for patients with IBD after diagnosis and when considering psychological therapies. Participants described their personal experience of MBCT as a therapeutic and an educational initiative which has enabled them to transform their relationship with the illness. As a result, many felt empowered with regaining sense of control over their body and symptom management. In addition, the inclusive process and shared experience of MBCT have alleviated the sense of social isolation commonly associated with IBD.</p><p>However, time commitment and distance were recognised as a barrier to MBCT and it could potentially influence the degree of therapeutic gain from MBCT for some participants. This study has implications for policymakers and providers of care for patients with IBD. Providers of care may wish to consider offering an 8-week MBCT programme to patients with IBD to help with symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p><p>To conclude, this qualitative study has demonstrated the acceptability of MBCT in a group of patients with IBD. Together with the pilot RCT where this study was nested, both findings form a knowledge base for a future full-scale RCT investigating the effectiveness of MBCT in IBD. This trial is novel in its investigation and will hopefully encourage more research to address the psychological needs of patients with IBD and the use of MBCT.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec21"><title>Additional files</title><p>
