Anoxic brain injury remains the leading cause of death in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The mechanisms causing neurological damage are complex but involve both ischemia and reperfusion injury leading to tissue degeneration and loss of neurological function, the extent of which depends on duration and density of the insult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Targeted temperature management (TTM) may attenuate this damage in an experimental setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and clinical trials have shown promising results in improving neurological function and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Despite this, the optimal target temperature is debated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and active neuroprotection in addition to temperature management seems intuitively beneficial. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues are approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes but have recently been suggested to ameliorate degenerative neurological disease and reduce inflammation after ischemic cerebral stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The GLP-1 analogue Exenatide has been shown to reduce infarct volume after focal brain ischemia in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and to reduce infarct size in a model of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and reperfusion in swine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In humans, patients treated with Exenatide after MI have been shown to have a larger salvage index assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. These findings have been confirmed by later trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In addition, Exenatide has been well tolerated in acutely ill patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction with no apparent increased risk of adverse events, including hypoglycaemia or pancreatitis, compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The present trial will investigate the neuroprotective capabilities of the GLP-1 analogue Exenatide administered for 6&#x000a0;hours and 15&#x000a0;minutes within 4&#x000a0;hours after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in comatose patients resuscitated from OHCA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This pilot study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial assessing the effect of Exenatide compared with placebo on top of TTM in adult comatose OHCA patients.

The patient&#x02019;s eligibility for trial inclusion is assessed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). If all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are met, informed consent is obtained, in accordance with Danish legislation, from two independent medical doctors not involved with the trial. Patients are then randomly allocated to active study drug or placebo via an internet-based randomization algorithm available on the trial website.

Patients are sedated and mechanically ventilated. Patients are treated for 24&#x000a0;hours with an automated-feedback device with temperature control to achieve a target core temperature (bladder) of 36&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. After 24&#x000a0;hours of TTM, patients are rewarmed to a core temperature of 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with no more than 0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C per hour. Phase 2 ends when sedation is withheld.</p><p>PHASE 3 (from end of intervention period to 72&#x000a0;hours after end of intervention period): Sedation is stopped or tapered after rewarming when temperature is at least at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Normothermia of 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C +/&#x02212;0.5&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C is maintained until 72&#x000a0;hours from cardiac arrest if the patient is still managed in the ICU and is comatose or sedated. However, weaning from ventilation will be attempted at the earliest possible time during this phase based on standard procedures for the discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. Blood is drawn at 24, 48 and 72&#x000a0;hours and is later analysed for the biomarkers neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100B &#x02013; markers of cerebral injury. Neurological evaluation of patients who remain in a coma is performed by blinded physicians at 72&#x000a0;hours or later after the end of the intervention period.</p><p>PHASE 4 (72&#x000a0;hours after the end of the intervention period to 28&#x000a0;days after OHCA): Neurological status according to the Cerebral Performance Category scale (CPC-scale) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and vital status are evaluated daily in the ICU on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and/or at hospital discharge, whichever comes first.</p><p>PHASE 5 (hospital discharge/day 28 to end of trial): Vital status and neurological status are evaluated on days 30 and 90 and then by telephone interview on day 180. The evaluation is performed by a research nurse blinded to the intervention allocation. Vital status will be assessed at the end of the trial using the Danish civil registration system.

At first notice of a potential candidate for inclusion in the trial, a set of study drug and placebo will be prepared. The infusions will be prepared as follows:</p><p>First, 1.5&#x000a0;ml is removed from 250&#x000a0;ml of isotonic NaCl and 1.5&#x000a0;ml of 20&#x000a0;% human albumin is added to prevent binding of the study drug to the infusion material. For every potentially eligible patient, two infusion kits will be prepared. One is a placebo kit as described, and one has 25&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Byetta (Lilly, Exenatide) added. The two infusion kits are labelled &#x02018;A&#x02019; or &#x02018;B&#x02019; by random allocation in a computer-based randomization system and brought directly to the ICU. The random allocation will occur via the trial website with a specific logon for personnel involved in study drug preparation. The allocation &#x02018;A&#x02019; and &#x02018;B&#x02019; will be chosen at random by the trial website algorithm (randomization generated into dynamic blocks), stratified for site and will be unblinded by the end of trial.</p><p>The cardiologist responsible for the patient&#x02019;s treatment screens the patient&#x02019;s eligibility and obtains informed consent from legal representatives. If the patient is eligible for inclusion and informed consent is obtained from two independent physicians, the patient is randomized via the trial website to receive either infusion kit &#x02018;A&#x02019; or &#x02018;B&#x02019;, and the other kit is discarded. The cardiologist orders the infusion to be given. The infusion is given in a central or peripheral intravenous line. The nurses preparing the infusion kits remain blinded to participant allocation, and the nurses initiating the study drug infusion (ICU nursing staff) remain blinded to the preparation of the infusion kits.</p><p>The study drug infusion is initiated by the ICU nursing staff as soon as possible at a rate of 72&#x000a0;ml/hour (0.12&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Exenatide/minute) for 15&#x000a0;minutes (volume to be infused is 18&#x000a0;ml), followed by 26&#x000a0;ml/hour (0.043&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g Exenatide/minute) for an additional 6&#x000a0;hours (volume to be infused: 156&#x000a0;ml). This concludes the pharmacological intervention and thus a total of 17.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of Exenatide is administered. As the allocation is blinded, the same infusion rates are used in the placebo arm. For safety reasons, blood glucose is monitored closely during the administration period and for the following 2&#x000a0;hours. Blood glucose and corrective glucose administration is reported. Additional management of the patients is at the discretion of the attending physicians. Thus, all trial participants, care providers, investigators and outcome assessors remain blinded to the intervention until completion of the trial. If a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction (SUSAR) is found, the sponsor has the ability to unblind the patient&#x02019;s intervention allocation through the physician responsible for the trial website, who is otherwise detached from the trial.</p><sec id="Sec6"><title>Monitoring of compliance</title><p>Infusion of study drug &#x02018;A&#x02019; or &#x02018;B&#x02019; will be recorded along with time of initiation of the study drug infusion.

Reasons for not infusing the study drug per protocol and any dose reduction outside of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;minutes from the scheduled time point are registered.

Since no difference in feasibility is expected and the trial is designed as a pilot study, we have chosen to power this study according to differences in the NSE AUC. A difference of 20&#x000a0;% is defined as the minimal clinically relevant difference. Previous studies have found a value of approximately 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml (25&#x02013;75&#x000a0;% CI 10&#x02013;45) at 72&#x000a0;hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. We expect a mean AUC at 72&#x000a0;hours of 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml*day, assuming an SD of 30&#x000a0;% of the mean AUC. The &#x003b1; is set at 0.025 (co-primary endpoint), which gives a power of 90&#x000a0;% if 50 patients are included in both groups. A 10&#x000a0;% loss of final measurement is expected (patients expiring before full 72&#x000a0;hours).

This makes adjudication of the AEs, SAEs and SUSARs challenging. Thus, the principal investigator or delegated investigator evaluates and adjudicates AEs on a day-to-day basis and reports to relevant authorities according to Danish legislation. In the event of a suspected SUSAR, the digital algorithm can unblind the treatment allocation of a single patient through the trial website. If this becomes necessary, it will be reported along with the results of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Surrogate endpoints</title><p>Secondly, our primary endpoint defined as area under the NSE-curve at 72&#x000a0;hours is a surrogate marker for poor neurological outcome and death. The surrogate marker is used instead of a hard endpoint in order to power this pilot study adequately. Previously, NSE has been shown to be a solid marker for poor outcome after OHCA in patients undergoing TTM, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, our surrogate endpoint reflects the clinically relevant question of whether Exenatide has neuroprotective effects in our population.</p><p>In conclusion, this article describes the design and planned analysis used in the GLP-1 trial for the first publication of the primary outcomes.
