One-lung ventilation (OLV) decreases arterial oxygenation; thus oxygen delivery to the brain can be decreased. In this study, we compared phenylephrine and dopamine with respect to maintaining cerebral oxygenation during OLV in major thoracic surgery.</p><p>Sixty-three patients undergoing lobectomies were randomly assigned to the dopamine (D) or phenylephrine (P) group. The patients&#x02019; mean arterial pressure was maintained within 20% of baseline by a continuous infusion of dopamine or phenylephrine. Maintenance fluid was kept at 5&#x0200a;mL/kg/h. The depth of anesthesia was maintained with desflurane 1MAC and remifentanil infusion under bispectral index guidance. Regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO<sub>2</sub>) and hemodynamic variables were recorded using near-infrared spectroscopy and esophageal cardiac Doppler.</p><p>The rScO<sub>2</sub> was higher in the D group than the P group during OLV (OLV 60&#x0200a;min: 71&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;6% vs 63&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;12%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03).

Therefore, restriction of fluid administration and treatment of hypotension, which is not caused by major hemorrhage, with vasoactive agents, could be a basic concept in thoracic anesthesia.</p><p>Patients undergoing lung resection surgery usually receive one-lung ventilation (OLV). During OLV, a significant decrease in cerebral oxygenation can occur.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Because the goal of hemodynamic optimization is to improve oxygen delivery to major organs, understanding how the administration of vasoactive agents affects cerebral perfusion and oxygenation, the most important organ in the body, would be of major clinical relevance, especially during OLV.</p><p>However, there are no data comparing vasoactive drugs in terms of maintaining cerebral oxygenation during thoracic surgery. Therefore, we compared 2 commonly used agents, phenylephrine and dopamine, continuous infusion with respect to maintaining regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO<sub>2</sub>) during OLV in major thoracic surgery.</p><p>Our hypothesis is that dopamine continuous infusion provides higher rScO<sub>2</sub> during OLV than phenylephrine continuous infusion.</p><p>The primary aim of our study was to investigate the effects of phenylephrine and dopamine continuous infusion on rScO<sub>2</sub> during OLV. As secondary outcome, we identified the hemodynamic variables which are responsible for the changes in rScO<sub>2</sub> in major thoracic surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a parallel-design, 1:1 allocation, randomized, double-blind (participants, assessors of outcomes) controlled study. The ClinicalTrials.gov ID is NCT02009007.</p><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>After approval by the Institutional Review Board of Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Republic of Korea, 63 patients undergoing elective thoracic surgery for lung cancer in a tertiary care academic center, from January 2013 to December 2013, were recruited, and written informed consent was obtained from each patient. Eligibility criteria were: age &#x0003e;18 years, elective lobectomy or bilobectomy, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I&#x02013;III, and presenting with at least a 20% decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) during anesthesia. Exclusion criteria were: forced expiratory volume in 1&#x0200a;second &#x0003c;60% of predicted values, cerebrovascular disease, poorly controlled hypertension (systolic arterial pressure &#x02265;160&#x0200a;mm Hg), poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (blood glucose &#x02265;200&#x0200a;mg/dL), diuretics or antidepressant use before operation, and renal insufficiency (creatinine &#x0003e;1.5&#x0200a;mg/dL). The patients were randomly assigned to the dopamine (D) or phenylephrine (P) groups using the computerized random number generator program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomizer.org/">www.randomizer.org</ext-link>). An enclosed assignment in a sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelope was allocated to each patient. This envelope was opened only by 1 author (HJA) at the theatre, and the card inside determined whether the patient was in the D or P group. The anesthesiologists who maintained blood pressure within 20% of baseline with the allocated drug were neither involved in data collection nor in interpretation of test results. Patients were also blinded to the allocation group.</p></sec><sec><title>Anesthesia and Monitoring</title><p>After the patient's arrival in the operating theatre, a BIS monitor (Aspect Medical System, Norwood, MA) and 2 near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) probes (INVOS 5100C: Somanetics Corp., Troy, MI), 1 on each side of the forehead, were placed, in addition to the other routine monitors. After inducing anesthesia with fentanyl (1.5&#x02013;2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg), propofol (2&#x02013;3&#x0200a;mg/kg), and rocuronium (0.8&#x0200a;mg/kg), all patients were intubated with a double lumen endotracheal tube (Mallinckrodt, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) and maintained with balanced anesthesia using desflurance 1MAC and remifentanil (0.05&#x02013;0.2&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg/min). The depth of anesthesia was maintained similarly between BIS 40 and 55 in both groups. The remifentanil infusion rate was based on the patient's age, ASA physical status, and BIS monitoring. A radial arterial catheter and an esophageal Doppler probe (CardioQ, Deltex Medical, UK) were placed after tracheal intubation.</p><p>Baseline MAP was a value recorded when the patients arrived to the operating room and were stabilized for 10&#x0200a;minutes. The drug was started when the MAP decreased more than 20% of baseline after anesthesia. Dopamine was started at 5&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg/min and phenylephrine at 1&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g/kg/min, and the infusion was adjusted for MAP to stay within 20% of baseline. SpO<sub>2</sub> was maintained above 94% by adjustment of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and FiO<sub>2</sub> during OLV.</p><p>The cerebral rScO<sub>2</sub> was monitored by NIRS (INVOS 5100C: Somanetics Corp., Troy, MI) with optodes placed to the forehead above the frontal sinuses. INVOS 5100C employs a dual-detector system to subtract a shallow light path from a deep light path, allowing the derivation of the average oxyhemoglobin saturation in a volume of tissue about 2.5 to 3.0&#x0200a;cm below the skin. The device displays an approximation of venous-weighted hemoglobin saturation in tissue deep to the sensor.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Mean values of right and left optodes were analyzed.</p><p>Cardiac output (CO) and stroke volume (SV) were monitored using an esophageal Doppler (CardioQ, Deltex Medical, UK). The esophageal Doppler measures blood flow velocity in the descending aorta. The aortic diameter is obtained from a built-in nomogram. SV is obtained by multiplying the blood flow distance and the cross-sectional area of the aorta.</p><p>Arterial blood gas was analyzed at baseline, 15&#x0200a;minutes after induction (TLVB), 30 and 60&#x0200a;minutes after OLV (OLV30, OLV60), and 15&#x0200a;minutes after the restart of two-lung ventilation (TLVA). All hemodynamic and rScO<sub>2</sub> data were retrieved from the monitor after each case by the primary investigator who was not involved in anesthesia. The values of baseline, TLVB, OLV30, OLV60, and TLVA were recorded.</p><p>An intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer solution was maintained at 5&#x0200a;mL/kg/h throughout anesthesia. Blood loss was replaced by the same amount of hydroxyethyl starches. Packed red blood cell was transfused if the hemoglobin concentration fell below 8&#x0200a;g/dL. Pressure-controlled ventilation was used with a tidal volume of 6&#x0200a;mL/kg of predicted body weight and a ventilatory frequency of 8 to 12&#x0200a;bpm, with a target EtCO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 45&#x0200a;mm Hg. The arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation was monitored by a finger pulse oximeter (Nellcor, Covidien, Mansfield, MA).</p></sec><sec><title>Postoperative Complications and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) Stay</title><p>Postoperative complications within 48&#x0200a;hours, the duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU stay were compared between the 2 groups. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was measured by acute kidney injury network (AKIN) score. Postoperative delirium was monitored by the confusion assessment method in intensive care unit (CAM-ICU). Trained ICU nurses who were unaware of the study allocation assessed delirium every hour until ICU discharge.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Since no previous study exists, we referred a bolus study of similar vasoactives for sample size calculation, in which the mean difference of rScO<sub>2</sub> was 10% between bolus phenylephrine and bolus ephedrine (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05).<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> We regarded 15% as a clinically meaningful difference as a continuous infusion study. We conducted a pilot study to obtain standard deviations (SDs) of continuous infusions under OLV which were &#x000b1;7% and &#x000b1;9% in the D and P groups, respectively (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;5, each group). We used 15% SDs for both groups as a more conservative approach. As a result, a sample size of 25 in each group was required with alpha level 0.05 and statistical power 80%. Considering a dropout rate of 20%, we chose a sample size of 30 per group. Sample size calculation was conducted by the software G&#x02217;Power 3.1.9.2.</p><p>The mixed-effect model was used to conduct within-group comparison across different time points. Between-group comparison was done at each time point by Student <italic>t</italic> test or Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, as appropriate. Bonferroni correction was used to adjust multiple comparisons. Normality test was done by Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk test. Relationships between independent variables and rScO<sub>2</sub> were tested using Pearson correlation analysis.</p><p>Results presented as mean&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;SD for data normally distributed, and median (interquartile range [IQR]) for data not normally distributed and a value of <italic>P</italic> value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data were analyzed by the software program SAS 9.4 (SAS institute, Inc., Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Three patients refused enrollment.

Age, hemoglobin concentration, and CO were correlated with rScO<sub>2.</sub></p><p>The cerebral blood flow (CBF) decreases passively if the MAP falls below the lower limit of cerebral autoregulation, exposing the patient to possible cerebral hypoperfusion and ultimately, a reduction in rScO<sub>2</sub>. Immediate reductions in CBF and rScO<sub>2</sub> have been reported when the MAP drops below 80&#x0200a;mm Hg.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In our study, the MAP was higher in the P group than in the D group during OLV. However, the mean rScO<sub>2</sub> was significantly lower in the P group than in the D group, and the difference of rScO<sub>2</sub> between the 2 groups increased as OLV continued.</p><p>Only 3 studies<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> have been published for the comparison of vasoactive drugs in relation to rScO<sub>2</sub>. In 1 study, patients received phenylephrine (100&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g intravenous [iv]) or ephedrine (10&#x0200a;mg iv) to restore MAP after anesthesia induction and rScO<sub>2</sub> was monitored by INVOS cerebral oximeter.

The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 to 79&#x0200a;mm Hg; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.001) and preserved rScO<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> Another study was a 2-treatment cross-over trial using Oxiplex TS cerebral oximeter; 1 bolus dose of phenylephrine (100&#x02013;200&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g iv) and 1 bolus dose of ephedrine (5&#x02013;20&#x0200a;mg iv). The rScO<sub>2</sub> was significantly decreased after phenylephrine treatment (&#x02212;3.2%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.01), but rScO<sub>2</sub> was preserved after ephedrine treatment (+0.04%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;0.05).<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> In a comparison study between phenylephrine and norepinephrine using FORE-SIGHT cerebral oximeter, phenylephrine and norepinephrine caused an equivalent increase in MAP [&#x00394;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13 [8&#x02013;22] and &#x00394;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13 (9&#x02013;19)&#x0200a;mm Hg, respectively), and a similar decrease in cardiac index (both &#x00394;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;0.2&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;0.3&#x0200a;L/min/m<sup>2</sup>) and rScO<sub>2</sub> [&#x00394;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;4 [&#x02212;7 to &#x02212;2]% and &#x00394;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;&#x02212;4 [&#x02212;5 to &#x02212;1)%, respectively).<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup></p><p>Phenylephrine and dopamine act in different mechanisms. Phenylephrine mainly increases vasomotor tone and dopamine mainly increases myocardial contractility and heart rate (HR). Vasoactive amines do not cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier; therefore direct action of either phenylephrine or dopamine on cerebral vessels would be negligible.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Therefore, we speculate that the administration of phenylephrine may have reduced CO. Reduced CO by phenylephrine has been documented in both animals and humans.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In animal experiments, phenylephrine increased arterial pressure by 30%, but decreased CO by 30%, ejection fraction by 36%, and SV by 25%.<sup><xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The CO, SV, and HR decreased significantly after phenylephrine treatment in anesthesia-induced hypotensive patients, whereas ephedrine preserved CO and SV, and increased HR.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Phenylephrine leads to increased vagal tone as demonstrated by slowed HR, and this can also result in decrease in CO. A significant linear relationship was shown between CO and the middle cerebral artery mean flow velocity.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Second, phenylephrine may constrict cerebral vessels indirectly through reflexive sympathetic nerve activation. Cerebral arteries are innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers abundantly,<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>originating from the superior cervical ganglion.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Activity of sympathetic nerves on cerebral vessels increases promptly after a phenylephrine-induced rapid increase in arterial pressure.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In anesthetized patients, the phenylephrine bolus injection increased the MAP by 20% to 30% and caused a significant decrease in CBF.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>In the current study, age, hemoglobin (Hb) concentration, and CO, but not MAP, were identified as the variables associated with rScO<sub>2</sub>. Age and Hb concentration were not different between the D and P groups. Therefore, the distinctive effect of phenylephrine and dopamine on rScO<sub>2</sub> may be mainly explained by their different impacts on CO. In the study by Meng et al, which compared phenylephrine and ephedrine boluses,<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> CO was identified to have the most significant association with rScO<sub>2</sub>, and after taking CO into consideration, the other physiological variables were not significantly associated with rScO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, it seems that higher CO is the key factor of higher rScO<sub>2</sub> shown in the D group, compared with the P group. Other variables which can possibly influence rScO<sub>2</sub> such as FiO<sub>2</sub>, SpO<sub>2</sub>, PaO<sub>2</sub>, PaCO<sub>2</sub>, pH, temperature, and depth of anesthesia, were controlled during OLV in this study, and there were no differences between the groups.</p><p>Low rScO<sub>2</sub> measured by NIRS was associated with an increase of neurological damage, cognitive impairment, or postoperative complications during cardiac and thoracic surgery.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> However, there is no proven cut-off value of rScO<sub>2</sub> below which cerebral ischemia may occur because there is substantial inter and intrapatient variability in rScO<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> In our study, incidence of delirium defined by CAM-ICU was not different between the 2 groups, and there were no postoperative cerebrovascular incidents. Urine output was higher in the D group during operation, but the incidence of AKI was not different between the 2 groups. Incidence of new-onset arrhythmia or ICU stay was not different either. However, our study was not powered for complications. Further studies focused on clinical outcomes are required.</p><p>For limitation, this study was a monocentric approach of hemodynamic control to compare inotrope and vasopressor; therefore, it does not exactly reflect clinical practice which employs multimodal approach for hemodynamic control. Inotropes including dopamine have several side effects, such as increasing oxygen consumption of the heart muscle and leading to tachycardia, arrhythmia, and a higher risk for cardiac events.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Therefore, risk&#x02013;benefit balance should be taken into consideration, and individualized approach is required for each patient.</p><p>Secondly, we did not measure CBF directly, but rather oxygenation of the brain. Usually, changes in rScO<sub>2</sub> parallel those in middle cerebral artery flow velocity (MCAV).<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> An important role of CBF is to provide adequate oxygenation for the brain; therefore monitoring rScO<sub>2</sub> instead of middle cerebral artery flow may be more relevant.</p><p>Thirdly, we measured CO using an esophageal Doppler. Vasoactive drugs could affect the diameter of the aorta,<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> thus making esophageal Doppler measurement less accurate. However, esophageal Doppler is less invasive than pulmonary artery catheter and more accurate than most of the noninvasive CO monitors under the influence of vasopressors.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Fourthly, phenylephrine may constrict scalp vessels and result in the reduction of rScO<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> INVOS 5100C is supposed to measure rScO<sub>2</sub> of 2.5 to 3.0&#x0200a;cm below the skin. However, the effect of scalp vessel constriction cannot be absolutely ruled out.</p><p>Final limitation is the lack of a control group. However, a control group that would not receive any treatment when blood pressure decreases was considered unethical. In previous reports, rScO<sub>2</sub> dropped significantly when no drug intervention was given to treat hypotension during OLV.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>In summary, cerebral oxygenation decreases after phenylephrine administration, but is maintained after dopamine continuous infusion in thoracic surgery patients undergoing OLV. The higher CO shown with the dopamine infusion may be beneficial in terms of maintaining cerebral oxygenation during OLV. We suggest that the increase in MAP is not a prerequisite to secure cerebral oxygenation, and CO should be increased to keep the optimum range of cerebral oxygenation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Authors&#x02019; contributions: HA contributed substantially to conception and design, acquisition of data, and analysis and interpretation of data.
