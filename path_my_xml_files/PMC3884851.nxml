<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> However, direct evidence implicating PGP in COPD pathogenesis in humans is lacking. In the limited number of sputum samples available to us due to the design of the Macrolide trial, we demonstrate that PGP is reduced in the airways of patients with COPD taking azithromycin, particularly with longer duration of therapy and is accompanied by reduced neutrophil burden, measured as sputum myeloperoxidase. Reduction in sputum PGP is accompanied by a positive clinical response to azithromycin (reduced exacerbation frequency). Our subgroup had a similar therapeutic response to that seen in the parent trial, suggesting that our findings could be generalised to the entire Macrolide group.</p><p>Although seen with only a few specimens, sputum PGP was strikingly elevated as long as 35&#x02005;days before the onset of symptoms of an acute exacerbation of COPD and briefly afterwards. It declined sharply with successful treatment and resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013004140F3">figure 3</xref>). Seemungal <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> described a 7-days prodrome where respiratory symptoms worsened before the onset of an exacerbation but failed to predict exacerbations with spirometry. Our data suggest that airway inflammation may worsen weeks in advance of this and that PGP may predict the onset of an exacerbation long enough before symptoms appear to permit early intervention. Although many biomarkers of COPD have been described, to our knowledge, none has been shown to herald exacerbations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref> The persistence of elevated sputum PGP long after exacerbations in some individuals may contribute to continuing neutrophilic airway inflammation and promote the &#x02018;frequent exacerbator&#x02019; phenotype.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19 R20 R21">19&#x02013;21</xref></p><p>We cannot determine from our data whether the reduction in exacerbations due to azithromycin was secondary to reduced sputum PGP or whether the reduction in sputum PGP was due to fewer exacerbations in azithromycin-treated participants. Answering this question definitively would require a larger, longitudinal study of PGP in patients with COPD. Nevertheless, these data support the idea that PGP plays a significant role in COPD pathogenesis, particularly exacerbations, and may provide important clues as to the mechanism of azithromycin's anti-inflammatory properties. PGP predicted a positive response to azithromycin within 6&#x02005;months of starting therapy and was superior in this respect to other biomarkers studied as part of the Macrolide trial.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref></p><p>We are uncertain as to the mechanism of PGP reduction by azithromycin. Macrolide antibiotics have been reported to have numerous anti-inflammatory properties, including inhibiting MMP activity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> As MMP-8 and MMP-9 are essential to extracellular PGP generation from collagen by neutrophils,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> this would provide an attractive potential mechanism. However, we could find no difference in sputum MMP-9 activity between treatment groups. We did not examine other MMPs which we have previously implicated in PGP generation, such as MMP-1 and MMP-8.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref> We measured PGP generation ex vivo from collagen by sputum but could find no difference between treatment groups. Subsequent to the current study, we have identified a neutrophil-derived enzyme, LTA<sub>4</sub>H, which generates leukotriene B<sub>4</sub> and rapidly degrades PGP.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> We have recently found that LTA<sub>4</sub>H is markedly elevated in COPD sputum compared to controls.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> Breakdown of PGP by LTA<sub>4</sub>H in our sputum samples could have confounded the PGP generation assay. As PGP is derived from neutrophil activity, reduced sputum PGP might reflect reduced recruitment of neutrophils to the airways due to other effects of azithromycin. The decline in sputum PGP was greater than the decline in myeloperoxidase, suggesting that PGP may have other effects in COPD aside from recruiting neutrophils. Addressing these questions was outside the scope of this study.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of our study support the idea that PGP plays an important role in COPD pathogenesis and provide clues as to the anti-inflammatory mechanism of azithromycin. PGP shows promise as a predictor of acute exacerbations and may serve as a useful biomarker for response to therapy in future studies of COPD and other chronic, neutrophilic lung diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e177" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004140.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e178" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-004140.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute chronic obstructive pulmonary disease clinical research network for their assistance in providing sputum samples and clinical data for this study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> PJO designed the study, acquired and interpreted the data and drafted the manuscript.
