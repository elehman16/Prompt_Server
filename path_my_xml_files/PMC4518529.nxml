Recent studies found that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A&#x003b2; fluctuates over time, including as a diurnal pattern, and increases in absolute concentration with serial collection. It is currently unknown what effect differences in CSF collection methodology have on A&#x003b2; variability.

Data from all sponsors was converted to percent of the mean for A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 for comparison.

In contrast, A&#x003b2; concentrations from CSF samples collected at two time points by lumbar puncture showed no significant differences.

Averaging A&#x003b2; concentrations at each time point is recommended to minimize the effect of individual variability. Indwelling lumbar catheters are an invaluable research tool for following changes in CSF A&#x003b2; over 24-48 hours, but factors affecting A&#x003b2; concentration such as linear rise and diurnal variation need to be accounted for in planning study designs.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13195-015-0136-z) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by degeneration of neurons and their synapses leading to progressive cognitive impairment. In the United States, AD is estimated to be the third leading cause of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and to have a financial burden on society comparable with heart disease and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The hallmark of AD at the microscopic level is an overabundance in the brain of extracellular plaques formed by abnormally folded amyloid-beta (A&#x003b2;) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of tau. The amyloid hypothesis proposes that the deposition of A&#x003b2; in the brain is a key first step in AD pathogenesis that precedes the onset of clinical symptoms by many years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, A&#x003b2; has been investigated both as a diagnostic biomarker for amyloid deposition, measured by imaging (e.g. positron emission tomography imaging with Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB-PET)) or A&#x003b2;42 concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and as a potential therapeutic target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies measured A&#x003b2; concentrations before and after amyloid deposition to understand potential changes in A&#x003b2; metabolism during AD pathogenesis. In these studies, CSF was collected from individuals infrequently via lumbar puncture, generally limited to the beginning and the end of the study. The importance of understanding A&#x003b2; metabolism for pharmacologic modeling during trials of investigational compounds led to clinical studies collecting CSF samples repeatedly over 24&#x02013;48 hours via an indwelling lumbar catheter. A number of these studies have demonstrated considerable intra-subject variability in the levels of CSF A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and have also shown a diurnal fluctuation in CSF A&#x003b2; that follows the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This diurnal oscillation has also been noted in plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The frequency and amount of CSF collected vary greatly in studies employing indwelling catheters. Differences in CSF collection methods could be a factor contributing to the observed variability of A&#x003b2; levels. For instance, a recent study found that CSF sampling frequencies and/or sampling volume contributes to intra-subject variability in CSF A&#x003b2; levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Further, sampling hourly via a lumbar catheter has been reported to result in a progressive linear rise in A&#x003b2; concentrations. The cause of the A&#x003b2; linear rise is unknown but is suspected to be due to changes in CSF flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Understanding how different collection methodologies affect the stability of CSF A&#x003b2; levels over time is of paramount importance for the design of clinical trials, where these biomarkers would be utilized to study pharmacodynamic activity, and ultimately may determine whether A&#x003b2; has utility in a diagnostic fashion. Several investigational compounds that target A&#x003b2; are currently in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In many cases, particularly in phase I and early phase II trials, the levels of A&#x003b2; in CSF are monitored to assess target engagement. Both lumbar punctures and lumbar catheters are used during clinical trials to collect CSF. For instance, both plasma and CSF A&#x003b2; levels were monitored in volunteers following treatment with a gamma-secretase inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In these studies, the levels of plasma A&#x003b2; were reduced in a dose-responsive manner, but no significant decreases were observed in the levels of CSF A&#x003b2;. In addition, a recent study examined the levels of CSF A&#x003b2; in AD subjects receiving bapinuzimab, an antibody that targets A&#x003b2;. No changes in the levels of CSF A&#x003b2; from baseline were observed following treatment, although there was a decrease in the levels of CSF tau [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In contrast, subjects treated with solanezumab, a selective antibody that targets soluble A&#x003b2;, demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in total CSF levels of A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This increase may be due to downstream effects on A&#x003b2; plaque dissolution. All of these studies collected CSF via lumbar puncture. Lumbar catheters have also been used for serial CSF sampling, such as when tracking changes in A&#x003b2; kinetics (i.e. production and clearance) using stable isotope labeling kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. As more therapies targeting A&#x003b2; advance into clinical trials, it is expected that the use of A&#x003b2; and other CSF biomarkers will increase substantially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>To identify the most relevant factors that may contribute to intra-subject variability in CSF A&#x003b2; levels, and as part of the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) consortia, we shared data from multiple clinical studies on CSF A&#x003b2; measurements from placebo or untreated subjects and conducted a meta-analysis to identify factors that may result in changes in CSF A&#x003b2; levels. The combined dataset is the largest collection of participants with serial CSF sampling via a lumbar catheter (<italic>n</italic> = 178). Our results suggest that the slope of the linear rise in CSF A&#x003b2; levels is dependent on the sampling frequency, but does not affect the hourly variability manifesting as an A&#x003b2; diurnal pattern. The results from this study will help guide clinical trial design, and provide insight into the relative stability of proteins associated with AD in CSF.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Each of the following pharmaceutical research companies or academic research centers contributed the CSF results for A&#x003b2; isoform x-40 and x-42 concentrations from assays developed commercially or within the research centers: Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS, New York, NY, USA), AbbVie Inc.

QCs from A&#x003b2;42 were therefore only evaluated within run and accepted when the within-run CV was &#x0003c;20 %. All samples for a subject were analyzed in the same plate or on the same day to minimize the variability of A&#x003b2;42 assessments.

All subjects were screened to be in good general health and without neurologic disease. A lumbar catheter was placed immediately before CSF sample collection started. The subjects were encouraged to stay in bed, and were allowed free choice of when to sleep throughout the study. Each study was conducted on a different group of subjects and each with a different CSF sampling procedure. There were no subject drop-outs or refusals. In Study A1, six healthy young men (25&#x02013;47 years old) participated, and 5 ml CSF and 4 ml blood were collected from each subject at 0 (6:00 a.m.), 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, and 26 hours. In Study A2, five healthy older men, two healthy older women (61&#x02013;74 years old), and 15 subjects diagnosed with AD (58&#x02013;83 years old) participated. Seven milliliters of CSF and 10 ml blood were collected from each subject at 0 (5:30 a.m.), 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours. In Study A3, eight healthy young men (24&#x02013;45 years old) participated and were divided into two groups.

Cosinor analysis was used to compare circadian patterns of CSF A&#x003b2; dynamics from all of the studies with serial CSF sampling. The sleep&#x02013;wake cycle was not monitored in these participants and could not be incorporated into the analysis. There were two sponsors with a large number of participants who underwent similar clinical trial designs in terms of frequency of CSF draws. The seven Merck studies (M1&#x02013;M7) involved 38 participants (mean age 44.2 years, SD 11.2). The second study from Washington University included 57 subjects (mean age 60.7 years, SD 19). In both studies, CSF draws were taken approximately every 1&#x02013;2 hours for 24&#x02013;36 hours.

The slope of the linear rise is also similar for both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42. The amplitude of the Merck studies is higher than that seen in the Washington University data, a difference possibly attributable to an overall younger population. Finally, the amplitude peaks occurred at approximately 20:00&#x02013;21:00 p.m. in both studies and for both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Diurnal oscillation of A&#x003b2; peptides in participants from two different study cohorts.

Despite variability in study design, numbers of participants, and sampling at each time point, studies from all sponsors showed a cosine fit for A&#x003b2;40 concentrations and all but AbbVie studies showed a cosine fit for A&#x003b2;42 concentrations. Peak amplitude showed greater variability in these three studies and occurred at different times of day, although the time was the same for A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 within each study sponsor. AbbVie studies had similar peak times for both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 compared with the Merck and Washington University studies (21:00&#x02013;22:00 p.m.). Both the Lilly and BMS studies had earlier peak times. For the Lilly studies, this may be due to an overall earlier start time: the Lilly studies began CSF collection as early as 02:00 a.m. and had a peak time of 16:00 p.m. for both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42. An earlier start time, however, does not account for the BMS studies that began CSF collection at 06:00 a.m. and had a peak time of 13:00&#x02013;14:00 p.m. Differences in participant sleep&#x02013;wake activity are unknown for all studies; therefore we cannot account for changes in sleep&#x02013;wake patterns between studies that may correlate with differences in peak times. BMS was found to have the highest amplitude and slope for A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42, but also had the youngest participants (mean age 31.6 years, SD 6.5) compared with Merck, Washington University, AbbVie (mean age 55.8 years, SD 17.8), or Lilly (mean age 42.4 years, SD 14.3) studies.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Diurnal oscillation of A&#x003b2; peptides in participants from three different study cohorts.

We analyzed the slope of the A&#x003b2; increase over the first 6 hours relative to the number of CSF draws made during that time period. Since the studies differed in duration, only the first 6 hours were used in the analysis. The increase appeared to be the most dramatic during this time period. Factors such as age group, gender, ethnicity, frequency of draws, sponsor, and time were analyzed. For this analysis, subjects were divided into three age groups defined as &#x0201c;young&#x0201d; (&#x0003c;30 years old), &#x0201c;medium&#x0201d; (between the ages of 30 and 50), and &#x0201c;old&#x0201d; (50 years and older). Similarly, the number of draws within the first 6 hours were also categorized into three levels (groups 1, 2 and 3): group 1 had three draws or less in the first 6 hours, group 2 had greater than three but less than seven draws in the first 6 hours, and group 3 subjects had seven draws or more within the first 6 hours.</p><p>Of these factors, only the frequency of the CSF draw, time, and the interaction of draw frequency and time were significant (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The repeated-measures analysis (or linear mixed model), described in Materials and methods, showed that the interaction effects of the number of draws relative to time were significant for both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42. We further obtained the estimates of the slope of time within each draw group. All of the estimates were positively associated with the frequency of CSF draws. Further analysis revealed that the slope over time for draw groups 3 differed significantly from zero (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), indicating that more frequent CSF draws resulted in a larger slope. Several factors were not known for the majority of the studies, most importantly amyloid status and sleep parameters that may affect the slope of the linear rise.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>ANOVA of fixed effects for industry in-dwelling catheter studies for A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="2">A&#x003b2;40</th><th colspan="2">A&#x003b2;42</th></tr><tr><th>Effect</th><th>

Occasionally, individuals exhibited notable shifts from baseline (increase or decrease); however, the majority of subjects exhibited stable results. Within individual studies, lumbar punctures were performed at approximately the same time of day.

While a tremendous amount of inter-individual variability existed, a general pattern of rapidly increasing concentrations of A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 in the first 12 hours of a study was found across all subjects in all indwelling lumbar catheter studies; in some cases, A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 reached levels as high as 200 % from the initial baseline draw. In most of the subjects, the slope of the linear rise decreased after the first 24 hours, but the levels did not return to baseline by 24 hours. Our results suggest that the use of indwelling catheters to collect multiple CSF samples results in an upward drift in the levels of both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 relative to the initial draw. In contrast, the levels of A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 did not change significantly from baseline to second draw when samples were taken by lumbar puncture performed at a similar time of the day 2 weeks apart.</p><p>The tremendous inter-subject variability of A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 seen over time could influence the results of AD prevention studies that target A&#x003b2;. Averaging A&#x003b2; concentrations at each time point is recommended to minimize the effect of individual variability and distinguish effects between experimental groups. We further recommend managing this variability by calculating the area under the curve using pharmacokinetic&#x02013;pharmacodynamic models. For example, a previous study of a gamma-secretase inhibitor was able to show relatively small effects on A&#x003b2; in CSF collected via indwelling lumbar catheters using this technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>A circadian rhythm is a cyclic oscillation intrinsic to many biologic processes, such as body temperature and hormone levels, and is typically studied using cosinor analysis to fit a cosine transformation with a 24-hour period. A&#x003b2; concentrations have been found to fluctuate over time in several studies collecting CSF via a lumbar catheter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Further, a previous study correlated fluctuating CSF A&#x003b2; levels to the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle (i.e. a diurnal pattern) in healthy young normal control subjects and older adults more than 60 years old with and without amyloid deposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In that study, younger controls demonstrated much higher amplitude of A&#x003b2; oscillation as compared with amyloid-positive or amyloid-negative older adults.</p><p>Despite heterogeneity in the frequency of CSF collection in this study, we found evidence in data from all sponsors for a diurnal pattern of both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42. The only exception was the AbbVie data for A&#x003b2;42 which showed a mesor-to-peak amplitude of 4.29 % with 95 % confidence intervals that do not cross zero (0.71&#x02013;7.87) suggesting a cosinor fit, but only a trend toward a difference with a straight line was noted (<italic>p</italic> = 0.06). This discrepancy is attributable to both the scatter of the data points in the first and last 6 hours of sampling due to CSF collection occurring at slightly different times of day across the AbbVie studies and a limited sampling time of 24 hours, the shortest period among all of the sponsors. Prior work analyzed a smaller group of subjects from the AbbVie studies (<italic>n</italic> = 21 compared with <italic>n</italic> = 36 in our analysis) and reported that intra-subject variability was related to sampling frequency and/or sampling volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. We suspect a diurnal oscillation was not seen in this prior work because each study was analyzed separately (<italic>n</italic> = 6&#x02013;8/study) and not as a larger pooled analysis.</p><p>Cosinor parameters, such as amplitude, differed across all studies. A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 showed similar oscillations within study sponsor, but not between all study sponsors. The peak-to-trough amplitude fluctuations of A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 varied between sponsors from approximately 8.52 to 14.02 % per 24 hours. The peak time of A&#x003b2; levels also varied between study sponsors. For example, both the Merck and Washington University datasets were found to have A&#x003b2; levels peak at roughly 13&#x02013;14 hours after the collection was started (which is equivalent to ~20:00&#x02013;21:00 p.m.). BMS, however, peaked earlier for both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 at approximately 8 hours after collection started (14:00 p.m.). In contrast, A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 peaked at approximately 14 hours after collection started in the Lilly studies (16:00 p.m.) and at approximately 16&#x02013;17 hours after collection started in the AbbVie studies (21:00&#x02013;22:00 p.m.).</p><p>These discrepancies in the amplitudes and peak time of CSF A&#x003b2; fluctuation are possibly due to differences in participant ages, sample collection schedules, analytic techniques used between sites, participant stress levels, participant amyloid status, and differences in sleep&#x02013;wake activity between participants in the different groups. Our findings suggest that the A&#x003b2; diurnal pattern is not a timekeeper that directly interacts with the circadian clock, but is dependent on human processes with a diurnal pattern&#x02014;such as changes in neuronal activity with the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]&#x02014;and may be modifiable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The timing and amount of participant sleep as well as light exposure were not monitored in these studies; therefore we cannot test our hypothesis that differences in sleep&#x02013;wake activity accounts for the inter-study difference in A&#x003b2; oscillation. However, the finding of an A&#x003b2; diurnal pattern for both A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 despite study heterogeneity and other confounders strongly suggests that this oscillation is due to an intrinsic human biological process rather than an artifact of experimental design.</p><p>Since the studies enrolled subjects of different demographics and different protocols were employed for CSF collection across the studies, statistical analysis was conducted to identify factors that were associated with the rise in A&#x003b2; levels. Factors such as age, gender, clinical sponsor, and frequency of CSF draws were all analyzed. In the industry-sponsored studies, where considerable variability existed in the CSF collection designs, the frequency of CSF draws was significantly associated with the A&#x003b2; rise. The results indicated that performing more than seven CSF draws in the first 6 hours of the study had a large effect on the rise in CSF A&#x003b2;, while the rise in CSF A&#x003b2; was largely not evident in studies that collected six or less draws in the first 6 hours. This finding is similar to previous reports from AbbVie that sampling frequency was a factor in the A&#x003b2; linear rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Several of the same studies sponsored by AbbVie are included in this analysis, but our study includes additional industry and academic sponsors and shows the same effect.</p><p>The A&#x003b2; linear rise is not a diurnal effect and is most probably a consequence of frequent CSF draws via an indwelling lumbar catheter leading to a shift in the rostrocaudal dynamics in CSF. A recent study showed that levels of A&#x003b2; were higher in CSF collected from the cisterna in patients suffering from trigeminal neuralgia relative to CSF from lumbar draws taken from patients suffering from tension-type headaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Potentially, frequent CSF draws from the lumbar region could result in an increase in the flow of CSF from the cisterna to the lumbar region, where A&#x003b2; levels may be higher. The volume of CSF collected may also be involved, although we could not address this question because all but one study (Study M3, <italic>n</italic> = 6; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) collected 6&#x02013;8 ml/draw. Factors that affect the concentration of A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 may also be involved in the linear rise. For instance, previous work has shown attenuation in the linear rise of A&#x003b2;42 in amyloid-positive individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Studies that involve different CSF collection protocols and labeling of CSF A&#x003b2; may help to address this question [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p><p>The studies conducted at Washington University in St Louis enrolled subjects in different age groups. In these studies, there was a trend towards age being a significant factor for the rise in CSF A&#x003b2; levels, with younger subjects showing significantly higher increases relative to older subjects for A&#x003b2;42. Previous studies examining age and the rise in CSF A&#x003b2; levels did not show an effect in amyloid-negative subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, in that study, the rise in A&#x003b2; was calculated over a 24-hour period, rather than the first 6 hours. In addition, subjects that were amyloid-positive did display smaller increases in CSF A&#x003b2; levels over time.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Implications for future clinical trial design</title><p>The issue concerning whether or not significant fluctuations in CSF A&#x003b2; concentrations occur owing to CSF collection methodology is of paramount importance for the design of clinical trials where these biomarkers would be utilized to study pharmacodynamic activity, and ultimately may determine whether these biomarkers have utility in a diagnostic fashion. Further, the use of a filter system in the sampling setup employed by RUMC illustrates that the selection of sampling materials and the configuration of those materials on the recovery of A&#x003b2; species from CSF pulled through catheter systems needs to be carefully evaluated. Overall, our analysis has identified that frequency of CSF draws and age are factors that contribute to the linear rise in A&#x003b2; levels. The A&#x003b2; diurnal pattern, in contrast, is suggested to be an intrinsic process that occurs independent of CSF collection methodology. These findings are important for the design of studies of A&#x003b2;. For instance, a recent trial investigated whether sleep deprivation resulted in an increase in CSF A&#x003b2; concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The study did show an increase in the A&#x003b2;42 concentration in the sleep-deprived group compared with the normal sleep control group, but A&#x003b2;40 did not show the same pattern as A&#x003b2;42. This is in contrast to our results that show A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42 oscillating together. The sleep-deprived group had an additional four CSF collection time points between hours 5 and 13 that complicate the study interpretation because differences in CSF collection may account for the rise in CSF A&#x003b2;42 concentration and discordance with A&#x003b2;40, although additional analyses of total protein showed that there was no effect of the differential sampling on CSF protein concentration between the two groups.</p><p>From our analysis, it is recommended that the frequency of CSF draws should kept to no more than 1/hour with a volume of 6&#x02013;8 ml in order to minimize changes in CSF A&#x003b2; with frequent draws, particularly in the first 6 hours of collection; also, it is critical that a standard draw frequency be utilized across all study groups. Our data are not sufficient to determine whether these are the optimal CSF draw volume and frequency to control for the linear rise. Further, the linear rise needs to be accounted for during analysis of A&#x003b2; levels in CSF collected by indwelling lumbar catheters either by fitting both a cosine function and linear rise simultaneously as we have done, or by subtracting out the linear rise before cosinor analysis as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Indwelling lumbar catheters are an invaluable research tool for following changes in CSF A&#x003b2; over 24&#x02013;48 hours, but factors affecting A&#x003b2; concentration such as linear rise and diurnal variation need to be accounted for in planning study designs.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec30"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13195_2015_136_MOESM1_ESM.pptx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Figure S1.</label><caption><p>Shows plots of cosinor analysis of data from all sponsors as in Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> with standard error of the mean intervals shown.</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>A&#x003b2;</term><def><p>Amyloid-beta</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AD</term><def><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ADNI</term><def><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMS</term><def><p>Bristol-Myers Squibb</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSF</term><def><p>Cerebrospinal fluid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV</term><def><p>Coefficient of variation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA</term><def><p>Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPLC</term><def><p>High-performance liquid chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p>Mini-Mental State Examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PET</term><def><p>Positron emission tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PiB</term><def><p>Pittsburgh Compound B</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QC</term><def><p>Quality control check</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RUMC</term><def><p>Radboud University Medical Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p>Brendan P.

The primary goal of ADNI has been to test whether serial MRI, PET, other biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD. Determination of sensitive and specific markers of very early AD progression is intended to aid researchers and clinicians to develop new treatments and monitor their effectiveness, as well as lessen the time and cost of clinical trials.
