Metformin and linagliptin used in combination have been shown to successfully reduce HbA1c levels, with greater reductions compared with monotherapy than with either drug alone. As predicted from the safety profiles of the individual drugs, the combination was also well tolerated, and not associated with weight gain.</p></sec><sec><title>What's new</title><p>In this 1-year extension study, the combination of linagliptin and metformin continued to be well tolerated, with low rates of hypoglycaemia, and reductions in HbA1c were maintained. This suggests that the initial combination of linagliptin and metformin will provide a useful treatment option, which could be considered in patients for whom metformin monotherapy alone is unlikely to achieve treatment targets.</p></sec></boxed-text></p><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>For patients with type 2 diabetes, control of hyperglycaemia is central to reducing the risk of long-term complications of the disease <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. The consensus of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes is that a glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) target of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;7.0% is reasonable for most patients <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. To achieve this target, all except the most motivated patients will need pharmacotherapy in addition to lifestyle changes <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. However, clinical studies have shown that treatment with monotherapy does not achieve stable glucose control over time <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, suggesting patients could benefit from early treatment with combination therapy.</p><p>The combination of metformin with a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor appears to provide a rational candidate for combination therapy, as the two agents have complementary mechanisms of action. Metformin reduces hepatic glucose production and increases insulin sensitivity, while DPP-4 inhibitors stimulate insulin secretion by inhibiting the rapid breakdown of the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Metformin also stimulates GLP-1 secretion from the gut, providing further synergistic effects with DPP-4 inhibitors <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. In addition, metformin and DPP-4 inhibitors both have the advantages of being weight-neutral and associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia, as well as the convenience of oral administration <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>The DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin has been available since 2011 for use in patients with type 2 diabetes either as monotherapy or in combination with other commonly used antidiabetes agents. Its use as initial combination with metformin has been assessed in a 6-month randomised, placebo-controlled trial, in which the combination provided improved glycaemic control compared with metformin monotherapy <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Here, we report a randomised, double-blind extension study assessing the 1-year safety and efficacy of linagliptin plus metformin in patients completing the 6-month trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Research design and methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>In this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, parallel-group extension study, patients with type 2 diabetes were assigned to linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;mg plus metformin 500&#x000a0;mg (both twice daily [bid]), linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;mg plus metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg (both bid) or metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg bid monotherapy for 54&#x000a0;weeks (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>). This study was an extension of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-month trial (NCT00798161), the design of which has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Briefly, the 6-month trial included 791 men and women with type 2 diabetes who were either treatment na&#x000ef;ve or had been treated with one oral antidiabetes drug (OAD), and who had HbA1c &#x02265;&#x000a0;7.5% to &#x0003c;&#x000a0;11.0% at screening or after OAD washout. Patients were randomised to one of six groups: linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;mg plus metformin 500&#x000a0;mg (both bid), linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;mg plus metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg (both bid), linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg once daily (qd), metformin 500&#x000a0;mg bid, metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg bid or placebo. Screened patients with HbA1c &#x02265;&#x000a0;11.0% after washout were not eligible for randomisation and instead received open-label linagliptin plus high-dose metformin for 6&#x000a0;months <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>; however, these patients were not eligible for the extension.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Patients who had been randomised to linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;mg plus metformin 500&#x000a0;mg (both bid, hereafter referred to as linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 500), linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;mg plus metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg (both bid, hereafter referred to as linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 1000) or metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg (bid, hereafter referred to as metformin 1000) in the 6-month trial continued on this medication in the extension. Patients previously randomised to metformin 500&#x000a0;mg bid were randomised 1:1 to metformin 1000 or linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 500; patients previously randomised to linagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg qd were randomised 1:1 to linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 500 or linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 1000 and patients previously randomised to placebo were randomised 1:1:1 to linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 500, linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 1000 or metformin 1000. Randomisation was performed centrally without stratification, using a pseudo-random number generator. To maintain double-blind conditions, all patients received active trial medication plus a matching placebo.</p><p>The total treatment period was 54&#x000a0;weeks, with a 2-week titration period followed by 52&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. To reduce the risk of gastrointestinal adverse effects with metformin, patients assigned metformin 1000&#x000a0;mg bid who had not received metformin in the 6-month trial received metformin 500&#x000a0;mg bid during the 2-week titration period; the metformin dose was then increased to 1000&#x000a0;mg bid. Other patients had a simulated titration period to maintain the treatment blind but had no change in their dose of trial medication.</p><p>After the first visit (week 0), patients returned to the study site at weeks 2, 6, 18, 30, 42 and 54 of the double-blind treatment period, as well as a follow-up visit 1&#x000a0;week after completing treatment. Patients had a complete physical exam at week 0, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at weeks 0, 18 and 54, and vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) recorded at week 0, 6, 18, 30, 42 and 54. Adverse events (AEs) were recorded at every visit. Blood and urine samples were collected at the start of the extension and at weeks 2, 6, 18, 30, 42 and 54. Routine laboratory assessments and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were determined for all timepoints; HbA1c was determined at all timepoints except week 2, with all determinations performed by a central laboratory.</p><p>Patients had been provided with home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) equipment during the 6-month trial, and all patients were re-trained, if needed, during the extension. HBGM testing was to be performed once per week after an overnight fast during the treatment period and at least once daily during the 1-week follow-up period. It could also be performed any time the patient had symptoms of hyper- or hypoglycaemia.</p><p>During the first 6&#x000a0;weeks, the investigator could begin rescue medication if the patient had a fasting glucose level &#x0003e;&#x000a0;11.1&#x000a0;mmol/l or a randomly determined glucose level &#x0003e;&#x000a0;22.2&#x000a0;mmol/l, confirmed by a second determination of &#x0003e;&#x000a0;11.1&#x000a0;mmol/l after an overnight fast, done at the study site on a different day. After week 6, rescue therapy could be started if the patient had a fasting glucose level &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10.0&#x000a0;mmol/l or a randomly determined glucose level &#x0003e;&#x000a0;19.4&#x000a0;mmol/l, confirmed by a measurement &#x0003e;&#x000a0;10.0&#x000a0;mmol/l after an overnight fast, done at the study site on a different day. Rescue medication could be started at any time if a patient had HbA1c &#x0003e;&#x000a0;8.5%. The choice (a sulphonylurea, thiazolidinedione or insulin) and dosage of rescue medication was at the investigator's discretion but only one additional antidiabetic therapy was to be used. If blood glucose levels remained above the defined limits despite rescue therapy (detected at study visits or in HBGM, and confirmed as above), the patient was to be discontinued from the trial for lack of efficacy.</p><p>The trial was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonisation Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the protocol was approved by the Independent Ethics Committees/Institutional Review Boards of the participating centres. All patients provided written informed consent before initiation of any study-related procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients who had completed the double-blind treatment phase of the previous 6-month trial, were not on rescue medication and provided informed consent were eligible to continue into this extension. Patients were excluded if they had any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe conduct of the trial; alcohol abuse within the 3&#x000a0;months before informed consent; or drug abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have interfered with trial participation. Women who were pregnant or nursing, or who were of child-bearing potential and not using an acceptable birth-control method, were also excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures and statistical analyses</title><p>The primary end-point was safety, assessed by the incidence and intensity of AEs, withdrawal because of AEs, clinically relevant new or worsening findings in physical examination or ECG reported as AEs, changes from baseline in vital signs and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory assessments. Patients were required to report any AEs spontaneously and specific questions were asked when needed to more precisely describe an AE. AEs were coded centrally using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 14.0 (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations).</p><p>Based on analyses of other compounds in the DPP-4 inhibitor class, hypersensitivity reactions (e.g., angio-oedema and anaphylaxis), renal events (e.g., renal failure) and increased liver enzymes were predefined as events of special interest. In addition, pancreatitis and severe cutaneous adverse reactions were defined as AEs of special interest in accordance with regulatory recommendations. Significant events were identified using a combination of standardised MedDRA queries and investigator-reported AEs.</p><p>Hypoglycaemic episodes were regarded as AEs and were recorded by investigators as either asymptomatic hypoglycaemia (an event not accompanied by typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia but with a measured plasma glucose concentration of &#x02264;&#x000a0;3.9&#x000a0;mmol/l), documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia (an event with typical symptoms of hypoglycaemia; this category was further divided by plasma glucose concentration of &#x02265;&#x000a0;3.9, &#x02265;&#x000a0;3.0 to &#x02264;&#x000a0;3.9, &#x0003c;&#x000a0;3.0&#x000a0;mmol/l or not measured), or severe hypoglycaemic episode (an event requiring the assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon or other resuscitative actions).</p><p>All reported AEs suspected of being stroke, cardiac ischaemia (including myocardial infarction [MI]) or cardiovascular death were reviewed in a blinded fashion by an independent clinical event committee.</p><p>Analysis of AEs was based on treatment-emergent AEs. To avoid double-counting of AEs in the 6-month trial, all AEs occurring before or on the day of first drug intake in the extension were assigned to the previous study, while all AEs occurring from the day after first drug intake in the extension were assigned to this study. Worsening of AEs or new occurrences of AEs reported in the preceding 6-month trial were reported as AEs in the extension study. Any new occurrence of AEs within 7&#x000a0;days after the patient's last intake of trial medication was assigned to the treatment period, while any AE occurring &#x0003e; 7&#x000a0;days after stopping study drug was assigned to the posttreatment period.</p><p>Safety analyses were performed on the treated set, defined as all patients who received &#x02265;&#x000a0;1 dose of trial medication in this extension trial. Descriptive analyses were presented for all patients, as well as separately for the switched set, defined as all patients from the treated set who changed treatment between the 6-month trial and this extension.</p><p>Secondary end-points were change from baseline in HbA1c and FPG, the percentages of patients who achieved target HbA1c levels of &#x0003c;&#x000a0;7.0% or &#x0003c;&#x000a0;6.5%, the percentages of patients with a reduction in HbA1c levels of &#x02265;&#x000a0;0.5% after 54&#x000a0;weeks of treatment and use of rescue therapy. Other end-points were change in body weight and waist circumference from baseline to week 54.</p><p>Efficacy analyses were exploratory, employing descriptive statistics. To provide meaningful analyses, measures of glucose control within the three randomised groups were analysed according to treatment in the previous 6-month trial. Changes in HbA1c and FPG were performed separately for the switched set and the non-switched set (all patients who continued the same treatment between the 6-month trial and this extension study) using observed cases. Values obtained after rescue therapy were excluded and considered missing values. For the non-switched set, changes in HbA1c and FPG from the baseline of the 6-month trial were analysed in addition to changes from the start of the extension study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This study was conducted in 101 centres in 14 countries (Canada, Croatia, Estonia, France, Germany, India, Lithuania, Mexico, the Netherlands, Romania, Russia, Sweden, Tunisia and Ukraine) between 30 June 2009 and 16 June 2011. In total, 687 patients completed the 6-month trial and 567 patients were randomised to the extension study, of whom 566 were treated with &#x02265;&#x000a0;1 dose of study drug (Figure<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). Of the 566 treated patients, 333 (59%) continued the treatment they had been randomly assigned in the 6-month trial, while 233 patients (41%) switched treatments. Across the three treatment groups, 455 patients (80.4%) completed the 54-week period and 111 patients (19.6%) prematurely discontinued the study. Reasons for discontinuation were comparable across the groups, with the most common reason for discontinuation in all groups being an AE (36 patients, 6.4%). The mean (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;standard deviation [SD]) duration of exposure to study drug was comparable across the three groups (metformin 1000: 342&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;89&#x000a0;days; linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 500: 344&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;86&#x000a0;days; linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 1000: 341&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;99&#x000a0;days).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Patient flow.

Higher HbA1c levels are associated with increased likelihood of being prescribed combination therapy, perhaps reflecting recommendations from expert groups that initial combination therapy (rather than stepwise addition of agents) should be considered for patients unlikely to achieve control with monotherapy <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In clinical practice, using combination therapies offers the advantages of achieving target HbA1c control early and maintaining targets without the need for additional therapies, and the combination of metformin with a DPP-4 inhibitor provides greater HbA1c control than either monotherapy <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Further advantages of the combination of metformin with a DPP-4 inhibitor are that there are no major safety concerns, and no increased risks of hypoglycaemia or weight gain.</p><p>This study provides additional data on safety and efficacy for patients with type 2 diabetes who were initially treated with either the combination of linagliptin and metformin or metformin alone. Initial combination therapy with linagliptin and metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes has previously been shown to be superior to metformin monotherapy, with significantly improved reductions in HbA1c and FPG levels over 6&#x000a0;months <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. In this extension study, the HbA1c and FPG reductions were maintained over a subsequent blinded follow-up period of 1 year, with the linagliptin and metformin combination showing better glucose control than metformin alone. For patients with continuous treatment, mean reductions in HbA1c from the start of treatment were &#x02212;1.25&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.11% for the metformin 1000 group, &#x02212;1.32&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.13% for the linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 500 group and &#x02212;1.63&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.12% for the linagliptin 2.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;metformin 1000 groups, with the decrease in the first 6-month trial maintained over the 1-year extension. Furthermore, the majority of patients who were at target HbA1c after 6&#x000a0;months of treatment maintained these goals after 18&#x000a0;months, although a number of patients discontinued treatment, thus explaining the apparent increase in the proportion of patients achieving goal in the metformin monotherapy group.</p><p>Initial combination therapy may be preferred over a stepwise approach to therapy for some patients. Comparison of initial combination therapy with low-dose metformin plus linagliptin to initial monotherapy with metformin followed by add-on linagliptin showed that both strategies are similarly effective in lowering HbA1c. However, there were &#x0223c;50% fewer patients in the metformin 500-mg monotherapy group at the start of the extension study, suggesting lack of durability with this approach. Consistent with results from the initial trial <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, patients with high vs. moderate baseline HbA1c values achieved the greatest HbA1c reductions with combination therapy.</p><p>In the extension study, the incidence of all treatment-emergent AEs and treatment-related AEs was comparable across study arms, and the incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation was low. This confirms the results of previous observations that linagliptin in combination with metformin is associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia and is weight neutral in the long term <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>In summary, this 52-week, randomised, blinded extension study provides further evidence that linagliptin in combination with metformin can be used over an extended time period without additional safety burden, as indicated by comparable safety profiles of metformin monotherapy and combination therapy. In addition, the clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control previously seen with the combination of linagliptin and metformin over 6&#x000a0;months were sustained. Because of the chronic nature of the disease, patients with type 2 diabetes will require glucose-lowering combination therapies, such as linagliptin and metformin, for many years, and the results of this 1-year comparative effectiveness study support the use of combination therapy for the early treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH &#x00026; Co.
