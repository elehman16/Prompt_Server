Clinical laboratory parameters such as hemoglobin, white blood cell count, neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelet, creatinine clearance, and international normalized ratio/prothrombin time were measured and compared from baseline to week 90 in the study population.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All tables and listings were generated using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

The descriptive statistics for all disease conditions, prior medical therapy other than the study, and concomitant medications were summarized. Frequency and duration of treatment were computed for all medications. History of prior cancer therapy, prior radiotherapy, and their response rate were summarized.</p><p>The PFSR was estimated as the proportion of patients who did not progress and were alive at a given time and was calculated from the date of enrollment until the date of progression or death from any cause. PFS was calculated in days from the start of treatment until the earliest date of disease progression or death from any cause; else, the participant was labeled as censored. Disease progression was defined according to the RECIST criteria (version 1.1). The investigator determined response and date of disease progression. OS was determined from the date of enrollment to the date of death irrespective of the cause of death. Patients who had not died at the time of the final analysis were censored at the date the patient was last known to be alive. The PFSR, PFS, and OS time with 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated using the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method.</p><p>To have the best response as continued CR (for patients with CR at enrollment), the patient must have remained tumor free for at least 6 weeks postbaseline. To have a best response of CR or PR, patients were required to have follow-up measurements meeting the criteria for CR or PR at two consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart at any time postbaseline. For best response stable disease, follow-up measurements must have met the stable disease criteria at least 6 weeks postbaseline. The ORR was summarized using number and percentage along with the two-sided 95% Clopper&#x02013;Pearson CI.</p><p>The number and percentage of patients reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs) were tabulated, and severity, outcome, and relationship to the study medication were analyzed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p>Over a period of 12 months, 55 patients with NSCLC were screened, and 51 patients were enrolled across seven centers in India.

The possible role of erlotinib monotherapy as sequential treatment, postchemotherapy regimen emerged from the data derived from the TALENT study.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Maintenance therapy can prolong survival by delaying progression.</p><p>The Phase III SATURN study[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] showed that erlotinib provided as switch maintenance therapy post four to six cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy significantly improved the PFS and OS of NSCLC patients. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of erlotinib as first-line maintenance in the Indian population.</p><p>PFSR at 52 weeks was 22.5% and median PFS irrespective of EGFR status was 99 days or 14.14 weeks in patients on maintenance therapy with erlotinib. This was in line with that observed in the SATURN study in which patients on erlotinib had PFS of 12.3 weeks.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Consistent with clinical data which suggest that tyrosine kinase inhibitors are more active in certain NSCLC histotypes such as in adenocarcinomas, never smokers, and in women,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] the PFS for female population, nonsmokers and patients with adenocarcinoma were statistically significant as compared to males, smokers, and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively.</p><p>The OS observed in this study was 22 months which was longer than that reported in the SATURN study (12 months) and could be attributed to the difference in the follow-up period of the two studies. Patients were followed up for 18 months after the last patient was enrolled in this study and for median 11.5 months in the SATURN study. Similar to the PFS, OS was higher in females as compared to males and was statistically significant in nonsmokers as compared to smokers.</p><p>A higher ORR of 25.5% was observed in the current study in comparison to the 11.9% reported in the SATURN study while the disease control rate was 55.3% in the current study and 60.6% in SATURN study. Overall, despite the smaller size of the study population in this study, the efficacy of erlotinib as first-line maintenance therapy in Indian patients was comparable to the global data of the SATURN study.</p><p>EGFR mutation status was available for only ten patients of which three (30%) patients were mutation positive and seven (70%) patients were mutation negative. The small sample of EGFR positive patients in this study was inadequate to derive statistical conclusions in terms of the efficacy of erlotinib in this subset of the Indian population.</p><p>Recently, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III (IUNO) study was conducted in 643 patients with advanced NSCLC whose tumors did not harbor an EGFR-activating mutation and who had not experienced disease progression after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. The study did not meet its primary endpoint. OS of erlotinib in first-line maintenance was not superior to erlotinib as second-line treatment in patients whose tumor did not harbor an EGFR-activating mutation (hazard ratio = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.85&#x02013;1.22, <italic>P</italic> = 0.82). Based on these data, erlotinib use is now no longer recommended for first-line maintenance treatment in patients without an EGFR activating mutation.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>However, at the start of our study, erlotinib was indicated for maintenance treatment irrespective of mutation status. The limitation of our study was that only three patients were known to be EGFR mutation positive. Further studies with a larger number of Indian patients with EGFR mutation are required to substantiate these findings.</p><p>Consistent with the SATURN trial the most commonly reported AEs were rash and diarrhea. The incidence of SAEs (7.8% vs. 11%) was slightly lower than that observed in the SATURN trial presumably due to the smaller sample size.
