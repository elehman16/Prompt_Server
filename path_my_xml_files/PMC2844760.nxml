All patients were receiving optimal oral therapy including a &#x003b2;-blocker.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>This was a multinational, randomized, double-blind, phase IV study in 60 patients; follow-up was 1 month. There was a significant increase in cardiac index and a significant decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) at 24 and 48 h for both dobutamine and levosimendan. The improvement in cardiac index with levosimendan was not significantly different from dobutamine at 24 h (<italic>P</italic> = 0.07), but became significant at 48 h (0.44 &#x000b1; 0.56 vs. 0.66 &#x000b1; 0.63 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). At 24 h, the reduction in the mean change in PCWP from baseline was similar for levosimendan and dobutamine, however, at 48 h the difference was more marked for levosimendan (&#x02212;3.6 &#x000b1; 7.6 vs. &#x02212;8.3 &#x000b1; 6.7 mmHg; <italic>P</italic> = 0.02). No difference was observed between the groups for change in NYHA class, &#x003b2;-blocker use, hospitalizations, treatment discontinuations or rescue medication use. Reduction in B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) was significantly greater with levosimendan at 48 h (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). According to physician's assessment, the improvement in fatigue (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) and dyspnoea (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) was in favour of dobutamine treatment, and hypotension was significantly more frequent with levosimendan (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007).

These agents may increase myocardial oxygen consumption and worsen myocardial ischaemia and, while they may improve pump function acutely and stabilize the patient's condition, there may be an increased frequency of arrhythmias and death. Whether this is also the case in patients with ADHF treated with optimal dosages of &#x003b2;-blockers remains unclear.</p><p>Intravenous levosimendan is a novel agent developed for the short-term treatment of worsening heart failure (HF). It has been found to increase myocardial contractility via a sensitization of cardiac troponin C to calcium,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C1">1</xref></sup> and to produce vasodilatation by opening the ATP-sensitive potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cells. Levosimendan also has phosphodiesterase type III inhibitory properties at high concentrations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C2">2</xref></sup> Levosimendan induces haemodynamic improvement without an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C3">3</xref></sup> In randomized, double-blinded studies in patients with ADHF, intravenous levosimendan administered over 6&#x02013;24 h has been shown to decrease pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and increase cardiac output, compared both with placebo and dobutamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C6">6</xref></sup> Moreover, in a retrospective analysis of the LIDO trial, the haemodynamic advantage of levosimendan over dobutamine was accentuated in the presence of &#x003b2;-blockers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C6">6</xref></sup> In the SURVIVE trial, levosimendan and dobutamine had similar outcome effects,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C7">7</xref></sup> but post hoc analyses showed that in patients receiving concomitant &#x003b2;-blockers, mortality was lower for levosimendan than dobutamine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Levosimendan may therefore offer an important alternative for the treatment of ADHF in patients on optimal conventional treatment including a &#x003b2;-blocker and in need of inotropic support. Because of an active long-acting metabolite (OR-1896),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C10">10</xref></sup> the haemodynamic effects of levosimendan continue for several days after stopping the infusion. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of a 24 h intravenous infusion of levosimendan with a 48 h infusion of dobutamine on invasive haemodynamics in patients with ADHF on optimal therapy including a &#x003b2;-blocker. This was the BEAT-CHF (efficacy and safety of short-term intravenous treatment with levosimendan vs. dobutamine in decompensated HF patients treated with beta-blockers) trial.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The investigation conforms to the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C11">11</xref></sup> and the principles of Good Clinical Practice within the European Union.

Patients were required to have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &#x02264; 35% within 3 months prior to inclusion, a cardiac index &#x0003c; 2.5 L/min/m<sup>2</sup>, and PCWP &#x0003e; 15 mmHg.</p><p>The main exclusion criteria were significant mechanical obstruction affecting ventricular filling and/or outflow, systolic blood pressure (SBP) &#x02264; 85 mmHg, heart rate &#x02265; 130 b.p.m. persistent for at least 5 min and serum potassium &#x0003c;3.5 mmol/L or &#x0003e;5.4 mmol/L (or, alternatively, plasma potassium &#x0003c;3.4 mmol/L or &#x0003e;4.9 mmol/L) at screening, or severe angina pectoris during the 6 h before baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multinational, double-blinded, double-dummy, parallel group phase IV study. The study consisted of a screening period of up to 24 h before initiation of treatment, a study drug infusion period of 48 h, and a follow-up period of 1 month. Patients were hospitalized at a minimum for the duration of the intravenous infusion. Randomization was stratified with respect to treatment with carvedilol, as a subgroup analysis from the LIDO trial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C6">6</xref></sup> suggested that carvedilol has a different haemodynamic interaction with dobutamine when compared with other &#x003b2;-blockers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C12">12</xref></sup> Patients within each stratum were randomly allocated to a 24 h infusion with levosimendan or a 48 h infusion with dobutamine in a 1:1 ratio. All patients received two infusions: active treatment and a placebo for the alternative treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study medication</title><p>Levosimendan or placebo for levosimendan (Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) was administered as an initial loading dose of 12 &#x000b5;g/kg delivered over 10 min followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 &#x000b5;g/kg/min for 50 min. The infusion rate was increased to 0.2 &#x000b5;g/kg/min for a further 23 h. If dose-limiting events (DLEs) occurred (as described below) during administration of the loading dose, the loading dose was stopped. Upon resolution, the infusion could be restarted at 0.1 &#x000b5;g/kg/min and increased to 0.2 &#x000b5;g/kg/min or reduced to 0.05 &#x000b5;g/kg/min as appropriate.

If DLEs occurred during the infusion, the dosage could be reduced to 5 or 2.5 &#x000b5;g/kg/min.</p><p>The optimal dosage of &#x003b2;-blocker administered at baseline was, as far as possible, to be maintained throughout the study. If possible, diuretic treatment regimens were to remain constant.</p><p>DLEs were defined as symptomatic hypotension, heart rate &#x02265; 140 b.p.m. constantly over 5 min, development of angina pectoris, electrocardiographic signs of significant myocardial ischaemia, or suspicion of myocardial infarction, development of new malignant tachyarrhythmia, or excessive diuresis that was sustained despite reducing the dosage or discontinuing administration of diuretics. Hypotension was defined as &#x02018;asymptomatic&#x02019; if systolic BP was &#x02264;75mmHg but the patient had no symptoms, or &#x02018;symptomatic&#x02019; if the patient had symptoms attributable to low BP in the opinion of the investigator irrespective of the blood pressure measurement.

Both treatments induced haemodynamic improvement in these patients. Even though the primary objective was not met, a trend in favour of levosimendan was seen at 24 h after the start of study drug infusion. This was consistent with previous findings in the LIDO study, where levosimendan showed a significantly greater decrease in PCWP and a significantly greater increase in cardiac output.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C6">6</xref></sup> Further, this difference became significant at 48 h, even though levosimendan was only administered for 24 h and dobutamine for 48 h. Two factors, the concomitant &#x003b2;-blockade diminishing effect on dobutamine and the formation of an active metabolite of levosimendan, probably account for these findings.</p><p>Although pharmacokinetic parameters were not measured in the present study, previous studies have shown that levosimendan has an active metabolite (OR-1896), which has a considerably longer elimination half-life than the parent drug (about 80 vs. 1 h).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C10">10</xref></sup> In line with the present findings, a 24 h levosimendan infusion has previously been shown to maintain the haemodynamic effects at a similar level at 24 and 48 h,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C10">10</xref></sup> with the effects lasting for about 7 days.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C14">14</xref></sup> The haemodynamic effects of dobutamine may diminish owing to tachyphylaxis,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C16">16</xref></sup> but in the present study this was not seen, and cardiac index and PCWP were at similar levels at 24 and 48 h in the dobutamine group.</p><p>The haemodynamic changes observed at 24 h in the &#x003b2;-blocked patients in the LIDO study showed an improvement in cardiac index, which was similar in magnitude to the improvement observed in this study. However, in the LIDO study, the dobutamine patients did not respond as well as the levosimendan patients. In contrast, in the present study, cardiac index improved to a similar extent in both the levosimendan and dobutamine groups at 24 h. The total dose of dobutamine over the first 24 h of the infusion was somewhat higher in the present study compared with LIDO, so the higher dosage might explain the greater improvements in the dobutamine group in the present study. However, a more likely explanation for these minor differences between the groups is the relatively small number of patients in both the LIDO subgroup and the present study.</p><p>Previous studies with levosimendan have demonstrated a reduction in plasma BNP concentrations, correlating with improvements in haemodynamic status in ADHF patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="HFQ032C7">7</xref></sup> Consistent with these findings, BNP levels were lower during levosimendan treatment and the difference between treatments was statistically significant at 48 h in the present study.</p><p>In both treatment groups, the majority of patients reported either improved or unchanged HF symptoms (dyspnoea and fatigue). According to the physician's assessment, a greater proportion of patients in the dobutamine group were reported to have an improvement in these symptoms. The pharmacodynamic profile of dobutamine is consistent with a short-term experience of improvement. As patients in the study were mostly confined to bed rest, changes in dyspnoea rating should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>Consistent with the more frequent reporting of hypotension as an AE for levosimendan patients (35%), SBP decreased more during the infusion of levosimendan than dobutamine. This is in contrast to the SURVIVE study, where a similar proportion of patients experienced hypotension as an AE (16% for levosimendan and 14% for dobutamine). Generally, the tolerability of levosimendan and dobutamine were similar and mortality rates were low in both groups.</p><p>In the present study, mean heart rate increased with both levosimendan and dobutamine (8 and 5 b.p.m. at 48 h, respectively), with the highest heart rate observed during dobutamine infusion at 2 h, similar results were reported in the LIDO and SURVIVE studies.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Limitations</title><p>Because of slow recruitment, the study was terminated before the prespecified number of patients had been included, which weakened the scientific conclusions of the study. The two study drugs, levosimendan and dobutamine have different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles, resulting in a different duration of effect. This was compensated for by administering the two drugs for different lengths of time, but it is possible that the duration of effect may still have been different.</p></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, in HF patients experiencing acute decompensation while receiving optimal &#x003b2;-blocker therapy, a 24 h levosimendan infusion achieved haemodynamic and neurohormonal improvement that lasted beyond the infusion period. The improvement with levosimendan was at least comparable to a 48 h dobutamine infusion at 24 h after the start of the infusion and superior at 48 h. This lasting effect is corroborated by clinical observations indicating a practical advantage over dobutamine.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was sponsored by <funding-source>Orion Pharma</funding-source>.
