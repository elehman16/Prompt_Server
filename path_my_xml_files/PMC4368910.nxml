Patients will receive an infusion of freshly isolated CD133+ cells immediately and frozen doses at days 30 and 60 via peripheral vein (0.2&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> cells/kg for each of the three doses). Primary objective is to demonstrate an improvement in the severity of liver disease over 3&#x02005;months using either G-CSF alone or G-CSF followed by repeated infusions of haematopoietic stem cells compared with standard conservative management. The trial is powered to answer two hypotheses of each treatment compared to control but not powered to detect smaller expected differences between the two treatment groups. As such, the overall &#x003b1;=0.05 for the trial is split equally between the two hypotheses. Conventionally, to detect a relevant standardised effect size of 0.8 point reduction in Model for End-stage Liver Disease score using two-sided &#x003b1;=0.05(overall &#x003b1;=0.1 split equally between the two hypotheses) and 80% power requires 27 participants to be randomised per group (81 participants in total).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial is registered at Current Controlled Trials on 18 November 2009 (ISRCTN number 91288089, EuDRACT number 2009-010335-41).

At present liver transplantation is the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease however this is limited by donor organ availability, the supply of which has not matched the rising number of patients requiring liver transplantation.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Moreover, liver transplantation requires long-term immunosuppression which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, renal impairment and malignancy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is a clear need for new therapies for chronic liver disease which are either an effective alternative to liver transplantation or reduce the proportion of patients that require transplantation.</p><p>Initial observations that the bone marrow may contribute to hepatic repair and regeneration<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;6</xref> were followed by studies of the therapeutic benefits of bone marrow derived cells in animal models of liver injury. Bone marrow (BM) cells injected into mice with chronic liver injury resulted in a reduction in hepatic fibrosis and an improvement in serum albumin,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> while mobilisation of BM cells by injection of GCSF reduced the severity of liver injury and improved survival in both acute and chronic models of liver injury.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, other studies have shown either no beneficial effect of BM cell injections<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> or even a worsening of hepatic fibrosis after bone marrow cell injection.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Despite varied outcomes in preclinical studies, multiple clinical studies of BM-derived stem cell therapy have been performed. Am Esch and colleagues studied patients without chronic liver disease undergoing liver resection for metastatic cancer affecting the liver. They demonstrated accelerated hepatic regeneration in patients receiving infusions of BM-derived CD133+ stem cells with concomitant portal vein embolisation prior to hepatic resection.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> In patients with liver disease trials of bone marrow stem cell therapy have included small numbers of patients and have been designed to examine safety and feasibility rather than efficacy.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>The initial reports of the use of BM-derived stem cells in patients with chronic liver disease utilised a variety of approaches to the method of cell isolation and route of delivery. Gordon <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> administered GCSF to patients with cirrhosis and collected CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) mobilised into the blood and infused them directly into the liver via the hepatic artery. Alternatively, investigators in another study directly harvested BM cells from the iliac crest under general anaesthesia, selected out mononuclear BM cells and infused these cells via the portal vein.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> While both studies involved only small numbers of patients, 5 and 9, respectively and lacked control participants, they demonstrated that this form of therapy appeared safe and feasible. Clinical outcomes were reported in both studies and showed reduced serum bilirubin and improved serum albumin 2&#x02005;months following cell infusion in the first study<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and improved serum albumin and Child-Pugh score (a marker of liver dysfunction) at 6&#x02005;months in the second.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> These two initial studies highlight the significant number of variables involved in comparing these and subsequent studies.</p><p>Further small-scale, uncontrolled studies have included variations in the patients enrolled (aetiology and severity of liver disease), the method of cell harvest (direct BM aspiration or peripheral blood leukopharesis), the type and number of cells infused (various populations from unsorted mononuclear cells to purified CD133+ HSC) and the route of cell infusion (hepatic artery, portal vein or peripheral vein).<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The aim of many of these studies was to determine safety and feasibility and in that sense the outcomes were promising. However, the size and nature of many of these subsequent studies meant that meaningful conclusions on clinical outcomes could not be drawn.</p><p>In more recent small controlled trials, Lyra <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> demonstrated significant improvements in liver function 1&#x02005;year following infusion of BM mononuclear cells into the hepatic artery when compared with untreated control patients.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Ismail <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> examined the role of infusion of bone marrow mononuclear cells prior to liver resection in patients with cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma and showed improved outcomes 3&#x02005;months postoperatively compared with patients undergoing resection alone.</p><p>There have been many reports of clinical studies describing the use of BM stem cells and HSC in patients with chronic liver disease, which have predominantly involved small numbers of patients and made no comparisons with untreated controls. These studies were systematically reviewed by Moore <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and of the studies considered only one<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> was found to be of adequate trial design to be informative regarding the potential efficacy of cell therapy and this trial was negative. The general message from these studies is that stem cell therapy appears to be a safe and feasible therapeutic option, however its efficacy has yet to be proven.

This dosage is based on maximising the number of cells to be re-infused while ensuring that sufficient cells can be harvested from each patient to standardise the treatment.

Analysis of 60 patients eligible for the trial in our clinic cohort demonstrated a mean baseline MELD score of 13.5, with a mean change in MELD over 3&#x02005;months of 0.0&#x000b1;1.0. This indicates that no change in MELD over 90&#x02005;days would be observed in conventionally treated patients. A clinically significant reduction would be at least a 1 point reduction in MELD. The trial is designed as a three-armed study with one control arm. The trial is powered to answer two hypotheses of each treatment compared to control but not powered to detect smaller expected differences between the two treatment groups. As such, the overall &#x003b1;=0.1 for the trial is split equally between the two hypotheses. Conventionally, to detect a relevant standardised effect size of 0.8 point reduction in MELD score using two-sided &#x003b1;=0.05 (overall &#x003b1;=0.1 split equally between the two hypotheses) and 80% power requires 27 participants to be randomised per group (81 participants in total; 49). The null hypothesis to be tested is that the change in mean at 90&#x02005;days compared across two groups (treatment vs control) is the same. The alternative hypothesis is that the change in mean at 90&#x02005;days compared across two groups (treatment vs control) is at least 0.8 SDs apart.</p><p>The number of participants lost to follow-up, or withdrawn consent prior to initial treatment is expected to be minimal. The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) may advise replacement of participants if numbers are higher than anticipated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s12"><title>Analysis of primary outcome measure</title><p>All analyses will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis, retaining participants in their randomised treatment groups and including protocol violator and ineligible participants, in order to maintain the unbiased comparison of treatments created by the randomisation procedure.</p><p>Baseline MELD score will be collected at randomisation and days 30, 60 and 90 postrandomisation. Change in MELD will be calculated for each participant and average changes presented and statistically compared for each treatment group against control using 2-sample t test or non-parametric two-sample Wilcoxon test if appropriate.</p><p>Changes from baseline for secondary outcomes scored as continuous measures will be calculated and presented descriptively by treatment group. It is unknown over what period the treatment remains active or if its effect increases linearly or in some other way. As such the statistical analysis plan will be updated to include an additional coprimary final analysis entailing a repeated measures analysis over time, specifically a mixed effect modelling procedure, taking into account the MELD measurement captured at baseline, days 30, 60 and 90. The introduction of mixed effects modelling will make more efficient use of the patient level information, enhance the scope of the study to understand the trend of treatment activity in more detail (rather than focusing only at a specific time point, day 90) and address missing values. To model the trend in MELD over time, a linear mixed effects models (taking into account within subject correlation) using linear, quadratic polynomials or more flexible semiparametric models will be considered. Goodness of fit tests will be used to compare the different models. We will evaluate if MELD changes over time, and if so, what is the pattern of change, as well as if the pattern differs between the each treatment and control group. For this analysis the null hypothesis to be tested is that the slope of the change in MELD compared across two groups (treatment vs control) is the same. The alternative hypothesis is that the slope of the change in MELD compared across two groups differ.</p><p>The multilevel coprimary analyses detailed in the foregoing await approval from the MHRA, as the REALISTIC trials team have sought consent to amend the primary analyses in this manner and believe the proposed changes will not be contested. The original powered analysis, the two sample t test, remains part of the primary analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s13"><title>Discussion</title><p>There is a clear need for new therapies for chronic liver disease as liver transplantation is limited by donor organ availability and by long-term complications.

<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The small scale studies performed in humans to date suggest the possibility of a beneficial effect in patients with liver disease but this has not been robustly tested in randomised controlled trials.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The REALISTIC trial was designed to examine the benefits of repeated injections of bone marrow derived CD133+ stem cells in patients with cirrhosis and is the first randomised controlled trial with a powered primary end point to examine the safety and efficacy of repeated cell injections.</p><p>In the design of the trial a variety of experimental approaches were considered, in particular the route by which cell therapy would be administered and the primary outcome measure by which the efficacy of the cell therapy would be determined.</p><p>Administration of cells directly into the vessels supplying the liver (portal vein and hepatic artery) is invasive and carries significant risks, including bleeding and thrombosis. This approach had been used in initial studies without complication, however, subsequent studies have shown this to be complicated by portal hypertensive bleeding following cell injection<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and one study was terminated early following complications in two out of four patients after hepatic artery injection.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> In this trial HSC will be administered into a peripheral vein thus avoiding the potential complications of repeated procedures to access hepatic vessels. In addition to reducing the risks of cell injection, this approach has practical implications in making the therapy more accessible and cost-effective as specialised interventional radiological procedures are not required.</p><p>In patients with compensated cirrhosis expected mortality at 1&#x02005;year is between 1% and 3% with median survival of 12&#x02005;years, with complications of cirrhosis developing at a rate of 5&#x02013;7% per year.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The low short-term mortality in these patients means that utilising survival as the primary outcome measure would not be appropriate. MELD score is an objective, prognostic scoring system validated for patients with chronic liver disease, and the variables required to calculate it are easily obtained from standard blood tests. The magnitude of change in MELD score is predictive of the development of the complications of cirrhosis, and in this trial the change in MELD score at 90&#x02005;days will be used as the primary outcome measure. The authors hope such a trial design will fill an important gap in the current literature of cell therapy for liver disease. Furthermore such a design may be a template for future studies with other novel cell therapy products which are undergoing development for the therapy of chronic liver disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The REALISTIC trial would like to thank the Data Management.
