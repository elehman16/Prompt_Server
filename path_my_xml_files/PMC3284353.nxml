There is therefore an urgent need to investigate rapidly whether there is any evidence of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in southern Laos, which is only approximately 400 km from the Thailand/Cambodia border area of artemisinin resistance/tolerance. Although ACTs were introduced as national policy by the Government of Laos in 2005, artesunate monotherapy with variable patient adherence has been used since 1999. In addition, counterfeit artesunate containing subtherapeutic quantities of artemisinin has been reported in the area.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref></p><p>The mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) PCT in a series of 861 patients with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria recruited in three trials in southern Laos treated with artemisinin derivatives (artesunate plus mefloquine, n = 316), artemether-lumefantrine (n = 238), and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (n = 307) during 2002&#x02013;2008 was 1.89 (1.86&#x02013;1.92) days (range = 1&#x02013;4 days).

However, these studies involved daily blood sampling for parasite counts, rather than six hourly counts, which would be required to detect anything other than gross changes in PCT. Furthermore, the last available data were collected in 2008. We therefore conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing oral artesunate (2 mg/kg/day versus 4 mg/kg/day for 3 days) followed by a 3-day treatment course of artemether-lumefantrine to estimate the current efficacy of the drug for uncomplicated <italic>P. falciparum</italic> malaria in southern Laos.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study site, patients, and clinical procedures</title><p>The study was conducted during June&#x02013;September 2010 at Xepon (30 beds) Inter-District Hospital (16.69&#x000b0; N, 106.20&#x000b0; E, 208 meters above sea level) in southern Savannakhet Province, Laos, near the Laos/Vietnam border, approximately 665 km southeast of Vientiane, the capital of Laos.
