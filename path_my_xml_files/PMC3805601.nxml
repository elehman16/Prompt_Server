We measured satiety on a 5-point scale by questionnaire at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months. We calculated the change in satiety from before intake to 1 minute after intake and 15 minutes after intake.

We found no statistically significant difference in satiety between the sugar-free and sugar-sweetened group; the adjusted odds ratio for a 1 point increase in satiety in the sugar group versus the sugar-free group was 0.77 at 1 minute (95% confidence interval, 0.46 to 1.29), and 1.44 at 15 minutes after intake (95% CI, 0.86 to 2.40). The sugar-group liked and wanted their beverage slightly more than the sugar-free group, adjusted odds ratio 1.63 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.54) and 1.65 (95% CI 1.07 to 2.55), respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="headed"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Sugar-sweetened and sugar-free beverages produced similar satiety.

A possible explanation is that sugars in solution are detected incompletely by receptors that determine satiation. As a result, sugar-free and sugar-containing drinks should produce similar degrees of satiety[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], and intake of calories from other foods is not affected[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Previous studies indeed showed that masked replacement of sugar-containing beverages with sugar-free beverages was only partly compensated for by an increased energy intake[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Small experiments lasting a few days[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], or a few weeks[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] showed that satiety following sugar-containing and sugar-free artificially sweetened drinks was similar. However, data from large, long-term double blind trials are lacking, especially in children. </p><p>Liking and wanting are food rewards that also influence food intake[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Liking reflects the immediate experience or anticipation of pleasure from eating a food, i.e. the hedonic value or &#x02018;palatability&#x02019; of the food. Wanting is the intrinsic motivation to engage in eating a food, now or in the (near) future[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A four-week study in adults found that sugar-free beverages were preferred less than sugar-containing beverages[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], but another study failed to confirm this[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Again, large long-term trials are lacking. </p><p>We therefore investigated satiety, liking and wanting in DRINK, a double-blind randomized controlled trial in which children replaced their habitual daily sugar-containing drink with either a sugar-free or sugar-sweetened beverage for 18 months[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. </p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2.1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Written informed consent was provided by a parent or guardian who had obtained assent from the child.

The design and results have been reported[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Here we report effects on satiety, liking and wanting. DRINK was an 18-month double-blind randomized controlled trial in 641 children aged 5-11 living near Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Participants were individually randomized to receive either 250 ml per day of a sugar-free, artificially sweetened beverage with 0 kcal (sugar-free group) or a similar sugar-sweetened beverage that provided 104 kcal (sugar group). For the present study, only participating children in the two highest school grades were eligible because young children would not be able to understand the questionnaire. All 203 of them proved willing and able to participate, and were enrolled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078039-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We recruited participants between August and November 2009[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Treatment started between November 14 and December 7, 2009. The trial lasted 19.5 months. We interrupted treatment for 1.5 months during the summer holidays of 2010. </p><fig id="pone-0078039-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0078039.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Randomization and follow-up of the study participants.</title><p>In the sugar-free group, allergy was reported as an adverse event for one child.

We replaced the beverage brought from home with our study beverages. We provided children with 1 can per day of a noncaloric, artificially sweetened, noncarbonated beverage or a sugar-sweetened noncarbonated beverage. We developed custom drinks for this study to ensure that the sugar-free and sugar-sweetened drinks tasted and looked essentially the same. The identical-looking 250-ml cans provided either 0 or 26 g of sucrose (0 or 104 kcal per day). The sugar-free beverages contained 34 mg sucralose and 12 mg acesulfame K as sweeteners. After the DRINK trial of 18 months the large majority of children were unable to guess whether they had received sugar-sweetened or sugar-free drinks[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Each week children received a box at school labelled with their name and containing 8 cans, 1 for each day of the week plus 1 extra to be used as a spare in case a can was misplaced. We offered beverages in four flavours: raspberry, peach, lemon and mango. Flavours were rotated every two weeks. </p></sec><sec id="s2.4"><title>Satiety, liking and wanting</title><p>We measured satiety, liking and wanting with a questionnaire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078039-g002">Figure 2</xref>; Supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078039.s003">Appendix S1</xref>). The satiety scale has been validated in children aged 4-6 years old who indicated satiety produced by three different imagined eating situations[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Children showed different outcomes for each meal suggesting that our satiety scale indeed measures satiety. Leon et al. compared three methods to measure liking in 169 children aged 4 to 10 years old[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They concluded that the scale used by us provides a reliable and valid estimate of liking in children aged 8-10 years. The wanting scale has been used earlier [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] but has not been formally validated yet.</p><fig id="pone-0078039-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0078039.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Time schedule for filling out the questionnaire.</title><p>The timeline is indicative because each school had its own timing of the morning break.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0078039.g002"/></fig><p> Children completed a single questionnaire (of satiety, liking and wanting) on one day every 6 months. They did this during the 10:00 am morning break when they consumed their study drink and snack. The teachers instructed the children explicitly how to fill out the questionnaire and to consume their drink. The teacher also asked them to write down in the questionnaire whether they had finished the contents of the can. One researcher was present at each school and circulated between school classes during the measurements. The children filled out the questionnaires themselves without assistance.</p><p> We measured satiety, liking and wanting on 5-point scales; 1 indicated low levels, and 5 high levels (Supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078039.s003">Appendix S1</xref>). We measured satiety three times on each test day: just before intake of the study beverage and the food brought from home, 1 minute after intake, and 15 minutes after intake[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We measured wanting 1 minute before and liking 1 minute after intake. The questionnaire also inquired about snack consumption, i.e. the amount and type of food eaten with the study beverage. We calculated the calories in these snack food[<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="s2.5"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>We present outcome variables as medians and interquartile ranges. We used generalized linear mixed model analysis in STATA SE 12 (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA). The generalized linear mixed model analyses took into account the repeated measurements at 0, 6, 12 and 18 months, and the ordinal structure of the 5-point scales. For children who discontinued beverage intake we included the data obtained up until discontinuation. </p><p> We calculated regression coefficients for the likelihood that on the 5-point satiety scale the sugar-group increased by 1 point more than in the sugar-free group. We separately calculated increases in satiety from before intake to 1 minute after intake, and from before intake to 15 minutes after intake by adjusting for satiety prior to intake (model 1). In model 2 we additionally adjusted for caloric intake from snacks with the beverage, for gender and for BMI z score. Adjustments for gender and BMI z score served to correct for imbalances in randomization. We used similar analyses to calculate differences between treatment groups in liking and wanting of the beverages. Calculations of liking and wanting were adjusted for gender and BMI z score at the start of the study. We also calculated regression coefficients for effect modification by month of measurement. The sugar-free group always served as the reference group. Therefore, odds ratios larger than 1 imply that the effect in the sugar group was larger than that in the sugar-free group, and vice versa. We also present arithmetic means of scores to show the differences between groups, and how the means changed with time. However, we did not perform statistical analyses of the arithmetic means because the outcomes were on an ordinal scale. We used the conventional limits for significance of P = 0.10 for effect modification and P = 0.05 for all other analyses. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3.1"><title>Participants</title><p>The 203 participants were aged 10.2 (0.8) years at the start of the study, mean (SD).

Average liking fell by 1.18 points in the sugar group and by 1.04 points in the sugar-free group, while the difference between groups was 0.4 (1.06) points at baseline and 0.2 (1.24) points at 18 months, mean (SD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0078039-g004">Figure 4</xref>).

Again, effect modification by month of measurement was not statistically significant (P= 0.97).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We found that sugar-free and sugar-sweetened beverages produced similar degrees of satiety in a large population of children who consumed such beverages daily for 18 months. We previously reported that the children who consumed the sugar-free beverages accumulated less body fat than children who consumed sugar-sweetened beverages[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The present study suggests that this may be explained by similar levels of satiety. When we substituted sugar-free beverages for the sugar-containing drinks that children drank habitually, they apparently did not feel a need to eat more of other foods and drinks to compensate for the missing calories.</p><p>We tested satiety under real-life conditions, i.e. during the morning break at school when children consumed their beverage together with their usual snack. We assume that satiety was determined by snack intake &#x02013; mostly crackers, sweets, or fruits - , beverage volume, and caloric content of the drink.&#x000a0;Mean caloric intake from snacks and volume of drinks were the same between groups but the sugar-free drinks contained 26 g less sucrose. We conclude that the sugar content of the drinks did not have a measurable effect on satiety. This finding is consistent with short term experiments in adults[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] that also found similar levels of satiety following sugar-containing and sugar-free beverages. Effect modification by month of measurement for satiety 15 minutes after intake was marginally significant. This could indicate that sugar-sweetened beverages became more satiating as the trial proceeded. However, this may have been a chance finding.</p><p>We found that the children liked and wanted the sugar-sweetened beverage slightly more than the sugar-free beverage. These differences persisted throughout the study even though overall liking and wanting of both types of beverage fell drastically with time. In contrast, short-term studies with pudding[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], or beverages[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] found similar ratings of pleasantness for aspartame-sweetened and sucrose-sweetened products. However, beverages containing a blend of aspartame, acesulfame K and saccharin were rated lower in pleasantness than beverages containing sucrose[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Another study reported that cream cheese sweetened with aspartame had a more pleasant taste than cream cheese containing stevia or sucrose[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus the pleasantness of artificially sweetened products may be highly dependent on the type and mix of sweeteners used and on other aspects of product formulation. According to the literature different neural pathways are involved in liking and wanting[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, our data suggest that these concepts may be related since they produced similar results. Future research is needed to examine whether wanting and liking indeed involve the same neural pathway or that our wanting scale lacked validity.</p><p>Liking and wanting of the trial drinks decreased markedly in both groups over the course of the trial. Similar declines have been reported in studies with solid foods over periods of 15 days to 6 months[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The decrease in liking and wanting agrees with our observation that most children who discontinued intake gave dislike of the beverage as their reason. A year and a half is indeed a long time for a child to drink the same drink every day, and the variety of flavours that we offered was obviously not enough to overcome this. Sensory-specific satiety may have decreased liking and wanting over time[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. </p><p>Our study had several strengths. One is its long duration. Previous studies had a maximum duration of 4 weeks[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Long term studies may be more informative because short term satiety signals may have little to do with the long term mechanisms that determine weight gain. Our study was large; we included 203 subjects, as opposed to 11 to 42 in previous studies[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Also, we used a double-blind design that eliminated the effects of psychological cues and socially desirable behaviour. Previous studies were either incompletely blinded[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or not blinded[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Finally, we performed our study in children while previous studies investigated adults only. Regulation of food intake in adults may differ from that in children[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>Our study also had limitations. Of the 203 participants, 57 children or 28% did not complete the study. However, we found similar results when the data of these 57 children were left out (data not shown). The lack of a statistically significant effect does not exclude that we may have failed to pick up small differences in satiety between beverage groups. However, since the effects were in opposite directions at 1 and 15 minutes after intake, we consider it likely that sugar-free and sugar-sweetened beverages did not lead to systematically different levels of satiety. The dietary status of our children was less standardized than in previous studies which included an overnight fast plus a standardized breakfast[<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Finally, we measured satiety by questionnaire and we did not quantitate actual food intake following the beverage intake[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p> The participants in our study were healthy Dutch children, and most of them were white and of normal weight. Future studies should be done to find out whether our findings hold for other ethnic groups or for obese children. Future studies may also examine the effect on satiety at intervals longer than 15 minutes[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. </p><p> One important question is whether our findings are unique for sugars in liquid form. Short term studies with semi-solid foods such as pudding and jelly suggested that noncaloric sweeteners produced the same degree of satiety as sucrose[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It is unknown whether (covert) removal of solid calories is detected by receptors that determine satiety, although there is evidence that such removal reduces satiety and leads to compensatory intake of calories from other sources[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. </p><p> We found that sugar-sweetened and sugar-free beverages produced similar satiety. Therefore when children are given sugar-free instead of sugar-containing drinks they might not make up the missing calories from other sources. This may explain our previous observation that the children in the sugar-free group accumulated less body fat than those in the sugar group[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0078039.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
