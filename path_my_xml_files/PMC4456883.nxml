It starts at puberty or a few months earlier. The peak incidence is between 14-17 years in women and 16&#x02013;19 years in men.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It seems to be famililial, but owing to the high prevalence of the disease this has been extremely difficult to assess. Nodulocystic acne has been reported to be more common in white males than in black males, and one group of investigators has found that acne is more severe in patients with the XYY genotype.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>It occurs due to alteration in the pattern of keratinization within the sebaceous follicles, level of circulating sex hormones, especially androgens, quantity and quality of sebum secretion, colonization by follicular microbial flora, immunological factors and environmental factors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Increased sebum secretion is associated with the development of acne lesions, since sebum serves as a nutrient source for the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Propionibacterium acnes</italic> (<italic>P. acnes</italic>), a member of the normal skin flora. Microbiological colonization of the sebaceous gland has been identified as a major factor in disrupting the follicular epithelium, in which <italic>P. acnes</italic> produce enzymes such as lipases, proteases, and hyaluronidases leading to subsequent inflammatory reactions in the surrounding dermis.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>It is one of the most common reason for visiting a physician.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Even though it is often perceived as a self-limited and not physically disabling disease of adolescence, its prevalence remains high into adulthood, and its psychological impact can be striking, contributing to lower self-esteem, anxiety, and depression. Consequently, there is significant patient-driven demand for effective acne therapies, including prescribed medications and over-the-counter products. In addition, taking into account the need for long-term treatment, there is increased need for topical medications that are popular with patients in order to achieve long-term compliance. As a result, agents are available in a variety of formulations. These include topical antibiotics, retinoids, and benzoyl peroxide in monotherapy or in combination products. Systemic medications also include antibiotics and retinoids, as well as hormonal agents.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Topical therapy is the standard of care for mild to moderate acne. Retinoids and antimicrobials such as benzoyl peroxide and antibiotics are the mainstay of topical acne therapy. Such treatments are active at application sites, and they can prevent new lesions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>One of the major limitations of topical therapies for acne vulgaris, especially for facial acne, is the relatively high potential for tolerability reactions characterized by visible signs (i.e., erythema, scaling, peeling, edema, dryness, roughness) and/or symptoms (i.e., stinging, burning) of cutaneous irritation. These reactions can result from direct effects of active ingredient (i.e., retinoid, benzoyl peroxide) and/or the characteristics of the vehicle, with patients in some cases electing to discontinue treatment or use therapy intermittently, which usually results in less than optimal therapeutic outcomes.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Combination therapy is likely to have a more significant effect because it targets three major areas of acne pathophysiology: <italic>P. acnes</italic> proliferation, inflammation and hyperkeratinisation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of acne vulgaris and the limitations of the conventional therapies, combination therapy utilizing agents with complementary mechanisms provides the opportunity to target multiple pathogenic causes of acne vulgaris.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>There is no published clinical study which compared three combinations of topical benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and clindamycin 1% gel versus benzoyl peroxide 2.5% gel and nadifloxacin 1% cream versus tretinoin 0.025% and clindamycin 1% gel in patients of acne vulgaris. Hence the present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of standard regimens with benzoyl peroxide and nadifloxacin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS</sc>

It is associated with the high probability of adverse cosmetic and psychosocial effects. Even with the presence of various effective treatments, there is always necessity for nearly harmless, accessible, and most effective treatment options for acne.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Although the present study compares three groups of treatment, which was previously not done still we can evaluate other studies where one of the combination present in our study is compared with some other combination but of same class.</p><p>A study was conducted by Webster <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] where it was found that benzoyl peroxide-clindamycin has high efficacy and good overall tolerability in the topical treatment of patients with mild to moderately severe acne vulgaris. This is in accordance with our present study.</p><p>A study was conducted by Jain <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] where on comparing the efficacy of two combinations benzoyl peroxide-clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide-metronidazole therapy regimes with each other, no statistically significant difference was found. Hence, both of these groups have same efficacy. This finding is might be due to difference of drug (metronidazole) present in combination, which is being compared with combination benzoyl peroxide-clindamycin than our present study.</p><p>Another study conducted by Choudhury <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] where comparison of efficacy of two combinations benzoyl peroxide-nadifloxacin and benzoyl peroxide-clindamycin was done. No differences in total lesion counts was observed among these two groups. Improvements in the IGA scores were more in benzoyl peroxide-nadifloxacin than benzoyl peroxide-clindamycin, but the difference did not reach to statistically significant values. This is not in accordance to the present study due to variations in sample size and compliance of the patients.</p><p>A study was conducted by Shwetha <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] where comparison of efficacy of combination of topical 1% clindamycin and 2.5% benzoyl peroxide was done with 1% clindamycin and 0.1% - adaplene in mild to moderate acne. Here, combination of topical 1% clindamycin and 0.1%-adaplene was found to be more efficacious than the other group. There is dissimilarity in the combinations although clindamycin-retinoid combination is used in both the studies. Clindamycin 1%-adaplene 0.1% is used in the above study and in present study clindamycin 1%-tretinoin 0.025% was used. We cannot correlate this study with this present study as two different retinoids with two different concentrations were used (adaplene 1% in this study and tretinoin 0.025% in present study).</p><p>The present study confirms the efficacy of all the three treatment groups in acne vulgaris. The present study reported a statistically significant total clearance of noninflammatory lesions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and inflammatory lesions (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) by Group A when compared to Group B and Group C, at the end of the study.</p><p>In present study, none of the patient reported any adverse event in Group B and is found to be safest when compared to Group A and Group C. It is in contrary to a previous study where during the safety and tolerability assessment, Group A (Group A) and Group B (Group B), they both were found to be equally well-tolerated.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The limitations of our study could be overcome by a multi-centric, double-blind study of longer duration with simultaneous microbial susceptibility testing. This could further reinforce the scientific evidence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>The incidence of acne vulgaris is very common. Innumerable remedies have been tried, to treat acne, ranging from topical therapies with topical antibiotics, retinoids (retinoic acid), keratolytics (benzoyl peroxide, sulfur) etc., and systemic therapies with oral antibiotics (tetracyclines, doxycycline, erythromycin, minocyclines etc.) or systemic hormonal therapy with corticosteroids. It is previously reported that acne responds well to oral therapies but the main problem is relapse after cessation of therapy. Until now, various regimens have been evolved, still it requires more research to search out the fully proved and most effective therapy.</p><p>In this randomized trial, Group A containing topical benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin, which is a standard regimen was found to be more efficacious than other groups. It produces decrease in the total number of lesions (inflammatory and/or noninflammatory). IGA score reaches to 0 (clear) earlier than the other groups. Group B containing benzoyl peroxide and nadifloxacin was found to be the most safest among all the groups as no treatment emergent dermatological adverse event occurred throughout the study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>
