Degenerative process in aging usually affects cognitive state negatively. The cognitive decline may result in disrupted ability to work, live independently, or maintain normal social interaction, which finally will be diagnosed with dementia. It is expected that more than 16 million of elder adults will suffer dementia until 2050 in the United States. The cost of this developing trend in dementia will be more than 1 trillion dollars.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been established as a transitional syndrome between normal cognitive state and dementia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The reported prevalence of MCI in the elders has been 3&#x02013;42%.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] All of the cognitive domains including memory, language, visuospatial capacity, praxis, and executive function may be impaired by MCI. MCI can be divided into amnestic MCI (a-MCI) and nonamnestic MCI (na-MCI) depending on whether or not memory is impaired.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] These subtypes are further subdivided into &#x0201c;single-domain&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;multi-domain,&#x0201d; depending on the number of cognitive domains impaired.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Comprehensive diagnosis of MCI would be relied on low performances on at least two neuropsychological tests within a cognitive domain. Memory and executive functioning are considered the main cognitive domains for a-MCI and na-MCI, respectively.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Many clinical trials have been proposed to decrease the progression of MCI to dementia with pharmacological or nonpharmacological interventions.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Pharmacological treatments, such as cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, huperzine A, Vitamin E, and <italic>Ginkgo biloba</italic> did not show any benefits to decelerate progression of MCI into dementia.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Nonpharmacological interventions have been also taken into consideration because of lower side effects, patients' preference, and lack of effectiveness of the drugs. Change from a sedentary lifestyle to moderate physical activity has beneficial effects on cognitive functioning, and preliminary evidence suggests that such change may reduce the incidence of dementia.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Among the nonpharmacological therapies in MCI, cognitive rehabilitation (CR) has been highlighted.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] CR is the process of relearning cognitive skills that have been lost due to brain impairment. If skills cannot be relearned, other capacities will be used to compensate the lost cognitive functions.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Some studies have shown that CR interventions may be effective on memory improvement in a-MCI, especially for compensatory strategies of prospective and episodic memory deficits.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In many neurological conditions, CR has been shown to be effective on executive functioning, attention, and speed of information processing.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In multiple sclerosis, CR was effective on the speed of processing.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The effectiveness of CR in acquired brain injury was also reported.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] CR was effective in mild to severe head trauma at any time after trauma.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] CR also had positive effects on the function of the frontal lobe in patients with Parkinson&#x02019;s disease.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, all of the CR interventions have been designed for MCI as a single entity or for a-MCI as a specific subtype. We could not find any rehabilitation trial that was dedicated exclusively for na-MCI. Thus, we sought to evaluate the impact of CR on na-MCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee and the Research Council of the Behavioral Sciences Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.

In na-MCI, information processing would be selected as the probable target for effective rehabilitation programs. Although CR did not show prominent improvement in neuropsychological capacity, it could result in better performance of executive functioning of daily living.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This project was the thesis of Maryam Alavirad, which was funded by the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Research number 393560).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>MB contributed in the conception of the work, conducting the study, supervision of data gathering, interpretation of the results, writing the manuscript, and revising the draft of the final version of the manuscript.
