More rarely, in severe cases, immunosuppressants such as cyclosporin are used [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The Hygiene Hypothesis developed in recent years as one of the possibilities [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] to explain the predisposing role of improved hygiene in the increase of atopic diseases in industrialized countries has opened new therapeutic perspectives. A causal effect is suggested between the decrease in the incidence of infections and the increase in the incidence of AD and, more generally, of allergic diseases [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It was tempting, therefore, to use treatments based on the stimulation of the immune system by derivatives mimicking the effect of bacteria, viruses or parasites as substitute for the &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; role of infections.</p><p>In a first step, it was confirmed that one could effectively prevent experimental models of allergy, such as the development of allergic asthma induced following immunization with ovalbumin, by the administration of killed infectious agents such as mycobacteria [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], or bacterial extracts [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] or probiotics [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This strategy was successfully extended to other models of allergy such as rhinitis [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], food allergy [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and, interestingly enough, also to experimental autoimmune diseases, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], to which the hygiene hypothesis also applies [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Importantly, in experimental models of both allergy and autoimmunity, it has been shown that signaling through single different Toll like receptors (TLR), present at the surface of different immune cells and in particular of antigen-presenting cells (i.e., dendritic cells), fully recapitulates the protective effect of infectious agents [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This suggests that it is not the nature of the microbial agent(s) or extract(s) that matters, but rather the type of TLR receptor(s) that are triggered, which by definition may be common between these agents.</p><p>Based on these experimental results, attempts have been made to apply this strategy to human AD. For obvious reasons it was decided not to use living infectious agents, even though this was attempted in certain autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis using a parasite, <italic>Trichuris suis</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In AD it was mainly the use of probiotics that prevailed. Numerous clinical trials have been published with this approach after the pioneering work of the Finnish group of Kalliomaki [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The results were the subject of controversy because the data were inconsistently reproduced by different groups [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, our recent meta-analysis concluded that probiotics had a real effect on disease prevention, observed in about 30% of patients [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Importantly, these results were mainly obtained when probiotics were administered preventively in children at risk of developing the disease due to atopic heredity. Inconsistent data are presently available on the treatment with probiotics in established AD [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The probiotic approach is interesting but questionable because of the diversity and lack of standardization of the preparations used.</p><p>Another approach, selected in several studies, was to use killed bacteria or bacterial extracts with, however, contrasting results [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Here we report a new clinically innovative approach using a bacterial lysate (i.e, OM-85). The choice of this agent for our trial was based first, on promising results obtained in experimental dysimmune diseases, showing that its adequate administration could recapitulate the protective effect of infections, according to the Hygiene Hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Secondly, OM-85 has been extensively used in the clinic as co-medication in the treatment of acute airways infections with an extremely good safety profile, both in adults and very young children in different countries [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>As described in detail below, our trial was conducted between 2003 and 2006. We are reporting the data today because over the last few years the strategy linked to the use of bacterial derivatives in allergy has regained interest, in particular because of mechanistic studies showing that the bacterial lysate in question is endowed with protective effects linked to stimulation of TLRs [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] (and our unpublished data). This pharmacological effect is novel and timely in the context of the immune mechanisms underlying the Hygiene Hypothesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>The study started in June 2003 and ended in June 2006.

A protection of about 20% versus placebo (standard treatment only), in the occurrence of NFs was observed, in the absence of appreciable side effects. These results were consistent when the per-protocol group of children was considered.</p><p>These results cannot be compared side by side to those obtained with probiotics because, as mentioned above, probiotics have not been largely used in children with established AD. They may, however, be compared to those using killed bacteria or other bacterial extracts. Studies using killed <italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic> were not conclusive [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

No efficacy was observed when the child had two allergic parents, suggesting that when heredity was &#x0201c;strong&#x0201d; the course of disease could less easily be influenced.</p><p>Our results are the first to indicate a clinical efficacy and long-term tolerability of OM-85, an oral bacterial extract, as adjuvant therapy in children with established AD, and for which the significant effect persisted even after major confounders (as corticosteroids use and AD family history) were considered. The adjuvant therapy improved the clinical outcomes of the conventional treatment with corticosteroids of 20%, which must encourage the search for clinical or biological markers to more precisely define the subgroups of responder patients.</p><p>In addition, the analysis of subgroups of patients showed the consistency of the overall results, in the absence of significant heterogeneity across strata.</p><p>These promising results suggest a possible wider use of OM-85 in the treatment of established AD. It is essential, of course, to provide more definite proof by performing further clinical trials, favouring the recruitment of children with moderate forms of AD with familiar history of atopy. Further work is also needed to analyse potential differences between different bacterial lysate preparations. Our results suggest that a mixture of bacterial derivatives might be more effective than a particulate fraction or two bacterial strains in the treatment of moderate AD [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Last but not least, the characterization of suitable immune biomarkers to monitor for treatment effectiveness would represent an invaluable tool to distinguish patient&#x02019;s subgroups presenting differential response to treatment.</p><p>Furthermore, our data together with the results obtained with probiotics, which, as already mentioned, gave rise to a meta-analysis describing a positive result for preventive treatment [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], indicate that non-specific modulation of the immune system by bacteria antigens, both, pathogens and commensal, contributes to reduce AD occurrence and progression, which is in agreement with the Hygiene Hypothesis.</p><p>These therapeutic effects are complementary to the wealth of epidemiological data supporting the Hygiene Hypothesis [<xref rid="pone.0161555.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161555.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain however to be defined, notably the precise nature of the bacterial components involved in the protective effect (i.e., pathogens recognition receptors (PRR) ligands binding to common motifs shared by pathogenic and commensal bacteria).
