Recent diagnostic guidelines have attempted to integrate neuroimaging and other biomarkers. The majority of the neuroimaging research in AD has centred around mesial temporal lobe atrophy, which shows volume loss in hippocampi, amygdala, entorhinal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>; however, none of these markers are straightforward to measure and evaluate and many are suitable only for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Very few studies have focused on the subcallosal grey matter in relation to AD despite the fact that atrophy of this region occurs early and is just as characteristic of AD.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Although the imaging diagnosis for AD is difficult, various studies have shown that hippocampal or mesial temporal lobe atrophy can be quantified by volumetric MRI<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> or visual rating methods<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>; however, volumetric MRI requires rigorous standards for image acquisition and analysis and is not suitable for routine clinical use. Thus far, visual rating methods for measurement have been found to be relatively insensitive for identifying mild AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and often introduce problems of reliability especially when protocols are complex. An increased cella media index has also been described in AD patients, but is relatively non-specific and greatly influenced by the general atrophy state of the brain.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref></p><p>It has been the authors' clinical experience that atrophy of the septal nuclei can commonly be seen in conditions associated with hippocampal atrophy, principally in AD, but also following head injury or in chronic alcohol excess. It was hypothesised that a widening of the interseptal distance (ISD), defined as the minimal distance between the nuclei of each hemisphere, could act as a surrogate marker for atrophy within core regions implicated in AD and other memory disorders. This distance can be measured accurately and easily on axial computed tomography (CT) or MRI at the level of AC-PC (anterior commissure to posterior commissure) line, as the distance between the medial convexities of the septal nuclei, posterior to the anterior cerebral arteries (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig&#x000a0;1</xref>). It was hypothesised that by simple measurement of the ISD, patients with memory disorders can be differentiated from the normal population, so that it can be used as a simple but useful screening tool for AD.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Axial T2-weighted image of an adult brain demonstrating anatomical landmarks for ISD measurement.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0010">Figure&#x000a0;1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Assessment of normal variation of ISD within an unselected hospital population</title><p>To observe the distribution of the ISD within a general population, the ISDs in 250 consecutive patients who had undergone CT of the brain were measured. The CT brain protocol included axial imaging using a GE 750 Discover HD (General Electric Healthcare Milwaukee, IL, USA) 64-slice multidetector CT system of 2.5 mm sections from foramen magnum to vertex (120 kV and 265 mA; 32 cm field of view [FOV]; allowing for a maximum of 2.3 noise factor; 860 mGy average dose). The CT examinations were requested either by general practitioners or hospital doctors for a variety of indications, but not specifically for the diagnosis of memory disorder. All patients' identifiable details were anonymised. Patients with intracranial mass lesions, large infarcts including the middle cerebral artery territory, and a history of neurosurgery that might affect the ISD were excluded. The measurements were done independently by an experienced neuroradiologist and a radiology trainee. Details recorded from the request forms including patient's age, any known diagnosis of AD, dementia, MCI, history of confusion or chronic memory problems as well as excess alcohol use were then recorded after blinded measurement of the ISD of these patients.</p><p>The measurements were then compared between the two for reproducibility analysis by using the analysis of variance method (ANOVA). Both inter-rater coefficient of variation and an intraclass correlation coefficient were calculated. The statistics were performed using the software, SPSS 17.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).</p><p>Using the measurements done by the neuroradiologist, the range and mean of the ISD for patients with known AD, dementia, MCI, history of confusion, or chronic memory problems were compared with those without overt memory problems or history of excess alcohol use using independent <italic>t</italic>-test. Using different cut-off values for the ISD, the sensitivities and specificities were calculated and a receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted. An optimal cut-off value was then defined based on the perceived best combination of sensitivity and specificity.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>Analysis of ISD in patients with known diagnosis of AD</title><p>To test the proposed cut-off value for the ISD, the first 20 patients from a memory clinic database who had a diagnosis of AD were selected for ISD analysis. Identifiable details were removed and patients were anonymised for analysis. All patients met criteria for probable AD based on the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> &#x0201c;Probable AD&#x0201d; reflects the greatest degree of diagnostic certainty that can be reached without neuropathology or biopsy.

Recent proposed modifications based on the use of neuroimaging were not adopted.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> The aim was not to bias the evaluation of ISD by selecting patients based on focal atrophy elsewhere, but to test applicability in the widest sense. The Mini-Mental State Examination scores of these patients ranged from 12 to 27. In all patients, a routine CT brain was available from the standard assessment within the memory clinic. All had been reported in the normal way, noting, for example, white matter lesions and evidence of previous infarction or brain injury, but no volumetric or semi-quantitative assessments of atrophy had been attempted. The ISD for each patient was measured from the CT brain examination by an experienced neuroradiologist.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>Blinded analysis of MCI patients with age-matched healthy control participants</title><p>To assess the value of ISD measurement in MCI, as well as evaluating independence from similar measures of generalised atrophy, a set of 66 datasets taken from a research study investigating structural correlates of ageing and mild cognitive impairment was also examined.

MCI was diagnosed according to the Petersen criteria.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> All had a Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0.5<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and memory impairment, which was confirmed by a score 1.5 standard deviations below the age-corrected population mean for the memory subscore of the Addenbroooke's Cognitive Examination.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Individuals were excluded if they had a known cause of cognitive impairment other than the onset of neurodegenerative disease (e.g., previous head injury, neurological disease, alcohol or substance abuse) and were also excluded if they met diagnostic criteria for non-Alzheimer dementia (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies or frontotemporal lobar degeneration).</p><p>Healthy control participants, with an equivalent age distribution, were recruited from the local community by advertisements posted on the internet and in family physician waiting rooms, newsletters, and mail shots. Exclusion criteria included a history of neurological and/or psychiatric disease, head injury, alcohol and/or drug abuse, memory or other cognitive decline, stroke, large artery or peripheral vascular disease, structural heart disease or heart failure, and contraindications to MRI.</p><p>All individuals gave informed consent to take part in a clinical, imaging, and cognitive study of mild cognitive impairment.

Measurements were rated as difficult in 11 patients. In six very young patients, the septal nuclei were so close to each other that ISD could not be measured accurately. The septal nuclei could not be located confidently in five patients as the anterior cerebral artery could not be separated from the nuclei. To compensate for this problem, after the independent assessment of ISD by the neuroradiologist and trainee, the images from these 11 patients were reviewed together and a reasonable ISD was agreed for each case.</p><p>The reproducibility analysis showed an inter-rater coefficient of variation of 10.5% and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.96 when the measurements of ISD were compared between the neuroradiologist and trainee. This shows that ISD measurement is highly reproducible between assessors irrespective of clinical experience.</p><p>In the original 250 ISD measurements, there were 28 patients where a known diagnosis of AD, dementia, MCI, history of confusion, or chronic memory problems had been noted on the request forms for the CT examination. The mean ISD for these patients was 5.9 mm (2.7&#x02013;11 mm). There were 11 patients with a history of excess alcohol use stated on the CT brain request forms and the mean ISD for them was 4 mm (2.2&#x02013;6.4 mm). The remaining 211 patients were considered a control group without overt memory disorders likely to reflect the general population. The mean ISD in this group was 2.3 mm (0.8&#x02013;9 mm).

It is located on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere nestled inferior to the rostrum of the corpus callosum and anterior to the third ventricle and lamina terminalis. It contains two nearly vertically oriented gyri, the subcallosal area, and the smaller paraterminal gyrus (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig&#x000a0;4</xref>). The septal nuclei are subcortical grey matter nuclei deep to the septal area.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Volume loss of the limbic structures and severe loss of cortical cholinergic innervation&#x000a0;are strongly associated with AD. As the septal area is contiguous with the limbic structures, extending from the temporal lobe, volume loss of limbic structures also affects the septal area. In AD patients, the greatest percentage volumetric loss had been shown to occur in the septal area compared to other limbic structures including the hippocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> MRI-co-registered HMPAO SPET examinations of the brain have shown reduced perfusion in the septal area, as well as other limbic structures in AD patients.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Septal area atrophy can be appreciated on axial CT or MRI as flattening of the normal medial convexity of the septal nuclei, which results in widening of ISD.</p><p>Although measurement of the ISD is straightforward and reproducible, it does require reasonably thin axial sections on CT and MRI. On 2.5 mm sections, the cistern of the lamina terminalis posteriorly, and anterior cerebral artery branches anteriorly, and the anterior paraolfactory sulcus are identified. The septal nuclei then appear as medial convexities. In the normal patient, the CSF space connecting the cistern and the sulcus is thin, and resembles a dumbbell or narrow-stemmed wine glass (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig&#x000a0;1</xref>). In the abnormal case, the CSF space is widened, in contrast to the anterior and posterior interhemispheric fissures and resembles a tumbler. With a little practice, widening of the ISD can be easily identified by both radiologists and clinicians, in routine reviewing of neuroimaging scans. <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig&#x000a0;5</xref> is an example of marked ISD widening, but with closely opposed medial frontal lobes.<fig id="fig5"><label>Figure&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Axial CT and MRI (T2-weighted) brain images of an adult with established AD showing abnormally widened ISD.</p></caption><alt-text id="alttext0030">Figure&#x000a0;5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr5"/></fig></p><p>To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate a simple, quick, and reliable surrogate marker for septal area atrophy, which is a marker for the neurodegenerative states seen in AD and MCI. The results confirmed the study hypothesis that AD and MCI patients have a significantly wider ISD. This would correspond to previous studies that have shown focal atrophy of related &#x0201c;limbic&#x0201d; grey matter regions in AD patients.<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Furthermore, the widened ISD is specific and is relatively independent of age-related cerebral atrophy or small vessel ischaemic damage seen in older patients.</p><p>Although the measurements were done using different imaging techniques, the ISD, in general, was wider in AD patient, than MCI patients. Therefore, by using a cut-off value of 4 mm, more AD patients than MCI patients were identified correctly. The results were similar to MRI volumetric studies showing greater hippocampal volume loss in AD patients to MCI patients.<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The variation of ISD in MCI patients was probably due to the known heterogeneity of MCI. This category includes patients who progress quickly to AD, as well as others who remain stable or who have an alternative disease, which, in some cases, will spare the septal region.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> This is further confirmed by the greater hippocampal atrophy seen in MCI patients who progress quickly to AD than those who do not progress to AD.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> It is speculated that ISD may help in predicting those patients who will progress to AD.</p><p>Differential atrophy in the hippocampal subfields by using a automated segmentation software has been described in a recent study which allows better detection of MCI, compared to conventional mesiotemporal volumetry.<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> However, in this study, we have proposed a quicker and easier quantitative method of identifying AD and MCI which can be used in routine examination, and not only in MRI but also in CT. In many healthcare settings, MRI is less easily accessible than CT, and so there are advantages in having a quick and simple method that can be equally well applied to CT and MRI.</p><p>Other measurements, such as the cella media index, have been described as being useful in AD patients. These relate the width of mesial temporal structures to the width of the whole brain, and are a relatively non-specific marker of atrophy.<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> The ISD is more specific, being a more direct marker of atrophy of affected nuclei; however, it is interesting to speculate on exactly why the ISD is increased in AD. Without a direct volumetric study of the septal area, the increasing distance directly reflects atrophy of the septal nuclei; however, the adjacent brain is intimately involved with memory. For example, the substantia innonimata is directly adjacent to the septal nuclei, and atrophy of the substantia innominata and nucleus of Meynert has been described in AD, with an imaging correlation on MRI.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> It is therefore probably an over-simplification to claim that the association of the imaging observation of a widened ISD is entirely due to loss of neurons confined to the septal nuclei. It is more likely that the observed widening reflects a somewhat more generalised regional atrophy of memory-related cholinergic neurons. The message contained within this paper is that a simple observation, made on routine CT, can identify a large percentage of patients with AD or who are at risk of developing AD. The negative finding is just as important: no patients in the present study with an ISD of &#x0003c;4 mm had AD.</p><p>Most patients with a large ISD (&#x0003e;5 mm) also had characteristic CT findings of enlarged temporal horns, and mesial temporal thinning: these patients are usually straightforward to assess by conventional imaging techniques; however, it is a common and reassuring observation in daily clinical practice to look at the ISD in patients where the mesial temporal lobes are equivocal on routine CT.</p><p>The main limitation of the present study is lack of histopathological verification. Although different studies have shown septal area atrophy in AD patients, the ISD is not a direct volumetric measurement for the septal area, but a surrogate measurement for it. The cross-sectional area of the nuclei or the height of the medial convexity could be measured directly on axial scans, but these measurements would be more complex, time-consuming, prone to interobserver error, and would convey no additional useful measurement compared to ISD measurement. Further research to correlate the ISD with hippocampal and septal area volume in AD and MCI patients has been initiated as a continuation of this study to establish their relationship and to compare superiority of tests.</p><p>The other limitation to the present study was that a full medical history for every patient was not obtained in the initial patient group to observe the variation of ISD in the general population. Memory problems may have been underdiagnosed among these patients as the authors relied solely on the information written in the request forms for the CT brain examination. The referring clinicians might not have included the relevant details of the patients' memory state and so patients with memory problems may have been included within the study's normal range. It was also assumed that patients with any chronic memory problems have a wider ISD than the normal controls; however, a major strength of this study is that this is based in a large and realistic hospital population. Furthermore, by using a cut-off ISD value suggested from the assessment of ISD in the initial patient group, patients with AD and MCI could be differentiated from healthy controls. Of course, there is some overlap between the groups, particularly between the MCI and the AD patients; however no AD patient had an ISD of &#x0003c;4 mm. The cut-off for ISD may be different for varying population groups, and determination of a more accurate population based cut-off value will require further studies on larger but different population groups.</p><p>ISD measurement is a cheap, simple, reliable, and easily reproducible method to measure septal area atrophy as a marker for neurodegenerative states seen in patients with memory problems. It can be used as a simple but valuable tool to differentiate patients with memory problems, in particular AD and MCI, from the normal population, with reasonable accuracy. Widening of the ISD can be easily recognised by both clinicians and radiologists, not only in MRI but also in routine CT brain scans. Use of ISD in routine reporting can act as useful screening test for AD and MCI, and help select patients for further investigations, so that diagnosis can be achieved at an earlier stage.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group
