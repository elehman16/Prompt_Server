The intervention to which clinics are randomised comprises a multi-faceted systems-based package, in which clinics are supported to develop and implement strategies to improve penicillin delivery, aligned with elements of the Chronic Care Model.

Secondary outcomes pertaining to other measures of adherence will be assessed. Within the randomised trial design, a mixed-methods evaluation will be embedded to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, impact and relevance, sustainability, process and fidelity, and performance of the intervention.

Rates in Australia&#x02019;s remote-dwelling Aboriginal populations are amongst the highest reported globally; the rate in school-aged Aboriginal children in Australia&#x02019;s Northern Territory (NT) in 2005&#x02013;2009 was estimated at 150&#x02013;380 per 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Numerous steps have been taken to attempt to reduce the burden of ARF/RHD in Australia. In the NT, this has included: making ARF a notifiable disease; developing and funding a register and control programme to coordinate patient care; developing freely available patient resources, staff training modules and management guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; developing a new smartphone application for ARF diagnosis to help health care staff unfamiliar with the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; and other initiatives. However, the barriers to ARF/RHD prevention remain prevalent and are multi-factorial.</p><p>ARF is a preventable disease caused by an abnormal host immune response that can develop after infection with group A streptococcus, a common cause of pharyngitis and skin sores. Children aged 5&#x02013;14 years are most at risk. In remote NT Aboriginal communities, exposure to pathogenic group A streptococcal strains is frequent, but only a small proportion of individuals develop the autoimmune response causing ARF. Recurrent ARF episodes cause cumulative heart valve damage, leading to RHD and its serious complications: heart failure, atrial fibrillation, requirement for major cardiac surgery for valvular repair, anticoagulation, thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications including stroke, endocarditis and premature mortality. A recent NT study demonstrated that after a first ARF diagnosis, 61 % of people developed RHD within 10&#x000a0;years, and of those nearly 30 % progress to heart failure within 5&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given the young age of disease onset the morbidity burden and cost to society is very high.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Secondary prophylaxis</title><p>Strategies for ARF prevention exist at the primordial, primary, secondary and tertiary levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Secondary prevention is the strategy with the best-proven efficacy and cost-effectiveness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This comprises regular antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent further streptococcal infections, and hence ARF recurrences, among individuals after their first ARF diagnosis. The standard recommended antibiotic regimen is 4-weekly intramuscular injections of benzathine (long-acting) penicillin G, for 10&#x000a0;years after the last ARF episode or until age 21, whichever is longer. Longer durations are required in people with moderate to severe RHD. This strategy significantly reduces ARF recurrence rates compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] or oral penicillin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. It forms the cornerstone of the World Health Organisation&#x02019;s RHD prevention strategy globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the Australian guidelines locally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>It is believed that the most effective way to govern delivery of secondary prophylaxis, as well as other elements of ARF/RHD clinical care, is via register-based control programmes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The NT RHD Control Programme and Register were established in the north of the NT in 1997.</p><p>A key challenge exists in improving adherence to secondary prophylaxis. Individuals should ideally receive every scheduled injections to ensure continual protection from streptococcal infection and subsequent ARF episodes. A more achievable target is &#x02265;80 % of scheduled injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], yet the proportion of clients with ARF/RHD achieving this target in the NT in 2009 was only 23 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Adherence</title><p>Adherence is a major theme in the discussion of chronic disease management in Australian Indigenous people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Determinants of adherence can be understood within the key domains of socioeconomic factors, health systems, medications including adverse effects, clients and the medical condition itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Adherence to ARF/RHD secondary prophylaxis, a directly-observed, health care provider-administered injection, includes unique additional challenges: the treatment is an often painful needle-prick; health care staff turnover in remote clinics is exceptionally high, and their knowledge of ARF/RHD is often poor; patient populations are young and mobile; health literacy tends to be low; and furthermore, patient traditional knowledge, world view and expectations of health care differ from what is offered by traditional Western medical models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Two small studies in northern Australia found that adherence among Aboriginal clients with ARF/RHD appeared unrelated to their health literacy or to fear of injections, but instead to their relationship with primary care staff and the presence of active recall systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>At the health centre level, important determinants of adherence identified in other studies include a culture free from institutional racism, with a degree of community control, strong leadership and opportunities for building the capacity of local workforce [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. A Cochrane review of the international literature on adherence support initiatives found only modest benefits, even from quite labour-intensive strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Such findings set a challenge for studies such as ours. However, adherence to an administered injection provides an opportunity for creative, multi-dimensional health-centre-based strategies, and the existing evidence base for improving health service delivery in our setting (see below) provides optimism that a carefully planned strategy can be successful.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The chronic care model</title><p>The logical approach to improving secondary prophylaxis uptake in the NT setting would comprise an intervention targeting the recognised challenges to secondary prophylaxis adherence, with a key focus on health service delivery. We have selected the Chronic Care Model (CCM) as a scaffold for implementing an intervention package at participating health centres. The CCM is a comprehensive system approach for chronic disease management, incorporating six domains: health systems, delivery system design, decision support, clinical information systems, self-management support and community linkages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The CCM is appropriate since although individual ARF episodes are by definition acute, the required management (long-term regular secondary prophylaxis and engagement with health services) is synonymous with chronic disease management, and the long-term complication, RHD, is chronic. The advantage of the CCM is that it is a &#x02018;whole-system&#x02019; model targeting both the client and the health service. It is also the current framework for the NT Chronic Disease Strategy and, therefore, situates the study well within current practices; this should enhance local transferability if the trial is successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Continuous quality improvement processes</title><p>One approach which has been successfully adopted in the NT to achieve systems change at health clinics has been systematic continuous quality improvement (CQI) activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. CQI strategies engaging primary health staff have been shown to improve health outcomes in remote clinics in the NT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Health systems improvements providing a &#x02018;comprehensive-care programme&#x02019; were shown to reduce ARF rates in the USA as long as four decades ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and reductions in ARF burdens have been achieved in Cuba and the Caribbean with programmes combining community education strategies with health care improvements (e.g. development of a register, education for health staff) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Specifically, regarding ARF/RHD in the NT, we have shown that application of a CQI process over 3&#x000a0;years at six remote clinics in the NT led to small but statistically significant improvements in some proximal outcome measures for ARF/RHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Tools used included an audit tool allowing clinics to monitor their delivery of services to ARF/RHD clients, and a &#x02018;systems assessment tool&#x02019; addressing systemic impediments to RHD service delivery. These tools are contained within the National Centre for Quality Improvement in Indigenous Primary Health Care (&#x02018;One21seventy&#x02019;) package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our study showed substantial variability between sites in their delivery of RHD services, and in the strategies they used to promote RHD service delivery. Factors associated with performance in these clinics are listed in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> (listed in order of amenability to change). Many could potentially be addressed using existing resources.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of factors influencing performance of six remote Northern Territory health centres in delivering services to clients with acute rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease (ARF/RHD)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Determinants of relatively good performance</th><th>Determinants of relatively poor performance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#x02022; Clear allocation of responsibility for rheumatic heart disease (RHD) care among health centre staff<break/>&#x02022; Good regional management &#x02013; commitment to continuous quality improvement (CQI), resourcing for CQI<break/>&#x02022; Effective feedback and management action in response to feedback from CQI process<break/>&#x02022; Good Aboriginal health worker involvement in health centre operations<break/>&#x02022; Good outreach arrangements &#x02013; including drivers, Aboriginal health workers<break/>&#x02022; Public health-oriented chronic disease support from regional level to health centres<break/>&#x02022; Staff stability and continuity, including availability of experienced general practitioner</td><td>&#x02022; Client flows in health centres do not direct ARF/RHD clients to staff responsible for RHD care<break/>&#x02022; Lack of clear allocation of responsibility for RHD care<break/>&#x02022; Lack of effective outreach services<break/>&#x02022; Changes and inefficiencies in clinical information systems<break/>&#x02022; Lack of regular/stable staffing, including general practitioner service<break/>&#x02022; Health centre management turnover, unstable management structure<break/>&#x02022; Larger number of clients, complexities of urban environment</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Another recent study in NT remote clinics implemented a Chronic Conditions Management Model, comprising decision support for health care staff and provision of simple, coloured (&#x02018;traffic light&#x02019;) reports to monitor the alignment of a clinic&#x02019;s performance with goals. This was associated with improved patient outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The authors concluded that even in Australia&#x02019;s most challenging primary health care contexts, improvements were achievable by identifying clear goals, and providing staff with support and feedback including reports generated from the clinic&#x02019;s own data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. CQI processes, under the CCM domain of clinical information systems, will be integrated into our study&#x02019;s intervention package; this will include 3-monthly feedback to clinic staff of adherence rates of their ARF/RHD clients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Objectives</title><p>Given the major burden posed by ARF/RHD for Aboriginal people in the NT, the proven benefit of secondary prevention with regular penicillin injections, but the challenges of delivering secondary prevention effectively, we therefore aim to improve the uptake of secondary prophylaxis among people with ARF/RHD. The predicted consequences of improved uptake are reduced rates of recurrent ARF episodes and mitigation of RHD development or progression. The primary objective is to test whether an intervention to optimise health systems can improve adherence to secondary prophylaxis for RHD. Objectives of the mixed-methods evaluation are to test efficiency, effectiveness, impact and relevance, sustainability, process and fidelity, and performance of the intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a stepped-wedge, community randomised trial with an open cohort design. Key characteristics of the trial are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. A stepped-wedge trial is a type of cluster randomised trial in which &#x02018;clusters receive the intervention at different time points, the order in which they receive it is randomised, and data are collected from clusters over time&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The open cohort means that individuals may leave during the trial (no longer require ARF/RHD secondary prophylaxis, die or move to a non-study community), or may become eligible during the trial (receive a new diagnosis of ARF/RHD requiring secondary prophylaxis). Steps of 3&#x000a0;months&#x02019; duration were chosen to provide a feasible total study duration whilst providing adequate time for project staff to accomplish intensive visits for incoming clusters. A lag time of 3&#x000a0;months has been anticipated between commencing the intervention and onset of a perceivable effect, hence data collection for quantitative measures during the intervention period will commence 3&#x000a0;months after the onset of the intensive phase for each cluster, providing a 12-month period. Since the intervention is applied at the health centre level, within-cluster correlation has been accounted for in the sample size calculation. Observations will be made on individuals (number of penicillin injections, as documented routinely by the RHD Register, before, during and after the intervention), so the effect of the intervention will be assessed on a within-client basis. Within the randomised trial design, mixed-methods evaluation will take place to address the study objectives.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Characteristics of the &#x02018;Improving Secondary Prophylaxis&#x02019; stepped-wedge trial</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Term/Trial characteristic</th><th>Definition</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Unit</td><td>Aboriginal health centres</td></tr><tr><td>Cluster</td><td>Pairs of health centres</td></tr><tr><td>Individuals</td><td>People with ARF/RHD who require secondary prophylaxis with penicillin, whose primary health centre is enrolled in the study</td></tr><tr><td>Timing of start of exposure</td><td>Groups of individuals (all individuals managed by a given community clinic) are first exposed at one of a number of discrete time points</td></tr><tr><td>Duration of exposure</td><td>Fixed length: 15&#x000a0;months per clinic</td></tr><tr><td>Measurement</td><td>Repeated measurements from individuals: record of every penicillin injection received, as documented in the ARF/RHD Register</td></tr><tr><td>Duration of trial</td><td>3.5&#x000a0;years</td></tr><tr><td>Number of clinics per cluster</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Total number of clusters</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Pre-roll out period</td><td>11 to 25&#x000a0;months</td></tr><tr><td>Roll out period</td><td>15&#x000a0;months</td></tr><tr><td>Post-rollout period</td><td>3 to 15&#x000a0;months</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

Each community of adequate size has one health centre (clinic), the sole provider of health care for the community. Towns each have one Aboriginal Health Service but additional mainstream medical services are also available.

While necessarily being tailored to local situations, we aim for homogeneity of approaches to ensure similarity of the intervention across sites; this is aided by aligning activities under the six themes of the CCM. All efforts are made to ensure that the exposure to (&#x02018;dose&#x02019; of) the intervention is uniform across clusters: the duration of intensive phase is identical for each cluster, and the number of scheduled site visits or of episodes of telephone support provided by project staff is uniform. In supporting implementation of the intervention, the research team work closely with health centre staff, CQI facilitators and the NT RHD Control Programme. The action plan is implemented by the health centre staff, supported by the project team. A project team member visits the community monthly, for 1 to 3&#x000a0;days per trip.

This number of clients will provide more than 90 % power to detect a doubling of the rate, if the pre-intervention rate is higher than 20 %. We estimated that health centres at up to 12 communities would be required to ensure a minimum of 300 clients diagnosed with ARF/RHD requiring secondary prophylaxis with penicillin.</p><p>The sample size is conservative (i.e. potentially larger than required) as it was calculated based on estimated between-client differences rather than within-client differences, which are usually smaller. That is, since change within a person is what is being measured, and within-client differences (variability within a person) are usually less than between-client differences (variability between people), and lower variance is associated with a lower required sample size, this study will, therefore, be well-powered. We have chosen an ambitious target (doubling the proportion of clients receiving 80 % or more of their scheduled injections) because a complex intervention such as this needs to show a substantial, clinically meaningful benefit if it is to be more widely recommended. The ratio of female to male ARF/RHD clients is approximately 1.3 to 1.

The random allocation code was generated by the statistician investigator (AK), using StataCorp 2015 Stata Statistical Software: Release 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). The pairing of health centres was chosen prior to randomisation on grounds of geographical proximity to facilitate travel and minimise project costs, given the very large distances involved. The investigators and the health centres will be informed of the next two centres to commence after the previous centres have been enrolled, to maximise allocation concealment, but also permit adequate time for logistical planning.</p><p>This design ensures that all health centres will receive the potential benefits of the intervention while using a robust design (randomisation to intervention timing), and maximising efficiency (study personnel can provide intensive support for different health centres sequentially) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Data</title><p>Data sources chiefly include the NT RHD Register for quantitative analyses, and semi-structured interviews and project officer reports for qualitative analyses.

RHD is responsible for an unacceptably high burden of premature morbidity and mortality in Indigenous Australians, and disadvantaged populations globally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Improved secondary prevention would make a major contribution to reducing this disease burden. This study is occurring within a coordinated body of work seeking to develop for the first time a comprehensive, evidence- based strategy for ending RHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Feasibility of the study is facilitated by the broad expertise of the investigator team, spanning clinical practice, quantitative research, statistical methods, qualitative methods, health services research and evaluation.</p><p>Community engagement and recruitment of consenting health centres took place during 2012 and 2013. The required sample size of ARF/RHD clients on secondary prophylaxis was exceeded after enrolment of 10 sites; in fact the number of total clients at study commencement within the first 10 sites to consent was 408 (minimum sample size&#x02009;=&#x02009;300); hence, the study should be well-powered to determine any difference in the primary outcome measure. A broad representation of community sizes, locations and governance structures exists within the 10 participating communities.</p><p>Methodological challenges encountered during implementation of this study to date have arisen related to the stepped-wedge design, the type of &#x02018;treatment&#x02019; to which clinics are randomised, and from the study environment. Time lags are an important challenge to address in stepped-wedge designs. We have observed that the time lag between intensive phase start date at a given site and when the intervention may plausibly start having measurable effects, not just on clinic processes but also on patients, is likely to be variable from site to site. We also recognise that clinics may struggle to develop and enact their action plan in accordance with study timelines and may, therefore, need to adjust subsequent study milestones at given sites accordingly.</p><p>A specific challenge and potential limitation for a trial in which the &#x02018;treatment&#x02019; is an intervention package is that of fidelity&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;the degree to which the intervention is delivered as intended. Substantial efforts have been made to achieve homogeneity of the intervention across sites, including the components as devised and delivered at individual clinics, and the &#x02018;dose&#x02019; (amount of support received by the project officers). However, there are inevitable variations, and we acknowledge that careful documentation of fidelity and dose are required to ensure that results will be interpretable regarding associations between intervention components and outcomes. However, such a challenge should not prevent complex interventions being subjected to rigorous study designs such as clinical trials.</p><p>Patient movements comprise another challenge. Aboriginal people frequently spend time in two or more communities. The RHD Register nominates one clinic as a person&#x02019;s primary clinic (where the majority of their injections are administered) and secondary clinic(s) are also recorded. In documenting patient movements (new diagnoses, deaths, people moving from one site to another such that their primary clinic is reassigned), preliminary findings suggest a substantial number of movements are occurring. Such movements in and out of the cohort will need to be taken account of in analyses.</p><p>Characteristics of the study sites include very high staff turnover at health centres, and frequent disruption of clinic activities due to other priorities in communities, in particular funerals, which may result in closure of the clinic for some days in respect of ceremonial activities. We have found additional challenges in creating a metric for the measurement of staff turnover, and also in creating a metric for community remoteness or disadvantage. Health centre staff are busy with clinical commitments and complex acute care management, and there is the potential for them to suffer research fatigue due to the high number of studies being conducted at their sites. We are aware of this potential issue and have sought to demonstrate how this study can be directly beneficial to enrolled sites, and to be flexible in our approach; however, flexibility can pose a threat to intervention fidelity.</p><p>Improving the delivery of secondary prophylaxis is the major priority in ARF/RHD control in Australia and globally to reduce deaths and suffering from RHD. The model we are trialling is designed to fit within current structures of health service delivery, and to require minimal additional resources. The study design is rigorous, the primary endpoint (proportion who receive &#x02265;80 % of injections) is of clinical importance for individual clients, and the evaluation will also allow us to determine the broader benefits of the intervention, along with any shortcomings. If successful, there is a high likelihood of the model being adapted into routine service delivery; the study investigators are well-aligned with policy-makers able to promote uptake of the research findings. Success in improving adherence in this study may also have important relevance to adherence to medications for other chronic diseases&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;leading causes of the large difference in life expectancy between Australia&#x02019;s Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. It will also provide guidance for improved RHD care internationally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial is underway.
