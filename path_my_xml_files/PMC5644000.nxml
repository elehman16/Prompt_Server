It is a complex mixture of 50% resins, 30% waxes, 10% essential oils, 5% pollen, and 5% of various organic compounds. The word propolis is derived from the Greek word <italic>pro</italic> (meaning &#x0201c;in front of&#x0201c;) and <italic>polis</italic> (meaning &#x0201c;community&#x0201d;).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Propolis has been extensively used by man since ancient times due to the outstanding therapeutic properties it has. Egyptians used bee glue to embalm their cadavers, Greek and Roman physicians used it as mouth disinfectant and as an antiseptic and healing product in wound treatment. It was also used by many Arab physicians. It was listed as an official drug in the London pharmacopoeias of the 17<sup>th</sup> century. Propolis became very popular in Europe between the 17<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> centuries due to its antibacterial activity. In the end of 19<sup>th</sup> century, propolis was widely used due to its healing properties.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Currently, several propolis products are being used worldwide including capsules (either pure or combined with aloe gel or pollen), extracts (hydroalcoholic or glycolic), mouthwash solutions, throat lozenges, creams, powder, and also in more purified products from which the wax was removed.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The several therapeutic properties of propolis include antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anesthetic, anticariogenic, antifungal, antiprotozoan, and antiviral.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The principal compounds responsible for biological activities of propolis are flavonoids, aromatic acids, diterpenic acids, and phenolic compounds.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>However, propolis cannot be used directly as raw material and a simple fractionation to obtain compounds is difficult due to its complex composition. Hence, to solve this problem, the usual procedure is the use of a solvent, which should remove the inert material and preserve the desired compound. Solvents used for propolis are water, methanol, ethanol, chloroform, dichloromethane, ether, and acetone, out of which ethanol is the most common solvent choice.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] The active substances of propolis are easily soluble in ethanol.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The concept of bacterial specificity in periodontal infections has been largely accepted. A susceptible host, the presence of periodontopathogens, and the absence of beneficial species are considered to be the three factors responsible for the establishment of an active periodontal infection. Periodontopathogens have been found to spread subgingivally, including at sites without clinical loss of periodontal attachment. Hence, in a normal periodontal treatment strategy, a reinfection of a disinfected area might well occur before the completion of the treatment. Thus, one-stage full mouth disinfection (OSFMD) is preferred as an adjunct to scaling and root planning (SRP) as it aims to eradicate or reduce the periodontopathogens in all the intraoral niches and it also reduces the probability of intraoral transmission of periodontopathogens from one niche to the other.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>This study aims to examine the result of OSFMD with 20% propolis hydroalcoholic solution, both clinically and microbiologically, after 24 h of SRP when compared to SRP alone in chronic periodontitis patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Thirty systemically healthy patients, who came to the Outpatient Department of Periodontology of Rungta College of Dental Sciences and Research, Bhilai, were selected for the study. All the patients were in the age group of 25&#x02013;55 years of either sex and they were diagnosed with chronic periodontitis having three or more nonadjacent teeth with pockets &#x02265;5 mm. All patients were otherwise systemically healthy, nonsmokers, and nontobacco users. None of the patients had undergone subgingival instrumentation within 12 months before the baseline examination, had compromised medical conditions which required prophylactic antibiotic coverage, or had used antimicrobial agents 4 months before the study. Patients who were uncooperative and showed unacceptable oral hygiene were excluded from the study. Furthermore, patients who had ongoing drug therapy, which might affect the clinical symptoms of periodontitis, were not included in the study.</p><p>The clinical parameters of the study included gingival index (GI),[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] plaque index (PI),[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] modified sulcus bleeding index,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] probing pocket depth (PPD), and clinical attachment level (CAL). The microbiological parameters included the microbiological counts of <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> (Aa), <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic> (Pi), and <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> (Pg).</p><p>All of the thirty patients were randomly allocated into two groups &#x02013; the test group (15 patients) and the control group (15 patients). The control group was subjected to SRP alone whereas the test group was subjected to OSFMD, using 20% propolis hydroalcoholic solution, 24 h after SRP. The clinical and microbiological parameters were recorded at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks, respectively.</p><p>The propolis extract powder was commercially bought and stored at room temperature and then it was mixed with 99.8% (v/v) ethanol in hermetically sealed glass vessels at a ratio of 1 g of propolis powder to 3 ml of ethanol. Vessels were then incubated for 1 week at room temperature in darkness, with constant agitation. The resulting ethanol solutions were clarified by centrifugation at 7000 g for 60 s, and the supernatants were collected and filtered through Whatman #4 filter paper. Ethanol-soluble components were then collected by evaporation to dryness. The extracts were re-dissolved in pure ethanol to obtain 20% (w/v) solutions. The final solutions were stored in hermetically sealed brown-glass bottles at room temperature.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>At baseline, all the clinical parameters were recorded [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1a</xref>]. The subgingival plaque samples were taken from the deepest pockets. All samples were taken from an undisturbed subgingival flora and after removal of the supragingival plaque. Before being sampled, the sites were isolated from saliva by the application of cotton rolls. Then, sterile paper points were inserted into the selected pockets and kept in place for at least 10 s [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2a</xref>]. Following removal, the paper points were transferred into a screw-capped vial containing 1 ml of transport medium.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Then, the samples were cultured for Aa, Pg, and Pi as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>. All the patients underwent SRP followed by recall of test group patients 1 day after SRP for OSFMD using the 20% propolis hydroalcoholic solution. OSFMD involves brushing the dorsum of the tongue for 60 s with the solution and rinsing the mouth twice with the solution for 1 min followed by repeated subgingival irrigation of all the pockets by means of a syringe with a blunt needle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2b</xref>].[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] All the patients were recalled after 4 weeks and 12 weeks and again the clinical parameters were recorded [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1b</xref>].

Due to its strong, anti-infective activity, propolis has often been called a &#x0201c;natural antibiotic.&#x0201d; However, only a few studies have examined the antimicrobial properties of propolis against periodontopathogens. Some studies have shown the advantages of using full mouth disinfection as an adjunct to SRP.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] To our knowledge, there is no study in which full mouth disinfection has been done using propolis. Hence, this study was done to find out the effects of full mouth disinfection of propolis solution using both clinical and microbiological parameters.</p><p>In our study, we found that the PI and GI values were similar at baseline in both the groups; however, in the test group, the values were similar or reduced after 12 weeks as compared to those after 4 weeks, unlike in the control group where the values increased after 12 weeks as compared to 4 weeks. Furthermore, the number of sites with bleeding on probing greatly reduced in the test group. This indicates the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects provided by propolis extract even after 12 weeks of commencement of treatment. Furthermore, there was a greater reduction of PPD in the test group when compared to the control group. Similarly, there was a greater gain in the CAL in the test group [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Graph 1</xref>]. This might be due to the tissue regeneration properties of propolis including healing which are possibly due to the antioxidant activity of propolis.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Microbiologically, the reduction in the number of colony-forming units (CFUs) per microliter was consistent in the test group after 12 weeks, unlike the control group where the number of CFU per microliter seemed to increase after 4 weeks [Graphs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">4</xref>]. This might be due to the long-lasting effect of propolis leading to a change in the repopulation process occurring in the periodontal pocket.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Graph 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of clinical attachment level</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-416-g007"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Graph 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of reduction in microorganism <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-416-g008"/></fig><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Graph 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of reduction in microorganism <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-416-g009"/></fig><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Graph 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of reduction in microorganism <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="CCD-8-416-g010"/></fig><p>Quirynen <italic>et al</italic>. in 1995 in his study examined both clinically and microbiologically, whether full-mouth disinfection within 24 h significantly improved the outcome of periodontal treatment. He divided ten patients into a test group (full mouth disinfection with chlorhexidine [CHX] after SRP) and a control group (only SRP). He concluded that the OSFMDD with CHX showed significant clinical (pocket reduction) and microbiological (shift toward a more beneficial flora) advantages on a short-term basis.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Some of the propolis studies had similar results to this study, for example, a study of Dodwad and Kukreja in 2011[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] compared propolis-containing mouth rinse with 0.2% CHX (positive control) and with saline (negative control). They found out that CHX mouthwash was better than propolis and saline in inhibiting plaque formation and propolis was found to be only marginally better than CHX in improving gingival scores. They suggested that propolis might be used as a natural mouthwash instead of chemical mouthwashes such as CHX. Coutinho in 2012[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared the effect of propolis irrigation with that of irrigation with placebo and no irrigation in the same patient. She found that there were better results when propolis was irrigated into the pockets and concluded that subgingival irrigation with propolis extract as an adjuvant to periodontal treatment was more effective than SRP. Akca <italic>et al</italic>. in 2016[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in his <italic>in vitro</italic> study compared the antimicrobial effectiveness of ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) to CHX gluconate on different types of microorganisms and the results revealed that propolis was more effective in inhibiting Gram-positive bacteria than the Gram-negative bacteria in their planktonic state and it was suggested that EEP could be as effective as CHX on oral microorganisms in their biofilm state. The main limitations of our study were a small sample size that has been taken for the study and the short-term follow-up period. Furthermore, freshly prepared solutions should be used for each patient before OSFMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on our result, it can be concluded that both clinically and microbiologically, OSFMD using propolis solution as an adjunct to SRP was found to be better when compared to SRP alone in the treatment of chronic periodontitis patients. The increasing interest toward natural therapies, effective and healthy pharmacological compounds is a stimulus for further research on propolis. Further long-term randomized clinical trials are needed to establish the efficacy of propolis as a full mouth disinfection agent.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the staff of Rungta College of Dental Sciences and Research.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fokt</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Pereira</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferreira</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cunha</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Aguiar</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Mendez-Vilas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>How do bees prevent hive infections?
