Conversely, repeated esophageal exposure to capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce may reduce the efficiency of esophageal secondary peristalsis. Repeated capsaicin infusion may therefore reduce the protection of the esophagus by hampering the clearing of residue substance or refluxate in the esophagus, which may in turn prolong acid clearance in patients with GERD.</p><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Secondary peristalsis is triggered by esophageal distension when food, liquid or air is retained in the esophagus after a failed primary peristaltic event or a reflux from the stomach[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is important to maintain an empty esophagus by clearing the bulk of the volume of the refluxate after a reflux event[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In order to prevent prolonged acid contact time in the esophagus[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], secondary peristalsis helps normalize esophageal pH together with primary peristalsis and swallowed saliva[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is suggested in human esophagus that both mucosal and muscular mechanoreceptors are involved in triggering secondary peristalsis which arises from a reflex arc mediated by a vagal afferent pathway[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) have considerably abnormal secondary peristaltic response rates when compared with aged matched controls[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. By application of mid-esophageal injections of water and air, it was shown that GERD was characterized with defective triggering of secondary peristalsis[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. We have recently studied secondary peristalsis in patients with GERD using mid-esophageal air stimulation with different speeds[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. We notice that there is a substantial defect of activation of secondary peristalsis in a subgroup of GERD patients with significant esophageal dysmotility, indicating that increasing severity of failed primary peristalsis along with defective triggering of secondary peristalsis contributes to impaired esophageal clearance in patients with GERD[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Despite its effect of enhancing secondary peristalsis when acutely administered to the esophageal mucosa[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], we have recently demonstrated that repeated intra-esophageal infusion of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce indeed inhibited secondary peristalsis in healthy adults with reducing induction of heartburn symptoms[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The likelihood of secondary peristaltic response by abrupt air injection was increased by transient capsaicin infusion, but reduced by repeated capsaicin infusion. By characterizing esophageal desensitization as induced by repeated capsaicin infusion in modulation of secondary peristalsis in human esophagus, our recent work provides further insight in understanding the physiological basis of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV<sub>1</sub>) mediated chemosensitivity and mechanosensitivity in human esophagus[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that heartburn perception and physiological characteristics of secondary peristalsis can differently be influenced by acute or repetitive intra-esophageal infusion of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce in GERD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>In this prospective study, we enrolled consecutive patients with GERD who were previously diagnosed as having reflux disease by the presence of typical symptoms associated with positive endoscopy findings[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] or documented abnormal acid exposure on 24-hour pH monitoring. All patients had typical reflux symptoms lasting for more than 6 mo. We excluded subjects with the following clinical conditions: (1) esophageal strictures; (2) previous gastrointestinal surgery; (3) presence of systemic diseases that might interfere with esophageal motility; (4) chronic use of medications known to affect esophageal motility; and (5) intolerance and/or lack of cooperation with entire protocol. Prior to the study, all subjects did not use any medication that might affect gastrointestinal motility. This study was performed after approval by Research Ethics Committee of Hualien Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Hualien, Taiwan and written informed consent was obtained from the participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Esophageal manometry</title><p>Stationary esophageal manometry was performed using a Koenigsberg 4-channel probe (Sandhill Scientific, Inc., Highlands Ranch, CO, United States). The catheter with 4.5 mm in diameter includes a circumferential solid-state pressure sensor at 5 cm and three unidirectional pressure sensors at 10, 20, and 25 cm from the tip. The infusion port is in the mid esophagus with its location between 15 and 20 cm from the tip. Each subject had the catheter inserted transnasally into the esophagus up to a depth of 60 cm. Then, we used stationary pull-through technique to withdraw the catheter until that the most distal sensor was located in the high-pressure zone of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Data of the entire study were then recorded and stored on the computer. Swallowing was detected by the most proximal channel of the catheter, which was located in the pharynx in order to distinguish primary and secondary peristalsis.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>After an overnight fast, secondary peristalsis was recorded 10 min after esophageal infusion of saline and capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce, or 2 sessions of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce on two separate days. Tested solutions including 5 mL of red pepper sauce (Tabasco, McIlhenny Company, Avery Island, LA, United States), diluted with 15 mL of saline and 20 mL of 0.9% saline were infused into the mid-esophagus <italic>via</italic> the manometric catheter at a rate of 10 mL/min with a randomized and double-blind fashion. We wrapped the syringe in aluminum foil in order to mask characteristic colors of different infusions. Subjective symptoms including nausea, heartburn, stick and pain were evaluated with a visual analogue scale score (VAS) (0-100) shortly after each session of the infusion. The total amount of infused red pepper sauce suspension (5 mL of Tabasco) was equivalent to 0.84 mg of pure capsaicin[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Secondary peristalsis was generated by the air injection into the esophagus conducted first by a slow air injection with an infusion pump attached to the manometric catheter at a rate of 0.25 mL/s. We measured total amount of volume tested with the pump machine based on the rate and time for air injection to induce secondary peristalsis. Secondary peristalsis was then performed with rapid air injection, in which 1-mL volume was started and gradually increased by 1-mL increments until the activation of a secondary peristalsis or the volume of the injection reached 20 mL. The threshold volumes for air injections were measured as the minimal injection volume allowed for triggering a secondary peristaltic pressure wave[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Then, secondary peristaltic response was determined by ten times of 20 mL of air injections. We determined overall secondary peristaltic response with an interval of 20 s, during which each subject refrained from any swallow. Each subject was allowed to take a dry swallow to clear any residual air inside the esophagus and to avoid any swallow during next air injection at the end of 20 s.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Successful secondary peristalsis was recognized if the pressure wave was greater than 12 mmHg in the proximal esophagus and was greater than 25 mmHg in the distal esophagus with normal propagation[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The minimal latency of wave onset between two adjacent channels was 0.5 s. We analyzed the data in the same manner for both slow and rapid injections[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. For measuring esophageal wave amplitude (mmHg) and duration (s), the recording sites were located 5 cm above upper margin of the LES.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We assessed the normality of all data by D&#x02019;Agostino&#x02019;s &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. All data including amplitude, duration, VAS score, and threshold volumes of secondary peristalsis were present as mean &#x000b1; SEM, and were compared by a paired <italic>t</italic>-test. Data for successful peristaltic response as induced by rapid air injection were analyzed and compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and were shown as median with interquartile range. Data for peristaltic wave amplitude and duration were compared for distal esophagus. Statistical significance was determined if <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 19 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., IL, United States).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>We studied 17 reflux patients who met the enrollment criteria and entered the study between Dec 1, 2012 and Nov 31, 2013. Ten patients (4 females, mean age 42 years, range 20-64) completed the entire protocol with different session of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce infused to the esophagus without any complication. Of the patients with GERD, 8 patients with reflux esophagitis, LA grade A and 2 patients had normal endoscopy. The most frequent cause of exclusion from this study is intolerance to the protocol due to esophageal infusion with capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce.</p><sec><title>Symptom perception and distension thresholds of secondary peristalsis</title><p>Infusion of capsaicin significantly increased the VAS score for heartburn symptom in patients with GERD when compared with saline infusion (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

However, secondary peristalsis is inhibited by repetitive esophageal infusion with capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce. Although this study supports the evidence that capsaicin sensitive afferents mediate heartburn symptom and secondary peristaltic thresholds, none of motility parameters of secondary peristalsis is influenced by acute or repeated esophageal infusion with capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce.</p><p>In this study, we found that heartburn symptoms in GERD patients were enhanced by rapid esophageal infusion of red pepper sauce, but was suppressed by repeated infusion of red pepper sauce. Our findings are in line with previous study which demonstrated the activation of heartburn symptom in non-GERD subjects with intra-esophageal instillation of capsaicin at a dose equivalent to 0.84 mg[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, we have recently observed that repeated esophageal exposure to red pepper sauce reduced the intensity of heartburn symptom in healthy volunteers[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The findings are in agreement with an earlier work in GERD patients that also noticed an analgesic effect in perceiving heartburn after repeated stimulation with the capsaicin[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Together with these findings, it is conceivable that the perception of heartburn symptom is likely to be <italic>via</italic> TRPV<sub>1</sub> receptor as established in our previous work[<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although sensitization of TRPV<sub>1</sub> receptor is important for mediating perception of heartburn symptom[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], this receptor may also become desensitized after the continued presence of capsaicin[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Capsaicin is known to be an intrinsic primary afferent neurons excitant and a neurochemical substance that initially activates and later desensitizes afferent pathways[<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been demonstrated in Pavlov&#x02019;s esophageal fistula dog that the cephalic phase of gastric secretion can be modulated in condition when the pharynx was bypassed[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this study, we found that repeated esophageal infusion of capsaicin selectively attenuated secondary peristalsis activated by rapid injection instead of slow air injection of the esophagus in GERD patients. Our findings are supported by the results of Lang et al[<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] who showed in animal model that repeated application of capsaicin selectively inhibited the reflexes activated by rapid distension rather than slow distension of the esophagus. Therefore, current findings reemphasize the notion that the reflexes generated by rapid distension of the esophagus are modulated by chemically sensitive esophageal mechanoreceptors while those reflexes induced by slow distension are likely to be mediated by chemically insensitive mechanoreceptors. That notion is evident in patients with GERD.</p><p>The discrepancy in the amplitudes of secondary peristalsis after capsaicin infusion between healthy controls and GERD patients can be explained due to the fact that patients with GERD are more likely to have relatively poor motility in term of ineffective motility. In patients with abnormal primary peristalsis, abnormal secondary peristalsis has been observed[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. It is suggested that the defect may occur in the efferent part of the motor pathway.</p><p>It is as yet not completely clear whether a desensitization of the esophagus can be induced by a repeated capsaicin infusion, although other studies have showed desensitization phenomenon in other human organs including the skin and nasal mucosa[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Acute jejunal infusion of capsaicin induced burning sensations and pain without affecting sensitivity to balloon distension[<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], whereas other studies have shown that repeated administration of capsaicin is associated with reduced sensitivity to balloon distension in the intestine[<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Conversely, there was no change in acid-induced esophageal mechanosensitivity to balloon distension after esophageal pretreatment with capsaicin[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is conceivable that the effect on mechanosensitivity of capsaicin, regardless of mode for esophageal distension, on mechanosensitivity may be variable according to differences regarding types of stimuli and study designs. We have previously demonstrated a desensitization effect on distension-induced secondary peristalsis by repeated capsaicin infusion of the esophagus in healthy subjects[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In this study, we confirmed in a group of GERD patients that desensitization effect on secondary peristalsis can be accomplished by repeated esophageal capsaicin infusion.</p><p>It may be discussed whether repeated visceral exposure to capsaicin provides a complete esophageal desensitization[<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], in particular in humans. It has been reported that the durations of desensitization can last from several hours to weeks after capsaicin exposure in human studies[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and such a durable effect has been shown in upper gastrointestinal motility in healthy volunteers[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this work, the duration of the desensitization effects of repeated capsaicin administrations was studied only in a limited time period, which may impact the physiological significance and mechanisms how capsaicin-induced analgesia generates in the esophagus. Indeed, after repeated infusion of capsaicin in this study, local esophageal capsaicin concentration may reach about 10 &#x003bc;mol/L, which may cause rapid degeneration of capsaicin-sensitive nerve endings[<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It is probably that the desensitization effect of repeated capsaicin infusion is due to the temporary loss of capsaicin-sensitive afferents in the esophagus. This needs to be clarified by further longitudinal studies.</p><p>This study has some clinical implications. Current data support an earlier notion that esophageal mucosa is sensitive to capsaicin stimulation which induces heartburn symptom and which can be reduced by repeated exposure to capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce[<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The fact that repeated esophageal exposure of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce decreases heartburn symptom appears to have potential therapeutic benefit for relieving heartburn symptom in patients with symptomatic GERD, although further work is needed to confirm its clinical utility. From the other hand, our study suggests that repeated esophageal exposure to capsaicin may inhibit secondary peristalsis and relevant reflex that may reduce the efficiency of esophageal transit and clearance as generated by secondary peristalsis[<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By doing so, repeated capsaicin infusion may indeed reduce the protection of the esophagus by hampering the clearing of residue substance or refluxate in the esophagus, which may in turn prolong acid clearance in patients with GERD.</p><p>There are some limitations in this study with regard to the issue of desensitization capsaicin-induced of secondary peristalsis in patients with GERD. First, we did not apply the novel technique of high resolution manometry and impedance, which allows better characterization of secondary peristalsis, which may be missed by conventional manometry due to its inferior capability of depicting the peristaltic activity. Second, it is still unclear whether complete desensitization can be achieved by current dose of capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce, although such dose has been successfully applied for studying heartburn and secondary peristalsis in human esophagus with a similar fashion to acid instillation[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The effect of desensitization is achievable only when the dose causes subjective symptoms with maximal magnitude; however, this is not ethically plausible for <italic>in vivo</italic> study in human esophagus. Third, there are possibly 2 subgroups of GERD including mild erosive reflux disease and those with non-erosive reflux disease; however, we enrolled those patients with typical symptoms as well as good response to acid suppression therapy to get a more homogeneous patient cohort. Finally, the number of studied subjects is small due to intolerability to the procedure, which may lead to type II error.</p><p>In summary, acute esophageal infusion with capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce appears to exacerbate heartburn symptom and promote the efficiency of secondary peristalsis in patients with GERD. However, these effects are likely to be reduced with repetitive esophageal exposure to capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce. Our study supports the hypothesis that capsaicin sensitive afferents are responsible for modulating esophageal symptom and distension-induced secondary peristalsis in patients suffering GERD symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>A part of this study was presented as a presentation at the Digestive Disease Week<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (DDW) 2014 in Chicago, Illinois and published as an abstract form in <italic>Gastroenterology</italic> (2014) 146 (5 Suppl. 1): S678.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce improves esophageal secondary peristalsis in healthy adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Research frontiers</title><p>The authors determined whether acute and repetitive capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce suspension could influence heartburn perception and secondary peristalsis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Innovations and breakthroughs</title><p>Acute esophageal infusion with capsaicin-containing red pepper sauce appears to exacerbate heartburn symptom and promote the efficiency of secondary peristalsis in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).
