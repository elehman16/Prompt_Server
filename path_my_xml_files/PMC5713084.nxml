Elevated numbers of subgingival microorganisms have been associated with destructive periodontal disease activity. The elimination or reduction of microbial pathogens present in subgingival plaque is one of the primary objectives of periodontal therapy. Recognition of specific role of certain bacteria in chronic periodontitis has tended to consolidate ideas in therapeutic management of such diseases.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Removal or inhibition of subgingival plaque thus plays an important role in the maintenance of oral health.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The main goal of periodontal therapy is not only to stop periodontal destruction but also to prevent the recurrence of disease and regeneration of lost tissues.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Mechanical debridement alone may fail to eliminate the putative pathogens from the pockets completely because of the location of these organisms within gingival tissue or in deeper areas inaccessible to periodontal instrumentations and thus results in recurrence of disease. Therefore, the selective removal or inhibition of pathogenic microbes with systemic or topical antimicrobial agents in combination with scaling and root planing (SRP) is often considered as an effective approach at specific disease active sites.</p><p>Drugs administered systemically are absorbed into the blood stream and distributed throughout the body through the circulation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, systemic drug therapy is limited by adverse reactions such as toxicity, acquired bacterial resistance, and drug interactions. Patient compliance is also a recognized problem. In contrast, local administration of the drug allows the therapeutic agent to be delivered at the diseased periodontal site with increased therapeutic effect and minimal side effects. However, topically applied drugs do not have sufficient time to exert their bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect on targeted microorganisms residing in the subgingival area.</p><p>To overcome all these problems, various local delivery[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] methods for administering antimicrobial agents directly into the periodontal pocket have been tested. These methods further minimize the side effects of systemically administered drugs and also maintain a high level of antimicrobial agents within the gingival crevicular fluid over an extended period. Local drug delivery avoids most adverse reactions and disadvantages with little or no systemic effects. The local concentration achieved may be much higher than that is possible through the systemic route.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Among the antimicrobials used in periodontal therapy, much attention has been focused on tetracycline.</p><p>Tetracycline offers a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and may be a useful adjunct to periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Tetracyclines are the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials in periodontal therapy. The groups of tetracyclines are generally considered to be more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria and display good activity against most spirochetes as well as many anaerobic and facultative bacteria. High drug concentrations have been reported in gingival crevicular fluid making them particularly suitable for periodontal applications. The findings of Golub showed that apart from their antimicrobial action, tetracyclines may inhibit tissue collagenase and therefore retard the breakdown of collagen as seen in periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This was also confirmed by the studies of Rifkin and Vermilo on the anti-collagenase activity of tetracyclines.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The other properties of tetracyclines are inhibition of bone resorption, anti-inflammatory actions, and to promote the attachment of fibroblasts and connective tissue to root surfaces in periodontal therapy. Thus, tetracycline has improved outcomes as an adjunct to nonsurgical and surgical periodontal therapy.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Various systems for insertion of tetracyclines into periodontal pockets have been introduced which include hollow fibers,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer fibers,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] ethyl cellulose fibers,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] acrylic strips,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] collagen preparations,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and hydroxypropylcellulose films.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>A newer delivery system of tetracycline fibers within collagen fibers &#x0201c;Periodontal Plus AB&#x02122;&#x0201d; (Advanced Biotech Products, Chennai) containing 25 mg of pure fibrillar collagen along with 2 mg of tetracycline HCL has been introduced [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Since there are limited numbers of studies conducted with the above concentration of tetracycline hydrochloride, the present study was undertaken to determine the effects of tetracycline in the treatment of chronic periodontitis when used alone and in combination with SRP.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Periodontal Plus AB (tetracycline fibers)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-20-608-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of twenty human subjects comprising of both sexes, aged 35&#x02013;60 years, who came to the outpatient Department of Periodontology were selected.

Local drug delivery system allows the therapeutic agents to be targeted to the diseased sites and also avoids unnecessary exposure of the patient to systemic antibiotic therapy. In the present study, tetracycline was chosen as it has been proved to be effective in the management of periodontal diseases because of its properties.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the reduction in plaque and GI was observed to be associated with proper home care by patients and was reflected in respective decrease in PD and gain in loss of attachment. The reduction in PI scores may be attributed to the meticulous oral hygiene insisted on all the patients during the entire study period. It would possibly be explained on the basis that the residual effect of the drug from its reservoir, that is periodontal pocket, and tissues in the vicinity, over a prolonged period of time, disrupted the biofilm formation on the tooth surface. Thus, oral hygiene status is reflected by screening, randomization, and balancing than that of disease severity on the basis of plaque scores. This particular finding in our study signifies the clinical utility of SRP in changing the microbial environment in and around the tooth surface. Heijl <italic>et al</italic>. observed similar improvement in clinical parameters with all three treatment modalities.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>With reference to intergroup comparisons at day 30 and 45, a statistically significant difference in clinical parameters was observed between Group B and Group C, with less improvement seen when fibers were used alone. This observation simply reflects changes in composition of periodontal tissues, rather than gain of new attachment.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The least reduction in probing PD in Group B can be explained by the fact that the subgingival debridement was not performed in those sites treated with tetracycline fibers. Improvement in gingival health contributes to reduction in probing depth, presumably by reducing the swelling of marginal gingiva and/or by reducing tissue penetrability as a result of healing process.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>In the SRP group, significant improvements in clinical parameters are well comparable to other studies. Probably based on their similar observations, many authors have suggested not to use antimicrobial agents in patients with efficient oral hygiene maintenance capacity after complete subgingival debridement, as it is not advantageous in such patients.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>At day 45, there was a significant CAL gain in Group C. These results are in accordance with the studies of Newman <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Heijl <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Jeong <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Radvar <italic>et al</italic>. (1996)[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] who observed greatest therapeutic benefits when using a combination of SRP and tetracycline fiber. The principal objective of both tetracycline fiber therapy and scaling is to arrest disease progression by allowing the subgingival microbiota and creating a healthier periodontal environment, and the same is manifested clinically as gain in CAL.</p><p>Furthermore, it is interesting to note that subgingival debridement was not performed in the site receiving only tetracycline fibers; yet benefits were seen that surpassed those of mechanical therapy alone. A possible explanation for these observations maybe, in addition to the antimicrobial effects, the tetracycline fibers may have affected the local periodontal environment including chemical conditioning of the root surface and new attachment of PDL fibers to the surface. Another reason could be that the anti-collagenase activity of the fibers affects host response. Terranova reported that tetracycline fibers treatment of root surfaces were marked by enhanced binding of fibronectin and fibroblast.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>These anticipated therapeutic benefits with tetracycline fibers therapy should be weighed against the possible side/adverse effects of subgingival insertion such as allergy, gingival erythema, pain, discomfort, periodontal abscess formation, and oral candidiasis. However, owing to the minimal systemic uptake of the drug, no adverse reactions/complications were noticed in any case participating in the present study.
