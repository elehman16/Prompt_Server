Self-help smoking cessation support can help pregnant women to stop smoking, but the effects of delivering this kind of support via SMS text message are not known. A previous randomised controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of providing such support to pregnant smokers using an automated, tailored text message intervention called MiQuit. This larger RCT will estimate key parameters for and will test the feasibility of delivering a major trial run within the United Kingdom National Health Service settings aimed at providing definitive evidence on the utility of MiQuit for helping pregnant smokers to stop.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This will be a multi-centre, parallel group RCT. Participants are being identified in 16 English antenatal care settings and must be &#x0003e;16&#x000a0;years old, pregnant, &#x0003c;25&#x000a0;weeks gestation, smoke &#x0003e;1 daily cigarette, have smoked &#x0003e;5 daily cigarettes before pregnancy, and able to understand texts in English. After consenting and the collection of baseline data, participants are randomised to control or intervention groups in a 1:1 ratio; randomisation is stratified by trial site and gestation and employs computer-generated pseudo-random code using random permuted blocks of randomly varying size, and held on a secure server. All participants receive a National Health Service (NHS) leaflet aimed at helping them to stop smoking. Intervention group women also receive the 12-week MiQuit programme of tailored, supportive, interactive text message, self-help cessation support. Women are followed up by telephone 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation and at 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation. The study aims to recruit 400 women, and with this sample we will be able to estimate trial centres&#x02019; recruitment rates to within +/&#x02212;1% (margin of error&#x02009;=&#x02009;half width of 95% confidence interval); individual trial groups&#x02019; ascertainment of rates for smoking outcomes between 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation until approximately 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation to within +/&#x02212;4%, and across both groups, the combined cessation rate at 36&#x000a0;weeks +/&#x02212;3%.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Pilot trial completion will provide data to facilitate planning for a definitive trial investigating whether MiQuit works for smoking cessation in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02043509">NCT02043509</ext-link> Registered 14 January 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Self-help</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Protocol</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Epidemiological evidence indicates that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of many pregnancy-related complications including low birth weight, preterm birth, spontaneous abortions, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and neonatal death and is associated with many adverse postnatal problems including impaired lung function and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Taking into account that between one in four [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and one in eight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] women are estimated to smoke during pregnancy, the consequences of prenatal smoking come at a great financial cost to the health service.</p><p>A review of smoking cessation interventions for pregnant smokers indicates that such interventions can be effective at increasing cessation during pregnancy, although the increase is fairly modest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Although smoking cessation support is offered to pregnant smokers through the NHS Stop Smoking Services in England, uptake rates are fairly low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. While it is important to explore ways of increasing the uptake of face-to-face specialist support among this population, it is equally important to explore the potential of alternative forms of support.</p><p>One such alternative is self-help. A recent review of the literature indicates that self-help interventions for pregnant smokers almost double the chances of quitting compared with usual care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, self-help has been identified as being of high interest to pregnant smokers interested in quitting smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is also generally of low cost and, potentially, has wide reach. One promising mode of delivery for self-help support is through mobile phone text messages. A recent large trial of a text message smoking cessation intervention for non-pregnant smokers found it doubled cessation rates compared with a no-intervention control group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Regarding its potential for pregnant smokers, mobile phone ownership is high across the social class spectrum in the UK, and text messaging is particularly popular among those under 45&#x000a0;years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>A pilot trial of a tailored self-help intervention developed for pregnant smokers in Cambridge (called MiQuit) found that delivering support by text message to pregnant smokers was feasible and also acceptable for recipients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, the MiQuit intervention increased the likelihood of women setting a quit date and increased women&#x02019;s harm beliefs (related to smoking) and confidence in their ability and determination to quit. Although this trial was small (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;207), it provided an estimate for MiQuit&#x02019;s efficacy, albeit with wide 95% confidence intervals, which suggests that this intervention could be a valuable addition to standard NHS support for smoking cessation in pregnancy. At 12&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation, 12.5% of women who used MiQuit reported not having smoked in the previous 7&#x000a0;days, which was validated using salivary cotinine assessment, compared with only 7.8% in the control group; if MiQuit could have such an impact in routine NHS care, its low cost would make it highly cost-effective.</p><p>Before MiQuit could be used in routine care, a definitive randomised controlled trial would need to prove its effectiveness, so obtaining further evidence concerning its efficacy is appropriate. However, such a trial would need to be very large and expensive and, currently, there is insufficient information to justify conducting this. For example, it is not known if cessation encouraged by MiQuit, in the pilot trial, which was measured, at 12&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation (around mid-pregnancy), persists beyond this point. However, sustained cessation throughout pregnancy would be required before one could expect this potentially-useful intervention to have a meaningful impact on fetal health. Also, there is only very limited information with which one could plan a definitive trial such that this made efficient use of research resources; for example, likely recruitment and follow-up rates need determining. Consequently, we propose a pilot trial, which will investigate whether or not it is possible to evaluate MiQuit in a multi-centre RCT located within the NHS research infrastructure, taking full advantage of appropriate NHS research network resources. This study will provide estimates for the following parameters, which will be of crucial importance when deciding upon resources required for a definitive trial: the range of likely recruitment rates in different centres; quit rates amongst trial participants; feasibility of assessing smoking status of trial participants in later pregnancy; ascertainment rates obtained; and the likely effect of MiQuit when women are offered this in NHS settings. Findings from the pilot trial will permit estimation of the likely impact of MiQuit being introduced into routine clinical practice.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of this trial is to estimate the likely impact of the MiQuit text message-based smoking cessation intervention for pregnant smokers and to establish robust estimates for key parameters, which would be required in order to design a definitive trial of this intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective of this study is to estimate the key parameters required in order to design a definitive trial testing the efficacy of MiQuit, including the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Recruitment rates within pregnant smokers attending hospital recruitment centres</p></list-item><list-item><p>For individual trial groups, rates of ascertainment of validated smoking cessation between 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation until late pregnancy (approximately 36&#x000a0;weeks)</p></list-item><list-item><p>For both trial groups, the combined quit rate at 36&#x000a0;weeks (cessation as defined above).</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p>The secondary objectives are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To estimate and model the likely effectiveness and cost effectiveness of MiQuit compared with usual care including a generic smoking cessation information leaflet.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To document participants&#x02019; use of MiQuit interactive features and of NHS cessation support.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To assess the effect of MiQuit on social cognitive determinants of quitting smoking.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore participant views and experiences of using MiQuit.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To explore research staff views and experiences of the MiQuit pilot trial.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study is a multicentre, two-arm, parallel group, single blind, randomised controlled trial testing the MiQuit text message smoking cessation support system in pregnant women.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study setting</title><p>Participants will be recruited from hospital antenatal clinics in England.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>To be eligible for the trial participants must be i) pregnant and less than 25&#x000a0;weeks gestation, ii) have smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day pre-pregnancy and have continued to smoke at least 1 cigarette on a typical day during pregnancy, iii) aged 16 or over, iv) agree to accept information to assist cessation, v) have their own or have primary use of a mobile phone, vi) be familiar with sending and receiving text messages, vii) be able to understand written English (text messages are in English only) and consent issues explained in English, and viii) be able to give informed consent.</p><p>They should not already be enrolled in another text service to assist smoking cessation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention</title><p>MiQuit is an automated responsive text message support programme lasting 12&#x000a0;weeks, which provides tailored smoking cessation support and advice to the participant&#x02019;s mobile phone. The MiQuit system provides advice and support content that is tailored to 12 characteristics of the individual at baseline and is tailored to changes in smoking status collected at two time points during the 12-week programme. In addition, participants can text in a quit date and receive additional support tailored around this date. Participants can also increase or decrease the frequency of support they receive at any time by texting the keywords MORE or LESS. The support includes motivational messages, advice about preparing for a quit attempt, how to manage cravings and withdrawal, dealing with trigger situations, information about how smoking affects babies and general encouragement. Participants will receive between 70 and 145 texts over 12&#x000a0;weeks (0.8 to 1.7 texts per day), dependent upon how they use the system. They also will have the ability to request instant support text messages on demand or distraction messages by texting one of three keywords to the MiQuit system. Any text message replies to MiQuit made by participants will be charged at the usual network rate or included in their text allowance, but texts they received from MiQuit are free. All likely costs to participants will be made clear in the participant information sheet (PIS).</p><p>In addition to the MiQuit text message intervention, intervention group participants will receive a standard NHS leaflet giving some information and advice on stopping smoking and usual NHS antenatal care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control</title><p>Control group participants will receive the same NHS leaflet giving some information and advice on stopping smoking in addition to usual NHS antenatal care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Adherence</title><p>Participants allocated to receive the MiQuit intervention will have an adherence check performed at the late pregnancy/postnatal follow-up stage, at 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation (visit 3).

The randomisation will be stratified by site and gestation (&#x0003c;16&#x000a0;weeks versus &#x02265;16&#x000a0;weeks). The database will then send an email to inform unblinded central administrators who are not involved in participant follow-up of the allocation; they will then send participants an information pack, which will provide further information on participant allocation. Local hospital staff and central staff involved in follow-up will remain blind to treatment allocation as far as possible; however, as participants are not blinded it is possible that they may unintentionally reveal their allocation during follow-up. In addition, staff carrying out the final follow-up calls will need to ask participants questions about the intervention and so will become unblinded towards the end of this call. There should be no other reasons why unblinding is needed. Researchers carrying out the analyses will remain blind. Further details are provided in the data collection sections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Women will be recruited as they attend hospitals for antenatal screening (ultrasound) appointments using one or both of two different methods, depending on the locally-available resources in participating Acute Trusts. For both recruitment methods, all pregnant women attending clinics will be asked to complete a brief questionnaire, which identifies smokers and asks those who would like to receive self-help cessation support in the context of a research study to provide contact details. A PIS will be attached to the questionnaire. Questionnaires will be distributed by a member of the patient&#x02019;s usual care team (for example, receptionist or midwife); information about the trial will be displayed in relevant clinical areas and adverts in clinic environments may also be used to aid recruitment. The two methods of recruitment are described as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Via trial co-ordinating centre staff</italic>: A trust staff member will oversee daily collation of questionnaires and interested women&#x02019;s contact details at each recruiting site, sending these to a trial office by fax or post. A member of the study team, who has been appropriately trained, would then telephone potentially-interested women and ensure that all aspects pertaining to study participation are verbally-addressed prior to obtaining consent.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Via staff in Acute Trust</italic>: This method of recruitment will only be used in trial centres in which Comprehensive Local Research Network (CLRN) research midwives are available. Consent will, in the main, be obtained in person by a CLRN research midwife (RM); however, should the patient need to leave before consent can be obtained, a member of the team may call and consent over the telephone as for method one. A trust staff member or the RM working within these recruiting sites will oversee collation of questionnaires and the RM will follow up face-to-face those respondents who are interested in participating, usually while they are still in clinic. The RM will offer trial enrolment to all eligible, interested women ensuring that relevant aspects of trial procedures are fully explained prior to obtaining written informed consent. Those women who are not able to wait will be asked (where possible) for a convenient time to contact by telephone where the process will be fully explained and consent provided verbally.</p></list-item></list></p><p>This trial will, therefore, investigate the feasibility of the two recruitment methods and will also provide an estimate of CLRN resources that might be required for a definitive study using the second recruitment method. A variety of NHS Trusts will be used as recruitment sites to encourage diversity of recruitment and increase generalisability. Reasons why potential participants are not recruited will be collected and reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Withdrawal of participants from intervention or assessments</title><p>Participants may be withdrawn from the trial either at their own request or at the discretion of the Investigator. Participants who experience miscarriage or fetal death will be advised to withdraw from the trial.</p><p>Individuals in the MiQuit arm may cancel text messages by sending a &#x02018;STOP&#x02019; text message at any time during the programme&#x02019;s duration. However, unless they specifically withdraw, they will remain in the trial as participants.</p><p>Any participant who has already participated in the study may not re-enter at a later date.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Participant timeline and data collection</title><sec id="Sec20"><title>Pre-Screen</title><p>All potential participants will be identified via a brief questionnaire, which will be attached to a participant information sheet.</p><p><italic>Recruitment method one</italic>: For recruitment by this method a member of the Co-ordinating centre study team will complete and sign the consent form noting that the consent was taken by telephone.</p><p><italic>Recruitment method two</italic>: This will cover the details as for method one, except that the participant can provide either written or verbal informed consent; an RM working within the participating acute trust will explain all aspects of the study and will counter-sign the consent form in both cases.</p><p>All participants will be asked to give written informed consent for the collection of an exhaled breath and/or saliva sample if they report a quit at the week 36 follow-up. They will be made aware that the provision of samples will only be required if a quit is reported at week 36 of their pregnancy and that this may involve a visit to the participant&#x02019;s home by the research midwife. If the participant is not happy to be visited at home but is happy to provide a saliva sample, postal sample kits are available. Carbon monoxide levels in exhaled breath samples can only be measured in person during a home visit.</p><p>Participants will also be given the option at the beginning of the study to consent to be contacted by the study team to discuss whether they would be interested in being interviewed as part of an intervention process evaluation. They will not be consenting to the interview at the start of the study.</p><p>All participants will be provided with clear information about how to withdraw their consent via Freepost postcard (provided to all participants), text, email, or telephone.

This will confirm contact details and ask about socio- demographic data, smoking attitudes and behaviour (for MiQuit tailoring), heaviness of smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], gestational age, number of births beyond 24&#x000a0;weeks, partner&#x02019;s (significant other&#x02019;s) smoking status and health status (EQ-5D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The researcher will enter the participant details on the electronic database and then randomise the participant. This will ensure the researcher will remain blinded to the participant allocation. The participants are randomised, using the Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit's web-based service, to intervention (MiQuit) or control. For participants in either trial arm, a specific information sheet, which describes only details of procedures employed within that arm, will be generated and sent to them by a non-blinded member of the trial team who is not involved in follow-up. Documentation will also include a leaflet giving some information and advice on stopping smoking, details of a contact point for participants who have questions about trial involvement and details of how participants can reverse their decision to take part (outlined in - removal of participants from intervention or assessments). The PIS, information sheets and consent form will be available in English only, as understanding of English is required to receive the MiQuit intervention.</p><p>Follow-up contacts will use a blend of postal, telephone, email/web and SMS text messaging reminders to elicit maximal response rates. For those participants reporting a quit, where possible, a home visit from their local RM will be arranged.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Visit 2 - 4-week follow-up</title><p><italic>At 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation</italic>, participants will be contacted via telephone in order to assess smoking status, numbers of quit attempts lasting more than 24&#x000a0;hours, quality of life information (EQ-5D) and use of NHS and non-NHS smoking cessation support in the period since randomisation. This visit will, in general, be performed via telephone by a member of the study team at the co-ordinating centre, blind to treatment allocation; however, should the study team be unable to contact by the participant by telephone, other methods will be used in an attempt to elicit the best response. These include; posting a short questionnaire with explanatory letter and pre-paid return envelope, or sending a link, which allows web-based completion or by text.</p><p>It is possible that if members of the co-ordinating centre study team speak to participants at the 4-week follow-up, they may become un-blinded for the late pregnancy follow-up (visit 3). However, the value of exploring the feasibility of different follow-up approaches for this pilot trial outweighs the small risk of bias presented by this scenario.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Visit 3 - late pregnancy/postnatal follow-up</title><p><italic>At 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation</italic>: Participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire (data to be collected up to 10&#x000a0;weeks after estimated delivery date will be acceptable for use). This will include quality of life information (EQ-5D) and measures of smoking behaviour, attitudinal/behavioural information, use of NHS smoking cessation support and participants&#x02019; ratings of the intervention (MiQuit arm only). As for the 4-week visit, this visit will be performed mainly via telephone by a member of the study team at the co-ordinating centre, blind to treatment allocation. As for the 4-week visit, previously-described alternative methods will be employed to elicit the best response rate.</p><p>It is recognised that asking about the intervention at follow-up will result in the researcher who conducts the late pregnancy follow-up becoming un-blinded. To ensure that this has minimal impact on follow-up data obtained, the participants will be asked items about the intervention at the end of the interview/questionnaire starting with the question &#x02018;<italic>Did you receive any stop smoking text messages from the study team</italic>?&#x02019;</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Visit 4 - validation of smoking status</title><p>During this assessment, whether in person or by post, participants will be asked to report their smoking status and recent use of nicotine replacement therapies.</p><p>Participants self-reporting abstinence in late pregnancy will have their smoking status validated by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO) readings and/or salivary cotinine samples. The validation of smoking cessation would be initiated as soon as possible after notification of abstinence at visit 3.</p><p>Exhaled CO will be measured using a validated hand held CO monitor and can only be taken when a researcher is able to visit the participant in their home. Saliva samples for cotinine (a metabolite of nicotine) analysis could be collected at the same visit. Ideally both forms of assessment would be used, but either CO or cotinine assessment would be sufficient on their own if difficulties in getting a valid sample are experienced with either method. Where it is not possible to visit a participant in their home, a salivary sample pack will be sent by post and participants will be invited to return a sample in a pre-paid postal packet. Written consent agreeing to provide the samples for validation will be obtained from any participants who did not give this consent at baseline (that is, those who were recruited via telephone). This consent will be obtained either during the home visit or by sending a consent form for the participant to complete and return with a postal saliva sample. Cut-off points for biochemical verification will be determined according to the latest evidence, but defined abstinence is likely to be in the region of &#x0003c;9&#x000a0;ppm for CO readings and &#x0003c;10 ng/ml for salivary cotinine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Duration of the trial</title><p>It is anticipated that the total duration of the study will be 20&#x000a0;months.

Those participants who participate in a longer in-depth qualitative interview to gain information on their experience of the intervention (MiQuit arm only) will receive &#x000a3;20 in vouchers as compensation for their time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Qualitative interviews for process evaluation</title><p>A small number of semi-structured telephone interviews will be carried out with a selection of participants from the MiQuit arm in order to address secondary objective 4. This process evaluation will provide important data on participant&#x02019;s experience of receiving support from MiQuit within the context of their everyday lives and participation in a trial. Semi-structured interviews will enable the researcher to have some control over the data collected to compliment the trial evaluation but at the same time be interactive and allow the participant control also. The findings will greatly assist the design of a definitive trial and optimisation of the intervention.</p><p>Participants will be purposively selected according to smoking status and cessation behaviour and use of the MiQuit system, including those who decide to discontinue use of MiQuit. Only participants who have already consented at baseline to be contacted to discuss participation in an interview will be contacted and will receive additional information before the call on what to expect. After completing the late pregnancy follow-up, participants in the MiQuit arm, who indicated at baseline that they were happy to be contacted about participation in an interview, will be sent a specific information sheet and blank consent form. A researcher will call a number of participants (not all) and establish if the participant is still interested in going ahead with the interview. If they are happy to continue, the researcher will request verbal consent for the interview and proceed with the interview. If the participant is interested but unable to continue with the interview at that time, a specific date will be set for the interview to take place. In every case, verbal consent will be recorded by the researcher before the interview goes ahead, and a copy of the consent form will be sent to the participant. The participant will be made aware that the interview will be audio-recorded and that they can withdraw from the interview at any time and that this would not affect their subsequent care or rights. Participants will be recruited until the researchers feel that data saturation has occurred (that is, the point where few novel insights are generated from the most recent interviews). Given the focused nature of the interviews, it is anticipated that this would be reached after interviewing 10 to 15 participants. The interview schedule will include questions on the participants&#x02019; general experience of smoking and quitting during pregnancy, their experience of using and interacting with MiQuit, their feelings towards whether and how MiQuit might have helped them engage or maintain a quit attempt, and their thoughts on how it could be improved.</p><p>The interviews will be undertaken by experienced personnel and last up to 60&#x000a0;minutes. The interviews will be analysed using framework analysis, assisted by the qualitative analysis software NVivo. This will include looking at two main characteristics of the participants: that is, smoking status and use of system including those who discontinue (text STOP) and how these relate to several aspects of the experience of receiving the intervention including factors that may affect interaction with MiQuit, feelings towards message content and system features and suggestions for improvements for future use.</p><p>A number of semi-structured telephone or face to face interviews will also be carried out with a selection of recruiting site research staff involved in the study in order to address secondary objective 5. This will provide important data on the staff experience of running and recruiting into the MiQuit study. As for the participant interviews, the semi-structured interviews will enable the team to have some control over the data collected to complement the trial evaluation but also be interactive to allow the local site research staff to have some control too. The findings will greatly assist the practical design of a definitive trial.</p><p>A number of staff from recruiting centres will be selected for interview, to allow a variety of opinions and comments to be collected.</p><p>The objectives for these interviews are as follows:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>To develop a taxonomy for describing MiQuit trial recruitment processes.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To describe research midwives&#x02019; perceptions of the key facilitators for and barriers against recruitment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To relate key facilitators and barriers to recruitment processes and so further understanding of how, in a definitive trial, recruitment could be maximised.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To describe from the perspective of research midwives, those factors, which are perceived to influence acute trusts&#x02019; decisions to act as a trial centres (NB: after analysis, we will be in a position to hypothesise about how best to encourage trusts to sign up to being trial centres in a definitive study).</p></list-item></list></p><p>Issues to be covered in staff interviews will include the following:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The particular process they used in their site to identify, engage and enrol participants, including the consent process;</p></list-item><list-item><p>their views on the local trial processes, including why particular processes were used, what worked well or was challenging, what the study team could have done to make this easier, particularly focussing on issues that it is possible to influence;</p></list-item><list-item><p>how decisions are made about Trust involvement in a particular trial and what influenced them to take part, whether they would consider being involved in a similar study again, insights into best way to achieve meaningful collaboration; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>their views on the intervention.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The interviews will be audiotaped and analysed using thematic qualitative analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Statistical methods</title><sec id="Sec30"><title>Sample size and justification</title><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p><italic>Estimation of key trial parameters</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p>The primary objective of this pilot trial is to demonstrate the feasibility of running a definitive, multi-centre trial of the MiQuit interevention within an NHS context; with 400 participants, the following key parameters will be estimable within the precision indicated (figures presented are margin of error&#x02009;=&#x02009;half width of 95% confidence interval):<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>the recruitment rate of participants from within smokers attending trial centres/hospital to within +/&#x02212; 1%,</p></list-item><list-item><p>for individual trial groups, proportion of participants with validated smoking cessation between 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation until late pregnancy to within +/&#x02212; 4%, and</p></list-item><list-item><p>for both trial groups, the combined proportion of participants who quit in late pregnancy (cessation as defined above) to within +/&#x02212; 3%, assuming that the actual proportion of participants quitting is around 10%.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>2.</label><p><italic>Estimate for short-term efficacy</italic></p></list-item></list></p><p>A secondary objective of this pilot trial is to estimate the effectiveness of the MiQuit intervention for promoting smoking cessation. Providing evidence to support the notion that this intervention is likely to be effective would increase the research team&#x02019;s future chances of obtaining funding to conduct a definitive trial. We will investigate efficacy of MiQuit at 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation by comparing self-reported, 7-day, point-prevalence, cessation rates between trial groups. It should be noted that this is a surrogate end point for that which we plan to use in any definitive trial; a potential strength of using this is that event rates (that is, proportion of participants achieving cessation) are likely to be higher at this time point, which is closer to randomisation than the late pregnancy-assessment point, and this could provide greater power to detect between group differences. A potential disadvantage is that the relationship between this surrogate endpoint and cessation in late pregnancy (approx 36&#x000a0;weeks) is not known; consequently, findings using data obtained at this time point should not be used in isolation to assess whether or not a definitive trial should be conducted.

One recent trial (MiQuit feasibility trial), tested a very similar version of this trial&#x02019;s intervention, but in this study 7-day point-prevalence abstinence was measured in similar manner as we propose at <italic>12&#x000a0;weeks</italic> after randomisation, rather than at 1&#x000a0;month after; in this trial, the control group quit rate was 19.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Two recent UK trials have enrolled pregnant smokers, albeit with different characteristics, and have measured cessation outcomes at 1&#x000a0;month after randomisation.

We will determine the recruitment rate, with 95% confidence intervals, of participants who take part in the study from pregnant smokers attending trial centre. For each trial treatment group, we will estimate the proportions of participants, with 95% confidence intervals, achieving validated smoking cessation between 4&#x000a0;weeks after randomisation until late pregnancy (at approximately 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation). We will also estimate the proportion of participants, with 95% confidence intervals, who achieve validated smoking cessation in late pregnancy (approximately at 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation) for both trial groups combined.</p><p>We will perform chi-squared tests to assess the association for the proportion of participants who achieve 4-week and late-pregnancy smoking outcomes between the trial treatment groups. Logistic regression models will then be used to compare the outcomes between the two trial groups with adjustment for factors used to stratify the randomisation (centre and gestation at randomisation; &#x0003c;16&#x000a0;weeks versus &#x02265;16&#x000a0;weeks) through including these as fixed covariates in the model. These analyses will be pragmatic and based on intention-to-treat.

For this, we will undertake mediation analyses to explore whether potential changes in social cognitive determinants of smoking cessation explain changes in quitting behaviour.

For statistical analyses involving socio-demographic variables with missing data, if the proportion of missing data is &#x0003c;5% and roughly similar in both intervention groups, then we will explore the robustness of using a complete-case analysis and an analysis including allowing for the missing data through analysing missing data as a separate category.

Saliva samples will be collected at visit 4 (around 36&#x000a0;weeks gestation) to verify smoking status by a researcher or by post if a visit is not possible. Saliva samples will be obtained using clean salivettes; it will involve the participant placing a sterile swab under the tongue, for up to 5&#x000a0;minutes until it is moist and then placing the swab into a sterile vessel. All samples will be stored in a linked anonymised format in a secure freezer storage unit (&#x02212;20&#x000b0;C) within Nottingham Health Science Biobank (NHSB) according to their approved protocols. Where researchers obtain samples by visiting participants who live at a distance that would make it impractical to deliver these to Nottingham in person, these samples will be posted by the study team in suitable packaging, and when received, the study team will transfer them to NHSB. Samples are stable at ambient temperatures for several days. For postal samples, the participant will be asked to state the date they provided the sample on the label. Participants will be advised to return the sample (using the protective pre-paid and addressed packaging) on the day they provide the sample. Again these will be transferred to the NHSB by a member of the study team. Nottingham Health Science Biobank has been given full approval by the HTA to be a full licence holder, meeting all legislation requirements.</p><p>Once all samples have been collected for the study, NHSB will arrange transportation of samples by courier to ABS Laboratories Ltd, Hertfordshire for analysis in a single batch shipment.

This pilot trial provides information, which complements that from our earlier feasibility trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and has been necessary for a number of reasons.</p><p>First, the primary outcome for the earlier study was self-reported, 7-day, point-prevalence, smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] measured at 12&#x000a0;weeks after trial entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Whilst any period of smoking cessation is likely to be beneficial for pregnant women and their infants, maximal health gain for infants is likely to occur if mothers maintain abstinence throughout pregnancy. Additionally, it is possible that women who remain smoke free for the whole of pregnancy will be better able to avoid relapse back to smoking after childbirth and, for both reasons, a definitive study should aim to detect any impact on women&#x02019;s smoking throughout the whole of pregnancy. Most smoking cessation trials encourage participants to set a quit date and cessation outcomes are measured prospectively from this point; however, MiQuit is a &#x02018;cessation-induction&#x02019; intervention, which encourages, but does not require users to set a definite quit date. Finding appropriate time points in pregnancy from which continuous cessation can be measured, monitored and validated, after participants have been exposed to MiQuit, is an important issue that the pilot trial is attempting to resolve. Achieving high ascertainment rates for piloted methods of measuring continuous cessation will mean that our piloted outcome could be used to measure and validate smoking cessation throughout the whole of pregnancy in any future definitive RCT.</p><p>Second, the treatment effects attributable to smoking cessation interventions are generally inversely proportional to their intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and MiQuit is a low-intensity intervention. For a definitive study to have sufficient power to show whether or not MiQuit has efficacy for smoking cessation in pregnancy, such a study could need a sample size of over 3,000 participants (estimated using data from previous MiQuit trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]). Clearly, to plan a definitive study that combines a sufficiently high chance of providing a definitive answer with efficient use of resources, the best possible information is needed. This pilot trial will provide the first estimate for the treatment effect that MiQuit might have for influencing continuous smoking cessation between earlier and later (approximately 36&#x000a0;weeks) pregnancy; although the pilot is not powered to provide such an estimate with high precision, it will nevertheless, be a very valuable parameter. Additionally, knowing the combined treatment groups&#x02019; cessation rates at 36&#x000a0;weeks will also be useful to inform definitive-trial sample size calculations.</p><p>Third, recruitment rates from this study will be vital for assessing the feasibility of delivering a large definitive RCT investigating smoking cessation in pregnancy and using English National Health Service (NHS) research structures. Since 2006, the English NHS has developed and revised research networks, funded from the health service budget and orientated towards delivering clinical research; there is a particular focus on RCTs that influence clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Networks provide staff working across the NHS whose remit is to recruit to research studies and researchers who successfully access network staff support can efficiently deliver multi-centre RCTs. However, negotiating access to research networks and subsequently finding the most efficient ways of combining their efforts with those of a university-based research team can be challenging and, significantly the two most recent English pregnancy smoking cessation trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were completed with relatively little research network input. To date, overall pilot trial recruitment has been strong and it appears that study methods could, feasibly be used to recruit to a larger definitive study. However, across the 16 trial centres from which this pilot recruits, there has been marked variation in recruitment rates. Consequently, lessons learned from our planned pilot trial process evaluation should help us to better understand the reasons for different recruitment rates in different centres and, potentially to enhance the research network staff experience of recruiting to the trial for any future study.</p><p>Given the nature of this pilot trial, discussion has principally focussed on methodological issues. However, if after this study, a definitive RCT is conducted and MiQuit is found to be effective for smoking cessation in pregnancy, this very cheap and likely (in that circumstance) highly cost-effective intervention could easily be made very widely available in many different ways to support smoking cessation in pregnancy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec48"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment began in February 2014, with the first participant randomised on 18 February 2014.
