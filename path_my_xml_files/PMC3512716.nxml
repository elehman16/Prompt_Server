We report efficacy/safety findings from an MF/F study in subjects with severe asthma previously uncontrolled on high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) with or without a long-acting &#x000df;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a 3-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, multicenter study with a 2- to 3-week open-label run-in period during which subjects received mometasone furoate (MF) 400 &#x003bc;g twice daily (BID). Subjects (&#x02265;12 years) were randomized to MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID, MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g BID, or MF 400 &#x003bc;g BID. The primary endpoint was the area under the curve (AUC) of the change in serial (0&#x02212;12 hours) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) for MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g vs MF 400 &#x003bc;g from baseline to week 12. Adverse events (AEs) and other clinical safety measures were recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>728 subjects were randomized (mean: age, 47.9 years; asthma duration, 14.0 years; FEV<sub>1</sub> % predicted, 66.3; reversibility, 22.9%; Asthma Control Questionnaire score, 1.93). Improvements in mean changes from baseline in FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02212;12h</sub> at week 12 were: MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g = 3.59 L &#x000d7; h; MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g = 4.19 L &#x000d7; h; MF 400 &#x003bc;g = 2.04 L &#x000d7; h, with both MF/F doses significantly better than MF (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). These FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub> values with MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g, MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g, and MF 400 &#x003bc;g correspond to average hourly increases of 0.30, 0.35, and 0.17 L, respectively. MF/F was associated with a rapid (&#x0003c;5 minutes) and sustained improvement in lung function. The percentages of subjects experiencing an asthma deterioration (ie, severe asthma exacerbation) were 12.4% (MF/F 200/10 &#x003bc;g), 12.2% (MF/F 400/10 &#x003bc;g), and 18.3% (MF 400 &#x003bc;g). There were no notable differences in AEs between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both the 200/10 &#x003bc;g BID and 400/10 &#x003bc;g BID doses of MF/F combination therapy led to significantly greater improvements in lung function compared with 400 &#x003bc;g BID MF monotherapy in subjects with severe asthma previously treated with an ICS alone or in combination with LABA.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
