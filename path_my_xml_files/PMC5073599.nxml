Gait inefficiency may be associated with declines in gross motor function and participation among adolescents with cerebral palsy. Resistance training may improve gait efficiency through a number of biomechanical and neural mechanisms. The aim of the Strength Training for Adolescents with cerebral palsy (STAR) trial is to evaluate the effect of resistance training on gait efficiency, activity and participation in adolescents with cerebral palsy. We also aim to determine the biomechanical and neural adaptations that occur following resistance training and evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of such an intervention for adolescents with cerebral palsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>60 adolescents (Gross Motor Function Classification System level I&#x02013;III) will be randomised to a 10-week resistance training group or a usual care control group according to a computer-generated random schedule. The primary outcome is gait efficiency. Secondary outcomes are habitual physical activity, participation, muscle&#x02013;tendon mechanics and gross motor function. General linear models will be used to evaluate differences in continuous data between the resistance training and usual care groups at 10 and 22&#x02005;weeks, respectively. A process evaluation will be conducted alongside the intervention. Fidelity of the resistance training programme to trial protocol will be quantified by observations of exercise sessions. Semistructured interviews will be conducted with participants and physiotherapists following the resistance training programme to determine feasibility and acceptability of the programme.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This trial has ethical approval from Brunel University London's Department of Clinical Sciences' Research Ethics Committee and the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee London&#x02014;Surrey Borders.

Although adults with mild-to-moderate CP have a relatively normal life expectancy,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> many experience deterioration in walking function between 20 and 40&#x02005;years of age.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> This can lead to physical inactivity,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> which in turn may result in increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref> and limit participation and social integration in the home and community. The oxygen cost of walking, which is often used as a measure of gait efficiency,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> is high among children and adolescents with CP in comparison to their peers with typical development.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> Gait inefficiency may contribute to the negative cycle of physical inactivity, deterioration in walking function and physical de-conditioning.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Reduced gait efficiency is also negatively associated with gross motor function and participation in mobility-related activities,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and may cause fatigue, which further exacerbates deterioration in walking function.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> As gait is most inefficient at age 12&#x02005;years in CP and gross motor function skills deteriorate shortly afterwards,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> targeted interventions during adolescence could disrupt this negative cycle.</p><p>Resistance training, which is commonly used for people with CP, has the potential to improve gait efficiency through a number of biomechanical and neural mechanisms. First, co-contraction of antagonistic muscles is exacerbated in CP<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> and contributes to gait inefficiency.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Studies involving children with typical development indicate that early resistance training-induced strength gains are predominantly neural in nature.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref> A study of children with CP suggests that a reduction in antagonistic co-contraction may be a partial contributor.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Second, excessive lengthening of the muscle fascicles during the single stance phase of walking could contribute to the increased energy cost of walking among people with CP. In typically developed gait it has been shown that in spite of significant length changes of the plantarflexor muscle&#x02013;tendon unit as a whole, triceps surae muscle fascicles operate almost isometrically during the early to mid-stance phase of walking.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In the subsequent propulsive phase, the fascicles shorten at velocities associated with high efficiency.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26&#x02013;28</xref> This has been proposed to be an energy-saving mechanism during walking.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Pilot data suggest that in children with CP and equinus gait, the fascicles of the gastrocnemius muscle lengthen during the single support phase of walking,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> rather than act isometrically, potentially due to the muscle's inability to resist the tensile forces in stance. Since eccentric muscle contractions are metabolically less efficient than isometric contractions,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> this may contribute to walking inefficiency in people with CP. An increase in the volume and strength of these muscles due to resistance training may have a positive effect on oxygen cost by enabling fascicles to work more isometrically during gait. Finally, the degree to which the muscle shortens during dynamic contractions is governed by the elastic properties of muscles and tendons (ie, stiffness). It has been previously demonstrated that children with CP have an increased passive stiffness and disproportionally long Achilles tendon.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> This may reduce the ability of the muscle to generate adequate force in the propulsive phase of gait, as fascicles are not operating at optimum lengths or velocities. Resistance training has been shown to increase tendon stiffness by up to 25% in children with typical development,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> thus demonstrating the potential to affect the ratio of muscle to tendon stiffness in CP in a way that promotes a more efficient muscle&#x02013;tendon interaction and muscle contraction during gait. Such changes may improve gait efficiency in this population.</p><p>Resistance training has been advocated for adolescents with CP for decades as it may delay the loss of mobility in adulthood by increasing muscular reserve,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> reduce the risk of chronic disease such as type II diabetes mellitus,<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> and improve walking function.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, current evidence for the use of resistance training to improve walking function is equivocal<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41&#x02013;43</xref> and thus, clarity is required. The uncertainty regarding the effects of resistance training on walking function may be due to a number of shortcomings in current research. First, many resistance training protocols are of an inadequate volume, intensity or duration.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> For neural and musculotendinous adaptations to occur, an adequate training stimulus and duration are required.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> In addition, multijoint exercises are often used in resistance training programmes. As people with CP have severe muscle weakness, they may compensate with stronger muscles when performing multijoint exercises.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The efficacy of resistance training may also vary according to the muscle group targeted. Resistance training in CP is primarily targeted at the knee extensors<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> despite muscle deficits being most pronounced at the ankle.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Plantarflexor strength is associated with walking function and step cadence in CP;<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and pilot data suggest that progressive resistance training of the plantarflexors using single-joint exercises improves muscle strength, muscle volume,<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> walking speed and stride length.<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Further, the underlying biomechanical and neural adaptations to resistance training are poorly understood in people with CP. When evaluating a complex intervention, it is imperative that a theoretical understanding of the likely process of change is developed.<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> The paucity of research into resistance training-induced adaptations in CP means that current clinical practice is potentially based on erroneous assumptions.</p><p>We hypothesise that training the ankle plantarflexors with progressive resistance training will result in increases in gait efficiency through the biomechanical and neural adaptations outlined above. The aims of the Strength Training for Adolescents with CP (STAR) trial are to (1) evaluate the effect of resistance training of the ankle plantarflexors on gait efficiency, activity and participation in adolescents with CP, (2) determine the biomechanical and neural adaptations that occur following resistance training in adolescents with CP and (3) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of resistance training for adolescents with CP.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This is a multicentre randomised controlled trial with a parallel process evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012839F1">figure 1</xref>).

Instead, they will perform a combination of one or more exercises, depending on their individual strength capacity each week. Each participant will perform the prescribed exercise(s) until they complete the required number of sets and repetitions of plantarflexor exercises on each leg. For example, in week 1, a participant may be prescribed four sets of 12 repetitions of seated straight knee calf presses against a resistance band on each leg. In week 2, if they are able to perform &#x0003e;12 repetitions against the strongest resistance band they may be prescribed four sets of 12 repetitions of standing calf raises on each leg. They could also be prescribed two sets of 12 repetitions of standing calf raises and two sets of 12 repetitions of the seated straight knee calf press with the leg press machine, on each leg.

For this purpose, participants will be secured in a seated position with the knee joint as close to full extension as possible and the foot secured to the footplate of the dynamometer. The medial malleolus of the ankle will be aligned with the centre of rotation of the dynamometer arm. The dynamometer footplate will be positioned as close to perpendicular to the horizontal axis as possible, dependent on each participant's available joint range of motion. To reduce the risk of leg, upper body or heel movement during contractions, stabilisation straps will be applied tightly over the foot, thigh and torso, and participants will be instructed to cross their arms over their chest.</p><p>Each participant will be required to push against the footplate producing a maximal voluntary isometric contraction manoeuvre while plantarflexor torque is recorded.

Participants will be instructed to relax their calf muscles during the imaging. A strap will be placed over the participant's thighs just above the knee and a researcher will apply a gentle pressure on the heel in order to avoid any movement of the limbs. Hip and knee joints will be fully extended, unless full joint extension is not possible, in which case the degree of joint extension will be measured with a goniometer and kept identical during the postmeasurements and follow-up measurements. During the assessment, the foot will be extended off the edge of the examination table, completely relaxed and the ankle joint will be in its resting position. Either single or multiple sweeps (depending on the size of the muscle) will be taken by moving the probe across the calf while the position of the four markers attached to the probe will be tracked by a position sensor system. A consistent, minimal pressure will be applied with the probe to avoid compression of the muscle, aided by the application of a transmission gel to improve acoustic coupling. In order to keep the pressure minimal and avoid dark &#x02018;gaps&#x02019; of the lateral edges of the image (probe width=6&#x02005;cm), a customised curved gel pad will be held in between the skin and the probe's imaging surface.

Information from the patient support tool will be transmitted directly to the research team.</p><p>Fidelity of the resistance training programme to trial protocol will be quantified by observations of four sessions (two home sessions and two group sessions) for each participant during the 10-week period using a protocol checklist. A member of the research team will record the quantity and quality of exercises. The number of repetitions and sets performed of each exercise, and the amount of resistance added to each exercise will be recorded. It will be noted if the exercise was progressed based on individual strength capacity. The calf muscle will be palpated during each exercise to determine if it is being activated. Aspects of the quality of the exercise (ankle range of motion that the exercise is performed through, performance of prescribed repetitions to fatigue, movement quality and degree of knee extension maintained during the exercise) will be rated on a four-point scale, where a higher score indicates better quality.</p><p>To determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, semistructured exit interviews will be conducted with all participants in the resistance training group within 1&#x02005;week of completion of the intervention. Participants will be asked to reflect on their experience, including any positive or challenging aspects of taking part in the programme, to help identify factors which may impact on adherence. Semistructured interviews will also be conducted with physiotherapists at the end of their involvement in the study to explore their experiences of delivering the resistance training programme and identify facilitators and challenges to the delivery of the intervention per protocol and potential implementation into future practice. Indicative topic guides for the semistructured interviews with adolescents who participate in physiotherapists who deliver the progressive resistance training programme are available in online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM5">supplementary files</xref> 5 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM6">6</xref>, respectively.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM5"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012839.supp5</object-id><label>supplementary file</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss5" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012839supp5.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM6"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-012839.supp6</object-id><label>supplementary file</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss6" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-012839supp6.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>Semistructured interviews will be transcribed verbatim, and checked against the original recordings.

The principal analysis will be on an intention-to-treat basis. Subgroup analysis will be conducted according to: (1) the participants' ability to plantarflex the ankle, that is, rated as &#x02018;normal&#x02019;, &#x02018;impaired&#x02019; and &#x02018;no active movement&#x02019;; (2) adherence categorised as &#x02265;70% or &#x0003c;70% of the total dose (30 sessions). Statistical analyses will be conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (V.22.0, IBM Corp, Amonk, New York, USA). Statistical significance will be set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size calculation was based on being able to show a minimal detectable difference in the primary outcome, NNcost, between the two groups. The calculation was based on an analysis of covariance approach, whereby the NNcost values at follow-up are considered the outcome variable, and the NNcost values at baseline are used as a covariate. Both the minimal detectable difference of 0.17 and SD of 0.31 were based on values from the literature.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> A correlation of 0.70 between baseline and follow-up NNcost values was assumed. Using a 5% significance level and 80% power, it is calculated that a sample size of 27 participants in each group is required. It is estimated that there will be a drop-out of 10%, and thus it is proposed to recruit 30 people per group into the study, 60 people in total.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The trial is sponsored by Brunel University London. A parent or legal guardian of participants under 16&#x02005;years and participants over 16&#x02005;years will provide written informed consent. Participants under 16&#x02005;years will provide written or verbal assent. All participants will take part on a voluntary basis and will be informed that they can withdraw at any time without this influencing their subsequent treatment. The trial will comply with the latest Declaration of Helsinki. Data will be kept secure and confidential in line with the data management plan (doi: 10.17633/rd.brunel.3485234). Pseudonymised quantitative participant data will made available in a public repository following publication of data.</p><p>The Trial Steering Committee (TSC) will monitor and supervise the progress of the trial towards its interim and overall objectives. The membership of the TSC consists of an independent Chair person, who is not involved directly with the study, a representative from the funder of the study, two independent expert members and the chief investigator. All adverse events will be reported to the TSC. Serious adverse events will be reported to the trial sponsor within 24&#x02005;hours of a member of the research team becoming aware of it. Unexpected, related serious adverse events will be reported to the Research Ethics Committee within 15&#x02005;days of a member of the research team becoming aware of the event.</p><p>The findings of the trial will be distributed widely to academic and non-academic audiences. The results will be published in academic journals and presented at national and international conferences. Summaries of the results will also be developed and distributed to adolescents with CP, their families and healthcare professionals through the media, professional groups and charitable organisations. The research team will work with the TSC and the STAR advisory group, which consists of young people with and without CP, to ensure that these summaries are accessible to the target audience and that the results are disseminated through appropriate channels.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JMR and NT drafted the protocol and coordinated all subsequent revisions.
