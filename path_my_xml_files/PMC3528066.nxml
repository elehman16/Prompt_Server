The study was conducted in compliance with EU Clinical Trial Directive 2001/20/EC, the International Conference on Harmonization guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by an independent ethics committee that complied with local regulatory requirements. Voluntary written consent was obtained from all subjects before screening.</p><p>The study comprised a prestudy screening (Visit 1), followed by a 2-week run-in period, a 1-week, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase, then a 51-week open-label extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure</xref>). This paper reports data from the double-blind period only; outcomes of the open-label extension will be reported separately. During Week 1 of the run-in period, subjects were hospitalised for 5 days during which 96-h nutritional recording and 72-h stool collection were carried out to determine baseline CFA and coefficient of nitrogen (CNA) values. During this time, subjects did not receive PERT. Nutrition recording started 24 h before stool collection, which began at 0:00 hour on the second day of nutrition recording and ended at 24:00 hours on the last day of nutrition recording. Patients were advised by a dietician how to ingest at least 100 g dietary fat/day during this period. At the end of stool collection and nutritional recording (Visit 2), subjects were allowed to take their normal dose of PERT until randomisation. On Day 1 (Visit 3), which occurred within 1 week of Visit 2, subjects with a baseline CFA &#x02264; 80% were randomised to the double-blind phase. Nutrition recording and stool collection were conducted on Days 4&#x02013;7 in the same way as in the run-in period. Day 8 (Visit 4) marked the end of the double-blind phase.</p><fig id="f1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Patients were required to have PEI as determined by a CFA &#x02264; 80% during the run-in phase. Other inclusion criteria were &#x02265;18 years of age and, if women, nonlactating and not of childbearing potential or having agreed to practice an approved contraception method throughout the study, which had been used for at least 3 months prior to screening.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included: medical conditions that could interfere with the study or study drug; endocrine disease other than diabetes; major surgery except gall bladder removal or appendectomy; ileus or acute abdomen; any type of malignancy involving the digestive tract in the past 5 years; investigational drugs within 30 days prior to study entry; current excessive intake of alcohol or drug abuse; and hypersensitivity to porcine proteins or pancreatin.</p><p>Concomitant use of other PERT preparations was prohibited. Medications influencing duodenal pH [H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonists, antacids, sucralfate, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), prostaglandins, anticholinergic agents, or somatostatin], drugs acting on gastric emptying and drugs interfering with bile secretion could be given at a stable dose throughout the study. Other medications that did not interfere with the study or study drug were allowed if deemed necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment</title><p>Patients were enrolled by the participating centres and randomised 1:1 to pancreatin or placebo according to the randomisation list generated by the Pharmaceutical Supplies department of Abbott, using a block size of 8. Study medication was supplied with the randomisation codes printed on the labels.</p><p>Patients received pancreatin (Creon) 40000 MMS (Abbott) or placebo capsules orally. The dose was two capsules with each main meal (3 meals per day) and one capsule with snacks (2&#x02013;3 snacks per day) for a total of six to nine capsules per day. The first dose was to be taken with the first meal on Day 1. Creon 40000 MMS is provided as a hard, gastro-resistant capsule containing gastro-resistant pellets (Minimicrospheres) that provide 400 mg pancreatin (pancreatic enzyme powder) per capsule, corresponding to 40 000 Ph. Eur. units lipase. Thus, the dose in lipase units was 80 000 Ph. Eur. units per main meal and 40 000 Ph. Eur. units per snack. The actual lipase value at release was approximately 45 000 units/capsule.</p><p>Medication was dispensed in aluminium-aluminium blister packs with 10 capsules per blister. Blinding was maintained by the identical appearance of study medication and placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy outcome measure was the change in CFA from baseline to the end of double-blind treatment. CFA was determined by the equation CFA = 100*[(mean fat intake &#x02212; mean stool fat)/mean fat intake].

CNA was determined by the equation CNA = 100*[(mean nitrogen intake &#x02212; mean stool nitrogen)/mean nitrogen intake]. Mean stool weight, stool fat and stool nitrogen (g/day) were determined from the net weight/fat/nitrogen in the 72-h stool sample. Mean fat and nitrogen intake were determined from the 96-h dietary diaries by a dietician using suitable software; nitrogen intake was determined by calculating the mean protein intake recorded then multiplying by 0.16 (the average nitrogen content of a polypeptide chain). Clinical symptoms were assessed by investigators by asking subjects to provide information on number of stools per day, stool consistency (hard, formed/normal, soft, watery), flatulence (none, mild, moderate, or severe) and abdominal pain (none, mild, moderate, or severe). The CGI of disease symptoms was determined by investigators by asking patients to rate symptoms at each visit as none (absent), mild (present, but not bothersome), moderate (bothersome), severe (interfered with normal activity), or incapacitating (prevented normal activity).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety evaluation</title><p>Adverse events (AEs) were recorded using standard medical terminology and assigned to the terms in the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 12.1 (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Geneva, Switzerland). AEs were considered treatment-emergent (TEAEs) if they started or worsened with or after the first study drug administration and on the last day plus a gap period of 1 day. An AE was considered drug-related if the investigator judged it possibly or probably related to the experimental drug, or if this assessment was missing.</p><p>Physical examination and assessment of vital signs was carried out at baseline and at the end of the double-blind phase.

Assuming a normal distribution and a two-sided Type I level of 0.05, 28 patients in each treatment group were needed to achieve 90% statistical power. Therefore, 35 patients per treatment group were planned to account for missing data in 20% of subjects.</p><p>The safety sample comprised all subjects allocated to treatment who took at least one dose of pancreatin or placebo. Efficacy analyses were performed on the FA sample, defined as subjects in the safety sample who had at least one post-baseline assessment of any efficacy measurement.

In this 1-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, patients receiving pancreatin had a statistically significant greater improvement in fat absorption from baseline to the end of double-blind treatment compared with placebo, as measured using the CFA. Patients receiving pancreatin also had a significantly greater improvement in nitrogen absorption (CNA) compared with placebo, and greater reductions in mean stool fat, stool frequency and stool weight. Baseline CFA and CNA values were similar in both groups, and there were no between-group differences in fat and nitrogen intake at baseline or at the end of the double-blind period.</p><p>There were no relevant differences between groups regarding change in clinical symptoms (stool consistency, flatulence and abdominal pain) during the double-blind period. As clinical symptoms were not present or mild in most patients at baseline in both groups, it is unlikely that large changes would be seen over 1 week.</p><p>Greater improvements in the CGI of disease symptoms were observed in the pancreatin vs. the placebo group, although CGI ratings were slightly better in the placebo group at baseline. No changes were seen in body weight or BMI. These parameters would not be expected to change significantly over the course of 1 week; long-term changes will be analysed and described for the open-label period separately.</p><p>A subanalysis according to PPI use indicated that CFA values at the end of the double-blind period were similar in patients taking concomitant PPIs and in those not taking concomitant PPIs, suggesting that PPI use does not affect the efficacy of pancreatin. The greater increase from baseline in CFA in patients not taking PPIs can be explained by the lower baseline CFA in this subgroup.</p><p>Pancreatin was well tolerated with a good safety profile, and no unexpected AEs were observed. The overall incidence of TEAEs was higher in the pancreatin group; however, only one patient in the pancreatin group had a TEAE that was considered possibly related to treatment by the investigator. Gastrointestinal disorders were the most common TEAEs observed and were more frequent in the medical history of subjects in the pancreatin group at baseline (30% vs. 25% in the placebo group).</p><p>The outcomes of this study compare favourably with studies of other pancreatin formulations in patients with PEI due to CP. A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted in the United States and Eastern Europe investigated the efficacy and safety of pancreatin (Creon 12 000) in 54 patients with PEI due to CP or pancreatic surgery.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13"><sup>13</sup></xref> That study had a similar design to the present study, but patients received placebo during a 5-day run-in period prior to the 7-day double-blind phase. Mean CFA and CNA values on pancreatin at the end of the double-blind period (86% and 79%, respectively) were similar to those reported in this study, and the mean changes from baseline were significantly greater with pancreatin vs. placebo (CFA: 32% vs. 9%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001; CNA: 35% vs. 9%, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0005). The greater magnitude of change from baseline is likely due to lower baseline CFA and CNA values in the pancreatin group (54% and 46%, respectively), which indicates more severe PEI at baseline compared with this study. Different CP aetiology (e.g. a higher proportion of idiopathic CP or TCP) could be a contributing factor to the higher baseline CFA and CNA values observed in this study, indicating less severe PEI. Differences in the dietary content of the two patient populations may also have contributed to these baseline differences. Although patients were advised by a dietician in both studies to ensure ingestion of at least 100 g fat/day, the dietary fat intake in the Whitcomb <italic>et al</italic>. study was approximately one-third higher than that of the patients in this study and the protein intake approximately double, which may lead to greater malabsorption in patients not receiving PERT. Similar improvements in stool frequency were seen in both studies. In the Whitcomb <italic>et al</italic>. study, statistically significant improvements in flatulence and stool consistency were observed with pancreatin vs. placebo. As might be expected in patients with more severe PEI, clinical symptoms appeared to be more severe at baseline compared with this study. In the 6-month, open-label extension of the Whitcomb <italic>et al</italic>. study, the CFA and CNA were not assessed, but from baseline to end of open-label treatment, there was a significant improvement in stool frequency (1.0 &#x000b1; 1.3 stools/day; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and body weight (2.73 &#x000b1; 3.35 kg; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24"><sup>24</sup></xref> Improvements in clinical symptoms (abdominal pain, stool consistency and flatulence) and CGI of disease symptoms were also observed.</p><p>In a separate, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in the United States, 27 patients with PEI due to CP were randomised to pancreatin (Creon 10) or placebo for 2 weeks following a 2-week placebo run-in phase.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14"><sup>14</sup></xref> CFA values at the end of the double-blind phase were 87% on pancreatin and 68% on placebo, similar to the present study. The changes from baseline (37% and 12%; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0185) were again of larger magnitude than in this study owing to lower baseline CFA values (50% pancreatin and 56% placebo). Significant reductions in stool frequency were observed and physician-assessed GCI scores were significantly improved with pancreatin vs. placebo.</p><p>The on-treatment CFA and CNA values in this study were also comparable to those seen in a double-blind, randomised, cross-over study of another available PERT formulation [Zenpep (pancrelipase) Delayed-Release Capsules].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25"><sup>25</sup></xref> In that study, the on-treatment CFA was 88.9% with low-dose PERT and 89.9% with high-dose PERT (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 vs. placebo run-in value of 81.7%), and the CNA was 84.1% and 85.4%, respectively (both <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001 vs. 78.1% placebo).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25"><sup>25</sup></xref> However, unlike our study, patients were not required to meet a predefined level of PEI severity at baseline.</p><p>The dosing schedule used in this study of 80 000 Ph. Eur. lipase units per main meal and 40 000 per snack is similar to that used in the Whitcomb <italic>et al</italic>. study (72 000 USP lipase units per main meal and 36 000 per snack). This is an established recommended dose for the treatment of PEI due to CP; in clinical practice dose should be tailored to the individual patient's needs. These doses are within dosing ranges recommended by other authors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26 b27"><sup>26, 27</sup></xref></p><p>The patient population in this study [mean age 43 years (range 18&#x02013;62)] was younger than those assessed in the other two studies described above [51 (32&#x02013;75) and 51 (31&#x02013;74), respectively].<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13 b14"><sup>13, 14</sup></xref> This may be due to differing aetiology of CP in this Indian patient population compared with the United States and European studies, with a greater frequency of idiopathic CP and TCP in this study. Detailed information on the aetiology of CP for the patients enrolled in this study is not available. The proportion of patients having undergone pancreatic surgery was slightly lower in the pancreatin group (24%) than in the placebo group (36%). However, we do not consider this to be a limitation, as the focus of this study was the treatment of PEI rather than CP or pancreatic surgery. All patients enrolled in this study had the presence of PEI confirmed based on a CFA &#x02264; 80%; the aetiology of the underlying disease is not expected to affect the efficacy or safety of pancreatin in treating PEI. Furthermore, the previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Whitcomb <italic>et al</italic>. found no difference in pancreatin efficacy when comparing the CFA outcome in patients with CP vs. patients who had undergone pancreatic surgery.2010</xref></p><p>The findings of this study are applicable to all other currently available pancreatin MMS formulations as they differ in strength in terms of lipase. This study adds to the existing clinical evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of pancreatin and provides additional information on its efficacy and safety in a patient population from a different geographical region to those enrolled in previous clinical studies.</p><p>Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence for the efficacy of pancreatin (Creon) 40000 MMS in patients with PEI due to CP, and confirm that this formulation is well tolerated at the dose administered.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the following for their assistance: Dr Anita Bijoor, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, St John's Medical College, Bangalore, India for analysis of stool samples; personnel at Quintiles India; and the study team at Lakeshore hospital: Manish Gandhi, Mahesh Subramaniaiyer, and Asha S.
