Women commonly must access an array of VA and non-VA providers, usually requiring multiple separate visits, to achieve the same basic level of care which male veterans can achieve through a single on-site PC visit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The VA has invested in a variety of resources intended to improve WVs&#x02019; care, establishing women&#x02019;s health clinics, designating Women&#x02019;s Health (WH) PC providers with the requisite training/experience, and contracting with non-VA obstetrics and gynecology services. Despite these investments, WVs&#x02019; quality of care in VA continues to lag behind that of male veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Contributing to these outcomes is the lack of gender sensitivity prevalent in many VA care settings, which may be linked to low WV retention rates in VA care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">The VA has undertaken a major initiative to transform care through mandated implementation of Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACTs), which hold promise for addressing many of the gaps in WVs&#x02019; care. The PACT model is based on the concept of patient-centered medical homes (PCMHs), widely endorsed by PC professional societies and shown to improve quality of care and patient, provider, and staff satisfaction, while reducing costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. PACT focuses on development of high-performing &#x0201c;teamlets&#x0201d; comprised of PC providers, nurses, and administrative support who together manage care of a defined panel of patients. These teamlets operate within a larger team that includes, for example, pharmacists, social workers, mental health (MH) providers, and dietitians, and link to specialists and hospital care in their medical &#x0201c;neighborhood.&#x0201d; Through these teams/teamlets, PACT aims to achieve improvements in accessibility, continuity, coordination, and comprehensiveness using team-based care that is patient-driven and patient-centered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These improvements, in turn, should translate into better chronic illness care and prevention and lower costs.</p><p id="Par7">However, how VA should adapt this major reorganization to meet the needs of special populations, such as WVs, is yet to be fully worked out. The PACT model itself does not include specific accommodations for gender-specific care or improved gender sensitivity. Current WV care is also out of step with PACT priorities and emphasis on &#x0201c;one-stop shopping&#x0201d; for care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For example, WVs are more likely to be outsourced to the community for gender-specific services now than they were 10&#x000a0;years ago, and, while the number of women&#x02019;s clinics is up, over 40&#x000a0;% do not deliver comprehensive PC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, improving VA PC alone or &#x0201c;beefing up&#x0201d; women&#x02019;s clinics is unlikely to achieve what an integrated WH-PACT model must reconcile to improve care for WVs and thereby reduce persistent gender disparities in VA care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Research aims</title><p id="Par8">We propose to use evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) in the context of the Chronic Care Model to develop and test achievement of WH-PACT in a cluster randomized trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. EBQI is a systematic approach to developing local research-clinical partnerships to produce tailored, evidence-based care models or redesigns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The resulting WH-PACT redesign will make use of local WH resources (e.g., women&#x02019;s clinics, designated providers), while linking them to the broader PACT initiative and medical center resources. We will also explore the extent to which receiving care that meets WH-PACT tenets translates into higher value (better quality, lower costs) for individual WVs, evaluate local implementation, and develop tools for sustaining and spreading WH-PACT.</p><p id="Par9">Our aims are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par10">

Together, PBRN facilities serve over 100,000 WVs (about one third of WVs seen in VA) and span diverse patient populations. We identified five VISNs with three or more WH-PBRN sites; we excluded one that was already participating in a VISN-wide EBQI stepped-wedge trial. We approached leadership at the other four VISNs and their WH-PBRN member site leads about study participation. All agreed to participate. One VISN dropped out ahead of randomization, which was replaced with a VISN that had two WH-PBRN sites; we then worked with VISN leadership to identify a third non-PBRN VAMC, which subsequently joined the WH-PBRN (since the trial began, the WH-PBRN has expanded to 60 VAMCs in 20 of 21 VISNs). VAMCs participating in the trial span nine states (Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin).</p><p id="Par17">This study is designed as a parallel two-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial (cRCT), blocked on VISN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Evaluation and data collection activities are submitted serially to the GLA IRB for review as discrete human subject research component projects (e.g., patient survey component, provider/staff survey component). Two components involved contractors at local affiliates (teamlet interviews with UCLA, provider/staff survey with RAND Health), whose IRBs also reviewed and approved their respective activities.</p><p id="Par20">The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02039856).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>VA partnerships</title><p id="Par21">This study is one of the five inter-related projects that together comprise a WH-focused research-clinical partnership funded by VA Health Services Research and Development (HSR&#x00026;D) Service under the Collaborative Research to Enhance and Advance Transformation and Excellence (CREATE) initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Central to CREATE is the involvement of policy and/or practice partners in the design, conduct, and dissemination of study results, with an emphasis on implementation and spread of successful strategies. Within the VA Office of Patient Care Services, Women&#x02019;s Health Services (WHS) is the WH CREATE&#x02019;s primary partner, with close involvement of Mental Health Services (MHS) in assessing within- and across-project mental health analyses and themes. The WH CREATE is also advised by an Executive Steering Committee, comprised of WHS and MHS partners, representatives in national VA clinical quality reporting, regional network leadership, public affairs, WH clinical care delivery, WH policy, and implementation science and economics, as well as WVs who use the VA for care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Conceptual framework for application of EBQI</title><p id="Par22">This study is guided conceptually and practically by the Chronic Care Model (CCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Developed more than a decade ago, the CCM has been widely adopted to help guide clinical QI initiatives in the context of practices or teams in the USA and abroad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The CCM depicts the health system linked with complementary community resources, while providers and teams within each healthcare organization (regardless of size) aim to deliver care that is characterized by consistent, evidence-based assessment, treatment, and follow-up, with clinical decision support (often via information technology) and support for patient self-management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Applied to EBQI, local QI teams work on improvement plans that consider one or more CCM elements.</p><p id="Par23">The CCM is a particularly strong fit for QI around medical homes, with an easy crosswalk to PACT goals. For example, for care coordination, PACT teamlets should link patients with community resources to facilitate referrals and respond to social service needs; provide care management services for high-risk patients; integrate behavioral health and specialty care through structured collaboration, co-location, or referral protocols; track and support patients when they obtain services outside the practice; follow up with patients within a few days of an emergency room visit or hospital discharge; and communicate test results and care plans to patients/families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">Addressing CCM elements, however, requires substantial stakeholder buy-in, local knowledge and skills in QI, availability of needed technical support, and continual guidance. Previous research has shown that evidence-based programs require adaptation to organizational values, needs, and resources prior to dissemination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. More structured than continuous quality improvement (CQI), which has had mixed results, EBQI is a systematic approach to developing a multilevel research-clinical partnership approach to QI, using top-down/bottom-up features to engage senior organizational leaders and local QI teams in implementing improvements in the context of prior evidence, provider behavior change methods, and local practice structure and resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. National strategic directives serve as guides, while regional expert panels set innovation design priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Local interdisciplinary QI teams design and implement local activities, while researchers serve as technical experts and guides. EBQI also uses team-based CQI methods to help teams structure their aims and measures and conduct plan-do-study-act (PDSA) cycles, in addition to convening topic-focused workgroups with research/clinical expertise with periodic across-site meetings for training and sharing data and lessons learned. EBQI&#x02019;s value-added contribution is an emphasis on (a) applying objective evidence, with (b) theory review and synthesis integrated into aspects of innovation design and implementation, (c) valid and reliable measurement, and (d) formal measurement feedback to stakeholders at all levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Effectively applied to a series of VA implementation studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], EBQI uses well-established implementation strategies, such as local priority setting among key stakeholders, adaptation of the evidence to local context (practice tailoring), audit-and-feedback of QI data to support rapid cycle improvements, and practice facilitation to support implementation into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>EBQI implementation strategies applied to WH-PACT and hypotheses</title><p id="Par25">In this study, we propose to use EBQI to convene multilevel stakeholder panels (presenting panels with evidence on factors associated with improved WH care in the context of national VA WH policy); facilitate local practice QI team design meetings, while providing QI training/education and iterative QI data feedback; and sponsor within and across-practice QI collaboration calls (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). We will continually foster coverage of CCM elements.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI) conceptual model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13012_2016_461_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par26">We hypothesize that the initial results of EBQI will be the specification of the design choices for WH-PACT implementation, conduct of local QI activities, and improved provider/staff (and team) QI orientation, WH knowledge and attitudes, and gender awareness. We further hypothesize that EBQI will lead to higher achievement of WH-PACT (more practices achieve more features) in EBQI vs. control practices (aim #1). We anticipate that practice context (e.g., local leadership support, pre-EBQI factors) will moderate the relationships between EBQI and implementation of WH-PACT. We will then explore the extent to which receipt of WH-PACT concordant care (PACT features, comprehensive WH care, gender sensitive care delivery) is associated with improved WH-PACT outcomes (aim #2).</p><p id="Par27">For aim #3 (processes), we will document EBQI activities among intervention practices and examine barriers and facilitators to WH-PACT achievement in all participating practices.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Sample size calculation and power analysis</title><p id="Par30">We based our power calculations on the study&#x02019;s unequal (2:1) intervention-to-control ratio and clustered sample design. To detect a moderate (0.20) effect size between WVs at intervention and control sites, we considered data from the Primary Care Satisfaction Survey for Women&#x02019;s Care Coordination and Comprehensiveness scale, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] with 12 practices (8 intervention-to-4 control sites), cluster adjustment (ICC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], and two-tailed 5&#x000a0;% significance level. Based on these parameters, we will target enrollment of a minimum of 40 WVs at each of the 12 study sites over the 2-year period (baseline to 24-month follow-up), for a total of 480 WVs who complete a baseline and at least one of the two follow-up surveys (12- and/or 24-month). To achieve this target, we will create a baseline sample of 6665 WVs who have received PC or WH care at one of the study&#x02019;s 12 participating sites during the 12-month period prior to the baseline survey (555 per site). Allowing for a conservative 20&#x000a0;% response rate and 40&#x000a0;% attrition over the 2-year period, we aim to enroll 111 WVs at each of the 12 sites at baseline, for a total of 1333 interviews at the completion of the first wave.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p id="Par31">The primary outcome measure, focused on achievement of the PACT model of care for WVs, will include changes in levels of achievement of individual PACT features: access, continuity, care coordination, team-based care, patient-driven care, patient-centeredness, comprehensiveness (including gender-specific services and integrated MH), and gender sensitivity (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These measures will be examined at the practice, provider/staff, and patient levels and investigated qualitatively using the key stakeholder and teamlet interviews.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p id="Par32">Secondary outcome measures include WH-PACT outcomes that should result from achievement of the full PACT model, including improvements in quality of care and health status, and reductions in utilization and costs. For quality of care, we will examine chronic disease quality (e.g., process measures such as foot sensation exams or eye exams among diabetics) and preventive practice (e.g., women&#x02019;s breast and cervical cancer screening and gender-neutral prevention, such as influenza immunizations and colorectal cancer screening). We will determine whether total annual costs per patient and utilization by type of care (e.g., primary care, specialty care, hospitalizations, emergency department visit rates) have changed in EBQI vs. routine PACT implementation VAMCs and based on level of WH-PACT achievement. We anticipate, however, that acute and emergency care may be too rare in our practice populations to have the power to detect differences over time, so these analyses will be exploratory.</p><p id="Par33">We will also examine impacts on provider and staff WH knowledge and attitudes, QI orientation/culture, and gender awareness, as well as changes in practice contextual factors as a result of EBQI exposure (e.g., changes in leadership support, local resources applied to WH and primary care QI, training).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par34">We will use multivariate regression to determine EBQI effectiveness, adjusting for covariates, clustering, and enrollment and attrition weights at the patient and provider/staff levels. The primary regressor of interest is being at an EBQI vs. routine PACT implementation site. We will examine the potential moderating effects of practice context and provider/staff knowledge/attitudes. Patient-level controls will include sociodemographic characteristics, health status, comorbidity, and utilization. Adjustment for clustering will be performed using Stata v13. We will evaluate goodness-of-fit using Mallow&#x02019;s statistic (C<sub>p</sub>). We will use multiple imputation methods to address missing data patterns among covariates, although CATI procedures will significantly reduce item non-response in the patient survey, and the web-survey methods will do the same for the provider/staff surveys. Hot deck imputation will be used for imputation of missing values within scales as needed. To address the potential for response bias, patient and provider/staff survey data will be weighted to the inverse of the probability of selection based on available characteristics in the administrative data used to randomly sample them. We will use factor analysis and cluster analysis using PACT features (e.g., access), comprehensive women&#x02019;s health care (e.g., gender-specific care availability), and gender-sensitive care delivery (e.g., availability of same-gender providers or gender-aware providers) for WH-PACT achievement variable creation.</p><p id="Par35">All semi-structured interviews will be audio-recorded and transcribed, and qualitative analysis will be conducted using ATLAS.ti version 7.

The codebook will then be elaborated based on emergent themes using a constant comparison analytic approach, adjusting as each round of interviews is reviewed. Interviews will be compared within and across facilities and over time. In baseline key stakeholder and teamlet transcripts, we will conduct targeted coding of PACT-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and experiences; expectations of WH-PACT&#x02019;s effectiveness; and practice contextual factors that influence how care is delivered (and changed) locally.

Given the growing number of WVs relying on VA care, the expansion of services for which WVs are now eligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and the pressing need to reduce persistent gender disparities in VA care, the VA will reap important benefits from determining how to adapt PACT to enhance WVs&#x02019; outcomes.

The strength of our partnerships with WH and primary care leadership will also ensure that we are continually grounded in fiscal, management, and strategic issues of consequence as the study is conducted.

For retrospective administrative data pulls and analysis, we obtained a human subjects research exemption.</p><p id="Par51">The VA Central IRB (Washington DC) also determined that the participating VA medical centers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) were not engaged in research and that the intervention (or implementation strategy, evidence-based quality improvement (EBQI)) was QI. Documentation of IRB approval (and in VA settings, Research &#x00026; Development Committee approval as well) and Central IRB determination of non-research for the implementation strategy are available on request. Two of the study components involved contractors at local affiliates (teamlet interviews with UCLA Fielding School of Public Health and provider/staff surveys with RAND Health), whose IRBs also reviewed and approved their respective activities in addition to the VA IRB.</p><p id="Par52">No animals are or will be involved in this study protocol. Similarly, the use of animal or human data or tissue is not applicable to this study protocol.</p><p id="Par53">No individual person&#x02019;s data in any form are or will be included in this or subsequent manuscripts. Only aggregated patient, clinician, and staff survey data will be reported. For key stakeholder and/or teamlet interview data, non-attributed or identifiable quotes may be reported in addition to thematic summaries.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>U.S. General Accounting Office</collab></person-group><source>Actions needed to ensure that female veterans have equal access to VA benefits</source><year>1982</year><publisher-loc>Washington, DC</publisher-loc><publisher-name>GAO Publications</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Veterans Health Administration</collab></person-group><source>Sourcebook: women veterans in the Veterans Health Administration.
