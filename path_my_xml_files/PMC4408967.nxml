The chemical structure of pregabalin is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cpaa-7-069">Figure 1</xref>. Pregabalin is considered to be highly soluble, rapidly dissolves in water, basic, or acidic aqueous solutions, and is highly permeable.<xref rid="b1-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Pregabalin is used in combination with other anticonvulsant agents in the treatment of partial seizures. It is also indicated for management of neuropathic pain, including postherpetic neuralgia and pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, as well as generalized anxiety disorder and fibromyalgia. The dose ranges from 150 to 600 mg/day and is given in either two or three divided doses. Pregabalin binds with high affinity to an auxiliary subunit (&#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-&#x003b4; protein) of voltage-gated calcium channels in the central nervous system (CNS), which is responsible for its analgesic and anticonvulsant effects. Pregabalin reduces calcium-dependent release of several neurotransmitters by the modulation of calcium channel function. It is structurally related to the inhibitory CNS neurotransmitter &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA). However, the drug does not bind directly to GABA<sub>A</sub>, GABA<sub>B</sub>, or benzodiazepine receptors, does not increase GABA<sub>A</sub> response in cultured neurons, and does not alter brain concentrations of GABA or affect GABA uptake or degradation.<xref rid="b2-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b4-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Pregabalin pharmacokinetics are dose proportional over the range of recommended daily doses. It also has low intersubject pharmacokinetic variability &#x02013; according to Bockbrader et al,<xref rid="b5-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> the intersubject variability of pregabalin, reported as coefficient of variation (CV), is below 15%. Pregabalin is rapidly absorbed after oral doses and takes approximately 1.5 hours to achieve its maximum plasma concentrations (C<sub>max</sub>). Its oral bioavailability is more than 90% and is independent of dose. The rate of pregabalin absorption is reduced when given with food, resulting in an approximate 25% to 30% decrease in C<sub>max</sub> and an approximate 3-hour increase in time to C<sub>max</sub> (t<sub>max</sub>), but this is not clinically significant, as the extent of absorption is not affected. Therefore, it can be taken with or without food. Pregabalin is not bound to plasma proteins and has been shown to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier as well as the placenta in preclinical studies.<xref rid="b6-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Pregabalin undergoes insignificant metabolism in humans. More than 90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug, with a terminal half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of 4.8 to 6.3 hours in subjects with normal renal function. Race and sex do not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of pregabalin, but the dosing of this drug has to be adjusted according to creatinine clearance. Pregabalin does not interact with other drugs because of its lack of hepatic metabolism and interaction with cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes.<xref rid="b1-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>According to World Health Organization (WHO) estimation, eight in one thousand people in the world have epilepsy.<xref rid="b7-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The prevalence in developing countries is even higher. More than half of the total epilepsy patients worldwide are estimated to live in Asia.<xref rid="b8-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The condition results in a vast need of antiepileptic drugs, such as pregabalin. However, availability of the drug has become one of the most prevailing problems in the disease management.<xref rid="b11-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Therefore generic products are urgently needed to satisfy patients&#x02019; needs. Not only having to provide availability in the market and offer more competitive pricing, generic products also have to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to the reference (innovator&#x02019;s) product. Therapeutic equivalence is defined as the sharing of the same beneficial and adverse effects between two products or formulations, resulting in the interchangeability of both products.<xref rid="b12-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>To ensure therapeutic equivalence, a pharmacokinetic equivalence study can be performed. According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for industry,<xref rid="b12-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> pharmacokinetic equivalence or bioequivalence is determined as the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives becomes available at the site of drug action, when administered at the same molar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study. In other word, it is the condition where two medicinal products show a similar bioavailability. The objective of the present study (registry identification number: NCT02233777) was to find out whether the pregabalin capsule produced by PT Dexa Medica, Palembang, Indonesia was bioequivalent to the reference product manufactured by Pfizer Manufacturing Deutschland GmbH, Germany.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study subjects and design</title><p>Before study commencement, the protocol, patient information, and consent form was approved by the Health Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Indonesia.

There was no serious adverse event reported in the study, and all events were resolved at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the test formulation of pregabalin capsule 150 mg is bioequivalent to the reference formulation. Since absorption of the investigational formulation is sufficient to measure the drug concentration directly in blood and systemic absorption is relevant to drug action, a blood-level bioequivalence study was preferred over a pharmacologic or clinical end point study.<xref rid="b21-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The results were mainly intended to fulfil regulatory requirements for an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) submission of the tested product. The condition of bioequivalence demonstrates that the generic medicinal product is therapeutically equivalent with its reference, and therefore, it is unnecessary to conduct any comparative clinical studies to prove safety and efficacy. Thus, selection of the reference product is important. Reference products should pass through a series of preclinical and clinical trials in order to establish their safety and efficacy.<xref rid="b22-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Because the outcome from one bioequivalence study cannot be generalized to any other generic medicinal products containing the same active substance, the present study was required despite the availability of bioequivalence studies on other pregabalin capsule formulations.<xref rid="b19-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b24-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>A further intention in performing a reliable bioequivalence study is to provide a generic product that, not only offers more competitive pricing but also, demonstrates similar quality to its reference formulation in regard to safety and efficacy. The concept of providing a generic medicinal product supports the application of pharmacoeconomics. According to Arenas-Guzman et al,<xref rid="b25-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> pharmacoeconomics is the branch of economics related to the most economical and efficient use of pharmaceuticals to yield maximum value to patients, health care payers, and society in general. Recently, health care practitioners have been encouraged to make clinical and policy decisions based on the consideration of economic aspects rather than on clinical outcomes only. One of the most fundamental assessments is the assessment of direct medical costs, one of which is drug cost.<xref rid="b26-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The availability of a generic medicinal product can give pharmacoeconomic benefits according to patient and provider perspectives because it gives option for both patient and the health care provider when they have to select the most rational medication.</p><p>This bioequivalence study was conducted in healthy subjects in order to minimize pharmacokinetic variability, which can emerge if performed in patients with any concomitant illnesses and medications. The number of subjects that participated in the study was determined using means of CIs as tabulated by Diletti et al.<xref rid="b27-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The intrasubject variability, reported as CV, obtained for the pregabalin AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> was 5.09%. With this result, the participation of 20 subjects in the study was regarded adequate to ensure that the study had enough power to confirm statistical conclusion.</p><p>In this study, the study drugs were given as a single-dose preparation as recommended in the guidance of bioavailability and bioequivalence studies<xref rid="b12-cpaa-7-069" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> because this is generally more sensitive in assessing release of drug substance into the systemic circulation. For a single-dose study, measurement of the study drug&#x02019;s total exposure will include AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>; while measurement of peak exposure will comprise the C<sub>max</sub>, which is obtained directly from the systemic drug concentration data. The results of the present study showed that the 90% CIs of the test/reference ratios for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> of pregabalin were within the acceptance range of bioequivalence (80.00%&#x02013;125.00%).</p><p>Besides AUC and C<sub>max</sub>, this study also reported the t<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>1/2</sub> of pregabalin. The median (range) of t<sub>max</sub> for the test and reference formulations of pregabalin were 1.00 (0.67&#x02013;2.00) hours and 1.00 (0.67&#x02013;3.00) hours, respectively. Those values were proven not significant statistically. In the meantime, the mean (SD) of the t<sub>1/2</sub> for the test and reference formulations of pregabalin were 5.66 (1.20) hours and 5.87 (1.25) hours, respectively.
