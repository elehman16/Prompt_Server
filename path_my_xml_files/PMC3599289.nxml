Although the respiratory support of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has improved and new modes of mechanical ventilation (MV) have been developed, the occurrence of BPD has remained substantially unchanged. Nevertheless, one aspect of respiratory care in preterm infants which has not yet been thoroughly investigated is respiratory assistance in the delivery room immediately after birth. In fact, lung protection should start in the delivery room where, from the first breaths, the preterm infant can be helped to clear the lung fluid; to recruit alveolar spaces facilitating the formation of the functional residual capacity (FRC); to protect the lung by avoiding large tidal volume; to avoid the continuous &#x02018;opening and closing&#x02019; of the alveoli by delivering positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP); and to verify the need for surfactant replacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Recently, some studies have investigated the effectiveness of the early sustained lung inflation (SLI) procedure in preterm infants for prevention of MV. This strategy would permit lung recruitment immediately after birth through delivery of brief peak pressure to the infant airways via a nasopharyngeal tube or mask allowing preterm infants to achieve FRC. To avoid lung collapse at the end of the expiration, the effect of PEEP is crucial. SLI and PEEP seem to have an additive effect on adequate FRC formation by permitting optimal gas exchange, improving lung mechanics and reducing the need for respiratory support.</p><p>This technique has been proven to be more effective than intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) in improving FRC in the asphyxiated term newborn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Lindner <italic>et al</italic>. treated preterm infants by using SLI in the delivery room without a significant decrease in the MV rate or adverse effects in comparison with treatment with nasal-intermittent mandatory ventilation (NIMV) noted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, te Pas <italic>et al</italic>. treated preterm infants with repeatable SLI maneuvers and found a decrease in the need for MV at 72 hours of life and BPD in comparison with treatment in the delivery room with a self-inflating bag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These results are in agreement with the findings of a recent paper from the same group, which demonstrates the synergistic effect of SLI and following subsequent treatment with PEEP (delivered by nasal continuous airway pressure (NCPAP)) in achieving and maintaining a FRC improvement in an animal model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, Lista<italic>et al</italic>. recently reported that SLI followed by the delivery of NCPAP is effective in reducing the need for MV and the occurrence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in survivors compared to NCPAP alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>We therefore intend to compare the application of SLI followed by NCPAP with NCPAP alone in the delivery room to evaluate its effectiveness in decreasing the need for MV and improving respiratory outcome in preterm infants at risk for RDS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to compare the need for MV in the first 72 hours of life (excluding the transient tracheal intubation performed for surfactant administration) in infants born at 25<sup>+0</sup> to 28<sup>+6</sup> weeks&#x02019; gestation who received the SLI maneuver in the delivery room or not.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This will be an unblinded multicenter randomized trial of SLI versus noSLI in infants born at 25<sup>+0</sup> to 28<sup>+6</sup> weeks&#x02019; gestation.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Inborn infants satisfying the following inclusion criteria will be eligible to participate in the study:</p><p>1.

Informed written consent will be signed by both the parents and sufficient time will be allowed for consent. Non-Italian speaking parents will only be asked for their consent if an adult interpreter is available. Trust interpreter and link worker services will be used to support involvement of participants whose first language is not Italian.

After oropharyngeal and nasal suctioning, pre-ssure-controlled (25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) inflation will be sustained for 15 seconds, using a neonatal mask and a T-piece ventilator, followed by the delivery of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O NCPAP. Patients will be observed for the following 6 to 10 seconds to evaluate their cardio-respiratory function. If respiratory failure persists (that is, apnea and gasping) and/or the heart rate is &#x0003e;60 and &#x0003c;100 bpm despite NCPAP, the SLI maneuver (again 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O for 15 seconds) will be repeated. If the heart rate remains &#x0003e;60 and &#x0003c;100 bpm after the second SLI maneuver, the infant will be resuscitated following the current guidelines of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Moreover, if the heart rate remains &#x0003c;60 bpm the infant will be resuscitated following the current guidelines of the AAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and a second SLI maneuver will be repeated when the heart rate increases to &#x0003e;60 and &#x0003c;100 bpm. Infants in the control group will be treated with delivery of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O NCPAP and will be assisted following the guidelines of the AAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>All enrolled infants will be transferred to the NICU in NCPAP (PEEP at 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p>Neonatal care will be started with FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.21 to 0.40 in both the groups, in agreement with the local protocols. Respiratory support in the delivery room will be given using the same T-piece ventilator (Neopuff Infant T-Piece Resuscitator, Fisher &#x00026; Paykel, Auckland, New Zealand), which is a pressure-limited mechanical device that supplies consistent peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) and PEEP, and is capable of delivering sustained inflation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. To avoid pressure leakage, a neonatal mask of appropriate size which adequately covers both the mouth and nostrils of infants will be used. The flow rate will be set at 8 to 10 l/min without changes during the resuscitation.</p></sec><sec><title>Criteria for starting MV</title><p>In the delivery room, infants will be started on MV if they have not reached the goal of 70% SpO<sub>2</sub> by 5 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and 85% by 10 minutes of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] with a heart rate &#x0003e;100 bpm, despite NCPAP at 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. In the NICU, infants will be started on MV when the pH is &#x0003c;7.20 with PaCO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003e;65 mmHg, PaO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;50 mmHg with FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265;0.50 after surfactant treatment, or if infants have frequent episodes of apnea (&#x0003e;4 episodes in 1 hour or &#x0003e;2 episodes requiring bag-and-mask ventilation), despite adequate NCPAP (5 to 7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O) delivery and oxygenation. MV will be set to maintain a PaCO<sub>2</sub> of 55 to 65 mmHg and 88 to 95% SpO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Other aspects of respiratory support</title><p>To maintain an adequate SpO<sub>2,</sub> infants with an FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x02265;0.40 will be treated with surfactant (200 mg/kg Curosurf, ChiesiPharmaceuticals, Parma, Italy) followed by the reinstitution of NCPAP as soon as vital signs are satisfactory (intubation-surfactant-extubation (INSURE) strategy). All infants who will need MV will be treated with surfactant and will then be gradually weaned from it. Additional doses of surfactant (100 mg/kg) will be given to infants, also through the INSURE strategy, at the discretion of the attending neonatologist.</p><p>Infants will be extubated, after a loading dose of caffeine citrate (20 mg/kg), when they meet all of the following criteria: FiO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;0.40, PaCO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;65 mmHg with a pH &#x0003e;7.20, MAP &#x0003c;7 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, hemodynamic stability and the absence of clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection</title><p>All collected data will be obtained from the clinical records.
