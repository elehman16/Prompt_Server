Periodontal regeneration can be achieved by a variety of surgical procedures including bone grafts, bone substitutes, guided tissue regeneration (GTR) or a combination of bone grafts or bone substitutes and GTR.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Clinical research performed in periodontal regeneration has suggested that one of the most predictable techniques in improving clinical attachment levels and bone fill is achieved when using a combination of a graft material and GTR.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The ideal graft material is one that is osteoinductive, easy to manipulate, absorbable, and abundant. Bovine porous bone mineral (Bio-Oss Collagen) is a relatively new material used in periodontal regeneration. This material is prepared by protein extraction of bovine bone which results in a structure similar to human cancellous bone and has the ability to enhance bone formation.</p><p>Bone formation has been shown with bovine bone mineral in sinus elevation procedures around endosseous implants and in critical size osseous defects.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Mechanical barriers are used with the objective of controlling early periodontal surgical wound-healing dynamics in order to promote periodontal regeneration. Basically, barrier membrane serves the purpose of preventing epithelial downgrowth, thereby allowing progenitor cells of the bone and periodontal ligament to regenerate desirable tissues from the base of the defect.</p><p>Several materials have been used as barriers for GTR and shown to be well tolerated by the gingival tissues.</p><p>A bilayer collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) of porcine origin has been shown to be a promising alternative in guided tissue regeneration since it is slowly absorbable, (possibly lasting as much as 9 months)[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and therefore having the potential to promote regeneration of the periodontal tissues. This membrane has been shown to be as effective as expanded polytetrafluoroethylene membranes in guided bone regeneration around dental implants.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>TISSEEL is a highly concentrated fibrin glue (FG) which has been widely used in many surgical disciplines including periodontal surgery. Beside its hemostatic capabilities, FG has been used in periodontal surgery to fixate gingival grafts to recipient sites[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and to enhance treatment outcome of different reconstructive procedures. TISSEEL contains factors, such as thrombin, fibrin, fibronectin, and PDGF, which are known to retain biological activities, in particular on cell proliferation and differentiation, and which may also stimulate wound healing by acting as a scaffold for the proliferation of mesenchymal and endothelial cells. This in turn may lead to an increased granulation tissue formation, deposition of collagen, and enhance the restoration of a severed tissue compartment of the attachment apparatus of the tooth, which have been lost due to periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>The present study was undertaken to compare clinically and radiographically, the regenerative potential of a bovine-derived xenograft (Bio-Oss Collagen) with either a bioresorbable type I collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) or fibrin fibronectin sealing system, TISSEEL in treating periodontal infrabony defects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 14 healthy patients, fulfilling the selection criteria were enrolled for this study. Twenty eight sites in these 14 patients showing bilateral/contralateral infrabony defects were randomly selected according to the split mouth design and divided into experimental site A and experimental site B.</p><p>Experimental Site A: 14 sites were treated with open flap surgery followed by placement of bovine derived xenograft (Bio-Oss Collagen) with a bioresorbable type I collagen membrane (Bio-Gide).</p><p>Experimental Site B: 14 sites were treated with open flap surgery followed by placement of a bovine derived xenograft (Bio-Oss Collagen) with fibrin fibronectin sealing system (TISSEEL).</p><p>Inclusion criteria included patients with the age group of 20 to 60 years, with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis with pocket depth of &#x02265;5 mm, having at least two infrabony defects &#x02265;3 mm, on any two quadrants or on contralateral sides of the same arch. Radiographic evidence of the infrabony defect had to exist. The exclusion criteria consisted of patients with uncontrolled diabetes; on anticoagulant/immunosuppressive therapy and/or with other systemic disease; patients unable to perform routine oral hygiene procedures; patients with history of drug allergy, and who are known smokers. Patients were informed as to the character and purpose of the study and were required to sign an informed consent. The study design and consent was approved by the University Institutional Review Board.</p><p>Initial therapy consisted of oral hygiene instructions which were repeated until patients achieved an O&#x02019;Leary plaque score (O&#x02019;Leary <italic>et al</italic>. 1972)[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] of 25% or below followed by scaling and root planing. A re-evaluation was performed after 6 to 8 weeks to confirm the indication for periodontal surgery.</p><p>The following calculations were made from the clinical measurement recorded:</p><p>

Buccal and lingual sulcular incisions were given and mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated. Care was exercised to preserve as much interproximal soft tissue as possible. Complete debridement of the defects as well as scaling and root planing were achieved. The defects were randomly assigned before surgery to the two treatment groups with randomized block approach. At the control site, the defect was filled with a composite bovine-derived xenograft Bio-Oss Collagen (Geistlich, Wolhusen Switzerland). The graft material was moistened in sterile saline for 5 minutes before placement into the defect. Following grafting, a bioresorbable collagen membrane of porcine origin (Bio-Gide) was cut according to the morphology of the defect using a template. The membrane was carried to the defect site and adapted over the entire defect so as to cover 2 to 3 mm of the surrounding alveolar bone and to ensure stability of the graft material. Neither sutures nor pins were used for membrane stabilization. Finally, the mucoperiosteal flaps were repositioned coronally and fixed with interrupted or horizontal mattress sutures [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Probing pocket depth for Bio-Oss Collagen with Bio- Gide Membrane</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-336-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Incision</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-336-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Defect depth</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-336-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Placement of graft material (Bio-Oss Collagen)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-336-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Placement of Bio- Gide Membrane</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-18-336-g005"/></fig><p>The same protocol was followed for the site B except that the membrane is not placed and instead the fibrin fibronectin sealing system (TISSEEL) was combined with Bio-Oss Collagen [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>]. The flaps were approximated with very little tension and periodontal dressings were placed (Coe &#x02013; pac). All the patients were prescribed systemic antibiotics &#x02013; amoxicillin 500 mg t.i.d for 5 days, along with an analgesic Piroxicam 20 mg b.i.d for 3 days.</p><p>Postoperative instructions were given to all the patients and they were instructed to report to the department 24 hours after the surgery and then after 10 days. On the 10<sup>th</sup> day following surgery, the periodontal dressing and the sutures were removed, and the surgical site was irrigated with normal saline. Symptoms regarding discomfort, pain, and sensitivity were enquired of the patient. Recall appointments for patients were made after 3, 6, and finally at 9 months. At each visit, oral hygiene instructions were reinforced and supragingival scaling was done if required. Patients were advised chlorhexidine mouth rinse twice daily for another 3 weeks. Measurements of the osseous defects were made utilizing the same grooves previously employed to record pocket depth and attachment levels. The distance between the most apical end of the stent and the point at which the groove adapted probe made contact with the bottom of the defect was the one recorded on the buccal and lingual sites.</p><p>Intraoral periapical radiographs were taken for each site before the surgical procedure and at intervals of 6 and 9 months using long cone paralleling technique [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>]. The IOPA radiographs were digitalized into 3648 &#x000d7; 2736 pixel images [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F14">14</xref>] using Sony digital camera (Japan) and were then analyzed using the Image J Software. All the scanned radiographs which were in pixels were converted to a gray scale of 8 bytes.

Hence, recording the changes in the alveolar crest height is important.</p><p>In the present study, a gain in the alveolar crest height of 0.86 &#x000b1; 0.68 mm (19.1%) at 6 months was observed which increased even more at 9 months postoperatively to 0.95 &#x000b1; 0.68 mm, which was statistically highly significant. Similar trend was observed in site B also. The gain in the alveolar crest height was 1.2 &#x000b1; 01.6 mm (31.9%) at 6 months and was further increased to 1.52 &#x000b1; 1.61 mm (39.59%) postoperatively. The findings were statistically highly significant.</p><p>The comparison between the two experimental groups showed that there was higher increase in the alveolar crest height in Experimental site B where a combination of Bio-Oss Collagen and TISSEEL was used. The difference was statistically significant.</p><p>In the present study, a favorable response was observed in all the clinical and radiological parameters recorded at different intervals for both Site A and Site B, and were statistically highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>The placement and suturing of the membrane was time consuming as compared to bone grafting along with fibrin fibronectin sealing system, even though the FFS system added to the cost of the treatment.</p><p>No postoperative complications other than those considered normal following any surgical procedure were noticed in either of the two groups. Also, no antigenic reactions were observed in any of the patients, thereby indicating the safety of Bio-Oss Collagen as a bone graft material, TISSEEL as a carrier material, and Bio-Gide as bioresorbable membrane.</p><p>Application of fibrin glue provides an artificial clot that is very stable after 3 minutes and persists longer than the neutral clot because of the presence of anti-fibrinolytic substances.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The prolonged fixation of the fibrin glue into the surgical wound is the property that allows its use as a sustained local delivery carrier. In addition, human fibrin glue is rich in fibronectin, which has been reported to favor new attachment formation by adhering to root surfaces and promoting fibroblasts and periodontal ligament cells migration.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Caffesse <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] used fibrin and fibronectin in combination with barrier membranes to treat periodontal defects in beagle dogs. The authors showed slightly better results in sites treated with the combinations of fibrin-fibronectin and GTR when compared with sites treated with GTR alone. Furthermore, no detrimental effects of the fibrin/fibronectin system on histologic new attachment formation were observed.</p><p>The results of the present study confirm that infrabony defects can be successfully treated with bone graft and fibrin glue. Clinically and statistically significant amounts of probing attachment and bone gains were observed at the 9-month follow up. The comparison between the test and the control sites, however, did not reach statistical significance. Nevertheless, slightly better clinical results were obtained in the sites treated with fibrin glue in combination with bone graft in terms of gain in alveolar crest height. This can be partly explained by the greater depth of the infrabony component of the defects in the site B.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] The lack of a significant difference may be due to the small number of subjects enrolled in the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The following conclusions were drawn from the present study:</p><p>Highly significant reduction in probing pocket depth took place in both the groups, which were almost identical. There was significant gain in the clinical attachment level in both the groups. Radiographically, a greater percentage of defect fill was noticed in both the groups.</p><p>There was a significant increase in the alveolar crest height in the group treated with Bio-Oss Collagen and TISSEEL combination. This might be because of the growth factors in the TISSEEL and the prolonged fixation of the fibrin glue into the surgical wound that allows its use as a sustained local delivery carrier. The regenerative materials (bovine-derived xenograft (Bio-Oss Collagen), Type I collagen membrane (Bio-Gide) and fibrin fibronectin sealing system (TISSEEL)) were safe to use. From the current study, it appears that both the treatment modalities were successful in showing the promising results in the treatment of periodontal infrabony defects.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>LIMITATIONS</title><p>
