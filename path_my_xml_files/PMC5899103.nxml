For some families, that is, not all families benefit equally. Individual trials tend to be underpowered and often lack variability to differentiate between families how benefit less or more. Integrating individual family level data across trials, we aimed to provide more conclusive results about often presumed key family (parental education and ethnic background) and child characteristics (problem severity, ADHD symptoms and emotional problems) as putative moderators of parenting intervention effects. We included data from 786 families (452 intervention; 334 control) from all four trials on the Incredible Years parenting intervention in The Netherlands (three randomized; one matched control). Children ranged between 2 and 10&#x000a0;years (<italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5.79; <italic>SD</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.66). Of the families, 31% had a lower educational level and 29% had an ethnic minority background. Using multilevel regression, we tested whether each of the putative moderators affected intervention effects. Incredible Years reduced children&#x02019;s conduct problems (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;.34). There were no differential effects by families&#x02019; educational or ethnic background, or by children&#x02019;s level of ADHD symptoms. Children with more severe conduct problems and those with more emotional problems benefited more. Post hoc sensitivity analyses showed that for the two trials with longer-term data, moderation effects disappeared at 4 or 12&#x000a0;months follow-up. Often assumed moderators have some, but limited abilities to explain who benefits from parenting interventions. This suggests the need for studying theoretically more precise moderators in prevention research, other than relatively static family characteristics alone.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Conduct problems</kwd><kwd>Parenting intervention</kwd><kwd>Diversity</kwd><kwd>Integrative data analysis</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001826</institution-id><institution>ZonMw</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>729101004</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Society for Prevention Research 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p id="Par2">Parenting interventions can effectively prevent and reduce conduct problems in children (Weisz and Kazdin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2010</xref>). Yet, about a quarter to a third of the families fails to show improvement from established parenting interventions (Scott et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2001</xref>; Shelleby and Shaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>). Our ability to predict who will benefit more from prevention efforts, and who will benefit less, are limited (Ng and Weisz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2016</xref>). Most individual trials have insufficient statistical power and variance to predict who benefits (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>). Yet, identifying the families who benefit is critical for understanding why conduct problems can be changed successfully by providing parenting support in some families and not in other families (Rutter and Pickles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2016</xref>). This understanding in turn is vital for strengthening prevention strategies to reduce children&#x02019;s conduct problems.</p><p id="Par3">In this study, we aimed to shed light on the extent to which widely studied moderators explain for whom parenting interventions reduce conduct problems, by synthesizing individual family level data across four trials to increase statistical power and variance. Many different putative moderators have been suggested (Shelleby and Shaw <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2014</xref>). We included family and child characteristics as moderators that (1) are key predictors of conduct disorder, to examine whether particularly children who are most at risk benefit less or more from prevention efforts, and (2) suffer from inconsistent findings in individual trials and meta-analyses about their impact on intervention effectiveness.</p><sec id="Sec1"><title>Parental Educational Level and Ethnic Background</title><p id="Par4">Low parental educational level impacts child development in part through the chronic stressors that often accompany the lower socioeconomic status of parents with lower educational levels, such as deprived neighborhoods and parental mental health problems (e.g., Conger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1992</xref>). Similar stressors are suggested to explain why lower educated families may benefit less from parenting interventions. Empirical findings, however, vary between showing that socioeconomically disadvantaged family benefit less (e.g., Leijten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>), equally (Gardner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>), or more (e.g., Gardner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>; MacKenzie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>). Perhaps even more surprising are the equally inconsistent findings from meta-analyses (e.g., Dekovi&#x00107; et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Leijten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>; Lundahl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2006</xref>). In sum, parental educational level as part of family socioeconomic status is studied exhaustively, but its role in parenting intervention effectiveness remains unclear.</p><p id="Par5">Children from ethnic minority families with a relatively recent immigration history in Western Europe are at higher risk for the development of conduct disorder (e.g., Sagatun et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2008</xref>). Besides, culture and language differences may impact to what extent families benefit from interventions. One previous study integrated data from two parenting intervention trials (Reid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2001</xref>) and found no meaningful differences in intervention benefits across ethnic groups in the USA. Individual trials in Europe (e.g., Bj&#x000f8;rknes and Manger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2013</xref>) and a meta-analysis (Menting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>) reached similar conclusions. Despite these findings, concerns remain that ethnic minority populations, particularly those with relatively recent migration histories, may benefit less from parenting interventions that are developed in dominant cultural groups in North America and Western Europe (e.g., Miranda et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Conduct Problem Severity and Associated Problems</title><p id="Par6">Conduct problems in early childhood is the strongest predictor of conduct disorders in later life (Moffitt and Caspi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2001</xref>). Most individual trials and meta-analyses suggest that children with more severe conduct problems benefit more from parenting interventions (e.g., Leijten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>; Menting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). Mechanisms underlying this effect may be a larger scope for improvement and increased parental motivation to change. In some trials, however, children with more severe conduct problems benefited less (e.g., Kazdin and Wassell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2000</xref>). Inconsistencies might be explained by limited variance in problem severity within individual trials; trials tend to focus on either prevention or treatment of conduct disorder and rarely include children with a wide range of conduct problems.</p><p id="Par7">A profound concern for prevention is that mental health problems often co-occur. ADHD symptoms and emotional problems are relatively common in children with conduct problems and are related to worse prognosis (Hinshaw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1993</xref>; Rutter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). The what extent children&#x02019;s associated problems affect intervention outcomes is largely unknown. Systematic reviews (e.g., Ollendick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>; Riosa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2011</xref>) show that very few trials include co-occurrence of mental health problems as a moderator of intervention effects. Some trials include co-occurring mental health problems as a predictor of intervention effects, but predictor analyses fail to correct for change in the control condition and can lead to misleading results (e.g., see Halldorsdottir and Ollendick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2016</xref>, for a comparison of predictor and moderator analysis). Findings from the few available tests of co-occurring mental health problems as moderators of intervention effectiveness are mixed. Some suggest that ADHD symptoms do not influence effectiveness (e.g., Bj&#x000f8;rnebekk et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2015</xref>), or that children with more associated emotional problems benefit more (Jarrett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Why Integrate Data from Multiple Trials?</title><p id="Par8">Individual trials on the effectiveness of parenting interventions tend to be powered to test main effects of the intervention, rather than moderation effects. Moreover, they are conducted in a certain time period and geographical region, and families are enrolled through a specific set of recruitment methods (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>). This lack of statistical power and limited variance might explain why moderator findings are so inconsistent across trials. Meta-analyses are usually even more severely underpowered than individual trials to test moderation effects. Meta-analyses assess moderators at a trial level (e.g., the mean educational level of a sample) rather than at an individual level (e.g., the educational level of a parent). This means that the sample size of a meta-analysis equals the number of included trials, often a few dozen, and that all within trial variance is ignored (Lipsey <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">An alternative to traditional meta-analysis is integrative data analysis, or individual participant data meta-analysis (Curran and Hussong <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>). This approach synthesizes individual family level data from multiple trials and therefore uses variance between and within trials, gaining valuable power and generalizability. This highly recommended approach is rarely used in the social sciences because it requires authors to share their raw data, and because synthesizing data across trials can be difficult if different measures are used.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The Present Study</title><p id="Par10">We synthesized data from all trials on the effectiveness of the Incredible Years parenting program in The Netherlands.

Methods to teach parents these techniques include videotaped examples of parent-child interactions, brainstorms, and discussions about the pros and cons of different parenting techniques, and role-plays. Parents were given a book (Webster-Stratton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2006</xref>) and were encouraged to practice at home and to have weekly telephone contact with another parent from the group. At least one of the two group leaders of each group was a certified Incredible Years group leader.

We used the extensive variability in family and child characteristics of 786 families from all trials on the Incredible Years parenting intervention in The Netherlands to test five of the most often hypothesized family and child characteristics as putative moderators of parenting intervention effects.</p><p id="Par34">The overall effect size of Incredible Years on children&#x02019;s conduct problems was <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;0.34, similar to the effect size from a recent meta-analysis on Incredible Years (e.g., Menting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). Families from a wide range of educational and ethnic backgrounds benefited equally. Levels of social and economic inequality in the Netherlands are generally low, which may have influenced our findings. That said, two of the four trials included families that face serious problems in terms of housing, employment, education, integration, and safety.</p><p id="Par35">Children&#x02019;s ADHD symptoms also did not moderate intervention effects. Children with co-occurring conduct problems and ADHD symptoms have worse prognoses than children with only conduct problems (Hinshaw et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1993</xref>; Rutter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2006</xref>). Our finding that co-occurring ADHD symptoms did not diminish the effects of Incredible Years on children&#x02019;s conduct problems is therefore potentially promising for prevention strategies. Two child characteristics did impact treatment success: children with more severe conduct problems and children with more emotional problems benefited more.</p><p id="Par36">Children&#x02019;s initial problem severity is the only moderator relatively consistently replicated across individual trials and meta-analyses in parenting intervention research (e.g., Leijten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>; Menting et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). Children with more severe problems have a larger scope for improvement and their parents may be more motivated to change. Children&#x02019;s emotional problems as a moderator is less often studied. Our findings do not support the concern that children with co-occurring problems benefit less from interventions. In contrast, and similar to some other studies (e.g., Jarrett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>), our findings suggest that parenting interventions buffer the development of conduct problems particularly in children who suffer from co-occurring emotional problems.</p><p id="Par37">If the main reason for not detecting moderator effects in smaller, individual trials is lack of statistical power, then why do we still find only two significant moderators, out of five often assumed moderators, in our well-powered combined sample of 786 families? To be sure, although several individual trials and meta-analyses find significant moderator effects, many more individual trials and meta-analyses do not find significant moderator effects (e.g., Ollendick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>; Reid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2001</xref>; Weeland et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017</xref>). Moreover, selective outcome reporting bias and publication bias may exist in that trials may have tested moderator effects, but did not report or publish their null findings (Dwan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). Our well-powered analysis of a diverse sample, derived from multiple trials, suggests that of the relevant child and family characteristics tested, only severity of children&#x02019;s behavior problems and children&#x02019;s emotional problems moderate intervention success.</p><p id="Par38">Because longer-term data were available for two out of four trials only, our sensitivity analyses on moderators of longer-term effects were less well-powered. Moreover, the two trials with available follow-up data differ meaningfully from the trials without available follow-up data: trials with available follow-up data mainly included white families with higher educational backgrounds, while the other two trials included an ethnically diverse sample of mothers released from incarceration (Trial #2), and an ethnically diverse sample with many socioeconomically disadvantaged families (Trial #3). We therefore interpret the findings of these post hoc sensitivity analyses with caution. That said, these sensitivity analyses confirm our main finding that often assumed moderators of parenting intervention effects are of limited help in explaining who benefits from parenting interventions for reducing disruptive child behavior. In addition, they suggest that while children&#x02019;s baseline level of problem severity and emotional problems may help explain differential immediate treatment effects, they may not explain differential longer-term effects, or at least that their ability to do so may depend on the type of trials and families included.</p><p id="Par39">The extent to which child and family characteristics such as educational level and ethnic minority background impact intervention effectiveness might in part depend on the specific intervention evaluated. Incredible Years is largely similar in content to other parenting interventions for children&#x02019;s conduct problems (Kaehler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2016</xref>). Different from most other interventions, however, Incredible Years uses a collaborative approach that might enhance cultural sensitivity. Group discussions, for examples, are used to encourage parents to come up with their own solutions and to use parenting techniques (e.g., play and praise) in a way that matches their personal values and norms (Webster-Stratton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2009</xref>). This inbuilt flexibility of the intervention may contribute to its ability to support families with different educational and ethnic backgrounds.</p><p id="Par40">Yet, our study does confirm that intervention effects vary widely across families. If many of the often hypothesized moderators fail to explain this variation, then what makes some families benefit more than others? Perhaps moderators other than relatively &#x0201c;static&#x0201d; and seemingly general family characteristics (e.g., demographics) play a role. Theoretically more precise moderation research is needed to better illuminate differential intervention response trajectories. We highlight three possible directions for future research: first, parents&#x02019; individual interactions with the therapist might help explain how families&#x02019; intervention response trajectories develop (e.g., Kivlighan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2014</xref>). Despite relatively strict Incredible Years therapist training and supervision procedures, families may experience different levels of alliance, trust, and/or support with therapists and other parents in the group. Thus, moderators may operate at the bidirectional therapist-client dyad level, rather than on the therapist or client level.</p><p id="Par41">Second, families may respond differentially to different parenting techniques taught in an intervention, depending on, for example, the fit between specific techniques and parents&#x02019; values about these techniques and their previous experiences with these techniques. For example, parents may differ in how they feel about disciplining techniques such as time-out, and positive reinforcement techniques such as praise. Parenting interventions teach parents dozens of techniques (e.g., Leijten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2015</xref>). Our abilities to understand families&#x02019; responses to parenting interventions might improve if we gain more insight into how families respond to the different parenting techniques taught in parenting interventions. This implies a shift in our research question from &#x0201c;who benefits?&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;who benefits from what?&#x0201d;</p><p id="Par42">Third, family characteristics interact in predicting parenting intervention effects (e.g., Leijten et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). The traditional variable-centered approach to identify individual family characteristics that moderate intervention effects masks these interactions. Person-centered approaches that allow family characteristics to cluster in predicting response trajectories can help identify the families that benefit less or more from interventions (e.g., Pelham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2017</xref>). Alternatively, recent trends to pool data across studies may allow for the statistical power needed to examine how family characteristics interact in predicting intervention effects.</p><p id="Par43">Several limitations of our study merit attention. First, our analyses relied on parent-reported outcomes of child behavior. Parent reports can be biased because parents are not blind to experimental condition (Sonuga-Barke et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2013</xref>). As in any integrative data analysis study, our ability to include instruments depended upon inclusion of instruments in the individual trials. Teacher reported conduct problems and observed noncompliance were available only in a subset of trials and could therefore not be used as outcome measures in our integrative analysis. Please note that the primary aim of this study was to compare whether intervention effects varied for different subgroups of families, rather than to estimate the absolute magnitude of intervention effects for which this bias may have been of particular concern. Second, we included some of the most well-studied moderators but excluded several other potentially relevant child and family characteristics such as children&#x02019;s executive functioning (e.g., Matthys et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2012</xref>) and biological markers of children&#x02019;s differential susceptibility to environmental influences (e.g., Belsky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2007</xref>). To our knowledge, however, none of these other putative moderators have (yet) shown a systematic, replicated pattern of differentiating between families who benefit more and families who benefit less. Third, three trials used the SDQ and one trial used the CBCL to assess children&#x02019;s ADHD and emotional problems. We used established norms for both instruments to convert CBCL scores into SDQ scores, and subscales that are known to correlate well (Goodman and Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1999</xref>), but our approach does rely on the assumption that both instruments indeed measure the same construct.</p><p id="Par44">We are among the first to integrate data across trials to allow for stringent moderation analysis of parenting intervention effects. Our findings suggest that at least in The Netherlands, the Incredible Years parenting intervention is not less or more effective for families with lower educational or ethnic minority backgrounds, or for children with ADHD symptoms. These rather different groups of families seem to benefit equally from the same intervention and these characteristics are unable to help differentiate between families who benefit more and families who benefit less. Our study does suggest that larger immediate intervention effects can be expected for children who show higher levels of conduct problems at the start of the intervention, and for children with more emotional problems.
