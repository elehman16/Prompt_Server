The original trial found that the intervention reduced the number of smokers at 6-month follow-up compared with the control condition, but had non-significant effects on the other targeted health behaviours. However, the original trial suffered from low levels of engagement, which the repeat trial sought to rectify.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three weeks before staring university, all incoming undergraduate students at a large university in the UK were sent an email inviting them to participate in the study. After completing a baseline questionnaire, participants were randomly allocated to intervention or control conditions. The intervention consisted of a self-affirmation manipulation, health messages based on the theory of planned behaviour and implementation intention tasks. Participants were followed-up 1 and 6&#x000a0;months after starting university. The primary outcome measures were portions of fruit and vegetables consumed, physical activity levels, units of alcohol consumed and smoking status at 6-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The study recruited 2,621 students (intervention <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1346, control <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1275), of whom 1495 completed at least one follow-up (intervention <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;696, control <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;799). Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that the intervention had a non-significant effect on the primary outcomes, although the effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake was significant in the per-protocol analyses. Secondary analyses revealed that the intervention had significant effects on having smoked at university (self-report) and on a biochemical marker of alcohol use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Despite successfully increasing levels of engagement, the intervention did not have a significant effect on the primary outcome measures. The relatively weak effects of the intervention, found in both the original and repeat trials, may be due to the focus on multiple versus single health behaviours. Future interventions targeting the health behaviour of new university students should therefore focus on single health behaviours.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN07407344">ISRCTN07407344</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Binge drinking</kwd><kwd>Diet</kwd><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Implementation intentions</kwd><kwd>Internet</kwd><kwd>Self-affirmation</kwd><kwd>Smoking</kwd><kwd>Students</kwd><kwd>Theory of planned behaviour</kwd><kwd>Young people</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>The performance of health-promoting behaviours (e.g., eating fruit and vegetables, engaging in regular exercise), coupled with the avoidance of health-risk behaviours (e.g., excessive alcohol consumption, smoking), is important in reducing the risk of developing serious health problems, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A recent survey in England indicated that among 16&#x02013;24 year olds, only 17&#x000a0;% of men and 19&#x000a0;% of women ate at least five portions of fruit and vegetables per day, 83&#x000a0;% of men but only 57&#x000a0;% of women met recommended levels of weekly physical activity, 27&#x000a0;% of men and 19&#x000a0;% of women consumed more than double the recommended daily limit of alcohol in the previous week and 27&#x000a0;% of men and 19&#x000a0;% of women were current smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Given that there is evidence of clustering of health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], it is likely that many young people engage in a number of health-compromising behaviours, thereby placing themselves at increased risk of developing serious health problems. There is therefore a clear need for interventions that target multiple health behaviours in young people. Encouragingly, there is some evidence that such interventions can have positive effects on health behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>An earlier trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] tested the efficacy of a theory-based online intervention (U@Uni) targeting four health behaviours (fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking) during the transition from school to university. Such life transitions are ideal opportunities to intervene as they represent &#x02018;teachable&#x02019; moments; times when people&#x02019;s social environments and supporting cues for behaviour are in a state of flux and people are therefore more amenable to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, given that more than 500,000 students and over 30&#x000a0;% of 18&#x000a0;year olds in England enter higher education each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], interventions delivered during this transition have the potential to reach a large number of young people. The intervention used three theory-based techniques to target the four health behaviours. First, a self-affirmation manipulation was used to reduce defensive processing of health messages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Second, theory-based messages were developed through formative research to target the key beliefs underlying the four health behaviours, in order to increase young people&#x02019;s motivation to engage in healthy behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Third, implementation intention tasks were included to help translate good intentions into healthy behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>The intervention had a significant effect on smoking, with fewer current smokers at follow-up in the intervention than in the control condition, although the intervention did not significantly affect the other three primary outcomes (i.e., fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Despite these largely non-significant effects, the health economic modelling revealed that rolling out the intervention to other universities would be likely to be cost-effective, primarily because of the low cost of the intervention and the impact of reduced smoking on future health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, the trial was compromised by a number of limitations, which resulted in low levels of engagement with the intervention. Only 52&#x000a0;% of participants allocated to the intervention condition completed the self-affirmation task, only 35&#x000a0;% accessed the health messages and only 1&#x000a0;% formed an implementation intention. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether the non-significant results are due to failure of theory or failure of intervention fidelity caused by low engagement. In addition, low engagement is also likely to lead to an inaccurate estimate of the effect of the intervention on the health behaviours, which an expected value of information analysis identified as an important driver of decision uncertainty in the health economic modelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>There were three potential reasons for low engagement. First, the baseline questionnaire was time-consuming to complete (approximately 20&#x000a0;minutes) due to the large number of items needed to assess the primary and secondary outcome variables. Having completed the questionnaire, many participants may have been fatigued and less inclined to proceed to, and engage with, the intervention. Second, the bespoke software platform that was developed to deliver the intervention had a number of technical glitches, meaning that participants&#x02019; experience of completing the baseline questionnaire and engaging with the intervention was suboptimal. In particular, what was intended as a seamless process was experienced as a series of discrete steps with subsequent drop-outs at each step. For example, after completing the baseline questionnaire, participants in the intervention condition were directed to the U@Uni log-in page where they had to enter some registration details before completing the self-affirmation manipulation. After completing the self-affirmation manipulation, participants had to log in again to access the intervention material, and many failed to do so. Third, participants in the intervention condition had complete control over the amount and type of intervention material that they viewed. For example, participants in the intervention condition could choose which health behaviours and which belief-based messages to view and whether or not to make plans. This is also likely to have reduced engagement, as participants could simply choose not to view any messages or make any plans.</p><p>With these limitations in mind, a repeat trial was conducted with a number of changes designed to increase engagement with the intervention and provide a more accurate estimate of the efficacy of the intervention. First, the baseline questionnaire was shortened. In particular, shorter and simpler measures of fruit and vegetable intake and alcohol consumption were included, and some secondary outcome measures (e.g., self-efficacy, perceived control) were removed. Second, the intervention was delivered using the LifeGuide open-source software platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. LifeGuide has been specifically designed for researchers to develop, deliver and evaluate online health behaviour interventions. It allows participants to complete baseline measures, be randomly allocated to conditions and access intervention material, all within the same website. As a result, participants experience the various tasks as seamless, with reduced opportunity to exit between tasks. Third, the key content of the intervention was delivered in a more structured format so that participants could quickly access health messages and make plans for all four health behaviours. In particular, participants in the intervention condition worked through four short modules that required them to read at least one belief-based message and make at least one plan for each health behaviour, before gaining access to the full intervention website.</p><p>This paper reports the results of the repeat randomized controlled trial of a theory-based online health behaviour intervention delivered during the transition from school to university. The primary research question was whether the intervention produces significant changes in the health behaviours of new students (i.e., fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption and smoking status) at a 6-month follow-up. Additional research questions focused on whether the intervention (i) changes theory of planned behaviour variables (and whether these changes mediate the effect of the intervention on the health behaviours), (ii) enhances health status, (iii) reduces health service usage, (iv) reduces recreational drug use and (v) reduces body mass index (BMI).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants and procedure</title><p>Three weeks before starting university (in September 2013), all incoming undergraduate students to the University of Sheffield (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5,453) were sent an email inviting them to take part in the study, with a link to an online questionnaire containing measures of demographics, health status, intentions, and health behaviour.

After completing all four modules, intervention participants in the intervention condition had access to the full website with further health messages and links on each of the four targeted health behaviours.</p><p>All participants were sent emails inviting them to complete follow-up questionnaires 1&#x000a0;month (October 2013) and 6&#x000a0;months (March 2014) after starting university. Participants were entered into a &#x000a3;100 prize draw as an incentive for completing each questionnaire. In addition, participants completing all three questionnaires received a &#x000a3;10 gift voucher and were entered into a further prize draw for an iPad Mini.</p><p>Participants were also sent emails when they started university, inviting them to provide additional data on the biochemical markers of health behaviour.

Participants were asked to provide details including their name, course, home town and main interests or hobbies, before being presented with a list of eight commonly held personal values (sense of humour, academic achievement, relations with family and friends, social skills, spontaneity, artistic skills or aesthetic appreciation, religion, faith or spirituality, and respect, decency or manners). Participants were asked to select their most important value (or provide their own) and to explain briefly why the value was important to them. The resultant information formed part of the user&#x02019;s &#x02018;profile&#x02019;, which was displayed in the banner at the top of all pages of the intervention website that included the participant&#x02019;s name, the value that they chose and the reason why it was important to them (&#x02018;I value X because Y.&#x02019;).</p><p>After completing the self-affirmation manipulation, participants were directed to complete short modules on each of the four targeted health behaviours. Theory-based messages were developed to encourage adequate fruit and vegetable intake and regular exercise, and to discourage binge drinking and smoking. The messages were based on the theory of planned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and developed on the basis of formative work that identified the key behavioural, normative and control beliefs associated with intentions to perform each of the four health behaviours in new university students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Module 1 focused on exercising regularly at university. Participants were presented with a list of topics that targeted key beliefs from the formative research and instructed to choose one (e.g., &#x02018;Exercise improves your fitness&#x02019;). They were then directed to a webpage containing theory-based messages (i.e., text), videos of students talking about the targeted belief, and links to other related material. After viewing the page, participants had the opportunity to either view another topic or message or proceed to the planner.</p><p>The planner helped participants to form implementation intentions by asking them to identify (i) a good opportunity to act on their intentions (e.g., when they have spare time between lectures) and (ii) a suitable response to their identified opportunity (e.g., to go swimming in the university pool) for each of the four targeted health behaviours. Participants were presented with an example of an implementation intention in an if-then format [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] (e.g., &#x02018;IF I am tempted to skip exercising, THEN I will tell myself &#x02018;no excuses&#x02019; and remind myself that I will feel great after exercising&#x02019;). Spaces were provided for participants to make up to three if-then plans by linking an identified opportunity and appropriate response. Participants were presented with their plan and asked to repeat it to themselves several times. A record of the plan was also automatically emailed to the participant.</p><p>When participants had finished Module 1, they were presented with the first page of Module 2 (&#x02018;Eating fruit and vegetables&#x02019;), and instructed to work through the module in the same way as for Module 1. Participants then completed Modules 3 (&#x02018;Avoiding binge drinking&#x02019;) and 4 (&#x02018;Avoiding smoking&#x02019;). When all four modules had been completed, participants had access to the full website, containing messages targeting all of the key beliefs from the formative research, links to the planner, saved plans and general health information.

Participants were asked to report the amount of (i) fruit and (ii) vegetables consumed in a typical day (at baseline) and since starting university (at 1 and 6-month follow-up). Reponses to the items were summed to give an estimated total of daily fruit and vegetable consumption.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Physical activity</title><p>The Short Form of International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].

The position of the sensitive item (i.e., &#x02018;I have used recreational drugs in the last 3&#x000a0;months/since starting university&#x02019;) was randomized. The single sample count method can be used to provide an estimate of the prevalence of recreational drug use in the sample without being able to identify whether individual participants do or do not use recreational drugs, on the basis that 50&#x000a0;% of the sample should answer &#x02018;yes&#x02019; answers to each of the four non-sensitive questions. This method has been shown to encourage accurate reporting of behaviours that are illegal and could be regarded as socially undesirable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Body mass index</title><p>All participants recorded their height and weight, from which their BMI was calculated.

Analyses assessing intervention effects on the primary outcome variables (i.e., the four targeted health behaviours at 6-month follow-up) were conducted using an intention-to-treat approach (i.e., data were included from all participants who completed at least one follow-up survey).

A series of analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) and logistic regression analyses were used to assess the impact of the intervention on performance of the targeted behaviours at 6-month follow-up, controlling for corresponding baseline scores, sex, age and nationality (i.e., UK or non-UK). For primary outcomes, the Bonferroni correction was used to account for multiple tests. Thus, statistical significance was declared if any of the primary endpoints were significant at 0.0127. The primary analyses were repeated without imputing data, as recommended by Altman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].

No adjustments were made for multiple tests, and intention-to-treat analyses were not performed for the secondary outcomes.

In addition, the intervention had a significant effect on the biochemical marker of alcohol use (fatty acid ethyl esters) at 6-month follow-up, with lower levels of alcohol use observed among participants in the intervention versus control condition. The intervention also had significant effects on three social cognitive variables. Participants in the intervention condition had a more negative cognitive attitude towards binge drinking than participants in the control condition at 1-month follow-up. However, contrary to expectations, participants in the intervention condition had lower self-efficacy scores for fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity than participants in the control condition at 6-month follow-up. The effect of the intervention on all other secondary outcomes (e.g., recreational drug use, health status, BMI, health service usage) was non-significant.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Estimated marginal means, percentages, sample sizes, standard deviations and p values for secondary outcomes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th colspan="6">1-month follow-up</th><th/><th/><th colspan="6">6-month follow-up</th><th/><th/></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Variable</td><td colspan="3">Control</td><td colspan="3">Intervention</td><td/><td/><td colspan="3">Control</td><td colspan="3">Intervention</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td/><td>% or mean</td><td>SD</td><td>

id="Sec27" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper reports the results of a repeat randomized controlled trial of a theory-based online health behaviour intervention delivered during the transition from school to university. The original trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] was compromised by a number of study limitations that resulted in low levels of engagement with the intervention. As a result, a number of changes were instigated in the repeat trial to increase engagement, including a shorter baseline questionnaire (to reduce participant fatigue), the use of the LifeGuide open-source software platform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to deliver the intervention (to improve the experience of engaging with the intervention), and a streamlined modular structure (so that participants could access the intervention material more quickly). These changes were successful in increasing engagement with the intervention. Thus, 85&#x000a0;% of participants in the intervention condition completed the self-affirmation manipulation compared with 52&#x000a0;% in the original trial, 72&#x000a0;% accessed at least one health message (and 47&#x000a0;% accessed health messages for all four health behaviours) compared with the 35&#x000a0;% who accessed the health messages in the original trial, and 41&#x000a0;% formed at least one implementation intention (and 29&#x000a0;% formed implementation intentions for all four health behaviours) compared with 1&#x000a0;% in the original trial.</p><p>Despite increased engagement, the primary analyses indicated that the effect of the intervention on the targeted health behaviours at 6-month follow-up was non-significant, although the effect on fruit and vegetable intake approached significance. Moreover, a per-protocol analysis revealed that participants who engaged with the intervention reported consuming significantly more portions of fruit and vegetables at 6-month follow-up than participants in the control condition. The original intervention was found to have a significant effect on smoking status at 6-month follow-up, which was primarily due to preventing non-smokers from starting smoking at university. This effect was not replicated in the repeat trial, although the direction of the effect was consistent. In addition, secondary analyses indicated that significantly fewer participants in the intervention condition reported that they had smoked at university (including a puff or socially) than those in the control condition. The intervention was also found to have a significant impact on the biochemical marker of alcohol use at 6-month follow-up, with lower levels of alcohol observed among participants in the intervention than in the control condition. This effect was in the same direction as the non-significant effect of the intervention on alcohol consumption in the primary analyses. Notably, participants who provided a hair sample did not differ from the rest of the baseline sample in their health behaviour.</p><p>The effect sizes for the intervention on the primary outcomes in the repeat trial were comparable to those found in the original trial, although two differences approached significance. The effect size for intervention on fruit and vegetable intake was marginally larger in the repeat trial, whereas the effect size for smoking status was marginally larger in the original trial. Overall, the effect sizes found in both trials were very small [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and, with the exception of smoking status in the original trial, smaller than those typically found in online health behaviour change interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>There are several potential reasons for the relatively weak effects obtained in the repeat trial (which also relate to the original trial). First, the intervention sought to target four health behaviours in a single intervention. Webb <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] reported that online interventions that target several health behaviours typically have smaller effects (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.12) than those that target a single health behaviour (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.17). A focus on several health behaviours may dilute the effect of the intervention on individual behaviours if participants choose only to change a single health behaviour. For example, an intervention targeting multiple health behaviours might help some participants to increase their fruit and vegetable intake and others to increase their levels of physical activity. Second, although levels of engagement with the intervention were increased in the repeat trial, they were still relatively low. Again, this may have been due to the focus on several health behaviours. For example, while 72&#x000a0;% of participants in the intervention condition accessed at least one health message, only 47&#x000a0;% accessed health messages for all four health behaviours. Similarly, while 41&#x000a0;% formed at least one implementation intention, only 29&#x000a0;% formed implementation intentions for all four health behaviours. Furthermore, there was some evidence that engagement moderated intervention effectiveness, with the per-protocol analyses revealing a significant effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake (although other effects remained non-significant). Third, the baseline sample recruited into the study reported engaging in the recommended health behaviours at a similar or greater extent than 16&#x02013;24-year-olds in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is therefore possible that the lack of positive effects for the intervention could be due to a &#x02018;ceiling effect&#x02019; at baseline. However, analysis of participants in the control condition revealed that consumption of fruit and vegetables decreased, and alcohol consumption and the number of current smokers increased, after starting university, which would negate this explanation for the null findings.<sup>1</sup></p><p>A number of limitations should be noted. First, in line with the original trial and the study protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], the effect of the intervention on the primary outcomes was assessed using an intention-to-treat approach in which missing data at 6-months were imputed from the 1-month follow-up data by carrying the last observation forward. The use of this procedure has been criticized as it may introduce bias in the results (in either direction) and lead to overly narrow confidence intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In particular, it assumes that students&#x02019; health behaviour would have remained stable from 1- to 6-month follow-up. Analysis of the control condition revealed changes in three of the four health behaviours between these two time points. However, as recommended by Altman [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], repeating the primary analyses without data imputation produced consistent results.</p><p>Second, the primary outcomes were assessed by self-report. To try to address this issue, we also sought to identify biochemical markers of alcohol and smoking behaviour by analyzing samples of hair provided by participants. Only 213 (8&#x000a0;%) of participants recruited into the trial participated in this aspect of the study. While highly selective, these participants were not found to differ from the rest of the sample on baseline measures of health behaviour. It should also be noted that there were no biochemical markers of fruit and vegetable intake, which precludes verification of the significant effect of the intervention effect found in the per-protocol analyses. Moreover, the fact that per-protocol analyses only included participants in the intervention condition who completed all intervention tasks (i.e., those who completed the self-affirmation profile, viewed a health message and formed an implementation intention) is likely to have introduced bias. As a result, the significant effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake found in the per-protocol analyses should be treated with caution.</p><p>Third, although the response to the initial invitation emails was higher (48.1&#x000a0;% vs. 31.3&#x000a0;%) in the repeat trial (primarily due to the invitation emails being sent out a week earlier and the use of a shorter baseline questionnaire), recruitment into the study was still relatively low. This was despite the use of a number of techniques that have been shown to increase response rates to online surveys, including the use of incentives and reminders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In addition, participation in the repeat trial was higher among women, non-UK students and younger students, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.</p><p>Fourth, attrition was higher in the repeat trial, with only 55.8&#x000a0;% of participants providing follow-up data (vs. 76.6&#x000a0;% in the original trial), and was higher in the intervention arm than the control arm, which may have been a consequence of the longer time that participants spent engaging with the intervention in the repeat trial. Participants who dropped out were found to have a lower BMI and stronger intentions to eat fruit and vegetables at baseline than participants who provided follow-up data. Participants who dropped out were also less likely to be British, white or female.</p><p>Fifth, the intervention used three theory-based techniques (i.e., self-affirmation, theory-based messages and implementation intentions), which were combined in a single intervention. Such a design precludes the identification of the active, or redundant, ingredients of an intervention. Future work could employ full factorial designs to assess the impact of different combinations of these techniques on health behaviour. There is some evidence that combining self-affirmation manipulations and implementation intentions has a beneficial effect on fruit and vegetable intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], although other research suggests that this combination may have a detrimental effect on physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A repeat trial of an online theory-based health behaviour intervention for new university students found no significant effects on the primary outcome measures at 6-month follow-up, although three positive effects were observed in ancillary analyses. First, a per-protocol analysis showed a significant effect of the intervention on fruit and vegetable intake. Second, secondary analyses revealed that significantly fewer participants in the intervention condition had smoked while at university than in the control condition. Third, analysis of hair samples demonstrated significantly lower use of alcohol among participants in the intervention condition than in control condition. Nonetheless, the overall effect of the intervention on the targeted health behaviours was relatively weak. This may have been due, in part, to the focus of the intervention on multiple, rather than, single health behaviours. Future interventions targeting the health behaviour of new university students might focus on smoking behaviour, given the positive intervention effects in the original and repeat trials and the important impact that smoking has on health outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Endnote</title><p><sup>1</sup> Analysis of participants in the control condition revealed significant effects of time on portions of fruit and vegetables consumed, <italic>F</italic> (2,932)&#x02009;=&#x02009;30.17, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, units of alcohol consumed, <italic>F</italic> (2,910)&#x02009;=&#x02009;48.83, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, and number of current smokers, Cochran&#x02019;s <italic>Q</italic> (2)&#x02009;=&#x02009;27.94, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001.
