Based on this association, the current treatment of gingivitis is focused on biofilm disruption, which will normally include mechanical processes, both professionally and at home. However, for patients, it is not easy to achieve a proper level of plaque control. The efficient plaque control techniques are very time consuming and require a special motivation and skills for their optimum use [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It was at this point where mouthwashes become important, due to the fact that they include diverse types of antimicrobial agents to complement the results of mechanical oral hygiene measures [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Chlorhexidine (CHX) is considered the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of oral antiseptics; nevertheless it has not been recommended for long periods of time due to its well-known secondary effects [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. All of these inconveniences have limited its acceptability among dental professionals and users; in contrast, however, are the exceptional antiseptic properties, promoting the interest of researchers in other alternative antiplaque agents [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Mouthwashes containing essential oils (EO) in their formulation have received a lot of attention. Their antiplaque activity has been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies, in which they were used in conjunction with mechanical oral hygiene measures [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Taking into account the fact that bacteria present in a biofilm can be from 10&#x02013;1000 times more tolerant to antimicrobial agents than those in planktonic phase [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], a more predictive evaluation of the efficacy of an antiseptic agent present in a mouthwash could be done using biofilm models. Numerous studies have been carried out regarding the activity of EO and CHX on the oral biofilm both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in situ</italic>. The latter are more valuable when establishing the antiseptic efficacy of mouthwashes, due to the fact that their activity is tested under <italic>in vivo</italic> clinical conditions [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In order to achieve a better understanding of the clinical effects that these agents produce in the interior of the biofilm, it is necessary to apply a methodology in which the biofilm grows directly in the interior of the oral cavity but its three-dimensional structure is not distorted by manipulation [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Most <italic>in situ</italic> studies on &#x0201c;non-destructured&#x0201d; dental plaque do not use natural teeth; instead, they use disks made of different materials that are introduced in the mouth for a variable period of time, during which they are exposed to the intraoral conditions of an individual. Therefore, it is not dental plaque itself, but a biofilm which is presumably very similar to dental plaque, which is generated in similar conditions and is set on a substrate which is generally artificial. Hereinafter, it will be denominated plaque-like biofilm (PL-Biofilm) [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The study of the antiplaque effect of an antimicrobial agent can be performed in long and short term clinical studies. Among the latter, 4-day models have particular importance. This model can be described as an established method for assessing the inhibitory activity against dental plaque that mouthwashes have, <italic>per se</italic>, and determines the relative effectiveness of the different formulations [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thereby, they have been widely used by different research groups to study various antiplaque agents that are commonly used in the oral cavity [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), despite having poorer resolution than transmission electron microscopy (TEM) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], has eliminated or considerably reduced the distortion produced by preparation of the samples. The main advantage of CLSM is that it permits the analysis of biofilm <italic>in situ</italic>, without altering its delicate structure, keeping it hydrated with no need for fixation or drying [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. CLSM also facilitates the observation of biofilms <italic>in situ</italic> and in &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; time, with all of the benefits of most sophisticated image analysis [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Systems based on the identification of bacterial vitality by fluorescence have become increasingly important, since they are accepted as a simple, accurate, reproducible and highly sensitive method for the quantitation of attached microorganisms [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Consequently, numerous authors have examined biofilms with the help of CLSM and fluorescence staining, incorporating both to analyse their structure [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], such as the spatial distribution of the vital and non-vital bacteria [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Various combinations of dyes have been used in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The combination of SYTO 9 and propidium iodide (PI) has been posed as a reliable alternative [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to traditional blend of fluorescein diacetate with ethidium bromide, mainly because of the destructive properties of this combination and the toxicity and instability of the ethidium bromide [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This staining method allows for a visual demonstration of bactericidal activity as well as its quantification using computerized image analysis [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the <italic>in situ</italic> antiplaque effect of 2 antimicrobial agents in the short term with a posterior analysis on &#x0201c;non-destructured&#x0201d; biofilm with CLSM combined with fluorescence staining.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec010"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This was a randomised, observer-masked, crossover study of the antiplaque efficacy of 2 available formulas based on EO (Listerine Mentol Listerine Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Madrid, Spain) and 0.2% CHX (Oraldine Perio Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Madrid, Spain) on an <italic>in situ</italic> model of PL-Biofilm growth.

All of these volunteers were revised by the same calibrated clinician to ensure they fulfilled all inclusion and exclusion criteria. The volunteers chosen were systemically healthy adult volunteers between 20 and 45 years old, who presented a good oral health status: a minimum of 24 permanent teeth with no evidence of gingivitis or periodontitis (Community Periodontal Index score = 0) [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and an absence of untreated caries at the beginning of the study. The following exclusion criteria were applied: smoker or former smoker, presence of dental prostheses or orthodontic devices, antibiotic treatment or routine use of oral antiseptics in the previous 3 months, and presence of any systemic disease that could alter the production or composition of saliva. Before the start of each study, a full mouth scaling with ultrasonics and teeth polishing with rubber cup after dental disclosing was performed by the same calibrated clinician on all selected participants.</p><fig id="pone.0117177.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0117177.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Flow diagram of the study with enrollment, allocation, follow-up and analysis of participants.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0117177.g001"/></fig><p>This project was approved (number 2012/393) by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Galicia.

The characteristics of this splint have been previously described [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], although a new variety of partial splint has been already introduced [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Mouthwash protocol</title><p>During the 96 hour (4 days) duration of each course of study, each volunteer wore the splints with the glass disks, withdrawing them from the oral cavity only during meals and to perform oral hygiene procedures, using only the mechanical removal of bacterial plaque with water, without the use of any toothpaste or mouthwash. They were advised to do just 3 meals per day avoiding eating or drinking in-between. The only drink permitted during meals was still water. While eating and brushing their teeth, the splints were stored in a provided opaque plastic box (the type used to store orthodontic removable devices). Volunteers were told to impregnate a sterile gauze with 5 ml of saline (the gauzes and the saline were provided as well), and extend it on the base of the plastic box, support the splints on it and close the box, leaving it at room temperature. The maximum allowed time that the volunteers had to eat and perform the oral hygiene measures were 20 minutes.</p><p>Using the permitted mechanical oral hygiene measures (without the splints), the volunteers performed the following protocols based on the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions, with the splints in the oral cavity, during the 4 days in the morning (8.30) after breakfast and at night (22.00) after dinner:</p><p>A) 20 ml rinses for 30 seconds with essential oils/twice daily (4D-EO).</p><p>-or-</p><p>B) 10 ml rinses for 30 seconds with 0.2% chlorhexidine/twice daily (4D-0.2% CHX; positive control).</p><p>-or-</p><p>C) 20 ml rinses for 30 seconds with sterile water (4D-WATER; negative control).</p><p>A number was assigned to each participant (closed envelope) by an investigator who was unaware of the study design.

Although they were not told the type of mouthwash they were going to use, the obvious differences in taste between the 3 mouthwashes made allocation concealment to the volunteer impossible. The antiseptics/control were prepared in opaque bottles labelled with an A, B, or C depending on the containing solution, with 10 ml more than the quantity needed for completing the whole series of mouthwashes. The day before the start of each experiment, after the full mouth dental scaling and polishing, participants were given by a masked investigator the corresponding previously made splints, the allocated opaque bottle, a plastic glass and a sterile 20 ml serum syringe with the objective of being the more precise possible with the quantity of solution used for the mouthwash. The day of the sample analysis, they were asked to bring back the bottles to measure the quantity of solution left in the bottle.

The optical sections were scanned in 1 &#x003bc;m sections from the surface of the biofilm to its base, measuring the maximum thickness of the field and subsequently the mean thickness of the biofilm of the corresponding sample. The maximum thickness of biofilm field was defined as the distance between the substrate (in perpendicular) and the peaks of the highest cell clusters [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The maximum biofilm thickness of each field was divided into 3 zones or equivalent layers: outer layer (layer 1), middle layer (layer 2) and inner layer (layer 3) (<xref rid="pone.0117177.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0117177.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0117177.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Scheme of the divisions of the PL-Biofilm in layers.</title><p>1-Outer layer; 2-Middle layer; 3-Inner layer. *PL-Biofilm. **Glass disk (substrate).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0117177.g003"/></fig><p>The capture of the data was done with the same settings in all cases. The spatial scan mode (XYZ) and the 1024x1024 pixels scan format resolution were used. The Argon-ion and DPSS laser were used at a 13% and 78% of maximum intensity, respectively. The values for the pinhole, zoom and scan speed were 121.58 microns, 1 and 400Hz, respectively. The only values that were different depending on the sample were the offset (range between-1% to 1%) and PMT gain which was different for channel red and green, being in general terms, higher for green than for red (test and positive control), due to the fact that there was more presence of red than green signal, being for the negative control the opposite. These values were always adjusted to get a good quality capture without background noise, avoiding excessive saturation of the brightest pixels of the image. As the technician was blinded to the experiment, they were advised to make the adjustments always consistent with what was seeing by the objective of the microscope, obtaining an image which was the closest as possible to reality.</p><p>Quantification of bacterial vitality in the series of XY images was determined using cytofluorographic analysis (Leica Confocal Software). In this analysis, the images of each fluorochrome were defined as &#x0201c;channels&#x0201d; (SYTO 9 occupies the green channel and PI the red channel).

[<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] in which they analysed a 3 day-evolution PL-Biofilm measured by TEM. This technique, despite being very precise, requires the fixation and drying of the PL-Biofilm, with unavoidable consequences to its delicate structure. The second is a very important methodological aspect which should be taken into account when using CLSM for measuring PL-Biofilm thicknesses and refers to the high thickness data obtained by Gu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and mainly by Auschill <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].

They determined the PL-Biofilm thickness using the number of 1-&#x003bc;m-planes obtained by CLSM (regardless of the perpendicularity); using a measurement like this could result in errors in many cases because a minimum substrate inclination could carry on an evaluation of the substrate in the diagonal, which would overestimate the thickness of the PL-Biofilm obtained. In this paper, the Leica Confocal SPII software was used to obtain the exact distance existing between the substrate and the highest point of the PL-Biofilm perpendicularly, which is a more realistic measure.</p><p>The thickness of the <italic>in situ</italic> PL-Biofilm after the 4-day-application of 0.2% CHX and EO was 6.48 &#x003bc;m and 9.99 &#x003bc;m, respectively.

The results differ between them depending on the technique used for its measurement (SEM, TEM or CLSM), type and concentration of the mouthwashes and its duration. The only study apart from the present series that compares the efficacy of EO and CHX is the one from Jentsch <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] who measured the thickness of the PL-Biofilm developed on the surface of enamel slabs after a total period of 4 days. Unlike the findings reported in the present paper, they did not obtain any differences between the activity at reducing the PL-Biofilm thickness of the EO and the CHX. However, it should be noted that the concentration of CHX used in our study was higher (0.2%) than the used by Jentsch <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].

This lower vitality is highly influenced by the deepest layer of the PL-Biofilm (the nearest to the substrate), which is clearly where the differences are found in regard with the PL-Biofilm with less time of evolution.

[<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] also obtained a lower vitality in the deepest layer, coinciding with the theory that the bacteria located in the deepest part of a biofilm are in an inactive metabolic state [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p><p>With respect to the bacterial vitality after the mouthwash cycles with EO and 0.2% CHX, the bacterial vitality reductions are similar to those which have been previously obtained [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the literature, for 0.2% CHX and amine/stannous fluoride, these values were 62% and 64%, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and 43% for zinc chloride at a concentration of 10 mM [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In the present series, the bacterial vitality reduction was similar between both antiseptics (74% for EO and 77% for 0.2% CHX). Once again, the lowest bacterial vitality was found in the deepest layers of the PL-Biofilm.</p><p>In the present series, the results obtained both in thickness and bacterial vitality were considerably lower than those obtained by Arweiler <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This could be because of some noticeable methodological differences that should be commented upon. In the present study, the volunteers did the negative and the test cycles in different periods, which permitted active mouthwashes being used <italic>in situ</italic> with the antiplaque agents. On the other hand, Arweiler <italic>et al</italic>. replaced the rinse with a simple immersion in the test solution (0.2 CHX). By doing this, they were assuming that an immersion was similar to an active mouthwash, ignoring the intrinsic factors that a rinse has itself such as the washing effect and the muscle strength applied by the cheeks. In a previous paper, Auschill <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] highlighted the importance of doing the mouthwash <italic>in situ</italic> due to the fact that Pratten <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] had previously exposed an <italic>in vitro</italic> biofilm to 0.2% CHX solution for 5 minutes, observing minimal effects on the biofilm. Based on this, in a previous pilot study, our research group observed that the effects of both 0.2% CHX and EO on the PL-Biofilm were not comparable at all in the case of an immersion and an active rinse (data unpublished).</p><p>The covering grade by the PL-Biofilm in combination with its thickness is directly related to the antiplaque capacity of an antiseptic agent. This parameter is important because it can be predictive of the adaptation of microorganisms to environmental influences [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To the best of author&#x02019;s knowledge, there are no published papers on this issue in 4-day PL-Biofilm <italic>in situ</italic>. On the other hand, there are some <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on this topic and one of them obtained similar results to the present series after 4 days. It is one from Al-Ahmad <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] who obtained a 77% and a 7% of covering grade with negative control and 0.2% CHX after 4 days, similar to those from the current study (75% and 20%, respectively).</p><p>There are two 4-day <italic>in situ</italic> studies which compare the effect of EO and CHX in terms of bacterial counts [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. In these studies, the plaque control was done and culturable species were determined using culture plaque techniques. Eventually, they concluded that EO and 0.12% or 0.1% CHX (the concentrations used, respectively) had similar antiplaque effects. In the present series, although EO and 0.2% CHX presented a high and similar antibacterial activity, the latter was more powerful when inhibiting the PL-Biofilm formation, since both the covering grade and the thickness were considerably lower in its case.</p><p>Results obtained in microbiological studies, including the present paper, should be contrasted with those derived from clinical studies, based on the application of antiseptics in the short and long term. The results obtained in the present series are consistent with those from Riep <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and Pizzo <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. These 2 studies are clinical trials on the antiplaque activity of different antiseptics after 4 days, where both EO and CHX were effective when reducing the amount of dental plaque on the teeth surface in regard to the negative control after 4 days. In this sense, it should be mentioned that in multiple literature reviews it has been concluded that performing daily mouthwashes with EO produces a similar antiplaque effect to that of CHX [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. On the contrary, in a relatively recent revision, Neely <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] concluded that although the effect of the EO and the 0.2% CHX at reducing gingivitis may be equivalent, the latter is more effective when reducing the plaque formation after 6 months.</p><p>Although both the EO and the CHX has proved antiseptic efficacy on the PL-Biofilm, when used for long periods, some clinicians have to deal with possible side effects of both. In case of CHX, they are mainly dental staining [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and taste alterations. When prescribing EO for long periods, there is always the controversy of using alcohol containing mouthwashes due to its possible (remains still unproven [<xref rid="pone.0117177.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]) relation with the risk of developing oral cancer. For these reasons, a possible alternative could be the commercial formulas of EO without alcohol, that is why it would be interesting a new objective based on testing the EO without alcohol with this same model <italic>in situ</italic>, in order to evaluate its efficacy in the short term before testing it in the long term.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In a 4-day <italic>in situ</italic> PL-Biofilm model, the formulas based on essential oils and 0.2% chlorhexidine showed a high antiplaque effect. Although 0.2% chlorhexidine formula showed better results when reducing the thickness and covering grade by the biofilm, both antiseptics showed a high and similar antibacterial activity. As a consequence, the present essential oils formula could be considered a reliable alternative to chlorhexidine in order to prevent its side effects when used continuously.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117177.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort 2010 Checklist of the present study.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117177.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117177.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol of the study.</title><p>A randomised, observer-masked, crossover study of the antiplaque efficacy of 2 available formulas based on EO and 0.2% CHX on an <italic>in situ</italic> model of PL-Biofilm growth.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117177.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117177.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Report of the primary data in terms of thickness of the biofilm obtained per disk and volunteer after 4D-EO.</title><p>Results of thickness of the biofilm after 4D-EO.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117177.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117177.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Report of the primary data in terms of thickness of the biofilm obtained per disk and volunteer after 4D-CHX 0.2%.</title><p>Results of thickness of the biofilm after 4D-CHX-0.2%.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117177.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117177.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Report of the primary data in terms of thickness of the biofilm obtained per disk andvolunteer after 4D-CONTROL.</title><p>Results of thickness of the biofilm after 4D-CONTROL.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0117177.s005.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0117177.s006"><label>S4 Table</label><caption><title>A.
