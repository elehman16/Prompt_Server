Since anti-Jo-1 aAbs were first characterized, 7 other anti-aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase aAbs have been identified to date. Anti-Jo-1 aAbs occur most frequently, followed by anti-threonyl-tRNA synthetase (anti-PL-7) and anti-alanyl-tRNA synthetase (anti-PL-12) aAbs. In addition to being associated with myositis, anti-aminoacly-tRNA synthetase aAbs are usually associated with interstitial lung disease (ILD), which is the major determinant of morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Arthritis, Raynaud phenomenon, and mechanic&#x02019;s hands are also frequently observed in patients with anti-synthetase syndrome (anti-SS) [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Along their follow-up, more than two-thirds of patients with anti-SS need increased prednisone doses, adjunct therapy, and/or a change to a different immunosuppressive or modulator drugs, <italic>i</italic>.<italic>e</italic>., disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, because initial treatment was ineffective [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. No particular combination can be recommended because none appears to prevent treatment intensification [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Since Jo-1 antigen and anti-Jo-1 aAbs may have a role in the pathophysiology of anti-SS [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the use of B-cell targeted treatment may be of interest, as it was previously shown to be effective in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic aAbs&#x02013;associated vasculitis [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>At the initiation of this study, only case reports [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and retrospective case series [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] indicate that B-cell depletion using monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab may be beneficial. Since then, a prospective randomized clinical trial of rituximab for the treatment of refractory myositis from different origins (juvenile and adult dermatomyositis, polymyositis, anti-signal recognition particle necrotizing myopathies, and anti-SS) was published [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but no clinical trial, except this one, has addressed the efficacy of rituximab in a prospective fashion in a homogenous group of patients with anti-SS refractory to conventional therapies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with anti-SS were eligible to participate in this pilot, open-label, prospective, multicenter (this study was conducted in 4 French adult internal medicine departments), phase II study if they were considered refractory to conventional treatments. Patients were defined as having anti-SS if they had myositis based on the 119th European Neuro Muscular Centre criteria [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], including a proximal myopathy with weakness, a subacute or insidious onset over 18 years, myogenic syndrome diagnosed via electromyogram, and muscle fibre necrosis and regeneration and/or inflammatory cell infiltrate diagnosed via muscle biopsy, associated with the presence of anti-Jo-1 or anti-PL-7 or anti-PL-12 aAbs. Anti-Jo-1, anti-PL-7, anti-PL-12 aAbs were detected using an immunodot assay (Euroline Myositis Profile 3, Euroimmun, L&#x000fc;beck, Germany). Refractory anti-SS was defined as intolerance or inadequate response to glucocorticoids and at least 2 other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents, <italic>e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>., azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, cyclophosphamide, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). These treatments had to have been unsuccessful for more than 6 months before study start. Inadequate response was defined by the absence and/or worsening of one of the following parameters: muscle strength assessed by MMT10 score using Kendall score, creatine kinase (CK) level (&#x0003e; 3 fold the upper limit of the normal range, controlled twice), and/or pulmonary function tests (PFT).</p><p>Exclusion criteria were myositis associated with cancer or with connective tissue disease, pregnancy, severe cardiac dysfunction (ejection fraction &#x02264; 30%), severe respiratory dysfunction (forced vital capacity &#x0003c; 1000 mL and/or &#x02264; 30% of the predicted value), severe adverse reaction after monoclonal aAbs infusion, active infectious disease including bacterial or viral infections (such as human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B virus), anaemia (haemoglobin level &#x0003c; 8g/dL), neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count &#x0003c; 1500 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup>/&#x003bc;L), and immunoglobulin G and/or M &#x0003c; 5.0 or 0.40 mg /mL, respectively.</p><p>The patients were screened during a clinic visit or hospitalization and recruited after verification of eligibility criteria.

These patients were considered as refractory because of the number of immunosuppressants they received prior to study entry. At M12, only 2 patients achieved the primary end point of an improvement on two muscle groups even if 7 had improved muscle parameters (MMT10 and CK levels) as well as extramuscular involvements.</p><p>The ILD (measured by PFT) improved for 5 of 10 patients and was stabilized (n = 4) or worsened (n = 1) for the 5 remaining patients. Furthermore, 6 of 10 patients were able to decrease treatment, which was associated with an improved quality of life. This beneficial effect seems transient since at M18, 4 had relapsed (based on MM10 score).</p><p>To our knowledge, there are only 3 prospective clinical trials using rituximab to treat anti-SS patients with n = 2 [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], n = 7 [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and n = 32 [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], but inclusion criteria and outcomes differ from one to another, making comparison with our study difficult.</p><p>Here, we included patients who had relapsed and presented with ILD. ILD has been shown to be strong predictor for use of DMARD [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and poor survival [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Thus, it was not ethically possible to design a placebo group (control group) considering the long duration of study (18 months), neither a standardized association of immunosuppressants to compare the patients. There is indeed no standard therapeutic recommendation for such patients, and treatments have to be adapted to the past history of these patients. Only the Rituximab in Myositis (RIM) trial had a control placebo group for only 2 months; it was the delay of rituximab administration that was randomized [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. During this &#x02018;randomized placebo phase design&#x02019;, the placebo control phase lasted only 8 weeks, leading to the statistical failure of the trial since the mean time to achieve the primary outcome was much longer than 8 weeks (20.2 weeks) [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Despite its limited population size, one strength of the present study is that we enrolled prospectively a homogenous group of patients who had well-defined anti-SS syndrome based on a serologic test. Other prospective studies were based on inhomogeneous groups [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], i.e., including patients with dermatomyositis (sometimes juvenile patients), polymyositis with or without anti-SS, and necrotizing autoimmune myopathies associated with anti-signal recognition particles aAbs. This great heterogeneity of patients makes the choice of outcomes difficult as the interpretation of the results.</p><p>End points for clinical trials in myositis are difficult to define because myositis encompasses very heterogeneous groups of patients with variable muscular and extramuscular involvement and because strength-assessing tools are difficult to establish. In 2004, the International Myositis Assessment and Clinical Studies Group (IMACS) [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] recommended tools that we did not use since when the study was designed, the assessments tools it proposed had not been fully validated, and because a visual analogue scale (0&#x02013;10) was proposed for muscular assessment. Along that line, later in 2010, it was shown that MMT focusing on a subset of eight muscles (Kendall grading scale) was a good outcome measure for myositis (MMT8) [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In 2014, an improvement of 20% of the MMT8 score, was an item of a core set measure used as out-come in the RIM trial [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Here we used MMT10 with Kendall grading scale. However, the validity of MMT grading scales was recently discussed [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The results of our study suggested that monitoring CK level could be more sensitive for muscular assessment.</p><p>For chest evaluation, we used PFT, a reproducible and objective tool recommended for ILD assessment [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and not the core set of measures (including subjective tools with visual analog scales) recommended by IMACS and used in the RIM trial. This is the first time that PFT was used as an end point in a prospective trial that included exclusively anti-SS patients, and the improvements we observed are in line with those observed in a retrospective study [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Of note, only 2 patients have an improvement of DLCOcor measurement whereas 5 patients had an in increase of volume. This suggests that PFT improvement may be mainly due to muscular strength reinforcement rather than improvement of ILD. Along that line, only one patient showed a reduction of interstitial infiltrates on CT scan. The presence of anti-Jo-1 aAbs was one of the strongest predictor of clinical improvement in the RIM trial (including adult and paediatric myositis patients) [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, a correlation between anti-Jo-1 aAbs titers and parameters of clinical disease activity had been reported [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Here, all but one patient were anti-Jo-1 aAbs positive. We did not observe clear pattern of variation of anti-Jo-1 aAbs titers associated with out-comes measures, but the two patients with muscular worsening (MMT10 and CK) had increased titers.</p><p>After rituximab infusion, the level of B-cell depletion has been correlated with the risk of relapse in rheumatoid arthritis [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] as in anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic aAbs&#x02013;associated vasculitis [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], although this has not been confirmed in all studies [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The results we obtained concerning B-cell depletion do not allow such a conclusion.</p><p>Finally, adverse event related to the rituximab were mainly infections. None of the infections required hospitalization. The acute respiratory insufficiency was probably due to methotrexate toxicity. Infectious was also the most frequent adverse event related to the drug in the RIM study [<xref rid="pone.0133702.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since patients we enrolled had concomitant immunosuppressant and/or corticosteroids, the role of rituximab in occurrence of infections cannot be evaluated without control group.</p><p>To conclude, this pilot, prospective, phase II study provide data on the effect of rituximab on both muscular and extramuscular manifestations in patients with refractory anti-SS. It supports the development of a prospective, controlled clinical trial including exclusively anti-SS patients to test the efficacy of rituximab and to identify predictors of efficacy.</p><p>This work was supported by the French Ministry of Health (PHRC) and the Association Fran&#x000e7;aise contre les Myopathies (AFM). Rituximab was kindly provided by Roche.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133702.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Trial study protocol (FORCE) in the original language (French).</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133702.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133702.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Trial study protocol (FORCE) in English.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133702.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133702.s003"><label>S3 Appendix</label><caption><title>Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133702.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0133702.s004"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Data underlying the findings in the FORCE study.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0133702.s004.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0133702.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
