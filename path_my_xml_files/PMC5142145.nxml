Recent meta-analyses shows that a multifactorial falls risk assessment and management programmes are effective in all older population studied. However, the application of these programmes may not be the same in all National health care setting and, consequently, needs to be evaluated by cost-effectiveness studies before to plan this intervention in regular care. In Italy structured collaboration between hospital staff and primary care is generally lacking and the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in a fall prevention programme at home has never been explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>This will be a two-group randomised controlled trial aiming to evaluate the effects of a home-based intervention programme delivered by a multidisciplinary health team. The home tele-management programme, previously adopted in our Institute for chronic patients, will be proposed to elderly people affected by chronic diseases at high risk of falling at hospital discharge. The programme will involve the hospital staff and will be managed thanks to the collaboration between hospital and primary care setting. Patients will be followed for 6&#x000a0;months after hospital discharge. A nurse-tutor telephone support and tele-exercise will characterize the intervention programme. People in the control group will receive usual care. The main outcome measure of the study will be the percentage of patients sustaining a fall during the 6-months follow-up period. An economic evaluation will be performed from a societal perspective and will involve calculating cost-effectiveness and cost utility ratios.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, no adequately powered studies have investigated the effect of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in a home fall prevention program.

<bold>an individual home exercise program</bold> with strength, balance and walking components based on the Otago Exercise Program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] widely used in more randomized clinical trials as a valid instrument to reduce fall incidence. The mainstay of Otago protocol is focused on implementing legs strength muscles mainly involved in gait and balance. The strengthening exercise are focused on major lower limb muscles: knee flexors, knee exstensors and hip abductors, which are particularly important for functional movements and walking, and ankle dorsiflexor and plantarflexor muscles involved in recovering balance. Due to the high percentage of frail patients admitted in our wards, we will need to adapt this protocol to our population and therefore we&#x000a0;will divide patients in two different intervention subgroups (high and low intensity group) including the same exercises with different workload (Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Strengthening exercises</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td/><td colspan="2">Both groups</td></tr><tr><td>1.

</p><p>Group selection will be determined by the research physiotherapist and administered after a baseline assessment. As in Otago, we will use Four Test Balance Scale as screening test to define the group selection. People able to complete the test as recommended (i.e. without some aid by operators, completing the four steps proposed characterized by growing difficulties in balance) will be included in the high intensity group. People performing less than three steps will be assigned to the low intensity group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p><p>According to Otago program, we will propone exercises focused on improving balance and muscle strength, recommending the patient to have regular walk at least two times a week for at least 30 min. Participants will be advised to undertake their exercise program at least three times a week. Before leaving the hospital participants will receive a booklet with instructions for each exercise prescribed and ankle cuff weights to provide resistance for the strengthening exercises.</p></list-item><list-item><p>
<bold>health care assistance</bold>
</p><p>A nurse tutor (NT) will follow up patients enrolled in the study with periodic phone called planned at least once a week. NT will promote health education support on fall prevention for patient and family, check out drug therapy adherence, collect new symptoms and concerns about current pharmacological. All personal and clinical patient&#x02019;s data will be recorded on a web platform accessible in real time (Teleriab) to physicians, NT or physical therapists participating in the study.</p><p>To help people to adhere to the program a research physiotherapist will follow the patients with training sessions through videoconference once a week during the first 3 months of the program, twice a month during the leading 2 months and monthly during the last month period. The physiotherapist will monitor the exercise session in real time tailoring the treatment to each single patient to avoid loss of adherence, and improving injury risk minimization strategies for patients at high risk.</p><p>A software Platform of telemedicine (Teleriab), designed to offer telerehabilitation services, will be used to allow communication between patients and medical or paramedical team. Through this web platform the health staff will realize phone calls and video contacts with one or more patients contemporary (with a maximum of eight videoconferences simultaneously) or consecutively respecting the privacy of the patients. People owing a computer with an internet connection at home will receive an entry password to Teleriab once randomized to the group of intervention. People without a personal computer who live in a geographic area compatible with Internet Key connection will receive a netbook with a pre-installed &#x0201c;client&#x0201d; Teleriab version and an USB internet key. Teleriab leads an automatically access to internet once preinstalled. For patients without a their-own computer and without internet connection, a netbook with a preinstalled client version of Teleriab and an activated ADSL contract service will be provided until the end of the study.</p></list-item></list>

Indeed, hospital physicians, specialists or general practitioners do not systematically address the patient&#x02019;s risk behavior.</p><p>Participants in the control group will receive usual care by their GP. Before hospital discharge, we will provide control participants with written recommendation on fall risk factors. The same document will be sent to the GP. Once a month, participants in the control group will receive a phone call to check for incidence of falls, related complications and drug therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p>Fall risk stratification will be performed in all potentially eligible patients using a Berg Balance Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].

Fear of falling will be measured by the Italian version of Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], gait and balance by Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] or Balance Evaluation System&#x02019;s Test (BEST) in patients with Parkinson disease, functional state by Activities Daily Living scale (ADL), Barthel Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], Instrumental Activity Daily Living scale (IADL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and quality of life by the EQ-5D questionnaire. Daily doses of drugs considered correlated with fall risk such as antihypertensive drugs, diuretics, beta-blocker, calcium antagonists, nitrates, antiarrhytmics, insulin, oral hypoglycemic drugs, neuroleptics, antidepressives, antiepileptic and dopaminergic and thyroid drugs will be also recorded.</p><p>The same operators previously involved in baseline evaluations will collect them at the end of 6-month follow-up as well.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Follow-up</title><p>Participants will be followed-up for 6&#x000a0;months after randomization. To ensure blinding during data collection, information and measurements will be collected by phone by an independent call center, whose operators have been trained to administer questionnaires and will be unaware of the group allocation. During this period patients will be monitored monthly about incidence of falls and related complications, clinical status, healthcare utilization, adherence to clinical recommendations and drug therapy modifications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome will be the proportion of fallers in the 6-month period after randomization. The secondary falls outcomes are the time between the first fall and the recurrent falls during follow-up and the percentage of patients sustaining two or more falls.

The primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis will be the percentage of people sustaining a fall during the 6-month follow-up. Within the cost-utility analysis the effects will be measured in terms of generic health-related quality of life descriptions, measured according to the standard Italian version of the EQ-5D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], a self-administered questionnaire administered at baseline and after 6 months.</p><p>All healthcare and patient costs will be measured by means of a cost diary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], in which participants continuously will record volumes of healthcare utilization during the 6&#x000a0;month follow-up period. In monthly telephone interviews, participants will be asked whether they had received care (or devices or services) or not. If participants will answer the question on a particular topic affirmatively, they will be asked to indicate the number of visits or details about the specific type of healthcare utilization.

They were over 65&#x000a0;years old, medium-high fall risk profile, consecutively discharged from January to June 2013 and with a 6-month fall rate of 22.2%.</p><p>Consequently, we have estimated that 290 patients (145 in each group) are needed to detect a reduction of 40% of fallers in the intervention group with respect to the control one, with a power (1-beta) of 80%, alpha of 0.05 and an expected dropout rate of about 6%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data will be primarily analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.</p><p>An on-treatment analysis will be subsequently performed to assess whether protocol deviations have caused bias. Participants with documented deviation from the study protocol (i.e. patients in the intervention group who did not receive the entire intervention or participants in both groups with incomplete follow-up data) will be excluded from this analysis. Chi-square analysis will be used to compare the proportion of fallers and non-fallers between groups. Cox proportional hazards regression will be conducted with time to first fall within 6&#x000a0;months of follow-up as outcome measure with age, sex, anthropometric data, prevalent disease, comorbidities, residual disability, marital status, social and economic status, MMSE and baseline variables as covariates. Multiple linear regression analyses will be used to compare differences in the other secondary outcomes at 6&#x000a0;months follow-up between groups. ANOVA with repeated measures will be used to analyze differences between groups from baseline to follow-up. Differences in baseline characteristics between groups will be examined using parametric (<italic>T</italic>-test) and non-parametric (Chi-square) tests. No ad interim analysis will be performed.</p><p>The economic evaluations will be conducted from a societal perspective and involve calculating cost-effectiveness ratio.

The inclusion of patients with mild-moderate cognitive impairment represents a further originality. In fact, most studies conducted in community-dwelling patients have not specifically addressed older adults with cognitive impairment, and the effectiveness of fall prevention interventions in this population is not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Elderly adults with cognitive problems are one of the most vulnerable sectors of our society with clear mental, social, and physical disadvantages. They are more likely to experience falls, and experience further mobility decline due to having fallen; therefore it is urgent to identify evidence based interventions for reducing the risk of falls and related injuries in people with cognitive impairment.</p><p>Finally, an additional strength of the study is the administration of a fall prevention program supported by the new home-based technologies. This may contribute to a new approach to prevent and treat fall risk in this population. To date, no adequately powered studies have investigated the effect of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in a home fall prevention program. We aim the program will be feasible in terms of intensity and characteristics, but particularly in terms of patient and provider compliance, which represent a possible barrier in successful implementation of fall prevention strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the results of the economic evaluation could provide information about the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and the effects on quality of life.

Epidemiological data on prevalence and fall rate incidence of subjects with a high fall risk profile coming from a multispecialistic rehabilitation setting are lacking. Consequently, we powered the study on the fall rate observed in a small number of patients discharged from our Institute that we hope will be confirmed in the usual care group.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BEST</term><def><p>Balance evaluation system&#x02019;s test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FES</term><def><p>Falls efficacy scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GPs</term><def><p>General practitioners</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IADL</term><def><p>Instrumental activity daily living scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICT</term><def><p>Information and communication technologies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MMSE</term><def><p>Mini-mental state examination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NT</term><def><p>Nurse tutor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TUG</term><def><p>Timed up and go test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>The Authors thank Rosemary Allpress for the English revision of the manuscript.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The study is supported by a grant from Ministero della Salute &#x0201c;Ricerca Finalizzata Giovani Ricercatori GR-2010-2310662.
