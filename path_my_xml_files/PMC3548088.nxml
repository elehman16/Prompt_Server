Low levels of adherence have been shown to increase risk of disease progression burden on services and treatment cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Non-adherence facilitates the emergence of resistant strains of the virus (limiting future treatment options) and provokes spread of the disease among the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Adherence has become crucial to AIDS programs worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and has led to the implementation of interventions aimed at enhancing adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In Brazil, besides universal and free access to health care and antiretroviral therapy, all PLHIV are also entitled to free access to CD4, Viral Load and Genotyping exams. The National AIDS Program has provided general guidance to the health system regarding adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>As analyzed by Caraciolo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], most AIDS care services report that adherence is assessed and encouraged, mainly during clinical consultations with physicians and nurses. Additionally, services carry out different initiatives to enhance adherence, such as group sessions or conversations and talks in the waiting room. Adherence promotion activities however, differ greatly across local health services, and are rarely evaluated. Moreover, most these activities are aimed at all patients and there are no reports of interventions aimed specifically at non-adherent patients. Few studies have been performed in Brazil investigating the efficacy of these interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and only one randomized controlled study has been published to date [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Considering this context, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo researchers established a partnership with the S&#x000e3;o Paulo AIDS Program to conduct a broader project to develop, implement and analyze a psychosocial intervention and its acceptability, feasibility and effectiveness within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS).</p><p>The intervention drew on the references which have distinguished the ethical and theoretical framework underlying the Brazilian Response to AIDS (BRA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], more specifically, its human rights-based approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Non-discrimination and participation are core components of the right to health, and of human rights-based responses to AIDS, as well as the principles of availability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of the services delivered, ensuring the most vulnerable populations are reached with the services they need [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a debate published in the <italic>Lancet</italic>, Kalichman and Diniz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] noted that mortality and incidence decreased following this rights-based approach providing the necessary evidence. BRA would have never succeeded without the SUS principle of universalidade (universal access), grounded in constitutional rights for both prevention and treatment.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> A common misunderstanding centers on the Unified Health System (SUS) principle of integralidade (comprehensiveness) aimed to overcome the dichotomy between prevention and treatment.</p><p>For two decades, <italic>integralidade</italic> and <italic>universalidade</italic> have been key assets to the quality of services delivered and for the high rates of adherence to ARV in Brazil, as previous studies have shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Early in the 1990s, the National Aids Program defended before the World Bank that treatment is in itself a form of secondary prevention of complications, reduces HIV transmission and bring affected people to the health system for testing, counseling and early treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. On the other hand, much of what was learnt in BRA prevention policies focused on universal access and adherence to condom use inspired the integralidade initiatives enhancement of AIDS care and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Two characteristics of the intervention discussed in this article are consistent with features of effective interventions analyzed in international systematic reviews, namely, the fact that it is an individual approach (compared to a group approach) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and is aimed at non-adherent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. It is also congruent with approaches that propose a more radical replacement of the notions of adherence with ideas that reflect &#x0201c;collaboration&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], &#x0201c;autonomy motivation&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], &#x0201c;empowerment&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and the notion of &#x0201c;concordance&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], as we have discussed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>This paper discusses the results of a clinical trial that evaluated the effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention developed from previous BRA initiatives that conceptualize health care as inextricably linked to prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], especially based on the concept of Care (Cuidado) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and its psychosocial constructionist approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a social-psychological individual intervention for improving adherence to antiretroviral drug regimens for HIV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Setting</title><p>This study was conducted in 2008, from March to November, at the STI/AIDS Training and Reference Center of Sao Paulo State, Brazil (CRT-DST/AIDS), a traditional &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; reference center for <italic>integralidade</italic> and interdisciplinary approaches for the Brazilian Aids Response (BRA), which has provided more than two decades of care.

All meetings were tape-recorded.</p><p>In this constructionist approach, the professional acts as a &#x0201c;director&#x0201d; of an &#x0201c;imaginary drama&#x0201d;. Conversations look for real episode narratives focusing on scripts and characters in action, the ARV intake scene dynamics in this case. Lists of problems, behaviors, attitudes, believes, knowledge, motivations and emotions are approached through real life scenes, chosen by the professional. Scenes are conceived as embodied scripts, situated in the broader social context where gender, social status and power imbalances are constructed. Without leaving the typical two-chairs-one-table ambulatory setting, spontaneity is increased as the professional explores positions and role changes by requesting the patient to be, for a moment, in the other person&#x02019;s shoes or to change their own scripts, supporting them to actively re-invent the scene. The deeper and shared understanding of the daily medication intake obstacle dynamic occurs when the &#x0201c;medication taker&#x0201d; can be seen in their role, as well as the roles of &#x0201c;others&#x0201d;, and can see their scenery in a clearer and fuller manner, by exploring scene meanings in the capacity of spectator from an outside perspective, while using active imagination to test new performances and scenes. Patient and professional conclude by exploring viable new plans of action. Beyond sharing the deeper understanding of daily life, professional technical knowledge and practical experience of the person in scene, which includes learning from situations experienced by other patients, are shared as testimonies of professional expertise.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Usual Care</title><p>Participants from the control group received only usual care.

The decrease in adherence observed after the end of the intervention solely in the IG presented statistical significance, and supports the hypothesis that this may have stemmed from the effects of the intervention, given that both groups were equally exposed to the effect of MEMS. Other studies have shown that adherence levels do not persist after the intervention, tending to decline over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>The increases in adherence promoted by complex interventions, even the most effective of these interventions, has proved to be limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Simoni et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]., in a recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials which assessed the impact of stimulus interventions on adherence to antiretroviral therapy, noted a 1.5-fold likelihood of intervention participants attaining 95&#x000a0;% adherence. To date, there is no evidence that low adherence can be remedied in a definitive manner. Therefore, strategies to enhance adherence should be continued throughout the treatment period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and include periodical actions aimed at enhancing adherence, particularly among individuals who struggle to manage their treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>The sole previous randomized controlled study of an intervention to enhance adherence to ARV conducted in Brazil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] was held in the State of Bahia and used self-reports to measure adherence. Results also showed no effect of the intervention on adherence. Van Dulmen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. analyzed 38 systematic reviews focused on chronic disease adherence interventions and revealed that half of these had no effect on adherence.</p><p><italic>Measurements of secondary outcomes</italic> also showed no effect when comparing viral load between IG and CG. However, the fall detected in both groups of 0.82 log in the IG and 0.96 log in the CG, between study baseline and end-point, reached statistical and possibility clinical significance, since falls of greater than 0.5 log correlate with lower risk of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>The decline in viral load observed may have stemmed from small increases in adherence among patients, in conjunction with the potency of the therapeutic regimen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Comparison of the evolution of viral load between the study participants and eligible individuals who refused to take part, showed decreases in both groups, albeit to a greater, statistically significant degree among participants of the clinical trial. This finding suggests that participation in the study in itself may have promoted an adherence-enhancing effect which in turn led to the differences in viral load detected between the two groups (participants of the study vs. refusals).</p><p>This study was the second randomized, controlled trial to increase ART adherence conducted in Brazil. As recommended by systematic reviews, adherence evaluation was objective, assessed in different points of the intervention and measured two months after its closure. Data was analyzed by intention to treatment and clinical results were also evaluated, an ethical requirement for these studies that aim at other benefits, as viral replication control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>We sought to overcome some of the drawbacks of previous studies noted by other authors by running this study in a setting other than that of clinical efficacy trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].</p><p>Lastly, it is important to emphasize that one of the contributions of this study was demonstrating the viability of running trials in health services by exploiting the potential of human resources and materials available, without introducing radical changes in the routines of professionals and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Limitations</title><p>The methodology originality and the short intervention period required by the funders demanded stricter control of its complexity. The venue option was the chosen reference and training center for an AIDS service that, compared to most Brazilian services, is better qualified and used as a benchmark. Given these constraints and limitations the present study did not benefit from the running of previous pilot studies, but may contribute to the design of future interventions in services which treat PLHIV in the State of S&#x000e3;o Paulo.</p><p>The experience of the health care team, the CRT-DST/AIDS facilities and its abundant and broad resources supported the study feasibility. In addition, the usual care provided by this service of technical excellence, offering a broad array of activities to encourage greater adherence, may have been an additional factor reducing the difference between the groups. Moreover, the Center&#x02019;s differentiated structure and history may demand further adaptation of the intervention to other service contexts.</p><p>This study has several other potential limitations resulting from this context. First, it was not possible to recruit the number of volunteers initially envisaged for the two groups. The number of eligible subjects in the service was lower than expected and the quantity of refusals resulted in a smaller than recommended sample.</p><p>Another limitation was patient attrition of 20&#x000a0;% in the IG and 11&#x000a0;% in the CG. The higher attrition in the IG may be related to the same reasons for refusal reported by those who did not agree to participate, such as having to come more frequently than usual to the health service. The periodicity of every-15&#x000a0;days was not feasible for all patients as assumed, and should be considered as a relevant result in the adaptation in each service contexts. In the routine care, periodicity may be tailored to each person daily activities, to his/her working and domestic scenarios, to the long distances they have to cover to assess the services. Another paper will focus on process evaluation, in order to discuss how to respond to the social and daily life context of these patients who refused or abandoned the trial because of other important daily life activities. Expected differences (20&#x000a0;%) in adherence between the IG and CG was overestimated in the sample size calculation. The statistical power calculated post hoc did not exceed 12&#x000a0;%, and was therefore lower than the 80&#x000a0;% power used for sample size calculation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The intervention did not increase adherence among study participants. However, the reduced levels of viral load detected in both groups may have benefited the study participants because lower levels are associated with reduced mortality and disease progression.</p><p>Interventions aimed at increasing treatment adherence occur in the complex real daily life of health services, and this factor must be considered when using this framework or taking this structured intervention as an inspiration to other initiatives. The assistance provided through the intervention did not prove sufficient to impact adherence levels at this service. Indeed, we continue to believe that this population requires individualized attention that fosters each person&#x02019;s participation as part of the solution, not as part of the problem, in line with the non-discrimination and participation principles of human rights-based initiatives.</p><p>Investing in the development of in-depth, individualized approaches aimed at promoting equity among individuals more vulnerable to non-adherence and AIDS morbidity, as well as at monitoring the Cuidado (Care) of patients with known adherence problems toward more effective solutions to tackle treatment problems, remains an ongoing challenge for health services.</p><p>Ongoing qualitative analysis of the intervention will yield further insights regarding the results of this pragmatic clinical trial. After refining the intervention, similar studies involving other less complex specialized services can be conducted in a range of different care settings which more closely reflect the prevailing reality of the national Unified Health System (SUS) and its Brazilian AIDS Response (BRA).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Amparo a Pesquisa do Estado de S&#x000e3;o Paulo (FAPESP) funded this study.
