This randomized, double-blind, positive- and placebo-controlled crossover study enrolled healthy, adult, nonphysically dependent recreational opioid users with recent history of intranasal drug abuse (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;27). Active treatments contained oxycodone (30&#x02009;mg). Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics (e.g., Overall Drug Liking [ODL], Take Drug Again [TDA], and High Visual Analog Scales [VAS]; Subjective Drug Value [SDV]; pupillometry; intranasal irritation), and safety (e.g., adverse events, vital signs, laboratory tests) were assessed to 24&#x02009;hours postdose. Crushed ORF administration yielded reduced oxycodone C<sub>max</sub> and increased T<sub>max</sub> versus crushed OC and Oxy API. Peak effects for pharmacodynamic measures were delayed with ORF (1&#x02013;2&#x02009;hours) versus OC and Oxy API (0.5&#x02013;1&#x02009;hour). ODL, TDA, High VAS, and SDV E<sub>max</sub> values were significantly lower (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;.05) and some intranasal irritation ratings were greater for ORF versus OC and Oxy API. No significant or unexpected safety findings were observed. Compared with OC and Oxy API, intranasally administered ORF was associated with lower and delayed peak plasma concentrations, decreased drug-liking, and decreased intranasal tolerability. This suggests that ORF has a decreased potential for intranasal oxycodone abuse. There were no significant or unexpected safety findings. As is true for all abuse potential studies, epidemiological or other appropriate post-marketing studies are required to assess the impact of the reduction in intranasal oxycodone abuse potential observed in the present study on real-world patterns of ORF misuse, abuse, and diversion.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oxycodone</kwd><kwd>OxyContin</kwd><kwd>reformulation</kwd><kwd>abuse deterrent</kwd><kwd>abuse potential</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetic</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamic</kwd><kwd>tamper resistant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The direct and indirect costs of chronic pain in the United States have been estimated at more than $100 billion annually in medical expenses, lost wages, and lost productivity.<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Prescription opioids are an important treatment option for the management of chronic pain, but their misuse and abuse constitute a substantial medical and public health problem.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>While opioids are often abused via intact oral administration, opioid dosage forms are also frequently tampered with and then abused orally or via alternate routes of administration (predominantly intranasal and intravenous routes) that provide rapid opioid delivery to the central nervous system.<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In an effort to reduce abuse via alternate routes, opioid formulations have been created with features designed to deter tampering, such as physical barriers (e.g., excipients that resist manipulation) and inclusion of antagonists (e.g., naloxone or naltrexone) that block opioid effects.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> It is recognized that no opioid formulation is immune to tampering by knowledgeable drug abusers,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> but tamper-deterrent formulations may serve to decrease the public health burden of opioid abuse by making abuse more difficult, more time consuming, and less effective to the abuser.</p><p>The original formulation of OxyContin&#x000ae; (OC) was approved in 1995 by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of moderate to severe pain. The original formulation provided no inherent resistance to tampering, and the control of oxycodone release could be easily defeated by crushing the tablet into a fine powder. By 2001, OC had been identified as one component of the growing problem of prescription drug abuse.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The FDA responded to this problem, in part, by working with industry to develop proactive risk mitigation strategies. Such strategies for OC included adding a black box warning to product labelling and initiating a proactive surveillance progam for prescription opioid abuse and diversion.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>To further address the problem of misuse, abuse, and diversion of OC, an abuse-deterrent reformulation of OxyContin&#x000ae; (ORF) was developed. ORF was designed to be bioequivalent to OC following intact oral administration and to resist physical and chemical manipulations intended to defeat the control of oxycodone release. In vitro tampering studies demonstrated that ORF resists crushing and other particle size reduction efforts. ORF is anticipated to discourage tampering and intranasal oxycodone abuse. Firstly, tampering with ORF requires significant time and effort. Secondly, the particles produced by tampering with ORF may retain some controlled-release properties. Thirdly, the size of the particles may serve to increase both the likelihood of incomplete dosing and the severity of nasal irritation associated with insufflation. Lastly, when ORF is dissolved in small volumes for intravenous administration, it forms a viscous solution that cannot be effectively drawn into a syringe.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, since ORF is designed to deliver oxycodone over time when taken as directed, it can be abused by taking intact tablets orally without legitimate purpose.</p><p>This study of recreational opioid users evaluated the abuse potential, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of finely and coarsely crushed, intranasally administered ORF tablets relative to finely crushed OC, oxycodone powder (Oxy API), and OC placebo. It examined intranasal administration (i.e., snorting) of crushed ORF and OC for three reasons: because intranasal administration has been found to be a route preferred among abusers for delivery of opioids, including oxycodone<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> and OC specifically<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; because intranasal administration involves the crushing or pulverizing of ORF, which may compromise its controlled-release properties<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>; and because the accelerated absorption afforded by intranasal administration may pose a greater risk to the abuser.</p><p>ORF is the only available controlled-release formula of oxycodone at present. Other products are in development by other companies, but none are currently approved or commercially available. The results of this study apply strictly to ORF.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Ethical Conduct</title><p>This study was conducted at INC Research Toronto Inc., Toronto, Canada, in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments as outlined by the International Conference on Harmonisation. Prior to study initiation, the Institutional Review Board, IRB Services, Aurora, Canada, approved informed consent forms and the study protocol in accordance with Good Clinical Practice and applicable regulatory requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Subjects</title><p>The study enrolled eligible healthy male and female adults (aged 18&#x02013;55 years, inclusive) who reported a history of nonmedical use of opioids via the intranasal route, though reports of other routes of administration did not preclude participation. The absence of opioid physical dependence was assessed by interview and confirmed by the results of a naloxone challenge.Subjects were excluded if they had an Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (OOWS)<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> score 3 or greater following the naloxone challenge test, self-reported drug dependence (past 2 years), or a positive urine drug screen or breath alcohol test. Key restrictions included abstaining from alcohol consumption for 48&#x02009;hours prior to each visit and from recreational drug use from screening through study completion. Also not permitted were caffeine consumption for 24&#x02009;hours prior to clinic admission and nicotine consumption from 11 PM the night before until 8&#x02009;hours after each dose administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall Study Design</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, positive- and placebo-controlled, five-treatment crossover study that evaluated the abuse potential, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and safety profile of finely and coarsely crushed ORF versus OC and Oxy API according to current guidelines for studies of abuse liability.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The study consisted of: a screening phase, a qualification phase, a treatment phase, and a follow-up visit (2&#x02013;4 days following the last treatment visit or after early withdrawal). The screening phase included a naloxone challenge to determine physical dependence.</p><p>In the qualification phase, subjects self-administered intranasal doses of 30-mg Oxy API and volume-matched lactose powder placebo in a randomized crossover fashion, with approximately 24&#x02009;hours between administrations. Subjects were eligible to enter the double-blind treatment phase if they tolerated 30-mg Oxy API. Additionally, the fulfillment of one of the following three criteria was required: (1) subjects had both a peak score for lactose powder placebo &#x02264;55 on a 0&#x02013;100 point bipolar Drug Liking visual analog scale (VAS) where 50 represented a &#x0201c;neutral&#x0201d; response, <italic>AND</italic> a peak score &#x02264;10 on the unipolar 0&#x02013;100 High VAS where 0 represented a &#x0201c;no effects&#x0201d; response; <italic>OR</italic> (2) subjects had both a peak Drug Liking VAS score for 30-mg Oxy API powder greater than OC placebo by at least 15 points <italic>AND</italic> a peak High VAS score greater than OC placebo by at least 30 points. Finally, subjects were eligible to enter the treatment phase if their responses to Oxy API and OC placebo were judged to be acceptable by the investigator on VAS for Drug Liking, Good Effects, Bad Effects, and High.</p><p>In the double-blind treatment phase, subjects self-administered intranasal doses of the five study treatments in a randomized crossover fashion, with a washout period of at least 48&#x02009;hours between treatments. The five treatments were lactose powder OC placebo, 30-mg finely crushed ORF, 30-mg coarsely crushed ORF, 30-mg finely crushed OC, and 30-mg Oxy API powder. Coarsely crushed OC was not tested because simple crushing of OC readily produces a fine powder. OC placebo consisted of finely ground OC placebo tablets that were prepared in the same manner as the active OC tablets.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic Assessments</title><p>Plasma oxycodone concentrations were quantified from venous blood samples collected via an indwelling cannula or by direct venipuncture at predose, and at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24&#x02009;hours postdose. A solid-phase extraction method was used to extract oxycodone from 200&#x02009;&#x000b5;L plasma samples. The extracted samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using a Phenomenex Luna Si, 5&#x02009;&#x000b5;m, 2&#x02009;mm&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;mm, normal phase column. The mobile phase used was 85:15 (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile:0.2% formic acid in 20&#x02009;mM ammonium formate buffer, v/v). The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with positive ion detection.

profiles for tampered ORF versus OC, which indicated less potential for abuse of ORF compared with OC based upon a decrease in the rate and extent of oxycodone aborption in the first hours following administration. The pharmacodynamic data collected following ORF demonstrated a reduction in abuse potential compared to OC. These findings provide evidence that the difference in formulation characteristics between OC and ORF observed in in vitro tampering experiments translated into the intended abuse-deterrent effects on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of ORF.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Safety findings proved consistent with the known effects of opioid use and no unexpected safety findings emerged.</p><p>Consistent with recent FDA draft guidance,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> this study of abuse potential was validated by comparing the responses to the positive control treatments with responses to the OC placebo treatment. Intranasal administration of both positive controls, OC and Oxy API, resulted in significant increases in E<sub>max</sub> for Drug Liking VAS, Overall Drug Liking VAS, and Subjective Drug Value.</p><p>The elements of this study are consistent with those recommended in several published guidelines, including: double-blinding; the use of active and OC placebo treatments in a population of nondependent recreational opioid users who were able to discriminate between them via the relevant route of administration; a qualification phase that included a naloxone challenge; the use of opaque vials and particles of crushed treatments that appeared similar across all treatments; primary measures of drug-liking captured on bipolar VAS and expressed in terms of E<sub>max</sub>; appropriate pharmacokinetic measures (including the rate of the rise of drug concentration); and appropriate additional pharmacodynamic measures (including adequate assessments of intranasal tolerability).<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Finally, this study was part of a larger program developed to characterize the abuse potential of ORF.</p><p>The comprehensive analysis of the abuse potential of ORF includes a battery of in vitro tamper-testing studies as well as in vivo pharmacokinetic and abuse potential studies.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It also includes a suite of real-world epidemiological studies that compare rates of misuse, abuse, and diversion over the 2-year period since the introduction of ORF with a 15-month pre-introduction baseline period of OC rates.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Recently reported results from these multiple, ongoing epidemiologic studies support the findings presented here. The epidemiologic study results available to date have shown reductions in overall and tamper-related abuse of OxyContin since the introduction of the reformulation of OxyContin (ORF) in 2010,<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> as well as in its street price,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and diversion.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>In common with limitations of all abuse potential studies,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> the results of this study do not provide information relating the introduction of this abuse-deterrent formulation to changes in real-world abuse. Another limitation is that current recommendations suggest that cognitive and psychomotor measures be included in opioid abuse potential studies, although it is acknowledged that specific tests have not yet been identified for recommendation.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> An additional limitation is that, despite measures taken to reduce the opportunity for subjects to make physical comparisons among the study treatments (e.g., treatments were held in opaque vials with preinserted tubes for insufflation), it was not possible to fully prevent such comparisons being made, which may have compromised blinding to some extent. Finally, the outcome measures of this study are acknowledged to be measures of relative abuse potential and not absolute measurements. While the methods themselves appear to have validity, they do not take into account the social context in which ORF appears, including cultural norms and legal strictures on availability. Therefore, the results of this study should be interpreted in proper context: a study that compares an abuse-deterrent reformulation of a product with a product that was previously subject to significant misuse and abuse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Reformulated OxyContin (ORF) has physicochemical properties intended to deter tampering for the purposes of intranasal oxycodone abuse by making crushing both more difficult and less effective, resulting in a reduction in the rate and extent of oxycodone absorption in the first hours after administration. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of ORF were seen in this study of healthy adults who were nonphysically dependent, recreational opioid users. Intranasal administration of crushed ORF was associated with reduced C<sub>max</sub>, increased T<sub>max</sub>, and lower abuse quotient scores compared with Oxy API and crushed OC. Compared with both original OxyContin (OC) and Oxy API, peak effects of finely and coarsely crushed ORF were significantly lower on most subjective and objective measures (including Overall Drug Liking VAS, Take Drug Again VAS, High VAS, Subjective Drug Value, and pupillometry), and these peak effects occurred later compared with the positive controls. Significant increases in these subjective and objective measures for OC and Oxy API compared to OC placebo confirmed the validity of the study design. ORF exhibited a safety profile consistent with intranasal opioid use in this population. The reduced intranasal oxycodone abuse potential of ORF indicated by the findings of the present study are consistent with the findings of reductions in intranasal oxycodone abuse reported in epidemiologic studies of reformulated OxyContin.<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Michael L.
