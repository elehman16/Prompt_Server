In India, it accounts for nearly one third of prevalent cases worldwide and remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] A fixed dose combination (FDC) containing rifampicin (R), isoniazid (I), and pyrazinamide (Z) is the mainstay of the treatment of TB. Although FDC products provide many advantages, poor and variable bioavailability of antitubercular treatment (ATT) drugs produce a challenge to successful antitubercular program.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The low bioavailability of these drugs often results in insufficient therapeutic plasma levels of the drugs leading to treatment failure and emergence of resistance. Further drug-induced hepatotoxicity and potentially serious adverse effects add to the problem, and adverse effects often negatively affect the compliance.</p><p>Thus increasing the oral bioavailability of these drugs remains the priority of the treating clinician. A lot of strategies have been advocated for improving the bioavailability of these drugs. The concept of bioenhancers is derived from the traditional age-old system of Ayurvedic therapies and numerous plants have been evaluated for their potential bioavailability enhancing activity. In ayurveda, black pepper, long pepper, and ginger are collectively known as trikatu, which has been used as a bioenhancer.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] <italic>Carum carvi</italic> is one such herbal bioenhancer that has been extensively studied along with antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antitubercular, antihistaminics.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Although, a few recent studies have proved the bioenhancing property of <italic>C. carvi</italic> with antitubercular drugs in animals,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to the best of our knowledge there is no study evaluating its bioenhancing property in humans.

Its treatment poses many difficulties in the form of poor and variable bioavailability of antitubercular drugs. Of many approaches applied for increasing bioavailability of these drugs, one is use of herbal bioenhancers. Earlier reports in rats indicate bioenhancing potential of <italic>C. carvi</italic> when it was administered along with rifampicin.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] A recent report has also shown its bioenhancing action on rifampicin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide in rats.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The current study has indicated bioenhancing potential of <italic>C. carvi</italic> along with ATT therapy for the first time in humans. Thereby there exists the possibility of ameliorating the dose-related toxicity of ATT by allowing reformulation of dose reduction.</p><p><italic>C. carvi</italic> has been used since ages for many ailments in different parts of the world. It is a prized culinary herb, which is extensively used across different cultures. This herb has been mentioned in Ayurveda and other Indian systems of medicine prescriptions for a variety of ailments. It has been used as a carminative, stomachic, aromatic, and diuretic.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There has been no study till date using <italic>C. carvi</italic> as bioenhancer along with antitubercular drugs in humans. The present study is the first of its kind to determine in humans the bioenhancing potential of <italic>C. carvi</italic> along with antitubercular drugs.</p><p>In our study, the various pharmacokinetic parameters were comprehensively studied. The results show that addition of <italic>C. carvi</italic> extract led to increase in plasma levels of rifampicin, which peaked at 4 h. Similar increase was observed with isoniazid and pyrazinamide levels, which increased in same fashion with peak at 3 h (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><p>These observations state clearly that <italic>C. carvi</italic> acts as a bioenhancer and modifies the kinetics of antitubercular drugs favorably. This increase in the absorption of antitubercular drugs by <italic>C. carvi</italic> extract could be possibly attributed to the enhancement of mucosal to serosal permeation. Another factor responsible for this action of <italic>C. carvi</italic> extract could be the modification of permeation characteristics of the intestine. Besides, a possible reason could be its influence on the P-glycoprotein.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Moreover, there have been encouraging results on the use of this extract in animals.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These probable mechanisms could explain the beneficial effects of <italic>C. carvi</italic> on the kinetics of antitubercular drugs as revealed in our current study.</p><p>The outcome of the present study can be of immense clinical utility while managing patients of tuberculosis. There exists a possibility of developing a reformulated low-dose FDC regimen comprising these drugs. The use of herbal bioenhancer will be immensely useful in formulating dosage regimens for antitubercular drugs, which cause high toxicity on long-term use. Because ours is a preliminary study, which has been done in healthy volunteers, the results need to be carefully extrapolated in the context of patients of tuberculosis. Moreover, the present trial is a single-dose study and because tuberculosis patients require treatment for a long term, it remains to be seen how this bioenhancer behaves in these situations. Therefore, further research is suggested to see the bioavailability effects of <italic>C. carvi</italic> on antitubercular drugs in patients of tuberculosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study has shown that <italic>C. carvi</italic> acts as a bioenhancer and modifies the kinetics of antitubercular drugs favorably.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We are grateful to Dr. G.N.
