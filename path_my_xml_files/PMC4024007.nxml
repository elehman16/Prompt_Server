The descriptors used to describe PA intensity, &#x0201c;sedentary,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;light,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;moderate&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;vigorous&#x0201d; are not just used in PA guidelines but they are also used to classify relative exercise intensities using %HRmax. It is unclear if these common descriptors align with the %HRmax ranges used in the literature consistently between sexes, ethnicities, age categories and across body mass index (BMI; kg/m<sup>2</sup>) classifications. This information may be critical for public health officials in order to properly frame messages regarding PA participation for all populations. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to determine whether individuals understand the commonly used PA intensity descriptors in PA guidelines and properly self-select light, moderate and vigorous intensity PA. The second objective is to determine if there are differences in the understanding of PA intensity descriptors by age, sex, ethnicity or BMI class.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation in the study and all procedures were approved and conducted in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the York University Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants aged 18&#x02013;64 were recruited from York University between September 2009 and December 2012.

Participants accurately estimated light effort PA and underestimated moderate and vigorous effort PA, and there appear to be no differences by sex, ethnicity or across BMI classifications in the understanding of the commonly used PA intensity descriptors. However, middle-aged individuals appear to have a better understanding of moderate and vigorous intensity than younger individuals. Therefore, the current subjective PA intensity descriptions may need to be enhanced in order to align with the associated relative PA intensities using %HRmax.</p><p>Previous research suggests that even inexperienced adults correctly identify moderate intensity walking when information related to speed of walking and heart rate is linked to how their body feels when exercising <xref rid="pone.0097927-Braham1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Spelman et al (1993) <xref rid="pone.0097927-Spelman1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> also suggest that the self-selected exercise intensity of habitual exercise walkers approximates moderate intensity and meets the minimum American College of Sports Medicine recommendation for improving aerobic fitness. The findings from this current study suggest that the current descriptors commonly used to describe PA intensity in many PA guidelines, lead to the underestimation of moderate and vigorous effort PA, and underestimate the PA intensity required to achieve minimum health benefits. These differences may reflect secular changes in the understanding of the PA intensity terms or simply differences in study cohorts. Thus, future studies are needed to verify these findings. This is extremely important given the efforts to harmonize different expressions of relative intensities for aerobic physical activity participation <xref rid="pone.0097927-Jamnik1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The descriptors that describe PA intensity are not just used in PA guidelines but they are also used to classify relative exercise intensities using %HRmax. However, much of the research literature suggests that using individuals&#x02019; peak HRs from maximal exercise tests to prescribe exercise is more accurate than using the age-predicted maximum formula <xref rid="pone.0097927-Gellish1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0097927-Engels1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> as it takes into account individual differences in maximal HR <xref rid="pone.0097927-Whaley1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097927-American1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. However, incremental to maximum exercise testing is expensive and not readily accessible. Thus, the majority of individuals will need to rely on age predicted maximum formula of 220-age to calculate the proper PA intensity. This current study demonstrates that though statistically significant, the differences when using %HRpeak versus %HRmax were &#x02264;5%. This magnitude of difference has minimal clinical relevance, and thus, we suggest that %HRmax can adequately be used to identify PA intensities.</p><p>A wealth of evidence clearly demonstrates the benefits of participating in PA <xref rid="pone.0097927-Warburton1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097927-Public1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097927-Ready1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097927-World2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, however despite this research, the majority of Canadians are still physically inactive <xref rid="pone.0097927-Statistics1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0097927-Colley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In a recent publication with accelerometer data from Canada&#x02019;s Health Measures Survey, only 15% of Canadians are participating in 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per week in 10 minute bouts and only 53% of Canadians participate in 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA at least one day per week <xref rid="pone.0097927-Colley1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, meaning that the majority of Canadians are not active enough for minimum health benefits. However, if individuals are overestimating the intensity of PA that they are engaging in, the problem of physical activity may in fact be even larger.</p><p>Health Canada first published the CPAG in 1998 as a national initiative to help Canadians become physically active and incorporate PA as a part of their lifestyle <xref rid="pone.0097927-Health1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. To align with the changes in the global PA guidelines, updated evidence-informed PA guidelines were released in early 2011 by the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology and the Public Health Agency of Canada. These guidelines revised the recommendation for achieving minimum health benefits in Canadians aged 18&#x02013;64 years from 30 to 60 minutes of moderate effort PA or 20 to 30 minutes of vigorous effort PA on all or most days of the week to 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic PA per week, in bouts of 10 minutes or more <xref rid="pone.0097927-Canadian1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. To describe intensity of PA, the revised guidelines use the same descriptors and corresponding objective physiological values of intensity defined by specific ranges of %HRmax. The commonly used PA intensity descriptors in the guidelines appear to be sufficient for explaining light intensity, but do not appear optimal for relaying the correct intended physiological intensity for moderate and vigorous PA intensities. It is unclear currently how these differences in understanding might influence physical activity participation, but may lead individuals to mistakenly interpret that they are sufficiently active to achieve health benefits.</p><p>Several limitations must be taken into account. Despite having a large age range, a large proportion of participants in this study were younger with the median age being 20 years old. Therefore, the results should be verified in older populations. Further, we are unaware if unknown differences in the populations recruited may have altered the observations seen here. Secondly, we asked participants to walk at a speed they thought would provide health benefits, however we are unable to know whether these individuals can exercise at this pace for sufficiently long periods of time to obtain the desired health benefits. Third, it is unknown if our participants would use the PA intensity descriptors in the CPAG similarly when using other types of exercise equipment such as a bike or elliptical or even non-treadmill walking. Lastly, this study was initiated prior to the release of the revised 2011 CPAG, and although the same PA intensity descriptors were used, the framing and context of the revised guidelines may alter how these descriptors are interpreted. In addition, it is unclear as to whether the underestimation of moderate and vigorous intensity PA are as a result of the poor cardiovascular fitness and may be lack of exercise experience observed in our sample. Future studies should assess intensity estimation in samples with greater fitness to confirm our findings.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first study to determine that adults of different sexes, ethnicities and BMI classifications underestimate moderate and vigorous intensity PA, and underestimate the PA intensity recommended for health. Given the difficulties in understanding moderate and vigorous effort PA, new subjective descriptions for moderate and vigorous intensity may be warranted to aid individuals with the understanding of PA intensity.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0097927-Warburton1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
