Proton pump inhibitors inhibit the secretion of hydrogen ions in the stomach by inhibiting the (H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>)-ATPase enzyme (proton pump) at the secretory surface of the gastric parietal cell, resulting in potent inhibition of gastric acid secretion with prolonged elevation of intragastric pH. Both drugs are marketed in the United States for healing of and maintenance of healed erosive esophagitis and treatment of heartburn associated with symptomatic, nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease.</p><p>One of the limitations to the use of proton pump inhibitors on a once-daily basis has been incomplete acid suppression over the 24-hour postdose interval.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ceg-4-213">1</xref> Dexlansoprazole modified-release is a formulation that uses an innovative dual delayed-release (DDR&#x02122;) delivery system. DDR technology is designed to provide an initial drug release in the proximal small intestine followed by another drug release at more distal regions of the small intestine several hours later.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ceg-4-213">2</xref> As a result, dexlansoprazole modified-release produces a plasma concentration-time profile with two distinct peaks, whereby the first peak occurs 1&#x02013;2 hours after administration, followed by a second peak at 4&#x02013;5 hours postdose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ceg-4-213">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ceg-4-213">4</xref> Esomeprazole is a delayed-release formulation with single-release characteristics that produces maximum plasma concentrations at approximately 1.6 hours postdose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ceg-4-213">5</xref> Dexlansoprazole modified-release may be taken without regard to meals.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ceg-4-213">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ceg-4-213">6</xref> In comparison, esomeprazole is recommended to be taken at least one hour before a meal to achieve maximal efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ceg-4-213">5</xref></p><p>The pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, and safety profiles of various proton pump inhibitors following administration in humans have been extensively studied.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ceg-4-213">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ceg-4-213">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-ceg-4-213">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-ceg-4-213">11</xref> However, this is the first clinical study reported in the literature as a head-to-head comparison of the pharmacodynamics of dexlansoprazole modified-release and esomeprazole after a single dose. Because the study population consisted of healthy adult subjects, no efficacy endpoints were evaluated in this study. Comparison of the single-dose pharmacodynamics of dexlansoprazole modified-release and esomeprazole in a well controlled crossover study adds to the knowledge base for proton pump inhibitors without having to compare across studies. It is known from the literature that these two proton pump inhibitors have pharmacokinetic differences. Esomeprazole exhibits a dose-dependent and time-dependent pharmacokinetic profile that results in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in bioavailability at steady state and increased pharmacodynamic effects after five days of once-daily dosing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ceg-4-213">12</xref> The pharmacokinetics of dexlansoprazole modified-release are time-independent and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles after five days of once-daily dosing are similar (less than 10% difference) to those observed after a single dose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ceg-4-213">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ceg-4-213">4</xref></p><p>The objective of the current trial was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of single doses of dexlansoprazole modified-release 60 mg and esomeprazole 40 mg on 24-hour intragastric pH in healthy subjects. The dosage strengths chosen for this study were the highest approved for healing of erosive esophagitis (60 mg for dexlansoprazole modified-release and 40 mg for esomeprazole).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The institutional review board (IntegReview, Austin, TX) reviewed and approved the study protocol, protocol amendment 1, and the informed consent form prior to enrollment of subjects; all subjects were enrolled under amendment 1.

Sexually active women and men agreed to use acceptable contraception for a period of time starting from signing of the informed consent throughout the duration of the study and for 30 days following the last dose of study drug.</p><p>Women who were pregnant or lactating, and any subjects with an uncontrolled, clinically significant disorder or abnormality which may have impacted the ability of a subject to participate in the study or potentially confound the study results were excluded as per the study exclusion criteria. In addition, subjects were excluded if they had a hypersensitivity to any component of dexlansoprazole modified-release, esomeprazole, or related compounds, had any significant findings from physical examination or clinical laboratory test results, had positive test results on urine screens for alcohol and drugs of abuse, a positive serum caffeine screen, a positive breath test for <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> at screening, or consumed any medication or foods contraindicated by the protocol.</p><p>Medication or dietary products including grapefruit or Seville oranges, nicotine-containing products, prescription medication (except for hormonal contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy, if on a stable dose for at least 90 days prior to day 1 of period 1), hepatic or renal clearance altering agents, over the counter medications, vitamin supplements, and alcohol or caffeine-containing products were excluded during the screening and treatment periods.

During each period, subjects were confined to the study site from day -1 until all study procedures were completed on day 2. A washout interval of at least seven days separated doses of study drugs in periods 1 and 2. This washout interval was considered sufficient because the half-lives are 1&#x02013;2 hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ceg-4-213">4</xref> and approximately 1.6 hours<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ceg-4-213">5</xref> for dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole, respectively, and it allowed intragastric pH to return to baseline levels between doses of study drugs.</p><p>On day 1 of each period, study drug was administered at approximately 8 am after an overnight fast of at least eight hours and followed by a 60-minute postdose fast. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and an evening snack were served at hours 1, 4, 9, and 12 postdose, respectively. During confinement in period 2, subjects received meals identical to those received by the confined subjects in period 1. Each meal was standardized to contain approximately 25% fat. Blood samples were collected at scheduled time points up to 24 hours postdose to quantify dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole plasma concentrations. Intragastric pH recording was performed for 24 hours beginning immediately prior to study drug administration on day 1 of each period. Subjects fasted overnight for at least eight hours prior to collection of blood and urine samples for safety laboratory tests on day 2 of each period.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamic assessments</title><p>On day -1 of period 1, a single-channel antimony probe attached to a Digitrapper<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> data recorder (Sierra Scientific Instruments, Los Angeles, CA) was inserted intranasally into the stomach to a distance of approximately 10 cm past the lower esophageal sphincter. This procedure verified that the subject could tolerate probe insertion and obtained the length of the probe insertion that was used on day 1 of periods 1 and 2. The unit for measurement of intragastric pH was calibrated with standard buffers (pH approximately 1 and 7) before each use. On day 1 of periods 1 and 2, intragastric pH was recorded every four seconds over the 24-hour postdose interval; however, median intragastric pH values over 15-minute intervals were determined and used for the calculation of pharmacodynamic parameters.</p><p>The primary pharmacodynamic parameters calculated for each treatment regimen over 24 hours postdose were percentage of time with intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4 (ie, percentage of time that the medians over 15-minute intervals had pH values &#x0003e; 4) and mean intragastric pH (ie, the average of the medians over 15-minute intervals). Secondary pharmacodynamic parameters were percentage of time with pH &#x0003e; 4 and mean intragastric pH calculated for the time intervals 0&#x02013;12 hours postdose and &#x0003e;12&#x02013;24 hours postdose.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetic assessments</title><p>Blood samples for the determination of dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole concentrations in plasma were collected into chilled Vacutainers<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> containing dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K<sub>2</sub>EDTA) according to the following schedule: baseline (within 30 minutes prior to day 1 dosing) and at hours 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 16, and 24 postdose. Plasma concentrations of dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole were determined by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry at PPD Development (Middleton, WI), with validated concentration ranges of 2.00&#x02013;2000 ng/mL for dexlansoprazole and 1.00&#x02013;1000 ng/mL for esomeprazole. Plasma concentrations below the lower limit of quantification were set to zero for calculation of mean plasma concentrations and derivation of individual subject pharmacokinetic parameters.</p><p>The following pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated for dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole plasma concentration data: area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUC<sub>t</sub>) and to infinity (AUC<sub>&#x0221e;</sub>); maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>); time to reach C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>); elimination half-life; oral clearance; and apparent volume of distribution. Pharmacokinetic parameters were derived using noncompartmental methods with WinNonlin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Enterprise, Version 5.2 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Actual sample times, rather than scheduled sampling times, were used in all pharmacokinetic computations involving sampling times.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of CYP2C19 metabolizer status</title><p>The cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 isozyme is a polymorphic enzyme that is involved in the metabolism of dexlansoprazole<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ceg-4-213">4</xref> and esomeprazole.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ceg-4-213">5</xref> One blood sample for DNA isolation was collected before dosing on day 1 of period 1 from each subject in the study into plastic K<sub>2</sub>EDTA spray-coated tubes and stored under frozen conditions. A portion of the DNA sample was analyzed for the presence of CYP2C19 allelic variants (Covance Central Laboratory, Indianapolis, IN). Genotyping and phenotyping analysis for CYP2C19 was performed for all subjects to determine CYP2C19 metabolizer status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 44 subjects, 22 subjects per sequence group, allowed for up to four dropouts (an approximate 9% dropout rate) and still provided at least 93% power to detect a 10% difference in the percentage of time with intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4 over 24 hours between the two treatment regimens. The sample size was calculated using 159.13 as the intrasubject variance for the percentage of time with intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4, which was estimated from a previous dexlansoprazole modified-release study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-ceg-4-213">6</xref> The power for detecting a difference of 0.5 in mean 24-hour pH between the two treatment regimens was expected to be greater than 95%.

Limitations to the use of proton pump inhibitors on a once-daily basis have been a delayed onset of action, incomplete acid suppression over the 24-hour postdose interval, and the need for ingestion before a meal to achieve maximal efficacy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-ceg-4-213">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ceg-4-213">3</xref> To date, attempts to overcome these issues have included the development of isomeric proton pump inhibitors with stereoselective metabolism (ie, dexlansoprazole [the <italic>R</italic>-enantiomer of lansoprazole] and esomeprazole [the <italic>S</italic>-enantiomer of omeprazole]) and alterations in drug delivery to prolong the inhibition of gastric acid secretion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-ceg-4-213">3</xref> The dexlansoprazole DDR technology is designed to provide an initial drug release in the proximal small intestine followed by another drug release at more distal regions of the small intestine several hours later. As a result, dexlansoprazole modified-release produces a dual-peaked pharmacokinetic profile that prolongs the plasma concentration-time profile of dexlansoprazole.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ceg-4-213">2</xref> Unlike esomeprazole, which should be taken one hour prior to a meal,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-ceg-4-213">5</xref> dexlansoprazole modified-release can be taken without regard to food.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-ceg-4-213">4</xref> The aim of this study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of single doses of dexlansoprazole modified-release 60 mg and esomeprazole 40 mg on 24-hour intragastric pH in healthy subjects. The dosage strengths chosen for this study were the highest approved for healing of erosive esophagitis (60 mg for dexlansoprazole modified-release and 40 mg for esomeprazole).</p><p>The measurement of intragastric pH is a well accepted method for the assessment of the pharmacodynamic effects of a proton pump inhibitor.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-ceg-4-213">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18-ceg-4-213">18</xref> The present study is the first head-to-head comparison of the pharmacodynamic effects for a 24-hour period following single doses of dexlansoprazole modified-release and esomeprazole in healthy subjects, utilizing doses that are recommended for healing of erosive esophagitis.</p><p>The results of this study indicate that the DDR formulation technology of dexlansoprazole modified-release leads to an extended duration of gastric acid control on day 1 compared with the delayed-release formulation of esomeprazole. After a morning dose of each study drug, the extended duration in pharmacodynamic activity after dexlansoprazole modified-release was demonstrated 0&#x02013;24 hours postdose, mainly due to the significant differences observed during the &#x0003e;12&#x02013;24 hours postdose interval relative to esomeprazole. The two proton pump inhibitors had comparable pharmacodynamic activity 0&#x02013;12 hours postdose.</p><p>Overall, the pharmacodynamic profiles in our study were similar to those observed in other published reports.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ceg-4-213">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-ceg-4-213">9</xref> The primary pharmacodynamic parameter, mean percentage of time with intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4 from time 0&#x02013;24 hours postdose, was 58% for dexlansoprazole versus 48% for esomeprazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-ceg-4-213">Figure 2</xref>). The literature reported that percentage of time with intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4 from time 0&#x02013;24 hours after the same doses were approximately 60% for dexlansoprazole modified-release<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-ceg-4-213">2</xref> and 54% and 52% for esomeprazole.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-ceg-4-213">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-ceg-4-213">12</xref></p><p>A strength of this study is its randomized, crossover design, with each subject acting as his/her own control. A limitation is the single-dose design, preventing extrapolation of the results to a multiple-dose regimen. The study population of healthy volunteers does not allow for assessment of clinical efficacy, and no clinical significance is intended or implied. Nevertheless, the comparison of two proton pump inhibitor enantiomers with different formulation characteristics is of pharmacological interest. Although there are extensive data available detailing the multiple-dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of proton pump inhibitors, this is the first clinical study reported in the literature to provide a comparison of the pharmacodynamics of dexlansoprazole modified-release and esomeprazole after a single dose in a well controlled crossover study.</p><p>In conclusion, a single dose of dexlansoprazole modified-release 60 mg provided statistically significantly greater pH control for the entire 24-hour postdose interval when compared with a single dose of esomeprazole 40 mg. This observed difference was mainly due to the statistically significant greater pH control from dexlansoprazole modified-release over the &#x0003e;12&#x02013;24-hour postdose interval as compared with esomeprazole. The two proton pump inhibitors had comparable pharmacodynamic activity at 0&#x02013;12 hours postdose.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge the contribution of the Jasper Clinic Inc.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>MK, CE, and SN are employees of Takeda Global Research &#x00026; Development Center Inc, Deerfield, IL.
