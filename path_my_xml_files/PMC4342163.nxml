In women with exercise associated menstrual disturbances (EAMD), a spectrum of clinical sequelae has been observed and includes low bone mineral density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], stress fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], disordered eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], altered vascular function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], reductions in resting energy expenditure (REE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and suppressed metabolic hormone concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Prospective exercise training studies show that low energy availability (EA) is causally related to menstrual disturbances in exercising females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], as increases in EA are associated with the reversal of menstrual disturbances when exercise training persists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>EA has been operationally defined as dietary energy intake (EI) minus exercise energy expenditure (EEE) normalized to kilograms of lean body mass (LBM) i.e., (EA&#x02009;=&#x02009;(EI-EEE)/kg LBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This variable represents the net input of energy to the body remaining after exercise training for all other metabolic processes such as reproduction, thermoregulation, cellular maintenance, locomotion, and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Conditions of low EA (&#x0003c;30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM) have been associated with reduced concentrations of metabolic hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], unfavorable alterations in bone markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and reductions in luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in previously sedentary women during short-term manipulations of EI and EEE in a controlled laboratory setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Although these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] define a critical EA threshold of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM for the initiation of reduced LH pulsatility, few investigators have examined whether an EA of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM discriminates normal ovarian function from either subtle (luteal phase defects or anovulation) or severe (oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea) menstrual disturbances in exercising women. Severe reductions in LH pulsatility have been observed in amenorrheic runners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Reductions in LH pulsatility have also been documented in exercising women with eumenorrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], anovulatory menstrual cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and oligomenorrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It is unclear if an EA of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM or lower is associated with a dose response relationship with menstrual disturbances of increasing severity progressing from luteal phase defects and anovulatory menstrual cycles to oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea. It seems reasonable to expect that more severe reductions in EA would result in a greater degree of reproductive suppression to prevent the investment of energy directed towards pregnancy and away from life sustaining processes. Along these lines, we have previously published that the degree of suppression of REE was a significant predictor of the degree of severity of menstrual disturbances associated with exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>To produce a defined level of EA, Loucks et al.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] controlled EI with a clinical dietary product (Ensure Plus, Ross Laboratories, Columbus, OH) and used indirect calorimetry to monitor the target level of EEE. These methods to estimate EI and EEE are not feasible or practical for most free living exercising women. In the few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] that have examined EA in free living exercising women, EA has been defined inconsistently (e.g. kcal/kg LBM, kcal/kg FFM, kcal/kg body weight) and measured using a variety of methods. Accelerometers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], indirect calorimeters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], heart rate monitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and physical activity logs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], most of which analyzed with the Ainsworth compendium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], have been used to estimate EEE. Likewise, a number of methods such as dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], air-displacement plethysmography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], bioelectrical impedance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and skin fold measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] have been used to estimate body composition. Most studies have used self-reported diet logs for various lengths of time to estimate EI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Due to the small sample sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and inconsistencies in the methods used in the above mentioned studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the role of low EA as a predictor of menstrual abnormalities remains unknown. Conventional methods available to most exercising women such as diet logs, exercise logs, and or heart rate monitors to estimate EA, defined as EI minus EEE relative to LBM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], should be used to test the role of EA in predicting menstrual status in a large sample of free living exercising women.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to examine whether EA when assessed with conventional methodologies i.e. self-reported diet logs, exercise logs, and heart rate monitoring discriminates both clinical and subclinical menstrual disturbances in ovarian function in premenopausal exercising women. We hypothesized the following: 1) when participants are grouped according to their clinical menstrual status, EA would distinguish the amenorrheic and eumenorrheic exercising women; 2) when participants&#x02019; menstrual status is characterized in more detail using hormonal measures, a significantly higher proportion of exercising women will have menstrual disturbances (amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, anovulation, or luteal phase defects) when their EA is below 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM when compared to the proportion of exercising women who will have menstrual disturbances when their EA is at or above 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM; and 3) below an EA of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM, menstrual cycle disturbances will progress in severity from luteal phase defects to anovulatory menstrual cycles to oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea as EA becomes incrementally lower. A secondary purpose was to compare EA values with laboratory measures of metabolic status such as REE and circulating TT<sub>3</sub> concentrations to determine whether EA measures discriminated menstrual status similarly when compared to more objective laboratory measures of adaptation to energy deficiency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experimental design</title><p>To assemble the largest data set possible, we combined data from two studies, one performed at the University of Toronto and one performed at The Pennsylvania State University. Both studies were designed to examine menstrual disturbances and alterations in energy balance in exercising premenopausal women and used very similar methodological approaches. The current study includes data from 91 exercising women in whom assessments of menstrual status and EA were performed. Measurements of the variables of interest, i.e., menstrual status, body composition, EI, EEE, and demographics were conducted by the same investigators at both sites using similar methods. The usefulness of EA (assessed with conventional methods) to discriminate menstrual status was compared to laboratory measures of energy status (fasting TT<sub>3</sub>, REE, and ratio of actual to predicted REE [REE/pREE]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Ninety-one participants were recruited by fliers posted on campus and in the surrounding community, newspaper advertisements, and classroom announcements targeting exercising women for a study on women&#x02019;s health.

Height and weight were measured, and participants completed questionnaires to assess demographics, medical history, exercise history, menstrual history, eating behaviors, bone health, and mental health. A physical exam was performed on all participants by an on-site clinician to determine overall health and check for physical symptoms of PCOS such as acne or hirsutism. In most participants a fasting blood draw was analyzed for a complete blood count (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;57), basic chemistry panel (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;35), and an endocrine panel (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;59). The latter included measures of LH, follicle stimulating hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, thyroxine, prolactin, dihydroepiandrosterone (Quest Diagnostics, Pittsburgh, PA), total testosterone, and SHBG to rule out illness or endocrine or metabolic disease for most participants. Participants met with a General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) registered dietitian or trained laboratory personnel to receive instructions for completion of 3-day diet logs (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day). Additionally, DXA scans were performed to assess body composition.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Aerobic capacity</title><p>Peak aerobic capacity (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) was measured on a treadmill by indirect calorimetry using an on-line MedGraphics Modular VO<sub>2</sub> System (St Paul, MN) or SensorMedics Vmax metabolic cart (Yorba Linda, Calif., USA) during the study period using methods that have previously been published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Resting energy expenditure</title><p>REE was measured on a single occasion during the study period for all participants.

Body composition, including percent body fat, fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), and LBM was analyzed by a certified technician using DXA on one of three machines. The majority of participants were scanned on either a GE Lunar Prodigy DXA scanner (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;57) (GE Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, enCORE 2002 software, version 6.50.069) or a GE Lunar iDXA scanner (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;26) (General Electric Lunar Corporation, Madison, WI, enCORE 2008 software version 12.10.113). Remaining participants were scanned on a Hologic QDR4500 DXA scanner (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) (Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA). Consistent with the International Society of Clinical Densitometry guidelines, cross calibration studies were performed to remove systematic bias between the systems. For the cross calibration study between the Lunar Prodigy and Lunar iDXA, fourteen participants were scanned in triplicate on both machines.

The eumenorrheic group was further divided according to detailed characterizations of ovulatory status i.e., based on &#x0201c;subclinical&#x0201d; menstrual status as follows: a) exercising ovulatory (ExOv, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20): consistently ovulatory cycles for the duration of the 1&#x02013;3 menstrual cycle collection period, b) exercising with inconsistent presentations of subtle menstrual disturbances (ExIncon, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13): various inconsistent combinations of ovulatory, luteal phase defects, and anovulatory cycles from cycle to cycle for the duration of the 1&#x02013;3 menstrual cycle collection period, and c) exercising anovulatory (ExAnov, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8): consistently anovulatory menstrual cycles for the duration of the 1&#x02013;3 menstrual cycle collection period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Dietary energy intake</title><p>Measures of EI were calculated from 3-day diet logs completed during the study period. Participants were provided with a food scale (ECKO Kitchen Scale) and/or food amounts packet. The packet contained diagrams illustrating container sizes, cuts of meat, and various circles and squares which are typically used when estimating portion size for foods. Participants were encouraged to use these scaled diagrams as a guide for describing dimensions and sizes. Also, included in the packet was a sample page of an accurately completed diet record provided as a reference. Participants were asked to record all foods and beverages consumed on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day. EI was assessed for 3&#x000a0;days instead of 7 as a shorter 3-day diet log has been shown to reduce participant burden and improve compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. All 3&#x000a0;days of the diet logs were used. Registered dietitians and/or trained laboratory personnel instructed each participant on how to record EI and then later reviewed diet logs with participants for completeness and accuracy. The nutrient data from the 3-day diet logs were coded and analyzed using Nutritionist Pro (Version 3.1, Axxya Systems, Stafford, TX) or the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR 2008 Version; University of Minnesota; Minneapolis, MN).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Exercise energy expenditure</title><p>Participants completed exercise logs where all purposeful exercise sessions greater than 10&#x000a0;minutes in duration with a heart rate above 90 beats per minute were recorded for a 7&#x000a0;day period. The 7-day exercise logs were completed the same week as the 3-day diet logs, and all 7&#x000a0;days of the exercise logs were used. Purposeful exercise included activities such as elliptical, running, or strength training, but not daily living activities such as house cleaning or walking a dog. Participants were asked to wear a Polar S610 or RS400 heart rate monitor during all of their purposeful exercise sessions during the 7&#x000a0;day period. Energy expended during these purposeful exercise sessions was measured using the OwnCal feature of the Polar S610 or RS400 heart rate monitors (Polar Electro Oy, Kempele, Finland) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The OwnCal feature has been validated for calculating EEE from heart rate in University age females running, cycling, and rowing at various submaximal intensities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This feature uses body weight, height, age, gender, VO<sub>2peak</sub>, individual maximum heart rate (obtained from VO<sub>2peak</sub> test or calculated using 220-age), individual heart rate in a sitting position, and heart rate during exercise to derive kilocalories from energy expenditure. Actual VO<sub>2peak</sub> values were input into the heart rate monitors to compute EEE. The Polar S601 and RS400 hear rate monitors include rest in their estimation of energy expenditure. To estimate only EEE, we subtracted measured REE (kilocalories/min) from the Polar heart rate monitors estimation of energy expenditure. For the few (&#x0003c;20%) purposeful exercise sessions in which participants did not wear the heart rate monitors, the Ainsworth et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] compendiums of physical activities were used to determine the appropriate metabolic equivalent (MET) level for the exercise performed. To calculate the energy expended during the exercise session, the MET level was multiplied by the duration (min) of the exercise session. The MET value includes a resting component. To estimate only EEE, we therefore subtracted measured REE (kilocalories/min) from this value. Determination of MET levels from exercise logs from both experimental sites was made by the same member of the research team.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Energy availability</title><p>EA was operationally defined as EI minus EEE normalized to kilograms of LBM (EA&#x02009;=&#x02009;(EI&#x02013;EEE)/LBM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and calculated using the data described above for EI, EEE, and LBM. We calculated EA using the averages of each participant&#x02019;s values for EI, EEE on workout days only, and the LBM from the DXA scan. EEE represents only those calories attributable to exercise in that the estimate of the calories expended for REE throughout the duration of purposeful exercise sessions was subtracted from the estimate of EEE using the Polar heart rate monitors and or physical activity logs.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Urinary hormone measurements</title><p>All urine samples were corrected for specific gravity using a hand refractometer (NSG Precision Cells) to account for hydration status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] which has been reported to perform as well as creatinine correction for adjusting urinary hormone concentrations.

Urinary LH was measured in samples during the ovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle as determined by visual confirmation of a pre-ovulatory rise in E1G followed by a sustained increase in PdG. LH was determined using a coat-a-count immunoradiometric assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Deerfield, IL). The sensitivity of the LH assay was 0.15 mIU/ml and the intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation were 1.6% and 7.1%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Serum measurements</title><p>Blood was collected after an overnight fast before 1000&#x000a0;hr once during the study period.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] who demonstrated significant differences in EA in exercising women with subtle menstrual cycle disturbances (ovulatory vs. luteal phase defects), a sample size of 80 participants provides adequate power (1-&#x003b2;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.80) to detect significant differences in EA among menstrual groups. All variables were tested for outliers and normality using box plot analyses and Kolmogorov-Smirnova tests of normality, respectively. Extreme outliers represented a value more than 3 times the inter-quartile range (Q3-Q1) from the upper (Q3) or lower (Q1) quartile. Data points identified as extreme outliers were removed from subsequent analyses: BMI (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), LBM (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3), VO<sub>2peak</sub> (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), EEE (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1) and TT<sub>3</sub> concentrations (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine differences in EA among subclinical menstrual groups (ExOv, ExIncon, ExAnov, ExOligo, ExAmen).

An EA of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM did not discriminate menstrual status such that the proportion of participants with at least one of the subclinical menstrual disturbances was not dependent on whether EA was above or below 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.557, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.456).

However, EA does discriminate clinical extremes, i.e., amenorrhea (no menses in past 90&#x000a0;days) from eumenorrhea (regular menstrual cycle intervals of 26&#x02013;35 days in length) in exercising women. The lower TT<sub>3</sub> concentrations and ratio of REE/pREE observed in our exercising women with amenorrhea corroborate that our participants were exhibiting adaptations to chronic energy deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. From a clinical perspective, this finding suggests that EA may be a meaningful measurement for exercising women to assess their energy status and consequently risk for the Female Athlete Triad such that substantial decreases in their EA values would be suggestive of a greater risk for severe clinical menstrual disturbances, a negative clinical condition of the Female Athlete Triad. Recommendations to monitor EA should however include the caveat that it requires recording of diet and exercise logs for several days or other technology to assess dietary intake and EEE kcals and knowledge of how to interpret EI, EEE and EA values. Moreover, these measurements need to be performed several times throughout the training season when athletes move in and out of training periodization. The latter issues reflect realistic challenges to incorporating EA measurements into an athlete&#x02019;s regimen.</p><p>Our findings contrast those of other investigators who have examined EA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or its components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] in exercising women. Schaal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] did not observe differences in EA between eumenorrheic and amenorrheic endurance trained athletes. Moreover, of investigators who examined the components of EA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], neither Myerson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], Wilmore et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], nor Laughlin and Yen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] observed significant differences in EI, EEE, or body composition between amenorrheic and eumenorrheic athletes. Differences in the type of participants studied (e.g. recreationally active females vs. female athletes) and whether weight restrictions exist (e.g. aesthetic vs. weight vs. endurance sports) as well as smaller sample sizes of these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] may account for the lack of observed differences in EA in association with menstrual status. In this study, we observed differences in EA between exercising women with eumenorrhea versus exercising women with amenorrhea when a larger sample of exercising women were included in the analyses (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;71). Inconsistencies in the calculation of EA and the variability in methods used to estimate the components of EA and or the characterization of menstrual status may also contribute to conflicting findings.</p><p>The current study is the first to test the concept that an EA threshold of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM discriminates menstrual status when EA is assessed with self-reported diet logs, exercise logs and heart rate monitoring in a large group of exercising women studied under free living conditions. Additionally, this study is the first to examine whether menstrual cycle disturbances progress in severity from luteal phase defects to anovulatory menstrual cycles to oligomenorrhea, and amenorrhea as EA becomes incrementally lower below an EA of 30 kcal/kg LBM. We did not observe a threshold of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM below which EAMD occurred or any association between severity of menstrual disturbances and EA. Indeed, participants with an EA below 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM exhibited the entire spectrum of menstrual disturbances i.e., inconsistent combinations of ovulatory, luteal phase defects, and anovulatory menstrual cycle (14%) as well as oligomenorrhea (17%) and amenorrhea (52%). The observation that all types of EAMD were observed below 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg/LBM may indicate that there is not a clear association between the magnitude of disruption in LH pulsatility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and menstrual disturbances, or that the association between a threshold of EA and menstrual disturbances might manifest over longer time periods of exposure to given levels of EA. Since our study captured only a relatively short sampling period (up to three menstrual cycles or monitoring period), it is possible that a longer time period of observation would have revealed a stronger association between EA and specific types of menstrual disturbances.</p><p>In a short term study manipulating EI and EEE which led to significant disruptions in LH pulsatility below an EA of 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM, Loucks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] used a clinical dietary product (Ensure, Ross Laboratories, Columbus, OH) to control EI and indirect calorimetry to assess EEE. Conversely in the current study, we assessed EI and EEE using more conventional methods for exercising women. Namely, self-reported diet logs, exercise logs, and heart rate monitoring were used to assess EA. Several studies have shown inaccuracies when measuring EI with self-reported diet logs, particularly related to under reporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and EEE with self-reported exercise logs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Heart rate monitoring has been shown to estimate total EEE within &#x02212;4.0% to 11.4% in females when compared to doubly labeled water which is the gold standard for measuring energy expenditure in free living conditions. Although heart rate monitoring provides an objective assessment of EEE, participants must be compliant and wear the monitors for the duration of all their exercise training sessions. It is therefore possible that the inaccuracies associated with self-reported diet logs, exercise logs, and heart rate monitoring in assessing EI and EEE may have contributed to the lack of observed differences in EA among our exercising women with varying menstrual status (ovulatory vs. EAMD). Alternatively, factors such as psychological stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] or hyperandrogenemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] may also account for a proportion of the observed EAMD and this could thus weaken any suspected association between EA and menstrual disturbances. However, differences in EA were observed among participants with eumenorrheic and amenorrheic menstrual cycles suggesting that the conventional methods used in the current study to assess EA are able to discriminate more clinically extreme categories of menstrual status.</p><p>We observed lower EA values on average in our exercising women in comparison to those reported in the literature for sedentary women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These lower values may be attributable to under eating relative to energy expenditure. Findings from studies examining the coupling between food intake and EEE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] suggest that exercise may be linked with inadvertent under eating and low EI. The lack of an increase in food intake in response to an acute exercise-induced energy expenditure i.e. "inadequate compensation" has been observed in obese and non-obese men and women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The above studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] suggest that inadvertent dietary compensation to match EEE may have contributed to the lower overall mean EA (35&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM) observed in our exercising women when compared to the EA values we calculated from the reported EI, EEE, and body composition of the sedentary women of Myerson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (39&#x000a0;kcal/kg FFM) and Laughlin and Yen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] (38&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM). Regarding the relation between energy intake and exercise in our own data, we found that as EEE increased, EA decreased (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.245, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.020). This may suggest that inadequate dietary compensation increases as the volume of exercise increases.</p><p>Although our exercising women exhibited a lower overall mean EA than sedentary women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], our mean EA values (31&#x02013;40&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM)) are higher than other studies of exercising women. For example, using EI, training mileage, and fat free mass from several studies of female amenorrheic runners, Loucks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] estimated EA values ranging from 12 to 29&#x000a0;kcal/kg FFM in female athletes. Schaal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and Reed et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] observed EA values below 30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM in exercising women with amenorrhea, albeit in a much smaller sample of athletes than our investigation. Lastly, using reported EI, EEE, and FFM, we estimated an EA value of 28&#x000a0;kcal/kg FFM for the amenorrheic runners of Myerson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Since we observed a negative relationship between EA and EEE, suggestive of the presence of an uncoupling mechanism between EI and EEE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], it is possible that inadequate EI compensation to match lower EEE resulted in higher EA values (&#x0003e;30&#x000a0;kcal/kg LBM) when compared to other studies where the training volume of the participants and thus EEE was higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] than in our exercising women. Using this rationale, the higher mean EEE of Schaal et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] (1300&#x000a0;kcal/d) and Myerson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] (537&#x000a0;kcal/d) would explain the lower EA these investigators reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] also observed negative eating attitudes including high body shape concerns and total eating disorder scores in their female athletes. Aberrant eating attitudes have been shown to predispose women to consume less EI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is therefore also possible that higher EEE in combination with negative eating attitudes might have contributed to the lower EA values documented in these amenorrheic exercising women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Limitations of this study include the fact that EI and some EEE was collected using self-report 3-day diet and 7-day exercise logs. Several studies have shown inaccuracies when measuring EI using self-reported food records, particularly related to underreporting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Further, 3-day diet logs may not provide the best indication of typical EI in exercising women as their dietary intakes may change with their weekly training routine. We did not eliminate possible under reporters in the current study as: a gold standard for accounting for under reporters does not exist; other prior publications examining EA in exercising females have not employed a cut off method to eliminate under reporters from analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]; a cut off for under reporting does not identify over reporters; and, under reporting can also be a result of intentional caloric restriction. However, all of the participants were trained by on-site registered dietitians on how to accurately record food intake. The EA values reported in this study were normalized to kilograms of LBM. EA values normalized to kilograms of LBM may be slightly greater than if normalized to kilograms of FFM. The units of reference should be considered when comparing findings regarding the association between EA and menstrual status. An important feature of this study is that the data analyzed likely represent the largest dataset available in exercising women to date where menstrual disturbances have been confirmed with measurements of estrogen, progesterone, and luteinizing hormone metabolites from daily urine samples.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study was the first to show that EA, defined as EI minus EEE normalized to kilogram of LBM, did not discriminate subclinical menstrual status in a large sample of trained, exercising women with varying menstrual cycles, but did discriminate amenorrhea from menstrual cycles with regular bleeding intervals when using conventional methods i.e., self-reported diet logs, exercise logs, and heart rate monitoring to asses EA. Lower TT<sub>3</sub> concentrations and ratio of REE/pREE were observed in our exercising amenorrheic women indicating that our participants likely were exhibiting adaptations to chronic energy deficiency. We propose that substantial decreases in EA calculated using the above methods may be a useful index for exercising women to monitor their risk for amenorrhea, but not less severe or subtle menstrual disturbances. Future studies should focus on identifying ways to improve field measures of EI and EEE. More precise techniques to measure these components over longer time periods may improve the ability of EA in discriminating subclinical menstrual disturbances and those at risk for the Female Athlete Triad.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EA</term><def><p>Energy availability</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EEE</term><def><p>Exercise energy expenditure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>E1G</term><def><p>Estrone-1-glucoronide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ExAmen</term><def><p>Exercising amenorrhea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ExAnov</term><def><p>Exercising anovulatory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ExEumen</term><def><p>Exercising eumenorrhea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ExIncon</term><def><p>Exercising inconsistent menstrual cycles</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ExOligo</term><def><p>Exercising oligomenorrhea</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ExOv</term><def><p>Exercising ovulatory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EI</term><def><p>Dietary energy intake</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFM</term><def><p>Fat free mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBM</term><def><p>Lean body mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LH</term><def><p>Luteinizing hormone</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MET</term><def><p>Metabolic equivalents</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PdG</term><def><p>Pregnanediol glucuronide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>REE</term><def><p>Resting energy expenditure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TT<sub>3</sub></term><def><p>Total triiodothyronine</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JLR conceived the study, design and methodology, and drafted and edited the manuscript.
