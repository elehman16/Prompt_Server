Within most developed countries, members of sporting clubs consume alcohol at levels above that of communities generally. Despite the potential benefits of interventions to address alcohol consumption in sporting clubs, there have been no randomised controlled trials to test the effectiveness of these interventions. The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a comprehensive accreditation intervention with community football clubs (Rugby League, Rugby Union, soccer/association football and Australian Rules football) in reducing excessive alcohol consumption by club members.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The study will be conducted in New South Wales, Australia, and employ a cluster randomised controlled trial design. Half of the football clubs recruited to the trial will be randomised to receive an intervention implemented over two and a half winter sporting seasons. The intervention is based on social ecology theory and is comprehensive in nature, containing multiple elements designed to decrease the supply of alcohol to intoxicated members, cease the provision of cheap and free alcohol, increase the availability and cost-attractiveness of non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic beverages, remove high alcohol drinks and cease drinking games. The intervention utilises a three-tiered accreditation framework designed to motivate intervention implementation. Football clubs in the control group will receive printed materials on topics unrelated to alcohol. Outcome data will be collected pre- and postintervention through cross-sectional telephone surveys of club members. The primary outcome measure will be alcohol consumption by club members at the club, assessed using a graduated frequency index and a seven day diary.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study was approved by The University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (reference: H-2008-0432). Study findings will be disseminated widely through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry: ACTRN12609000224224.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Article summary</title><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This article describes the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial of an intervention to reduce alcohol consumption at community sports clubs.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Excessive alcohol consumption is particularly prevalent among people involved in sports, particularly team and contact sports.</p></list-item><list-item><p>There are currently no existing controlled trials testing the effectiveness of interventions to reduce excessive alcohol consumption in the sporting club setting.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The findings from this study will provide a basis for further research and potentially important findings for both policy makers and those implementing health promotion programmes in sporting clubs.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The study has a strong design incorporating random allocation, blinding of data collection staff and the use of dual, validated outcome measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The intervention is multifaceted and comprehensive, based on a strong theoretical framework (social ecology) and past research evidence.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alcohol consumption is causally linked with more than 60 types of injury and chronic disease,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> contributing to 3.2% of deaths and 4.0% of disability-adjusted life years worldwide.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> In 2007, 20% of Australian adults reported regular consumption of alcohol at risky levels (seven drinks for males; five drinks for females).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> Excessive alcohol consumption appears to be particularly prevalent among young, male sportspeople,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4 b5 b6">4&#x02013;6</xref> and those involved in team and contact sports, such as Rugby League, Rugby Union, soccer/association football and Australian Rules football (AFL).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref></p><p>Interventions implemented in community sports clubs represent one potential means of reducing excessive alcohol consumption by members of sporting clubs generally, and football clubs in particular.

To generate a population of clubs in the study region, lists of community football clubs and contact persons will be obtained from relevant local councils and the peak association for each football code. These lists will be supplemented with clubs identified through telephone directories and web searches.</p><p>Procedures for recruiting clubs to the study will be based on strategies previously found to maximise research participation, including prenotification of the study and opportunity to participate, direct telephone contact with participants to invite participation, multiple contact attempts, access to research staff for further clarification regarding participation and the use of dedicated research staff to manage the recruitment process.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17 b18 b19">17&#x02013;19</xref> Specifically, a club contact person (club president or other nominated contact such as a club secretary) from each eligible club will be sent a letter inviting their club to participate in the study. Two weeks following the distribution of letters, the contacts of all identified clubs will be telephoned to confirm eligibility based on the above-mentioned criteria and to assess interest in participating in the study. If club representatives do not recall receiving the information letter, address details will be clarified, and additional information letters will be sent. Follow-up phone calls will be made until the club representative is able to make an informed decision regarding their club's participation in the trial. It is envisaged that in some cases this decision will need to be made in consultation with the club's management committee. Research staff will attend such meetings if required. Following the completion of this process, all consenting clubs will be sent a confirmation letter thanking them for agreeing to participate in the trial.

More recently, unpublished data have suggested an inverse association between participation in the programme and prevalence of risky drinking (Rowland, Allen and Toumbourou, 2011) and drink driving among club members (Rowland, Toumbourou and Allen, 2011). Specifically, clubs not participating in the programme were found to have significantly greater levels of risky drinking among club members compared with clubs accredited with the programme (at Level 2 and Level 3).</p><p>Based on such formative research and parallel evidence from interventions targeting excessive alcohol consumption in other licensed premises such as hotels,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26 b27 b28 b29 b30 b31 b32">26&#x02013;32</xref> an expert advisory group consisting of experienced alcohol researchers, health promotion practitioners and programme staff developed the intervention to be tested in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention content</title><p>The intervention will apply social ecology theory by targeting the physical availability of alcohol through: restrictions on the types of alcoholic beverages sold (no ready to drink products above 5% alcohol/volume, no shots and no double nips of alcohol); mandatory inclusion of relatively inexpensive low-alcohol and non-alcohol beverages (priced lower than full strength alcohol options),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> prohibiting the sale of alcohol to intoxicated persons; and prohibiting the sale of alcohol by bar servers who have been consuming alcohol. The intervention will also include environmental supports including signage on liquor laws and standard drink measures, and the provision of free water and substantial food when alcohol is sold. The presence of the licensee will be required at all times alcohol is sold. The intervention will target the social and cultural environment of the football club by: prohibiting drinking games and promotions including cheap or discounted drinks,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> alcohol-only awards or prizes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> and all-you-can-drink functions; introducing a club-based alcohol policy; and routine patrolling of sporting club grounds to monitor and inform spectators of expectations regarding alcohol use and consumption at the venue.

Testing and piloting of these questions will be undertaken as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall data management</title><p>Data management will be primarily the responsibility of a Hunter New England Population Health statistician, otherwise independent of the research team and trial activities. Management of trial data will be in accordance with a data-management protocol, which has been developed and approved by the Project Advisory Group. This protocol details requirements regarding data entry, data cleaning, data backup, secure storage and transport, and analysis. As a requirement of ethics approval granted by The University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC), all data collected for the trial will be securely stored, accessible only to primary researchers and statisticians through the allocation of access rights. Confidential participant data including contact details (eg, phone numbers) will be stored in a secure data set that is not linked to survey response data sets. An independent statistician will be the only person with access to confidential participant data.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measures</title><sec><title>Primary outcome measure: alcohol consumption behaviour at the club</title><p>Alcohol consumption of club members at the club will be assessed using a graduated frequency index<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> and a 7-day diary.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> Using the graduated frequency index, members will be asked how often they have consumed: 20 or more; 11&#x02013;19; 7&#x02013;10; 5&#x02013;6; 3&#x02013;4; and 1&#x02013;2 standard drinks of alcohol at their club over the past 3&#x02005;months. They will be asked to report whether the frequency of this consumption was: everyday; 5&#x02013;6&#x02005;days a week; 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;days a week; 1&#x02013;2&#x02005;days a week; 2&#x02013;3&#x02005;days a month; about 1&#x02005;day a month; less often; or never. Consumption of five or more drinks about 1&#x02005;day a month or more often will be used to define risky drinking that places members at risk of immediate harm.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> Using the 7-day diary, members will be asked how many standard drinks of alcohol they consumed at their club each day for the last 7&#x02005;days. The average number of drinks consumed by club members at the club during a weekend day (Saturday or Sunday) will be calculated. These dual primary outcome measures will be used to account for limitations inherent in each measure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Intervention-implementation measures</title><p>Intervention-implementation measures will be based on the accreditation criteria and include: the club's liquor licence status (yes/no) and type<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>; existence of a written alcohol-management policy (yes/no); alcohol-related sponsorship of the club (yes/no); sponsorship through free/discounted alcohol (yes/no); proportion of staff trained in responsible service of alcohol (all/most/some/none); how often staff consume alcohol on duty (never/rarely/sometimes/usually/always); availability of non-alcoholic and low-alcoholic drinks (yes/no); relative pricing of low-alcohol and full-strength alcohol drinks (low-alcohol more expensive/priced the same/full-strength alcohol more expensive); availability of substantial food when alcohol is sold (snacks/light meals/full meals); existence of alcohol promotions: happy hour, all you can drink, discounted drinks, alcohol awards/prizes and drinking vouchers (all yes/no); and how often alcohol is served to intoxicated people at the club and how often intoxicated people are admitted to the club (never/rarely/sometimes/frequently/always).</p></sec><sec><title>Process measures</title><p>Programme acceptability will be measured through a series of question regarding the acceptability of intervention content (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">box 1</xref>) and intervention-implementation strategies (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">box 2</xref>), with participants asked to respond to statements on a four-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02018;strongly agree&#x02019; to &#x02018;strongly disagree.&#x02019;</p></sec><sec><title>Measures of club characteristics</title><p>The following data will be collected about participating sporting clubs: club size (number of players and members), football code and postcode of sporting club.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size and power calculations</title><p>Data previously collected indicate that the average number of drinks consumed by members of a sporting club on a weekend day is 4.7 (SD: 4.2), and the prevalence of at-risk alcohol consumption is approximately 27%. Based on these figures and allowing for intraclass correlations of 0.08 and 0.18, respectively, 35 clubs per experimental group and 19 members per club will provide the study with 80% power to detect a 13% difference in the prevalence of at-risk consumption, and 35 clubs per experimental group and seven members per club will provide the study with 80% power to detect a difference of 1.3 standard drinks in the average number of drinks consumed by members at the club on a weekend day.</p></sec><sec><title>Random allocation and blinding</title><p>Following the completion of pre test data collection from all club members, football clubs will be randomly allocated to intervention or control groups using simple randomisation in a 1:1 ratio. Allocation will be undertaken centrally by an independent statistician using a computerised random number generator in Microsoft Excel. The statistician involved in this randomisation procedure will neither have access to club pre test data nor be involved in intervention implementation or post-test data collection. The random allocation of clubs will be stratified by football code and geographic area, as evidence suggests that alcohol consumption of club members is associated with these characteristics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> Interview staff involved in collecting survey data postintervention will be blind to the treatment status of the club and not involved in any other aspect of the trial. To assess the effectiveness of blinding, interview staff will be asked to nominate the group allocation of participants following collection of postintervention data. Owing to the difficulty in blinding clubs to group allocation, this will be an open trial with club representatives told of the treatment status of their club following pretest data collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis: primary outcome</title><p>SAS (V.9.2 or later) will be used for all statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics will be used to describe the demographic and practice characteristics of intervention and control group clubs and their members and to describe intervention implementation, process and acceptability.</p><p>To assess intervention efficacy, generalised estimating equations analysis will be used to examine between-group differences on the primary trial outcomes&#x02014;using a logistic regression model for the categorical risky drinking outcome and a Poisson regression model for the continuous average number of drinks outcome. The generalised estimating equations analysis will adjust for the correlation of outcomes between individuals within clubs. Additionally, such an analysis will be performed incorporating imputation, whereby pretest member data will be carried forward in instances where post-test data are missing for clubs.</p><p>The outcome in the model will be at-risk alcohol consumption or number of drinks consumed over a weekend day. The predictors will include group allocation, an indicator variable for pre- and post-test, and the interaction of group and the indicator variable. The p value from the interaction term will be used to determine if there is any statistically significant difference in the change in the outcome over the treatment period. The &#x003b1; value for significance testing will be 0.05.</p><p>As a secondary exploratory analysis, both a per-protocol and subgroup analyses will be performed. A per-protocol analysis will be conducted excluding participants from clubs who had not implemented the intervention as specified in the protocol (did not achieve level 3 accreditation). Subgroup analyses will also be conducted by football-club code and for clubs located in urban (vs non-metropolitan) regions based on the values assigned to the club's postcode according to the Australian Standard Geographic Classification System.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> Subgroup analyses will be performed to determine if the intervention may be differentially effective based on clubs with these characteristics.</p><p>No interim analyses of the data are planned.</p></sec><sec><title>Research trial coordination</title><p>A Project Advisory Group has been formed to oversee the conduct of the trial. This group is chaired by one of the chief Investigators of the grant, an employee of The University of Newcastle. The group includes other representatives from The University of Newcastle, as well as Hunter New England Population Health and the Australian Drug Foundation, including investigators on the Australian Research Council grant.</p><p>A Project Implementation Team has also been formed to implement the trial in accordance with the trial protocol. This team consists of staff members of The University of Newcastle, Hunter New England Population Health and the Australian Drug Foundation. Project implementation is coordinated from offices of Hunter New England Population Health.</p><p>Data management is the responsibility of a Hunter New England Population Health statistician, otherwise independent of the research team and trial activities. Management of trial data is in accordance with a data-management protocol, developed and approved by the Project Advisory Group.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial discontinuation or modification</title><p>There are no predetermined criteria for discontinuing or modifying the trial. While unintended adverse events to trial participants, researchers or other community members are not anticipated, any such events will be forwarded to The University of Newcastle HREC in accordance with the conditions of ethics approval. Should the research team or HREC consider it appropriate, the trial protocol or procedures may be modified to prevent such harm.</p><p>Any protocol modification will be communicated through modification of the trial registration listed in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry and through publications disseminating trial results.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There is a clear absence of research evidence on the effectiveness of interventions to reduce excessive alcohol consumption in the sporting club setting. This will be the first randomised controlled trial to evaluate such an intervention in not just the community football club setting, but any sporting club setting. The study has a strong design that incorporates computerised random allocation, blinding of data-collection staff and the use of dual, validated outcome measures. In addition, the intervention is multifaceted and comprehensive, based on a strong theoretical framework and past research evidence involving both sporting clubs and licensed venues generally. The findings from this study will provide a basis for further research in the field and provide potentially important findings for both policy makers and those providing health-promotion programmes to community sporting groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d32e190" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2011-000328.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The research team acknowledges the support of the Hunter Medical Research Institute, and assistance provided by C Lecathelinais, A Sawyer and D Groombridge.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>To cite:</bold> Kingsland M, Wolfenden L, Rowland BC, <italic>et al</italic>.
