Patients could have had exposure to one previous tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor therapy. Primary endpoints were American College of Rheumatology 20% (ACR20) response at week 12 and modified Total Sharp Score change from baseline at week 24. Secondary endpoints included; Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) score, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, Leeds Enthesitis Index, Leeds Dactylitis Index, and Modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 409 patients randomised, 368 completed 24&#x02005;weeks of treatment.

Relevant improvements were also observed for ACR50 and ACR70. Statistically significant, and clinically relevant improvement in physical function, measured as a reduction in HAQ-DI scores, was demonstrated in the CZP groups, with response seen by week 2 and maintained up to week 24. The CZP loading dose may contribute to the observed fast response within the first 4&#x02005;weeks of treatment. CZP was effective with respect to improvements in the arthritis and physical function and also improved dactylitis and enthesitis, and demonstrated rapid improvements in skin involvement, measured by the PASI response. At week 24, improvements in nail disease were also observed.</p><p>The improvements in the signs and symptoms of PsA with CZP were comparable with other Phase 3 TNF inhibitor studies in PsA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>

As patients with primary failure to previous TNF inhibitor therapy were excluded from the trial, further investigation is necessary to determine treatment efficacy in this patient population. Although not a stratification factor, patients with and without concomitant DMARDs at baseline had similar baseline characteristics and experienced similar benefits from CZP; these results are similar to those observed with other TNF inhibitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref></p><p>Approximately 90% of patients completed 24&#x02005;weeks of therapy. The rate of serious infectious events was similar in this population to what has previously been reported in patients with RA treated with CZP. There was an increased incidence of liver test elevation, generally seen in patients treated in combination with DMARDs (data not shown). Two deaths were reported during the 24-week double-blind phase of this study; the causes were what would be expected in this population of patients, and both were considered to be unrelated to study medication by the investigators.</p><p>The limitations of this report include that it is the 24-week results of RAPID-PsA, and that the results from the ongoing long-term study will be needed to confirm the sustainability of these responses. Further, the relatively low average baseline PASI score in the PsA population may explain an apparent inconsistency between the results of this trial and those previously published for CZP in moderate to severe psoriasis, as patients with PASI &#x0003c;10 may have had limited scope for improvements in skin involvement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> The unusually high baseline PASI scores noted in five patients (range 50&#x02013;72), if not correct, may have been due to investigator or recording error. Regional variation in ACR20 response at week 12 in the placebo group may also limit the comparison of these results with previous trials in PsA; placebo rates in South America were substantially higher than rates observed in the other geographic areas and older trials which did not include South American patients. Thus, cross-treatment comparisons may underestimate the incremental efficacy of CZP. This variation had less impact on ACR50, ACR70 and ACR20 at other time points. The use of LOCF imputation for continuous variables also leads to potential bias, particularly for patients who withdraw early from the study.</p><p>In summary, the results of RAPID-PsA confirm that treatment with CZP is clinically effective in patients with PsA up to 24&#x02005;weeks, and that treatment with CZP resulted in rapid improvement in clinical signs and symptoms of PsA, including arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis and skin involvement. Treatment with CZP in this population revealed no new safety signals from those seen in the RA trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-203696-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1249" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Correction notice:</bold> This article has been corrected twice since it was published Online First.
