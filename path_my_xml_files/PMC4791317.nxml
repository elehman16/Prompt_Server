The PREFER study also demonstrated that the rotigotine-treated patients were more than twice as likely to be &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; when awakening as the placebo group.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Furthermore, rotigotine has been demonstrated to significantly improve early morning motor impairment and nocturnal sleep disturbances from baseline to EoM compared with placebo in the RECOVER study, a phase 3b study in patients with PD and early morning motor impairment.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This post hoc analysis extends these previous observations by demonstrating that rotigotine may be effective (ie, advantages in &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time and time spent &#x0201c;on without troublesome dyskinesia&#x0201d;) during all periods of the day when patients are awake (ie, morning, afternoon, and evening).</p><p>Wearing-off symptoms in patients treated with levodopa are thought to be due to, at least in part, the short half-life of levodopa and consequent fluctuating plasma levels.<sup><xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Early morning motor symptoms also may be considered &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time and are mostly related to the end of the previous dose's effectiveness.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, a reduced or lack of responsiveness to levodopa therapy, and greater &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time, may occur at other times during the day, most notably in the afternoon.<sup><xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The effectiveness of rotigotine over the 24-hour dosing window as demonstrated in this analysis is supported by the compound's pharmacokinetic profile. Plasma concentration-time profiles in healthy volunteers and in patients with early-stage idiopathic PD demonstrated stable rotigotine steady-state plasma concentrations during a 24-hour dosing period.<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Pharmacokinetic studies with the dopamine receptor agonists pramipexole and ropinirole also have shown more stable plasma concentration over 24 hours with the extended-release (ER) formulations over the immediate-release formulations.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> The ER formulations of pramipexole and ropinirole are orally administered and undergo first-pass metabolism after absorption in the gut. Although ER formulations of pramipexole and ropinirole have demonstrated efficacy in alleviating motor symptoms and time spent &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; in patients with advanced PD, those studies have not evaluated the effects of the agents during a 24-hour dosing window.<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Safety and tolerability assessments from the 3 studies included in the current analyses of rotigotine in patients with advanced PD have previously been reported in full.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In brief, the most commonly reported adverse events in rotigotine-treated patients were application site reactions and those consistent with dopaminergic stimulation or complications related to PD, for example, nausea, dizziness, somnolence, and dyskinesia.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In long term, open-label extensions of two of these studies (CLEOPATRA-PD and PREFER), in which patients were followed for 6 years, the spectrum of adverse events reported was similar to those in the preceding double-blind studies.<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Moreover, in a post hoc analysis of pooled data from studies of advanced-PD (CLEOPATRA-PD and PREFER), which compared adverse event profiles of younger and older patients, rotigotine was generally well tolerated with a safety profile that seems to be relatively unaffected by increasing age.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>This analysis has several limitations. First, rotigotine dosing was slightly different among each of these studies. In the CLEOPATRA-PD study, optimal dosing was permitted up to 16 mg/24 h, whereas the PREFER study used 2 rotigotine dose groups: &#x02264;8 mg/24 h and &#x02264;12 mg/24 h. SP921 was a dose-response study in the lower dose range (2&#x02013;8 mg/24 h), and the minimal statistically significant effective dose of rotigotine to reduce &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; time was found to be 8 mg/24 h in this study.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The current analyses pooled all rotigotine doses, and thus, the efficacy profile by dose over the 24-hour dosing period cannot be determined. However, the pooling of patient data from each of the 3 studies resulted in a relatively large sample population. In addition, as post hoc analyses, all <italic>P</italic> values are exploratory in nature. However, given these limitations, the results from this study provide important insights into the efficacy of rotigotine in alleviating motor fluctuations in patients with advanced disease.</p><p>In summary, these post hoc analyses of 3 randomized clinical studies in patients with advanced-stage PD suggest that rotigotine transdermal patch may be effective during all periods of the day when patients are awake. The results provide additional evidence in support of the clinical benefits of a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist in the reduction of motor fluctuations and help to better understand, from the patients' perspective, how the benefit provided by rotigotine is spread over the course of a day.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This post hoc analysis was supported by UCB Pharma, Monheim am Rhein, Germany.
