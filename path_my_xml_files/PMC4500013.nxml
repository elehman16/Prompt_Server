and breakfast on energy substrate and hormone levels in obese male college students.
[Subjects and Methods] This crossover study recruited 10 obese male college students with
a body mass index &#x0003e;25&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &#x0003e;20% body fat. One week post-recruitment,
the subjects exercised in the morning after an overnight fast. At 2 weeks, they exercised
post-breakfast. Energy substrate (glucose, free fatty acid) and metabolic hormone
(insulin, growth hormone, and cortisol) levels were measured immediately before and after
exercise and at 60&#x02005;min post-exercise. [Results] We observed interaction effects between
the measurement time and exercise treatment for glucose; significant differences between
measurement times and between exercise treatments for free fatty acids; interaction
effects between the measurement time and exercise treatment for insulin and significant
differences in the measurement time; significance differences between measurement times
and between exercise treatments for growth hormone; and significant differences between
measurement times and between exercise treatments for cortisol. [Conclusion<bold>]</bold>
Morning exercise following an overnight fast can be more effective in reducing body fat
than post-prandial exercise. However, increased cortisol levels following exercise after
overnight fasting may negatively affect long-term weight loss in obese men.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Energy substrates</kwd><kwd>Metabolic hormone</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In many countries, increased consumption of a westernized diet and lack of physical
activity have caused an energy intake imbalance and resulted in an increased prevalence of
obesity and chronic diseases, including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes,
and arthritis<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, regular exercise
and physical activity are reported to be effective methods for preventing obesity, its
accompanying chronic lifestyle diseases, and premature death<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. When performed on a regular, long-term basis, aerobic exercise can
prevent or cure obesity, increase muscle volume, elevate oxygen levels and oxidizing enzymes
in myocytes, and increase blood volume and fat oxidation<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, aerobic exercise can improve the various metabolic
risk factors involving blood pressure, fatty acids, and the cardiovascular system in obese
and type 2 diabetic patients<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. One study suggested
that exercise in the morning on an empty stomach promotes the utilization of lipids in
adipose tissue because the exercise is performed under low blood sugar conditions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Because this exercise regime promotes
increased utilization of lipids, it is thought to be more efficient for weight
regulation<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, findings from
other studies have suggested that performing aerobic exercise in the morning before eating
can induce neurotic symptoms and fatigue because low blood sugar levels result in
stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This stimulation can
increase the secretion of the steroid hormone cortisol<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Elevated cortisol level
can decrease protein synthesis in the muscle, thereby affecting carbohydrate, fat, and
protein metabolism, and can also promote gluconeogenesis in the liver<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
increased cortisol levels have also been observed to result from moderate- to high-intensity
aerobic exercise, which complicates the interpretation of these previous studies. The
ability of exercise to prevent obesity and reduce body weight depends on the retention of
internal nutrition before exercise and the secretion of hormones that affect carbohydrate,
fat, and protein metabolism<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many
studies have evaluated energy substrate changes and hormone levels (e.g., cortisol, growth
hormone, and insulin) in relation to different exercise parameters (e.g., intensity), but
none have investigated the effects of exercise performed in the morning (when cortisol
secretion is at its maximum) following an overnight fast or breakfast. Therefore, the
present study aimed to compare the effects of exercise after overnight fasting and after
breakfast on energy substrate changes and hormone levels in male university students with
obesity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The target group of the current investigation included 10 male students with obesity, a

The subjects performed the first
experiment (exercising after an overnight fast) after 1 week of testing and then performed
the second experiment (exercising 2&#x02005;h after breakfast) subsequent to a 2-week washout period
from the first experiment. For both experiments, the subjects maintained an empty stomach
after 10 P.M. on the day before exercising and then performed the exercise at 9 A.M. on the
next day. For the second experiment, the subjects consumed a specified ratio of calories and
nutrients 2&#x02005;h before the exercise. Blood collection was performed immediately before and
after exercise and also at 60&#x02005;min after the exercise.</p><p>For both experiments, the subjects exercised on a treadmill at 75% of VO<sub>2</sub>max and
burned up to 400&#x02005;kcal. For controlling effects due to differences in exercise intensity and
duration between the 2 exercise regimes, a regression equation derived from the data sheet
for graded exercise test values (oxygen intake and heart rate per minute) was used to
establish identical calorie consumption and exercise intensity between the experiments. The
average target heart rate and exercise time were determined to be 155.80 &#x000b1; 6.90 bpm and
31.70 &#x000b1; 2.35&#x02005;min, respectively. Meanwhile, to precisely monitor the individual caloric
consumption, the time point at which the target heart rate and exercise time were reached
was measured with an automated heart rate monitor (Polar Heart Monitor, Polar S610i, Polar
Electro, Kempele, Finland). The VO<sub>2max</sub> was measured with an exercise load test
(graded exercise test) using a treadmill (Medtrack ST 65; Quinton Instrument Co., Boston,
MA, USA) and a respiratory gas analyzer (True-one; Quinton Instrument Co.). The Bruce
protocol was used for the graded exercise test<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Blood was collected from the brachial vein (10&#x02005;mL each time)
immediately before and after exercise and at 60&#x02005;min following exercise for both exercise
regimes. The collected venous blood was maintained for 10&#x02005;min at room temperature and then
centrifuged at 3,000&#x02005;rpm for 10&#x02005;min. The upper phase was transferred to a microtube and
stored at &#x02212;80&#x02005;&#x000b0;C until the analysis. Glucose level was measured immediately after blood
collection using One-Touch (Lifescan Company, Mountain View, CA, USA), and serum insulin
level was analyzed using a commercial insulin reagent kit (Human insulin ELISA-kit, DSL, TX,
USA). Serum free fatty acid (FFA), cortisol, and growth hormone levels were assessed by
Green Cross Inc., Youngin, Korea. The parameters measured immediately before and after
exercise and at 60&#x02005;min after exercise between the 2 exercise regimes were compared and
analyzed by two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures. A significance level of p =
0.05 was used for the analyses. The statistics were performed with SPSS-PC version 20 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The results are shown as the average &#x000b1; standard deviation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>For minimizing the differences in the amount of exercise performed between the 2

exercise treatments. Glucose showed significant interaction effects between the measurement
time and the exercise treatment (p &#x0003c; 0.007), but no significant differences were observed
between measurement times or between exercise treatments. A possible explanation for this
interaction effect is that the glucose levels had not been restored to their post-breakfast
exercise levels. Meanwhile, FFA showed no significant interaction between the measurement
time and treatment. However, significant differences were observed between measurement times
(p &#x0003c; 0.001) and between exercise treatments (p &#x0003c; 0.002). These results suggest that
exercising in the morning before breakfast is more efficient than post-prandial exercise in
terms of utilizing lipids as an energy source. Insulin showed a significant interaction
effect between the measurement time and exercise treatment (p &#x0003c; 0.002; <xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Additionally, significant differences were
observed between measurement times (p &#x0003c; 0.001) but not between exercise treatments. The
interaction effect suggests that insulin was secreted in response to the high level of
glucose resulting from the patient&#x02019;s dietary intake. Meanwhile, neither growth hormone nor
cortisol showed a significant interaction effect between measurement time and exercise
treatment (p &#x0003c; 0.216 and p &#x0003c; 0.102, respectively). However, both hormone levels
significantly differed between measurement times (p &#x0003c; 0.001 and p &#x0003c; 0.012,

respectively).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the current study, glucose and insulin showed a significant interaction effect between
the measured time and treatment. One likely explanation is that their levels were high due
to the dietary intake 2 hours prior to the exercise. In addition, there were significant
differences in insulin level between the measurement time points, independent of treatment,
indicating that the insulin levels decreased immediately after exercise due to the increased
energy demand<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and then stabilized
60&#x02005;min after the exercise. Increased physical exercise improves glucose homeostasis and
increases sensitivity to insulin, and acute exercise can increase the sensitivity of tissues
or organs such as the skeletal muscles, fat, liver, and hypothalamus to insulin<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Further, acute exercise has been shown to result in improved glucose homeostasis in an
animal model of obesity<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. When blood sugar levels are low, cAMP level
increases<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> and activates fat
disassembly in the adipocytes<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, cortisol levels are higher in the morning<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. These factors imply that the morning is the most efficient time of
day to reduce body fat through exercise, particularly since blood sugar levels are at their
lowest. Dreave et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the
fat oxidation rate is high during morning exercise after overnight fasting as compared to
that during post-prandial exercise, and they concluded that the former exercise regime is
efficient for body fat reduction. Further, in the present study, growth hormone levels were
higher at all evaluated time points after overnight fasting as compared to the levels after
breakfast before exercise, and these levels could be related to the higher FFA levels
observed after an overnight fast. According to these results, the high levels of growth
hormone after overnight fasting increased the transport of fatty acids from adipocytes into
the blood, thereby acting as a source of energy for muscles during exercise in the absence
of carbohydrates.</p><p>Growth hormone and cortisol were previously reported to be simultaneously secreted during
fasting<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> or exercise<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and were found to increase FFA and
glycerol levels in the blood<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
current study, the FFA concentrations were high at all measured time points, which is
consistent with the results of previous studies with respect to overnight fasting and
morning exercise. In these previous studies, morning exercise was considered to be efficient
for decreasing weight and body fat in those with obesity, particularly when performed on an
empty stomach. However, in the current study, high cortisol concentrations were also
observed at all the accessed time points for both treatment groups. During exercise,
cortisol is secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to stress. Cortisol decreases protein
synthesis in the muscles; increases catabolism, affecting the metabolism of carbohydrates,
fats, and proteins; and stimulates gluconeogenesis in the liver<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the current study, the cortisol concentration was
higher after overnight fasting than it was after dietary intake. These results indicate that
glucose and insulin levels were high before exercise following dietary intake because the
cortisol levels were too low for the hormone to play a strong antagonistic role<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, these results suggest that a
greater amount of muscle wasting for use as an energy source during exercise after a morning
fast, as compared to exercise after breakfast, presumably resulted in a decreased
improvement in the fat-free mass. However, because the current study only examined the
effects of acute exercise, a long-term study will be needed for further validation. In
addition, persistently high cortisol levels resulting from regular exercise after overnight
fasting can negatively affect physical health. In particular, previous studies have
indicated that these persistently high cortisol levels can promote fat accumulation in the
abdomen, decrease insulin sensitivity<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>,
increase the risk of osteoporosis<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> and
hypertension<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>, and decrease immune
function and muscle mass, thereby negatively affecting the patient&#x02019;s overall physical
health. In the present study, we were unable to draw clear conclusions on the effect of
performing exercise after overnight fasting on physical health. However, the fundamental
results reported here provide the basis for a long-term study to more clearly address this
issue.</p><p>Recently, a number of studies have been carried out in the attempt to develop exercise
methodologies for maintaining and improving physical health to reduce the prevalence of
obesity. The effect of exercise timing and pre-exercise nutritional state has emerged as an
important consideration. In the current study, it should be emphasized that energy substrate
and metabolic hormone levels differed between the treatment groups. Compared to the
post-prandial exercise, the exercise performed after overnight fasting showed low glucose
