In two experiments, we examined how social groups guide selective attention toward in-group and out-group faces. Black and White participants detected a target letter among letter strings superimposed on faces (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Experiment 1</xref>). White participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (Black) compared to in-group (White) distractor faces. Likewise, Black participants were less accurate on trials with racial out-group (White) compared to in-group (Black) distractor faces. However, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load&#x02014;when the task was visually difficult. To examine the malleability of this pattern of racial bias, a separate sample of participants were assigned to mixed-race minimal groups (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Experiment 2</xref>). Participants assigned to groups were less accurate on trials with their minimal in-group members compared to minimal out-group distractor faces, regardless of race. Again, this pattern of out-group bias was only evident under high perceptual load. Taken together, these results suggest that social identity guides selective attention toward motivationally relevant social groups&#x02014;shifting from out-group bias in the domain of race to in-group bias in the domain of minimal groups&#x02014;when perceptual resources are scarce.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Bavel</surname><given-names>Jay J.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>National Institute of Aging grant</institution></funding-source><award-id>5T32AG000029-37</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>LaBarron K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>JVB was supported by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and National Science Foundation.

Living in groups confers numerous benefits, including the fulfillment of many basic psychological needs [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The value humans place on group membership is illustrated by the fact that people form groups in every culture on earth [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and readily form groups under the most trivial of circumstances [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. People develop an inherent understanding that they belong to a certain group, including the value or significance of this group and the relationship and associations that they share with the group and its members&#x02014;known as social identification [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In this research, we examined when and how social identity impacts one&#x02019;s capacity of controlling selective attention, critical for goal-directed behavior</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Social identity shapes attention</title><p>Social identities can shape a wide range of social and cognitive processes, including the interpretation of social events [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], face memory [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and visual attention [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, extensive research has found that racial out-group members often capture one&#x02019;s attention [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. One recent study examined the effects of racial out-group on <italic>inattentional blindness&#x02014;</italic>the inability to consciously perceive goal-irrelevant stimuli while attending to goal-relevant stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In a classic demonstration of inattentional blindness, participants were presented with a video clip in which two teams were tossing balls and instructed to count how many times the ball was passed among one of the teams. Fewer than half of the participants reported seeing a person wearing a gorilla suit walk through a scene [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Evidence suggests that certain social groups can disrupt inattentional blindness. For instance, White participants were more likely to notice a Black compared to a White interloper, thereby attenuating inattentional blindness [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In other words, racial out-group members attracted the attention of White perceivers.</p><p>Although racial out-group faces often attract attention and activate stereotypes and evaluations, these biases can be regulated among participants who have both the motivation and cognitive resources (for review see [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; see also [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). For example, when White participants have a motivation to pay attention to racial in-group members, such as finding a romantic partner or a friend, they are more likely to notice a White interloper [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. As such, the motivation and interpersonal goals can override the effects of race, allowing people to employ more egalitarian visual attention. However, controlling the impact of racial out-group biases often comes with high cognitive cost [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. For instance, when White participants who were asked to perform the Stroop color-naming task following an interracial interaction, they showed impaired task performance after an interracial interaction compared to a same-race interaction [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. According to the authors, the interracial interaction required the active inhibition of stereotypes, which diminished cognitive resources on the subsequent Stroop task [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Similarly, successful goal-directed behavior in most selective attention tasks requires the inhibition of task-irrelevant distractors [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As such, controlling or regulating attention and behavior around racial out-group members may require cognitive or perceptual resources.</p><p>An alternative strategy for regulating attention is through activating different social identities. Previous research has indicated that social identification is dynamic and varies according to the social context [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For instance, merely assigning people to a mixed-race group can elicit a preference for and greater attention to in-group members, regardless of their race [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, while prejudice and stereotypes often contribute to intergroup bias in the race domain, identifying with a group&#x02014;however minimal&#x02014;can override the effects of race on cognition and behavior. Moreover, participants assigned to these minimal groups often show in-group favoritism, rather than out-group derogation (see [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]). In minimal group contexts, the out-group is often treated as irrelevant or ignored [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In-group bias, then, can direct attentional resources toward identity relevant stimuli. Research has yet to examine how these social identities can influence selective attention&#x02014;that is, how social identity guides attention when perceptual resources are scarce.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Selective Attention and Cognitive Control</title><p>Selective attention refers to one&#x02019;s ability to focus on motivationally-relevant stimuli while ignoring distractors [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. According to the Load Theory of Selective Attention and Cognitive Control (henceforth referred to as <italic>Load Theory</italic>), perceptual load determines when selection takes place (see [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). According to Load Theory, task-relevant stimuli and task-irrelevant distractors compete for limited processing resources [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Under low load, when processing task-relevant information is less demanding, spare processing capacity is available to process distractors irrelevant to a goal-directed task. However, under high load, when the amount of task-relevant information is high or the goal-directed task is demanding, limited processing capacity is exhausted, leaving fewer processing resources to process irrelevant distractors [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, perceptual load plays an important role in selective attention.</p><p>Successful goal-directed behavior in most selective attention tasks requires the inhibition of task-irrelevant distractors [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, to effectively perform a task, top-down attentional control must be exerted to facilitate the perceptual processing of task-relevant stimuli and to inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant distractors [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, due to the prioritization of racial out-group faces, even greater attentional control must be exerted to inhibit the processing of task-irrelevant racial out-group face distractors and focus on task-relevant stimuli. Thus, the availability of perceptual resources plays an important role in determining the extent to which top-down attentional control is exerted to inhibit racial out-group face distractors. As such, it may be easier to focus on task-relevant stimuli and inhibit attention to irrelevant racial out-group face distractors under low load when there are ample resources available to permit top-down attentional control. In contrast, it may more difficult to focus on task-relevant stimuli and inhibit attention to irrelevant racial out-group face distractors under high load when there are limited resources available to permit top-down attentional control. As a result, people may show impaired task performance with racial out-group face distractors under perceptual load.</p><p>Naturally, the impact of social identity on selective attention should hinge on the particular social identity in question as well as the broader social context. For instance, when people are motivated to engage with in-group members [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], in-group face distractors may produce greater interference effects under high load. Previous research suggests that assigning people to minimal groups imbues in-group members with affective value (see [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]), which then leads to stronger preferences for processing in-group relative to out-group faces [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For example, people showed superior recognition [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and greater activity of the fusiform face area (FFA)&#x02014;a brain region involved in face perception and recognition&#x02014;in response to minimal in-group relative to out-group faces (see [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]). Thus, in-group face distractors may be prioritized for selective attention in some contexts.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Overview</title><p>The current research was designed to clarify whether and how social identities shape selective attention. In Experiment 1, White and Black participants were asked to perform a letter detection task in which target letters were superimposed on either Black versus White distractor faces. Under low perceptual load, ample resources were available to exert top-down attentional control to effectively inhibit identity-driven attentional biases and complete the task. Therefore, the Black versus White distractor faces should result in no differential distractor interference under low perceptual load. In contrast, under high perceptual load, fewer perceptual resources were available to exert top-down attention control to inhibit or override out-group bias. We therefore predicted that White participants would show impaired task performance in trials with Black compared to White distractors, and Black participants would show impaired task performance in trials with White compared to Black distractor faces under high load. This experiment would provide evidence that racial out-group distractor faces interfere with selective attention when perceptual resources are scarce.</p><p>In Experiment 2, we examined whether assignment to an arbitrary group would produce greater interference effects of in-group face distractors under high perceptual load. We randomly assigned photos of mixed-race faces to a pre-existing in-group or out-group during a learning phase, and then examined the interference effect of these faces under high and low perceptual load. We predicted that participants would show impaired task performance in trials with in-group compared to out-group distractors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Experiment 1: Racial Groups and Selective Attention</title><p>In Experiment 1, we examined the effects of Black and White male distractor faces on a target detection task under high and low perceptual load. Black and White participants were asked to detect a target from letter strings superimposed on either White or Black face distractors. We predicted that the race of participants and distractor faces would moderate the load effect in a target detection task. Specifically, we hypothesized that participants would be able to inhibit attention toward racial out-group distractors under low perceptual load when greater perceptual resources are available to recruit top-down attentional control which is critical for overriding racial bias (see also [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]). However, racial out-group face distractors may capture one&#x02019;s attention and lead to greater distractor interference when perceptual resources are unavailable. That is, White participants will be more distracted by Black than White male face distractors and Black participants by White than Black male face distractors under high perceptual load.</p><sec id="sec006" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-four undergraduate students completed the study for partial course credit.

Thus, although the first experiment suggested that out-group faces might be most distracting under high perceptual load, the minimal group assignment would lead to preferential processing for in-group faces, thereby resulting in greater distractor interference of in-group face distractors under high perceptual load [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

We selected the binary logistic regression and first-order autoregressive (AR1) for the covariance structure. Separate effect-coded variables were created for group membership (in-group = 1, out-group = 2), race of distractor face (Black = 1, White = 2), and perceptual load (low = 1, high = 2).</p><p><bold>Collective Identification:</bold> Participants answered six questions assessing their collective identification with being in the in-group or the out-group using a 6-point Likert scale [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]: &#x0201c;I value being a member of BLUE (GREEN) team&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;I am proud to be a member of the BLUE (GREEN) team&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;Belonging to the BLUE (GREEN) team is an important part of my identity&#x0201d;.

It is difficult to attribute the results to facial features of stimuli because this design ensured that participants would be equally likely to see each face as an in-group or out-group color denoted group membership (in-group/out-group) and was counterbalanced across participants. Furthermore, the magnitude of in-group bias in distractor interference was correlated with the accessibility of in-group identification&#x02014;directly linking identification to attention.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>General Discussion</title><p>We explored whether social identities shape selective attention to perform effective goal-directed behavior. Furthermore, we examined how the influence of social identities on selective attention may depend on whether perceptual resources are adequate or scarce, which can be manipulated by perceptual load (see [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). As expected, participants exhibited greater interference effects of racial out-group relative to racial in-group face distractors under high perceptual load, when fewer processing resources were available (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec005">Experiment 1</xref>). However, the race of distractor faces did not interfere with task performance under low perceptual load. In contrast, participants assigned to minimal groups revealed greater interference effects of in-group relative to out-group distractor faces under high perceptual load, which provides evidence of the malleability of racial bias in selective attention (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec014">Experiment 2</xref>).</p><p>The current research provides strong evidence that social identifies shape selective attention to perform effective goal-directed behavior. Moreover, the effects of identity on selective attention appear to depend on the availability of perceptual resources. Under low perceptual load when processing task-relevant information was relatively easy, spare perceptual resources could be used to process racial out-group distractor faces, yet there were still enough perceptual resources available to exert top-down attentional control to inhibit attentional biases toward racial out-group distractor faces. We speculate, however, that the frontal-parietal networks involved in controlled processing were successfully recruited under low perceptual load to inhibit differential attention to racial out-group faces and focus on the letter detection task (see [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). Under high perceptual load, the same networks may have been recruited for the task, reducing the perceptual resources available to diminish the differential attention to racial out-group faces [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Thus, while racial out-group faces may capture attention in both conditions (relative to racial in-group faces), the present research suggests that participants are capable of recruiting top-down attentional control to inhibit their attentional bias toward racial out-group faces in the low perceptual load condition. However, future research should directly examine the psychological factors that may account for this pattern of results (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]) to determine whether inhibitory processes account for the differential response to racial out-group faces in the high and low load conditions. This research extends the previous research on racial out-group faces and attention by showing that attentional bias (e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]) may be inhibited when participants have sufficient perceptual resources (see also [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]).</p><p>The current research extends the Load Theory proposed by Lavie and her colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Lavie and her colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] have conceptualized a load-dependent locus of selective attention: the distractor interference effect on selective attention depends on the availability of processing resources under load [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. According to the theory, distractors significantly interfere with task performance under low perceptual load whereas their effect is diminished under high load. The results in our experiments suggest that social identity may shape distractor inference. Other studies have identified similar evidence of distractor interference under high perceptual load. For instance, when famous faces are used as distractors, participants&#x02019; ability to detect a target is significantly diminished&#x02014;regardless of the level of perceptual load [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], thereby providing evidence that load does not moderate the distractor interference of socially significant stimuli. Furthermore, a recent study reveals that individual differences play a role in task performance under load [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]: people with good self-regulatory function, indexed by higher resting cardiac vagal tone, were faster in trials with neutral distractors under high perceptual load. Taken together, these studies suggest that load theory needs to be revised to account for the influence of social and motivational concerns on behavior under perceptual load.</p><p>Our results may appear to contradict previous research in which participants did not activate categorical knowledge under high load [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. For example, Gilbert &#x00026; Hixon [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] presented participants with word fragments, some of which could be resolved by using stereotypic words that describe Asian Americans, such as shy or rice, while being exposed to either a White or Asian female assistant. Participants with <italic>low</italic> working memory load generated greater stereotypic responses in the presence of an Asian assistant compared to a White assistant. In contrast, participants with <italic>high</italic> working memory load were not influenced by the race of the assistant. There are a number of important differences that may account for the apparent discrepancy between these results and present research. First, Gilbert &#x00026; Hixon [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]) manipulated the amount of <italic>working memory</italic> load whereas we manipulated <italic>perceptual</italic> load in an attentional task. Although greater distractor interference effects are typically observed under high perceptual load, the opposite is true for working memory load [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Second, presenting a series of faces in which the only obvious difference was race and in which the faces were equally likely to be Black and White&#x02014;a notable departure from the base rates in the local population&#x02014;may have made race salient.</p><p>It is possible to interpret the results in terms of arousal induced by varying group distractors. Racial out-group distractors and minimal in-group distractors both could have elicited both arousing emotion, which may lead to a detrimental performance under high load, when fewer perceptual resources are available. In fact, it has been well know that both motivationally and socially relevant stimuli elicit the activation of neural structures that underlie attention [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, their effects on selective attention under load appear to be different. Previous research has indicated that participants were more accurate on trials with fearful compared to neutral faces under high load [<xref rid="pone.0161426.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0161426.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Conversely, participants were less accurate on trials with socially relevant stimuli (e.g., racial out-group or minimal in-group faces). Motivationally relevant stimuli (e.g., fearful faces) may signal a sign of threat and alert people to look for its source in the environment, which may have allowed people to identify targets better. Future work should attempt to differentiate the effect of arousal caused by emotionally arousing (e.g., fearful faces) and socially relevant stimuli on selective attention.</p><p>There are some limitation of the current research. First of all, the current research used only male faces. Therefore, future work is necessary to see if the effects extend to other stimuli, including female faces. Secondly, Experiment 2 included Asian, Hispanic and potentially unspecific race participants. Although we did not observe the effect of race of distractor faces among White participants in Experiment 2 (see foot note 7), which was contrast to Experiment 1, it is still possible that the mixed race make-up of the participants not the minimal-group assignment may cause the absence of a main effect of race of distractor faces. Therefore, future work should include only Black and White participants to eliminate the potential effect of mixed race make-up of participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec024"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We live in a world where we frequently interact and work with members of various groups to achieve our goals. As such, we are constantly exposed to an environment where social information, especially social identity, can easily and often become salient. It is important to know when this information can become a distraction that prevents one from maximizing goal-directed performance. The current research provides evidence that social identity plays an important role in one&#x02019;s ability for controlling selective attention when perceptual resources are limited. Our research provides evidence that social identity can prioritize selective attention even at the costs of distracting us from other goal-directed behavior.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Tobias Brosch, Jeni Kubota, Kyle Ratner, Jillian Swencionis, Jenny Xiao and members of the <italic>NYU Social Perception and Evaluation Lab</italic> (@vanbavellab) for their thoughtful comments on various stages of this research.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0161426.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Caporael</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></name>. <article-title>The evolution of truly social cognition: The core configurations model</article-title>. <source>Personality and Social Psychology Review</source>. <year>1997</year>;<volume>1</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>276</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>298</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15661664</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161426.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Dunbar</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>. <article-title>The social brain hypothesis</article-title>. <source>brain</source>. <year>1998</year>;<volume>9</volume>(<issue>10</issue>):<fpage>178</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>190</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161426.ref003"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Allport</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name>. <source>The nature of prejudice: <italic>Reading</italic></source>: <publisher-name>Addison-Wesley</publisher-name>; <year>1979</year>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161426.ref004"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Correll</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>. <article-title>A model of the ingroup as a social resource</article-title>. <source>Personality and Social Psychology Review</source>. <year>2005</year>;<volume>9</volume>(<issue>4</issue>):<fpage>341</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>359</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16223356</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0161426.ref005"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Kurzban</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Neuberg</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name>. <chapter-title>Managing Ingroup and Outgroup Relationships</chapter-title> In: <name><surname>Buss</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name>, editor. <source>The handbook of evolutionary psychology</source>. <publisher-loc>Hoboken</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>John Wiley &#x00026; Sons</publisher-name>
