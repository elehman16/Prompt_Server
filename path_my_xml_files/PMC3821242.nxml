Oleation leads and decides the total outcome of the Bio-purification therapy; hence, standard guidelines are needed for performing the internal oleation in an effective manner and also for avoiding the inadequate and excess oleation. It is obligatory to start and increase the dose of lipids (<italic>Sneha</italic>) in appropriate and judicious way considering the bio-fire (<italic>Agni</italic>) and nature of bowel habit (<italic>Koshtha</italic>) of the subject. The outcome of Bio-Purification depends upon proper mobilization of <italic>Dosha</italic> from the periphery (<italic>Shakha</italic>) to gastrointestinal tract (<italic>Koshtha</italic>); which is achieved with the help of oleation therapy (<italic>Snehana Karma</italic>) and sudation therapy (<italic>Svedana Karma</italic>). This clinical study was carried out on 29 subjects to standardize the dose and duration of internal oleation and to develop the oleation grade for the assessment of internal oleation therapy. The selected subjects were randomly divided into two groups, in which group A was given fixed increase dose of ghee and in group B non-fixed increase dose was given. Results of this study show that the total percentage of oleation was 33.57% in group A and it was 45.28% in group B. Subjects of Group B (non-fixed dose schedule) have shown better oleation in all the aspects, i.e. duration, oleation grade, and purification grade.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bio-purification</kwd><kwd>oleation</kwd><kwd>purgation</kwd><kwd>purification</kwd><kwd><italic>Snehana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Shodhana</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Internal oleation is the major preparatory procedures performed before Bio-purificatory therapies (<italic>Shodhana Karma</italic>) such as therapeutic emesis (<italic>Vamana Karma</italic>) and therapeutic purgation (<italic>Virechana Karma</italic>). The outcome of Bio-Purification depends upon proper mobilization of <italic>Dosha</italic> from the periphery (<italic>Shakha</italic>) to gastrointestinal tract (<italic>Koshtha</italic>), which is achieved with the help of oleation therapy (<italic>Snehana Karma</italic>) and sudation therapy (<italic>Svedana Karma</italic>). Of these two, the oleation is a major therapy which decides the outcome of purificatory procedure.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Emesis and purgation are the Bio-purificatory procedures against the normal physiological processes of the body. Anything against physiological activity of the body is bound to aggravate the <italic>Vata Dosha</italic>. <italic>Sneha</italic> helps in protecting the body from the negative onslaught of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic>.</p><p>In Ayurvedic classics, brief procedures of internal oleation has been told in the form of verse; however, there is no detail and precise explanation about the test dose, pattern of increase in dose, assessment of symptoms of adequate oleation (<italic>Samyak Snigdha Lakshana</italic>),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] etc. So, there is urgent need of standardization of internal oleation, especially the dose pattern.</p><p>Currently, the practicing physicians are facing difficulty in deciding the proper dose and duration of oleation. Therefore, two main discussion points in internal oleation are the fixation of dose and duration. It seems that Scholars have considered bio-fire (<italic>Agni</italic>) as a technique to fix the dose of <italic>Sneha</italic> and bowel habit (<italic>Koshtha</italic>) to fix the duration of oleation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>There is no mention of dose schedule of <italic>Sneha</italic> in classics. Indirect references regarding the fixation of dose of <italic>Sneha</italic> are available. Charaka explained this with an illustration that, just as cloth absorbs the water up to its capacity then drains off. Similarly, the bio-fire according to its strength digests the <italic>Sneha</italic> and drains off when excess. Here, Chakrapani also supported the Charaka's view of where to stop <italic>Snehana</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Up to the 12<sup>th</sup> cent A.D., the physicians are able to assess the bio-fire and bowel habit and decide how much dose and duration for <italic>Sneha</italic> is required. Afterwards, in the society, the physician wanted a quick ready reckoner of internal oleation schedule, which was fulfilled by Vangasena for first time in 12<sup>th</sup> cent. A.D. Vangasena was the first Scholar to describe clearly the three abstract incremental dose schedules as least, medium, and best.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>Ghee (medicated or non-medicated) is given in specific increasing dose pattern for three to seven days, determined by the nature of bowels passed and the digestive power of an individual. Estimated quantity of lipid required for oleation ranges from 600 to 1200 ml.</p><p>The careful daily assessment of oleation is very important for deciding further steps like sudation, emesis, or purgation. Any error in the assessment may lead to complications. The assessment of the outcome of oleation therapy is done on the basis of the symptoms of adequate oleation described in the classics.</p><p>It is hypothesized that oleation occurs better in the group, where <italic>Sneha</italic> has been given according to the bio-fire. In addition, it is presumed that if oleation occurs better, then purification will be better.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objects</title><p>

From the available Ayurvedic textbooks, some daily abstract dose schedules are mentioned which were based on the individual experiences or traditions. Some other authors even tried to double the 6<sup>th</sup> day dose on 7<sup>th</sup> day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Symptoms of adequate oleation</title><p>Normalcy of <italic>Vata</italic> is very first symptom quoted in the list of symptoms. Practically also, this symptom appears first. The value of Bio-fire strength index (BSI) was accepted as a score for intensity of hunger directly. Though the subjects did not report the actual increase in hunger on their regular meal timings but considering the quantity of ghee given, the BSI was decided [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Symptoms of adequate oleation observed in 29 subjects</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-147-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Pattern of appearance of symptoms of oleation</title><p>The data suggest that all symptoms of adequate oleation do not appear on the same day but as oleation process goes on in the body, the symptoms appear one by one. First of all, gastrointestinal tract becomes oleated, so that normalcy of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> and intensity of bio-fire are observed initially. Furthermore, when oiliness of stool and loose stool signs appear, then it can be concluded that complete oleation of gastrointestinal tract has occurred. This is also called as gastrointestinal tract oleation (<italic>Koshtha Snigdhata</italic>) in general. Afterwards, the symptoms like softness of body parts and oiliness of skin appear. This reveals that oleation has reached up to peripheral tissue level. This is called as peripheral tissue oleation (<italic>Shakha Snigdhata</italic>). The symptom of aversion to lipids intake suggests that there is no need of further administration of lipids [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Pattern of adequate oleation found in subjects of group A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-147-g005"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Pattern of adequate oleation found in subjects of group B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-147-g006"/></table-wrap><p>Thus, from the above data, it can be concluded that the pattern of symptoms of adequate oleation as described by Charaka[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and other eminent Scholars appear in a sequential manner.

</p></sec><sec id="sec3-13"><title>Effect of oleation on lipids</title><p>Some modern physicians and subjects undergoing oleation therapy think that it might lead to rise in the lipid levels. There is a fear amongst the medical fraternity and the subjects that oral intake of lipids used for oleation therapy (internal oleation) may lead to an increase in the biochemical parameters, especially the lipids. Oral ingestion of cholesterol is reflected as a mild increase in the plasma concentration. However, when cholesterol is ingested, the rising concentration of cholesterol inhibits the most essential enzyme for endogenous synthesis of cholesterol, thus providing an intrinsic feedback control system to prevent an excessive increase. As a result, the plasma concentration is usually not altered more than &#x000b1; 15% by altering the amount of cholesterol in the diet, although individual responses differ markedly. A highly saturated fat diet increases blood cholesterol concentration up to 15 to 25%. Ingestion of diet containing highly unsaturated fatty acids usually depresses the blood cholesterol concentration to a slight moderate amount [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T11">11</xref>].[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><table-wrap id="T8" position="float"><label>Table 8</label><caption><p>Effect of internal oleation on Biochemical parameters in group A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-147-g011"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T9" position="float"><label>Table 9</label><caption><p>Effect of internal oleation on Biochemical parameters in group B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-147-g012"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T10" position="float"><label>Table 10</label><caption><p>Effect of purgation therapy on Biochemical parameters in group A</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-147-g013"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T11" position="float"><label>Table 11</label><caption><p>Effect of purgation therapy on biochemical parameters in group B</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AYU-34-147-g014"/></table-wrap><p>A review of studies done till date provides an evidence that oral ingestion of lipids (internal oleation) do not cause rise in the level of lipids, rather it facilitates in bringing the increased level lipids to normal; even if the lipid levels increase during oral ingestion of lipids (internal oleation), it is transient and comes to normal after adequate Bio-Purification (<italic>Samyak Shodhana</italic>). The fear associated with the oral ingestion of lipids might be dispelled; thus, oleation therapy might be better acceptable. Judicious use of oral lipids aimed at Bio-Purification can be done even in cardiac diseases, non-insulin-dependent Diabetes mellitus where the lipids levels are usually abnormal.
