Each ml of blood loss results in loss of 0.5 mg iron. About 20% of maternal deaths worldwide can be attributed to anemia.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In India, about 36% of the total maternal deaths are attributable to postpartum hemorrhage or anemia.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In healthy women after normal delivery, the prevalence of anemia 1-week postpartum is 14% in iron-supplemented women and 24% in nonsupplemented women.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Patients with severe PPA have a longer average length of hospital stay, are more likely to receive a blood transfusion and incur higher hospitalization costs.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] About 18% of women hospitalized with anemia and postpartum bleeding receive a blood transfusion.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Currently, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia) recommends selective anemia screening at 4&#x02013;6 weeks postpartum for women who have had &#x0201c;anemia continued through the third trimester,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;excessive blood loss during delivery&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;multiple births.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Oral iron therapy is currently the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with iron deficiency anemia but it has disadvantages like poor absorption, poor compliance and gastro-intestinal (GI) side effects. Parenteral iron helps in restoring iron stores faster and more effectively than oral iron. intravenous (IV) iron sucrose is safe, effective, and economic in comparison to the repeated and painful intramuscular iron injections. Although the incidence of anaphylaxis and other adverse reactions with IV iron sucrose is markedly lower, multiple doses and prolonged infusion times are typically required.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) has a neutral pH (5.0-7.0) and physiological osmolarity, which makes it possible to administer its higher single doses over shorter time periods (single dose up to 1000 mg over 15 min) than other parenteral preparations.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Moreover, it does not contain dextran; therefore, the risk of anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions is very low, and a test dose is also not required. FCM though reported in the literature is yet to find its place in India for routine use. In this study, we compare and evaluate the safety and efficacy of IV FCM, iron sucrose and oral iron in the treatment of postpartum iron deficiency anemia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This comparative study was conducted at SCB Medical College, Cuttack, Odisha between September 2010 and August 2012.

The patients with hemoglobin (Hb) &#x0003c;10 g/dL, suffering from postpartum iron deficiency anemia were randomly categorized to receive IV FCM, IV iron sucrose or oral iron/ferrous ascorbate 100 mg daily. The adverse effects to drug administration in the three groups were recorded and treated if needed. Patients are having sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, aplastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia, anemia due to liver disease, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, history of recent blood transfusion and history of allergy to parenteral iron therapy were excluded from the study. Investigations, including peripheral smear, baseline serum ferritin and Hb levels were initially measured.

They were grouped according to the treatment they received viz., oral iron, iron sucrose or FCM. Double blinding was done to decide specific modality of treatment for a patient. A total of 300 women were analyzed (100 patients belonging to each group) after loss to follow-up; 30 in oral iron group, 22 in iron sucrose group and 14 in the FCM group. The demographic data like age, (body mass index), habitat, parity, presence of the antenatal anemia, mode of delivery and type of risk factors were comparable among the three groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Delivery by caesarean section, instrumental vaginal delivery, postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, placenta previa and multiple gestations were among the leading risk factors. Baseline Hb levels in the three groups was clinically insignificant. There was an overall increase in Hb and ferritin levels from baseline at 2 weeks and 6 weeks, which was significant between groups as well as within the group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). The mean baseline Hb and ferritin was the lowest in the FCM group, but it showed the highest increase when compared to the other two groups [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>].

The mean rise in Hb &#x000b1; standard deviation is depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>. Both forms of parenteral iron were found to cause a significant increase in Hb compared with oral iron in the three grades of anemia at 2 weeks and 6 weeks.

Both iron sucrose and FCM are a safe and effective treatment option for PPA, and there is no evidence of risk to their breastfed infants, but the ability to administer 1000 mg doses in a single sitting, fewer adverse reactions and better compliance makes FCM the first-line drug in the management of postpartum iron deficiency anemia causing a faster and higher replenishment of iron stores and correction of Hb levels. Being robust, it is associated with a low risk of oxidative stress reactions when compared to iron sucrose. It is closest to the ideal parenteral iron.

</p><p>Postpartum anemia is widespread in India. The total drug infusion concept with third-generation parenteral iron molecules is convenient for the patient and can save resources in the health care system, especially when compared with oral therapy and blood transfusions. Due to properties like ultra-short duration of treatment, no hospitalization required, lesser side-effects and quicker replenishing of iron stores, IV FCM may be considered early, while treating patient with postpartum iron deficiency anemia. In a few women with severe anemia and blunted erythropoietin due to infection and/or inflammation, FCM may be also considered in combination with recombinant human erythropoietin therapy. National health authorities should establish guidelines to combat iron deficiency in pregnancy and postpartum, thereby decreasing maternal mortality, morbidity, and infant morbidity in order to facilitate a prosperous future for both mothers and children in a continuing globalize world.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>R<sc>EFERENCES</sc></title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pavord</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Myers</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Allard</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Strong</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Oppenheimer</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>UK guidelines on the management of iron deficiency in pregnancy</article-title><source>Br J Haematol</source><year>2012</year><volume>156</volume><fpage>588</fpage><lpage>600</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22512001</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kouser</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Kouser</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Safety and efficacy of intravenous iron therapy in postnatal patients with iron deficiency anemia</article-title><source>J South Asian Fed Obstet Gynaecol</source><year>2011</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>25</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Somdatta</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Reddaiah</surname><given-names>VP</given-names></name><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of anaemia in the postpartum period: A study of a North Indian village</article-title><source>Trop Doct</source><year>2009</year><volume>39</volume><fpage>211</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19762572</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Reinold</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalenius</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Brindley</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Grummer-Strawn</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pregnancy Nutrition Surveillance 2007 Report</article-title><year>2009</year><publisher-loc>Atlanta</publisher-loc><publisher-name>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>EM</given-names></name><name><surname>Hendricks</surname><given-names>MK</given-names></name><name><surname>Beard</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray-Kolb</surname><given-names>LE</given-names></name><name><surname>Berg</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Tomlinson</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Mother-infant interactions and infant development are altered by maternal iron deficiency anemia</article-title><source>J Nutr</source><year>2005</year><volume>135</volume><fpage>850</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15795446</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sherrets</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Cusick</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Grosse</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Amendah</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Iron deficiency anemia among pregnant women: Screening and preventive medication</article-title><year>2009</year><date-in-citation>Last updated on 2011 Mar 10</date-in-citation><comment>Available from:
