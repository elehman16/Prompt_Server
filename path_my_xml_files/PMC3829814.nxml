Using a double-blinded, placebo-controlled anonymised design, the patients were divided equally into two groups. One group was given a dairy drink containing <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> Shirota to ingest daily while the other consumed a similar drink without bacteria. Participants attended the clinic on two consecutive days before the intervention and then again at the end of the study period. On the first day of each 2-day visit, following clinical examination, assessments were made of total nasal symptoms scores and peak nasal inspiratory flow. Nasal scrapings, nasal lavage and blood were collected for laboratory analyses of cellular phenotypes, soluble mediator release and <italic>in vitro</italic> responses to pollen allergen. These procedures were repeated 24 hours following nasal allergen challenge.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Prior to and following intervention there were no detectable differences between study groups in measured clinical outcome.

This makes the gastrointestinal microbiota composition of particular interest, as it provides a major source of immune stimulation and that seems to be a prerequisite for the development of oral tolerance. In allergic diseases, there is thought to be a dysregulation in the expression of T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 cytokines (Th2) which can be alleviated to some extent by <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> belonging to the natural intestinal microflora. One of the proposed mechanisms for this includes direct interaction of <italic>Lactobacilli</italic> with epithelial cells to modify their production of inflammatory mediators <xref rid="pone.0078650-Blaiss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.In a study of patients with allergic rhinitis out of the pollen season, 4 weeks' treatment with <italic>L. casei</italic> reduced the number of CD16/CD56 cells, <italic>L. plantarum</italic> decreased production of IL-5 and IL-13 and both probiotics reduced the amount of birch-pollen specific IgE <xref rid="pone.0078650-Snel1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. However, in this study immune parameters were determined in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures and the patients were not exposed to allergen, which makes it impossible to evaluate the impact of these findings on allergic disease. In our previous study involving patients with allergic rhinitis receiving <italic>L casei</italic> Shirota (LcS) or placebo for 5 months, we found a significant reduction in levels of antigen-induced IL-5, IL-6 and IFN-gamma production during the pollen season in the probiotic compared with placebo supplemented group. Meanwhile, serum levels of specific IgG increased and IgE decreased in the probiotic group <xref rid="pone.0078650-Ivory1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Several trials have investigated the clinical benefit of administering probiotic drinks to patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis <xref rid="pone.0078650-Vliagoftis1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> (SAR). The available data are inconclusive and often contradictory <xref rid="pone.0078650-Ishida1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078650-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078650-Aldinucci1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. We have therefore conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to test our hypothesis that daily consumption of <italic>Lc</italic>S over a period of four months will result in clinical improvement in an allergen challenge model of allergic rhinitis, with corresponding immunological changes at the nasal mucosa and in blood. There are specific difficulties associated with clinical trials in allergic rhinitis, such as variations between subjects in the extent of pollen sensitization due to differences in exposure to pollen. In order to control such variability we have used a single-dose allergen challenge in the clinic. Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) was selected as the primary end-point because the nasal symptom questionnaire is a convenient, reliable and valid method for assessing nasal symptom severity. Its principal use was to act as a primary outcome measure by comparing scores before and after treatment. Secondary end-points included peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) as a simple, objective measurement of nasal airflow and laboratory tests for local and systemic parameters of immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>CONSORT checklist and the protocol for this trial are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078650.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078650.s006">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the local Institute of Food Research Human Research Governance Committee (HRGC ref:IFR05/2009) and national Hertfordshire Research Ethics Committee NREC (ref:09/H0311/77).

The study was conducted out of the grass pollen season, between 11 September 2010 and 1 April 2011 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0078650.s006">Protocol S1</xref> for details of subject selection and randomisation) in accordance with Good Clinical Practice including Research Ethics Committee (07/MRE05/45) approval and all participants gave written informed consent. The study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. At first, procedures were undertaken to establish eligibility for recruitment to the study (described below). Following this, pre-intervention baseline measurements were made to document the intensity of local and systemic responses of each patient to a nasal allergen (pollen) challenge (NAC). At this time, patients were randomly allocated to either group A or group B by the study statistician, according to computer-generated randomisation code and given probiotic or placebo drink to consume daily. After 16 weeks each patient returned for post-intervention follow-up measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Subject Selection and Randomisation</title><p>Sixty volunteers with SAR to Timothy Grass pollen were recruited following screening for eligibility. Randomisation was performed by the study statistician using a computer generated code. Patients were randomised in blocks of 4 and 6 on a 1&#x02236;1 ratio with stratification for the presence/absence of asthma and presence/absence of allergy to tree pollen to receive 65 ml fermented milk drink containing 10&#x02227;9 <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> Shirota per ml or similar milk drink without Lactobacillus casei Shirota.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Study Visits and Measurements</title><p>At least 2 weeks following the screening visit, subjects returned for baseline assessments which consisted of measurements and sample acquisition before, and 24 hours following a single-dose nasal allergen challenge. Following clinical examination, baseline total nasal symptom scores (TNSS) and peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) were obtained in all patients on a 4-point Likert scale (0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no symptoms, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;maximum symptoms). Patients with asthma underwent spirometry using a Microlab spirometer (Micro Medical Ltd, Rochester, Kent, UK) as per American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines <xref rid="pone.0078650-Miller1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and recorded their total asthma symptom scores.

This was performed to find the dose for individual study participants at which maximum symptoms occurred and which would then be used as the challenging dose in the study itself. Blood was taken for laboratory analyses. Nasal lavage was performed according to the method described by Gr&#x000fc;nberg <italic>et al.</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078650-Grunberg1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> One to two nasal mucosal scrapes were obtained using a Rhino-probe curette (Arlington Scientific Inc., Springville, Utah, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>A single-dose nasal allergen challenge was undertaken using the concentration of allergen which approximated a TNSS of 4 during the incremental nasal allergen challenge. Nasal symptoms (described above) and PNIF (measured in duplicate) were recorded at 5, 10 and 30 minutes then hourly for 12 hours following the challenge. Patients with asthma recorded asthma symptoms, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) at 5, 10, 30 and 60 minutes following the nasal allergen challenge. Nasal lavage was obtained 30 minutes following the challenge in all patients who then returned to the clinic 24 hours later for nasal symptom scoring, PNIF, blood sampling, nasal lavage and nasal mucosal scraping, plus asthma symptom scoring and spirometry for asthmatic patients.</p><p>The procedures were repeated identically after the patients had received 16 weeks of study intervention. Post-intervention assessments were made no later than March for participants with grass and tree pollen allergy and no later than April for those with isolated grass pollen allergy.

After removal of supernatants, adherent and non-adherent cells were taken from culture, disaggregated and permeabilized before staining with fluorochrome-labelled antibodies. Cell surface CD86 (eBiosciences, Hatfield, UK), CD252 (Biolegend, London, UK) and intracellular cytokeratin (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) expression were documented by flow cytometry (Beckman Coulter FC500-MPL cytometer).</p><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) were derived from heparinised blood by density gradient centrifugation.

A sample size of 46 participants was calculated to provide 90% power to detect a treatment difference at a two-sided 5% significance level, if the true difference between the treatments is a TNSS of 1.5 following allergen challenge assuming a standard deviation of 1.5 <xref rid="pone.0078650-Dreskin1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Secondary endpoints were PNIF at 10 minutes, area under the curve for 12 hours following nasal allergen challenge (AUC12) for nasal symptoms scores and PNIF, phenotype of cells from nasal epithelial scrapings and peripheral blood or their secretions, as well as nasal lavage inflammatory mediator profile. Using total allergic rhinitis symptom score as the response variable and treatment, subject and time as explanatory factors, a repeated measures ANOVA was used to analyse the data including time as a random effect, also treatment group, baseline score and variables used in stratification were included as fixed effects. Similar ANOVA models were used to study the effect of the other measured response variables against treatment. No adjustments were made for baseline when no differences were noted between the four stratified groups in the study. The last number carried forward procedure was applied where there were missing data or patients failed to complete the 12 hour collection period. Laboratory data were analysed using Prism software and a two-tailed Mann-Whitney non-parametric U-test, without assumption of Gaussian distribution with 95% confidence interval (CI).

Following nasal challenge, levels of IL-1&#x003b2; normally increase but return to basal levels within 24 hours through sequestration by IL-1 responsive cells and normal clearance mechanisms. Interestingly, the treatment group showed a higher level of sIL-1RII. IL-1RII can act as an anti-inflammatory protein that functions as a decoy receptor by binding the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 <xref rid="pone.0078650-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> produced by nasal epithelial cells <xref rid="pone.0078650-Sim1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. IL-1 can enhance mast cell cytokine secretion and histamine release and studies in mice suggest its contribution to the pathogenesis of allergic rhinitis <xref rid="pone.0078650-Nambu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. IL-1 and IL-1R regulation may therefore be an important contributory factor to the inflammation that occurs with allergen exposure <xref rid="pone.0078650-Gupta1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It has been shown that soluble IL-1RII binds IL-1&#x003b2; to generate a composite binding surface to recruit soluble IL-1 receptor accessory protein (sIL-1RAcP) that serves to increase the affinity of sIL-1RII for IL-1&#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0078650-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> while also stabilizing the [IL-1+IL-1RII] complex <xref rid="pone.0078650-Wesche1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. In that case, IL-1 would be prevented from participating in the proinflammatory response and its kinetics of degradation would also be altered resulting in its prolonged detection.</p><p>The presence of IL-1&#x003b2; in nasal lavage before allergen challenge indicates its constitutive production in our allergic subjects, as described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0078650-Nambu1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Similarly, CD86+ cells were constitutively present in our nasal mucosal scrapes, possibly through upregulation by IL-1&#x003b2; <xref rid="pone.0078650-Takizawa1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. The percentages of CD86+ cells that we detected at the epithelial mucosa were relatively small, and lower than those described by others <xref rid="pone.0078650-Chieppa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, a discrepancy that we believe can be attributed to the more stringent flow cytometry gating strategy we adopted. To date, few studies have looked at co-stimulatory molecules on mucosal surfaces but an investigation using a single-cell suspension from freshly resected human inferior nasal turbinates of a healthy individual found only 0.02% of CD86+ dendritic cells <xref rid="pone.0078650-Hartmann1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, considerably less than were detected in our study. Viewed in the context of the whole nasal mucosa, small percentages may represent a sizeable total cell count. Indeed, it is known that small scale events taking place at the mucosal interface, such as direct dendritic cell sampling, play a major role in shaping the local immunological microenvironment <xref rid="pone.0078650-Chieppa1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A lower expression of CD86 in our control group can be explained by the work of Qureshi and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0078650-Qureshi1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> who show that T cells typically infiltrate the mucosa during an allergic response. On their activation, CD86 molecules on the plasma membrane of APCs co-localize with CTLA-4 on T cells and are then transendocytosed into the T cells with subsequent loss from the surface of APCs, an event of clear immunological relevance. Although we did not test for the presence of T cells or their expression of CTLA-4, a failure by the treatment group to alter their CD86 expression following nasal pollen challenge is consistent with the above observations. It also concurs with the study of Rasche and her colleagues who found higher CD86 expression after co-stimulation of PBMNC with allergen plus <italic>Lactobacillus</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0078650-Rasche1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><p>As in Rasche's study, we observed that the culture supernatants from <italic>in vitro</italic> challenged PBMNC had lower levels of sCD23 in the treatment compared with control group. Due to the multiple forms of CD23, its many ligands and various activities of the different complexes, the mechanisms involved in Th2 regulation by CD23 are not fully understood. Although the soluble form of CD23 (sCD23) can both enhance and inhibit Th2-type responses, serum levels of this molecule are higher in patients suffering from allergic disorders <xref rid="pone.0078650-Rogala1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. A recent study has shown that sCD23 can amplify Th2 responses and that this effect depends on cleavage of membrane-bound CD23 from the cell surface <xref rid="pone.0078650-Cooper1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>sCD23 has been shown to be regulated by IFN-&#x003b3; and in our study lower levels of sCD23 in the treatment group were accompanied by their higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3;, associated with abated Th2 reactions. This is consistent with findings from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of Roever and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0078650-Roever1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> who showed that the addition of neutralizing anti-IFN-&#x003b3; antibodies increased CD23 expression on B cells stimulated with IL-4 and Birch Pollen Allergen. <italic>In vivo</italic>, pre-seasonal use of specific immunotherapy (SIT) has resulted in a higher frequency of IFN-&#x003b3;-producing cells with improvement of both symptoms and medication use during the pollen season <xref rid="pone.0078650-Ciprandi1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, a reversal of established Th2 allergic responses has been shown to occur by an IFN-&#x003b3;-dependent mechanism acting both locally and systemically <xref rid="pone.0078650-Fonseca1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078650-Hamid1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p><p>Studies of oral tolerance and experimental colitis indicate that reciprocal IFN-&#x003b3; and TGF-&#x003b2; responses regulate the occurrence of mucosal inflammation <xref rid="pone.0078650-Strober1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. It is also known that TGF-&#x003b2; can inhibit IFN-&#x003b3; production and vice-versa <xref rid="pone.0078650-Trotta1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078650-Wen1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This would support the findings of our study where lower TGF-&#x003b2; production within the treatment group concurred with their higher levels of IFN-&#x003b3;. In patients with allergic rhinitis, it is known that the production of TGF-&#x003b2;1 drives airway remodelling and facilitates on-going inflammation <xref rid="pone.0078650-Shen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Evidence has also been provided for a correlation between TGF-&#x003b2; and higher intraepithelial mast cell numbers with co-localised TGF-beta receptors, suggesting that the expression of TGF-&#x003b2; may represent an important biological process involved in either the recruitment or retention of mast cells within the epithelium in naturally occurring allergic rhinitis <xref rid="pone.0078650-Salib1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078650-Olsson1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0078650-Gruber1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. While all of the above point towards a benefit of lower TGF-&#x003b2; levels in allergic rhinitis, pollen-specific immunotherapy significantly increases serum TGF-&#x003b2; levels that are correlated with higher IgA synthesis <xref rid="pone.0078650-Ciprandi2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, down-regulation of Th2 responses <xref rid="pone.0078650-Wachholz1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and prevention of eosinophilia and inflammation <xref rid="pone.0078650-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Thus, the regulatory role of TGF-&#x003b2; is both pleiotropic and complex and the significance of its fluctuating levels needs to be evaluated in the context of other immunological, clinical and environmental factors.</p><p>Our study shows that the interaction of probiotic organisms with the intestinal mucosa affects the nasal mucosa. To our knowledge this is the first time such an event has been documented. The biological relevance of this finding lies in the notion that events at mucosal surfaces have a systemic element to them, as evidenced by changes in blood seen in our study after nasal allergen challenge and these could influence the ensuing immune response. Indeed, a single bronchial allergen challenge with House Dust Mite (HDM) is accompanied by increased levels of allergen-specific IgE for HDM in serum and an enhanced Th2 response to HDM still detectable 5 weeks after challenge <xref rid="pone.0078650-vandePol1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.</p><p>In our single-dose nasal allergen challenge model we did not detect any clinically meaningful or statistically significant benefit in terms of nasal symptoms or nasal inspiratory flow following 16 weeks of probiotic consumption. There were no significant differences either in asthma symptoms or lung function when compared with pretreatment measures. In addition to this, our study did not show any effect in terms of asthma symptoms or lung function. This result is in keeping with an earlier study with <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species where no effect was noted in clinical outcomes <xref rid="pone.0078650-Wheeler1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, although our study included a small number of asthmatic patients all of whom had mild symptoms only. In agreement with an absence of statistically significant changes in clinical parameters, there were no group-specific differences in the laboratory analyses of classically allergy-associated components such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, TSLP or pollen-specific Igs, tested either in serum, nasal lavage, epithelial cell secretions or peripheral blood.</p><p>Lack of changes in the clinical symptoms could be explained by an inability of a single nasal allergen challenge to reproduce the chronicity of a natural allergen exposure. Although this approach has the advantage of overcoming the variable nature of pollen exposure <xref rid="pone.0078650-Demoly1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, it does not represent a real-life situation where individuals are exposed to lower concentrations of allergen over a prolonged period of time. In our study, differences in responses seen to nasal challenge alone and those following further <italic>in vitro</italic> challenge suggests that both allergen dose and multiplicity of challenge can influence the outcome. The need to find a model closer to natural allergen exposure has led to the development of strategies consisting of performing daily challenges with the chosen allergen and to repeat the process over a few consecutive days. However, even this does not mimic natural exposure to allergen since it does not induce lower airway inflammation that is commonly found in rhinitis subjects naturally exposed to allergen during the pollen season <xref rid="pone.0078650-Rousseau1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>.</p><p>We interpreted these data as showing that the interaction of probiotic organisms with the intestinal mucosa can have effects at a distant mucosal site, the nasal mucosa and suggest that single nasal allergen challenges, while permitting control of allergen exposure, may not replicate natural exposure to allergen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0078650.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
