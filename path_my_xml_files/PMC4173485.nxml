Various attempts have been made to attenuate these responses. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of esmolol and lidocaine for suppressing cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in a normotensive African population.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 120 adult patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II undergoing various elective surgeries. The patients were randomly divided into three groups of 40 patients in each group - C, L, and E. Group - &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; received no drug (control) as placebo, group -&#x0201c;L&#x0201d; received 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> preservative free lidocaine and group -&#x0201c;E&#x0201d; received 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> esmolol IV 2 min before intubation. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) and rate-pressure product (RPP) were measured before induction as baseline and after tracheal intubation at minute 1, 3, and 5. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either saline (Group C), lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg (Group L), or esmolol 2 mg/kg (Group E) (<italic>n</italic> = 40, each group). After induction of general anesthesia with thiopental 6 mg/kg and vecuronium 0.12 mg/kg, the test solution was infused 2 min before tracheal intubation. Changes in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), and rate-pressure product (RPP) were measured before induction of general anesthesia (baseline), 1, 3, and 5 min after tracheal intubation. Patients were also observed for any complications.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was a significant increase in HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, and RPP from the base line in control group &#x0201c;C&#x0201d; at 1 min with onward decreases at 3 and 5 min respectively after intubation. Percentage change in hemodynamic variables in groups C, L, and E at 1 min are as follows: HR = 30.45, 26.00, and 1.50%; MAP = 20.80, 15.89, and 10.20%; RP<italic>P</italic> = 61.44, 40.86, and 11.68%, respectively. Only patients receiving placebo had increased HR, MAP, and RP<italic>P</italic> values after intubation compared with baseline values (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Prophylactic therapy with 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> esmolol is more effective and safe for attenuating cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in a black population.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Blood pressure</kwd><kwd>esmolol</kwd><kwd>lidocaine</kwd><kwd>heart rate</kwd><kwd>intubation</kwd><kwd>laryngoscopy</kwd><kwd>Ghana (Source: MeSH</kwd><kwd>NLM)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cardiovascular complications are one of the most common causes of anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Direct laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation frequently induces a cardiovascular stress response characterized by hypertension and tachycardia due to reflex sympathetic simulation. The response is transient occurring 30 sec after intubation and lasting for less than 10 min.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] It may be well tolerated in healthy people, but may be hazardous in patients with hypertension, tachycardia, myocardial infarction, and other complications.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Various pharmacological approaches have been used to attenuate the pressure responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Specific racial differences need to be considered before treatment as it was found that African-Americans respond less well to beta adrenergic receptor blocking drugs as whites do.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The present work was undertaken to compare the effect of lidocaine and esmolol on blunting the hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation in normotenseive black patients.</p><p>Perioperative myocardial infarction is a leading cause of postoperative morbidity and mortality due to hypertension and tachycardia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Studies from the African continent report avoidable anesthesia mortality rates of 1:1900 in Zambia,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] 1:500 in Malawi[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and 1:150 in Togo.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Such anesthesia-related deaths could be reduced by controlling the hemodynamic changes that occur due to myocardial ischemia. There is increasing evidence that the control of the heart rate and blood pressure response to endotracheal intubation is essential in preventing adverse cardiovascular outcomes, as rate pressure product (RPP) acts as an indicator of oxygen demand by the heart at the onset of ischemia,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] there is therefore a need for assessment in this direction as there are currently no available studies in the Ghanaian population on the efficacy of lidocaine and esmolol in attenuating hemodynamic responses during intubation. Efforts are being made in Ghana to practice safe anesthesia and reduce perioperative complications and mortality during anesthesia. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and safety of intravenous lidocaine and esmolol in attenuating hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation in a Ghanaian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was undertaken after an institutional approval by the Committee on Human Research Publications and Ethics was obtained. The study was conducted from November 2011 to May 2012. Informed consent was obtained from 120 patients. The study population consisted of ASA physical status I or II, male and female adults between the ages of 18-65 years scheduled for various elective surgical procedures.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a prospective, randomized, and double blinded clinical comparison study in a Black population. The Sample size for the study was 120 generated using a sample size calculator. The study participants were randomly divided into three groups by a computer generated randomization table. A study nurse (Person A) who was not involved in the randomization process prepared the study drugs, all of which were diluted to 10 milliliters. All three drugs were coded to enhance blinding. Person B monitored the heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) with respect to time whilst Person C was responsible for intubation of the patients. Person A and C were kept constant throughout the study. Person B, C, and the patient were kept unaware of the drug injected to enable double-blinding.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>For the study were ASA class I or II, age range 18-65, oropharyngeal anatomy of Mallampati class I and any operation other than cardiac surgery performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>For the study included patients who were morbidly obese, patients with cardiovascular disease, heart rate &#x0003c; 60 beats per minute (bpm), basal SBP &#x0003c; 100 mm Hg and other conditions such as bronchial asthma, diabetes mellitus, drug allergies, and total duration of laryngoscopy was noted and in cases where duration exceeded 15 sec was excluded from study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Pre-surgical protocol</title><p>The day prior to surgery all patients underwent a pre-anesthetic evaluation with special consideration to elicit a history of hypertension, dyspnoea, chest pain, cough, wheezing, convulsions, and diabetes mellitus as well as previous anesthetic history and drug sensitivity. Information collected also included weight, nutritional status, airway assessment by the Mallampatti scoring system, a detailed examination of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and central nervous system. A preoperative routine investigations such as hemoglobin, hematocrit, total lymphocyte count, differential lymphocyte count, serum electrolytes, blood group/Rh typing, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, fasting blood sugar, chest radiography, and electro-cardiogram in all patients. Patients were advised to fast the night prior to surgery.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Surgical protocol</title><p>After patient identification a short preoperative history was taken, clinical examination and routine investigations were rechecked in all patients. Study objective and procedure were explained to the participants and a written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p><p>Intravenous access was secured and infusion of Ringer's lactate solution started. The patients were pre-medicated with 0.008 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> glycopyrrolate-bromide intramuscularly 30 min prior to surgery. Patients were then shifted to the operating room after which routine non-invasive monitor Infinity Delta XL Drager was applied and vital signs monitored. Midazolam 0.04 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> was administered intravenously over 30 sec as premedication and patients were pre-oxygenated with four to five breaths of 100% oxygen. The patients were induced with 6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> IV thiopentone sodium in incremental doses until loss of eyelash reflex occurred, 0.12 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> IV vecuronium bromide was given over 20 sec, followed up by administering the study drugs (normal saline, esmolol, or lignocaine) 2 min before laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>The study drug was randomly allocated to patients in a double blinded manner. Patients were ventilated with oxygen and 1% halothane using IPPV with a fresh gas flow of 6 litres min<sup>-1</sup> by Bain circuit until intubation. About 2 min after IV vecuronium, laryngoscopy was performed with a Macintosh laryngoscope blade and trachea intubated with an appropriate size cuffed endotracheal tube. After confirmation of correct placement of ET tube, anesthesia was then maintained with O<sub>2</sub> and halothane.</p><p>HR, SBP, DBP, MAP, RPP (rate pressure product), SpO<sub>2</sub> (oxygen saturation), and ECG (electrocardiogram) changes were recorded before induction (Basal) and after tracheal intubation at 1, 3, and 5 min for the purpose of this study. No manipulation like painting and draping the area of operation was allowed till 10 min after the study drug administration.

Beta-blockers are generally less effective in black hypertensives as a result of the tendency toward a low-renin state and with increased peripheral resistance. Higher doses of beta-blockers are therefore required to achieve target blood pressures in Black populations.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] &#x000df;-blocker esmolol possesses several properties which make it a valuable agent to obtund the cardiovascular response. Firstly, it is a cardio selective agent, and secondly it has ultra short duration of action (9 min)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and finally, significant drug interaction with commonly used anesthetics has not been reported.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Korpinen <italic>et al</italic>. (1998) reported that the administration of esmolol bolus 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> IV 2 min before laryngoscopy and intubation suppressed the increase in the heart rate rather than arterial blood pressures.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Bostana and Eroglu (2012) reported that IV esmolol in dose of 1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> before intubation was effective in suppressing the heart rate and arterial blood pressure.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. (2003) have also claimed optimal results while using higher doses of esmolol in Asian population, i.e., 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> without any incidence of unplanned hypotension or bradycardia. However, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimum dose and timing of its delivery.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Lidocaine has been a popular agent for attenuating circulatory responses. The beneficial effect of lidocaine is due to its direct cardiac depression and peripheral vasodilation,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] its ability to suppress airway reflexes elicited by irritation of tracheal mucosa and its analgesic as well as antiarrythmia properties. Some studies have reported beneficial effects[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] while others showed no effect of intravenous lignocaine administered 1, 2, or 3 min before laryngescopy.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The hemodynamic changes in HR, MAP, and RPP from baseline values 1 min after tracheal intubation, in esmolol group were highly significantly less than those in lidocaine. Our failure to detect any significant effect of lidocaine as compared to esmolol on stress response could be due to the fact that we performed this study in patients without heart disease while Stoelting <italic>et al</italic>. included patients with heart disease and reported a favorable response.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Studies have shown that there is increased incidence of myocardial infarction when intraoperative heart rates are more than110 beats min<sup>-1</sup>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In our study none of the patients in study groups showed heart rate &#x0003e;110 beats min<sup>-1</sup>.</p><p>RPP is a good estimate of myocardial oxygen requirement. The RPP levels close to 20,000 are normally associated with angina and myocardial ischemia.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] RPP 1 min after intubation remained less than 20,000 in study drug groups. This finding confirms the cardio-protective effect of study drugs during laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>In conclusion, the present data suggest that lidocaine 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> when injected 2 min before intubation can blunt the cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation successfully. However, the prophylactic therapy with esmolol 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> when injected 2 min before intubation is significantly more effective than lidocaine in suppressing hemodynamic changes to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation in normotensive black patients. The dosage and timing of administration of drugs are important factors that determine whether they will have beneficial effect on the laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, therefore further research is necessary to elucidate the effects of different doses of esmolol in black population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and esmolol (2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) are effective agents in suppressing the hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation without any deleterious effect. Esmolol 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> appears to be very effective and should be viewed as potential treatment strategy for attenuating hemodynamic changes during induction of anesthesia in Ghanaian population.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Savio</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name><name><surname>Tait</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Karkouti</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Wijeysundera</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>McCluskey</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Beattie</surname><given-names>WS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The safety of perioperative esmolol: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>2011</year><volume>112</volume><fpage>267</fpage><lpage>81</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21127279</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wakhloo</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Mehta</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kapoor</surname><given-names>BB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of Esmolol and Lignocaine for attenuation of cardiovascular stress response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation</article-title><source>JK Science</source><year>2009</year><volume>11</volume><fpage>78</fpage><lpage>81</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Manjunath</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name><name><surname>Venkatesh</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name><name><surname>Prima</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Jennifer</surname><given-names>LV</given-names></name><name><surname>Sathees</surname><given-names>BC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Can calcium and sodium channel blockers attenuate hemodynamic responses to endotracheal intubation?</article-title><source>Eur J Gen Med</source><year>2008</year><volume>5</volume><fpage>198</fpage><lpage>207</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rupakar</surname><given-names>VB</given-names></name><name><surname>Raval</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Chadha</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Attenuation of cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation with diltiazem-lignocaine combination</article-title><source>J Anaesthesiol Clin Pharmacol</source><year>2009</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>341</fpage><lpage>4</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Materson</surname><given-names>BJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Reda</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Cushman</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Single-drug therapy for hypertension in men.
