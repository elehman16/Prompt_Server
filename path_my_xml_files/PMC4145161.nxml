Methylnaltrexone for the treatment of OIC is significantly more effective than placebo, but only in about fifty percent of the patients regardless of dose increase. Dose increases cause increased toxicity without additional efficacy, and are therefore not recommended.</p><p>While methylnaltrexone is a &#x003bc;-receptor antagonist, only a few opioids are solely &#x003bc;-receptor agonists. Therefore, the response to methylnaltrexone may be determined by the receptor-profile of a specific opioid. In addition, methylnaltrexone may also affect the immune system and angiogenesis as was found in pre-clinical studies. Primary aim of this study is to determine differences in the efficacy of methylnaltrexone prescribed to resolve opioid induced constipation between three commonly used opioid subtypes: morphine sulphate, oxycodone and fentanyl. Secondary aim is to explore potential immunomodulatory and antiangiogenic effects of methylnaltrexone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this multi-center, prospective, parallel group trial we will evaluate the efficacy of methylnaltrexone in resolving OIC occurring as a side effect of the most common opioid subtypes: morphine, oxycodone and fentanyl. In total 195 patients with OIC despite prophylactic laxatives will receive methylnaltrexone every other day up to fourteen days. Patients will report its effect in a laxation diary. Group allocation is based on the opioid type the patient is using. At the start and end of the study period patients complete the Bowel Function Index questionnaire. A subgroup of the patients will donate blood for analysis of immunomodulatory- and anti-angiogenic effects of methylnaltrexone.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we aim to determine the efficacy of methylnaltrexone per opioid subtype to reduce constipation.

It leads to a noticeable decrease in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] by causing physical symptoms such as bloating and straining, and sometimes necessitates hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Constipation can have multiple causes, which can be divided into anorectal dysfunction, or slow colon transit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In palliative care for patients with cancer mechanical obstruction by tumor depositions or ascites might also be a cause of constipation, but often constipation is caused by opioid use. The incidence of opioid induced constipation (OIC) is estimated to vary between 35 and 70% of the patients using opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This large range is probably caused by variation in type and dosage of opioids, the amount of (prophylactic) laxatives used and the way patients are monitored for this side effect in different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The Rome criteria (currently version III) are generally used to diagnose constipation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. According to the Rome III criteria for constipation, a patient must have experienced at least 2 of the following symptoms over the preceding 3&#x000a0;months with symptom onset at least 6&#x000a0;months before diagnosis: fewer than 3 bowel movements per week, straining, lumpy or hard stools, sensation of anorectal obstruction, sensation of incomplete defecation, and/or manual maneuvering required to defecate. However, these diagnostic criteria might not be applicable to patients with OIC, because they require the presence of complaints for at least six months, while OIC usually develops within days to weeks and might need urgent treatment. Therefore, a practical definition of OIC is a decrease of the frequency of bowel movements after initiation of opioids to a frequency of less than three bowel movements per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. To prevent OIC, guidelines recommend prophylactic laxatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Most patients are able to manage their bowel movements by in- or decreasing the dosage of the laxatives they use. However, 12-20% of the patients report symptoms of OIC despite laxative prescription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. For these patients methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist, can be a valuable therapeutic option.</p><p>Opioids exert their action through the opioid-receptors. These receptors are present in the central nervous system but also in peripheral tissues. Under normal conditions opioid receptors are receptive to endogenous opioids, such as enkephalins and endorphins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The three major types of opioid receptors are the mu (&#x003bc;), kappa (&#x003ba;) and delta (&#x003b4;) opioid receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The affinity for the different receptors varies between different types of opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. How each receptor type contributes to OIC is not fully understood. There is evidence that each receptor type has an effect on gastro-intestinal motility and fluid secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous studies suggest that these effects are mainly mediated by the peripheral opioid receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><sec><title>Methylnaltrexone</title><p>Methylnaltrexone (Relistor&#x000ae;) is an opioid receptor antagonist which blocks opioid binding at the &#x003bc;-receptor but also has some affinity for the &#x003ba;-receptor. It is a quaternary derivative of naltrexone with restricted ability to cross the blood&#x02013;brain barrier. It therefore functions as a peripherally acting opioid antagonist, which reduces the opioid-induced decrease in gastrointestinal motility and delay in gastrointestinal transit time, and thereby reduces OIC. Methylnaltrexone does not affect opioid analgesic effects or induce opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is excreted by the kidneys and in the feces and has a plasma half life of approximately 8&#x000a0;hours. The most common side effects of methylnaltrexone are abdominal pain, nausea, flatulence, and diarrhea, which are likely to be related to increased peristaltic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Methylnaltrexone has been approved by the FDA and EMA for patients who receive palliative care (regardless of medical condition) with OIC despite prophylactic laxative use.</p><p>Methylnaltrexone for the treatment of OIC is significantly more effective than placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, in both the randomized and open-label phases of the pivotal multi-center trial, methylnaltrexone produced rescue-free laxation in only about half the patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Dose increases did not influence these results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. There may be several reasons for this observation. First, constipation in palliative care patients may have multiple simultaneously occurring causes, unrelated to opioid therapy. Second, assuming that the constipation of the non-responders is still opioid-induced, one can hypothesize that the response to methylnaltrexone could be determined by the receptor-profile of the specific opioid the patient is using (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This is because methylnaltrexone is primarily a &#x003bc;-receptor antagonist, while not all opioids are solely &#x003bc;-receptor agonists. A frequently prescribed opioid like oxycodone is a &#x003ba;-receptor and &#x003b4;-receptor agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] as well as &#x003bc;-receptor agonist, whereas morphine and fentanyl are both mainly &#x003bc;-receptor agonists. Morphine and fentanyl, on the other hand, differ in their lipid solubility and their tendency to sequestrate in the central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This may possibly contribute to differences in response to methylnaltrexone, because methylnaltrexone is unable to pass the blood&#x02013;brain barrier.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Opioid characteristics regarding constipation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Opioid</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Receptor affinity</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Lipophilicity</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Distribution site</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Incidence of constipation</bold><sup>

Therefore, we recently initiated a clinical trial to determine whether different receptor-profiles of opioids are related to the efficacy of methylnaltrexone.</p><p>Besides constipation, there are other side effects of opioids that might be of clinical importance. Acute and chronic use of opioids is known to have inhibitory effects on humoral and cellular immune responses and may also have a stimulating effect on angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. &#x0039c;u-type opioid receptors are identified in several immunological cell subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and it has been demonstrated that opioids suppress T cell functioning and the production of several cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Activation of the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor expressed on endothelial cells stimulates angiogenesis and a synergistic effect of morphine sulphate with VEGF has been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Methylnaltrexone could be of additive value to prevent this unwanted immunomodulatory and angiogenic activity of opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, we will study the effects of methylnaltrexone on immunomodulatory and angiogenic activity in patients during treatment with this agent.</p></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><p>Primary aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of a fixed dose of subcutaneous methylnaltrexone to induce laxation in patients who suffer from constipation due to either fentanyl, oxycodone or morphine sulphate despite optimal prophylactic laxative use.</p><p>Secondary aims are 1) to determine size, phenotype, and function of various leukocyte subsets as well as serum cytokine levels during treatment with the &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist methylnaltrexone and 2) to determine whether systemic antagonistic treatment with methylnaltrexone will modify systemic biomarkers of angiogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study is a multi-center, prospective, parallel-group, observational study to compare the efficacy of methylnaltrexone between patient groups using different types of opioids.

We ask patients for informed consent to participate in this study if they suffer from OIC caused by morphine, oxycodone or fentanyl, despite prophylactic laxative use. Patients should use only one subtype of maintenance opioids, but (short-acting) rescue doses of another opioid subtype are allowed for up to two doses a day. Rescue doses of a short-acting form of the same opioid subtype as the maintenance opioid can be used in any dosing frequency. With this maximum of two doses the rescue opioid will not have a therapeutic level during a significant part of the day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Patients should be on a stable laxative regimen for at least 3&#x000a0;days before the first dose of methylnaltrexone.

Patients also note an average pain score for each day, the occurrence of side effects and use of rescue laxatives in the laxation diary. The BFI consists of three questions about symptoms of constipation experienced during the past week.

Based on the receptor-profile and pharmacokinetics of the different opioids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] we hypothesize that methylnaltrexone will induce successful laxation in 60% of the patients in the morphine group, 60% of the patients in the oxycodone group and in 25% of the patients in the fentanyl group within 4&#x000a0;hours after at least 2 of the first 4 doses (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). For testing two hypotheses, being a 35% difference in response rate between the morphine group vs. the fentanyl group and a 35% difference in response rate between the oxycodone group vs. the fentanyl group, we used a corrected &#x003b1; of .025 instead of .05. This hypotheses will be tested against the null-hypothesis that there is no difference between the efficacy of methylnaltrexone between the different opioid subtypes. Calculation of the sample size performed with STATA 11, using a power of 0.8 and an &#x003b1; of .025 in a two sided test, results in 62 patients in the morphine sulphate group, 62 patients in the oxycodone group and 31 patients in the fentanyl group. Taking into account an expected drop-out rate of 20% we aim to include 78, 78 and 39 patients respectively.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Expected response rate to methylnaltrexone</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Opioid</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Probability that constipation is opioid induced</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Occupation of the peripheral &#x003bc; receptor by opioid subtype</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Expected response rate to methylnaltrexone</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Morphine Sulphate</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">70%<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">High<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">60%<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><bold>Oxycodone</bold><hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">75%<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Intermediate-high<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">60%<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold>Fentanyl</bold></td><td align="left">40%</td><td align="left">Low</td><td align="left">25%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Based on the data in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, we expect a high probability that the constipation is opioid induced for morphine sulphate and oxycodone. This is in contrast with a low probability that it is opioid induced for fentanyl. Because morphine sulphate primarily acts on the peripheral mu receptor, we expect a good response rate to methylnaltrexone. The combination of a high probability that the constipation is opioid induced in the oxycodone group, with its activity on both the central and the peripheral mu, kappa, and gamma receptor leads to an expected response rate that equals that of morphine sulphate. For the fentanyl group both the low probability that the constipation is opioid induced, and the sequestration in the central nerve system lead to a very low expected response rate to methylnaltrexone.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Based on the sample size of the three groups it seems feasible to include 20 patients of each group in the exploratory part of the study, in which the immunologic and angiogenic effects of methylnaltrexone are studied.

Despite prophylactic laxatives, up to 20 percent of patients using opioids will develop opioid induced constipation (OIC). Methylnaltrexone, a peripherally acting &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist, is designed to displace the opioid from peripheral receptors in the gut, thereby decreasing the opioid's constipating effects and inducing laxation, without reducing analgesia.</p><p>In current practice it is used as rescue medication after failure of standard (combination) laxative therapy. Methylnaltrexone prescribed in an earlier stage could avoid severe OIC symptoms. The reasons for this rescue strategy are mainly based on the fact that methylnaltrexone has only been tested as rescue medication for OIC and that the costs of methylnaltrexone are higher than those of other laxatives. Reports of gastrointestinal perforations after use of methylnaltrexone might have resulted in more reluctance to prescribe this drug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Another important factor that tempers the use of methylnaltrexone is the observation that only half of the patients respond to this treatment. We hypothesize that the response rate is dependent on the receptor profile of the opioid that is causing constipation. Consequently, it should be possible to optimize clinical benefit of methylnaltrexone by prescribing this in an earlier stage of constipation treatment to patients who are likely to respond. In this study we will evaluate differences in efficacy of methylnaltrexone in reducing OIC between the commonly prescribed opioid subtypes morphine sulphate, oxycodone and fentanyl.</p><p>As this is a prospective study, we have the benefit of adequate power compared to a subset analysis of previous studies. We will evaluate the objective response (number of laxations) in combination with the clinical benefit as is rated on the Bowel Function Index.</p><p>In this study the opioid subtypes the patients are using are not randomized, but based on the preference of the treating physician and the side effects experienced by patients. Although this might influence the incidence of OIC, it should not influence the efficacy of methylnaltrexone for a specific opioid subtype.</p><p>We have not included a placebo treatment group, because methylnaltrexone is already proven effective and cannot be withheld from patients for ethical reasons.</p><p>In this study rescue opioids of a different subtype than the maintenance opioid are allowed, with a maximum of two rescue doses per day. This decision is based on the fact that in daily practice a majority of patients use opioid combination regimens with a difference in prescribed subtypes of rescue- and maintenance opioids. We have set a cut-off at two rescue-opioid doses a day. This is based on the pharmacokinetic properties of rescue opioids, which will not have therapeutic levels during a significant part of the day when they are administered twice a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The possibility that these rescue opioids contribute to the development of OIC, even in these low doses, can however not be ruled out.</p><p>The exploratory laboratory part of this study is of particular interest when the anti-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects found in pre-clinical studies are clinically confirmed. If methylnaltrexone inhibits this pro-angiogenic and immunomodulatory effects of opioids, a randomized controlled trial investigating the effects of opioids with or without methylnaltrexone on tumor progression and survival could be a next step.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>ECN participated in the design of the study, coordinates the conduct of the trial and drafted the manuscript.
