In 2012, about 34,000 new cases of SCLC have occurred in the United States, in the majority attributable to cigarette smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>SCLC tends to disseminate early in the course of its natural history and to grow quickly. Approximately 10% to 18% of patients present with brain metastases (BM) at the time of initial diagnosis, and in an additional 40% to 50% will develop BM some time during course of their disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Although the incidence of SCLC is decreased in recent years, it remains a therapeutic challenge, as survival in patients with limited disease has not changed markedly over the past 25&#x000a0;years, reaching approximately 20% to 25% at 5&#x000a0;years in the best published series of patients treated with a multimodality approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]</p><p>SCLC has a propensity for early hematogenous spread and for association with paraneoplastic syndromes and is characterized by its rapid doubling time, high growth fraction and high, but short-lasting, chemosensitivity.</p><p>Paraneoplastic syndromes are more frequently seen in patients with limited-stage SCLC. Than in those with extensive-stage disease, but their presence is not unequivocally prognostically favourable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment and Cisplatin-Etoposide (PE) is still considered the world-wide standard since over 25&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Approximately one-third of patients diagnosed with SCLC present with LD, with a median survival time of 15&#x02013;20 months, compared to 7&#x02013;8 months for patients with ED. An overall response to combination chemotherapy is achieved in 80-90% of LD patients and in 60-80% of patients with ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>Also the complete response rate is influenced by the extension of the disease, and is significantly higher in patients with limited disease (30-50%) compared to patients with extended disease (15-30%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Since 90s, several studies have been conducted adding ifosfamide, an analogue of cyclophosphamide, to the PE combination, based on his single-agent activity and low toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>The randomized trial of the Hoosier Oncology Group in 171 ED pts showed a significant advantage in overall survival in the arm treated with PEI, compared to PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Despite that, PEI has not become a commonly used regimen in SCLC, maybe because its less convenient schedule, requiring 4 consecutive days of chemotherapy. Relying on its efficacy and manageable toxicity, PEI was the reference schedule for the treatment of SCLC, in our centre since 15&#x000a0;years.</p><p>Primary objective of the present retrospective study is to evaluate the activity of PEI in the SCLC in terms of: response rate, time to progression and overall survival, in patient with LD or ED, treated in first line. Secondary objective were: the analysis of the dose intensity of chemotherapy and the evaluation of the tolerability in terms of toxicity and adverse events.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><p>Between December 1998 and December 2008, 46 consecutive patients, older than 18&#x000a0;years, performans status (PS) &#x0003c;2, with localized (LD) and extensive stage (ED) SCLC presenting to the Medical Oncology Unit of Reggio Emilia (Italy) were treated, in first line, with PEI regimen.

There were no differences in response rates or in median survival time for LD (10.9 vs 12.6&#x000a0;months) and ED (8.3 vs 7.5&#x000a0;months) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>A Cochrane systemic review of platinum vs non-platinum chemotherapy regimens evaluated 29 trials with 5530 patients and concluded that platinum-based chemotherapy regimens did not offer a statistically significant benefit in either overall response or survival compared to non-platinum chemotherapy.</p><p>Subsequentely, a Japanase study, in 2002, reported that irinotecan and cisplatin combination resulted in a substantial improvement in survival compared with treatment with PE (median survival 12.8 vs 9.4&#x000a0;months) in ED [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The authors concludes that the combination of irinoteca and cisplatin was an attractive option for patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer who have a good performance status.</p><p>Numerous other drugs have been studied in combination with platinum, without substantial improvemet in median survival or response rate.</p><p>Combination chemotherapy of belotecan (is a new camptothecin-derivative antitumor agent that belongs to the topoisomerase inhibitors) and cisplatin showed promising efficacy comparable to currently available standard regimen with favorable non-hematologic toxicity profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>However, its high hematologic toxicity profile seems to preclude general acceptance of this regimen as option for treatment of SCLC. We are wainting for the result of the phase III COMBAT study which is comparing the efficacy of belotcan plus cisplatin to etoposide plus cisplatin in patients with ED SCLC.</p><p>Recent data with newer agents as thalidomide and bevacizumab, allow some cautious optimism for future advances in the treatment of this complex and challenging disease.</p><p>Strategies that have evaluated an increase of total dose, of dose intensity, number of courses, or number of drugs, or alternation of non-cross-resistant drugs, have been unsuccessful. These approaches are not recommended outside clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Some evidence suggests that adding thoracic radiotherapy to chemotherapy improves survival in patients with extensive-stage SCLC who have a complete response outside the thorax and at least a partial response within the thorax after three cycles of etoposide and cisplatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Immediate whole-brain radiotherapy is indicated in patients with brain metastases and intracranial hypertension or other neurological emergencies. In some series of patients with SCLC or NSCLC and brain metastases, whole brain radiotherapy combined with different chemotherapy regimens seemed to increase the risk of neurological toxic effects, but also to increase response rates and lengthen the time to progression of brain metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>This increase in toxic effects was probably related to the use of anthracyclines and high doses of radiation per fraction. On the basis of this evidence whole-brain radiotherapy should be started after the completion of chemotherapy in patients with brain metastases, with or without symptoms, but not delivered concomitantly with cytotoxic treatment.</p><p>Loehrer PJ et al., compared PEI regimen (cisplatin-etoposide-ifosfamide) with PE regimen in previously untreated ED-SCLC. The results indicated that PEI regimen was associated with a significant improvement in OS and PFS, without significant difference in toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>The Hoosier Oncology Group study showed an improved time to progression (statistically different) and overall survival associated with PEI combination chemotherapy (9.0&#x000a0;month versus 7.3 with PE regimen), in 171 patients randomized from 1989 and 1993; in the previous study, reported in 40 patients from 1987 to 1989, PEI regimen produced a high complete remission rate in patients with extensive disease.</p><p>Ifosfamide combination chemotherapy demonstrated a durable complete remissions also in heavily pretreated patients with recurrent germ cell tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In our study, PEI regimen gave interesting results both in LD and ED SCLC, with a remarkable median overall survival of 28.2&#x000a0;months in LD, and of 11.8&#x000a0;months in ED.</p><p>In both stages, the OS and TTP appear higher than expected, comparing to the results obtained with PE regimen published in the literature.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>SCLC remains a disease with disappointing results and no good news coming from the research. In extended-stage disease new drug combinations and approaches did not result in any improvement in overall survival, that remains the ultimate goal as, unlike in other chemosensitive cancers, second-line treatment is not an option for most patients.</p><p>Many other strategies, including maintenance therapy, dose-intense, dose-dense chemotherapy and alternating regimens have failed to demonstrate consistent benefits, often with unacceptable toxicity.</p><p>In the absence of a firm evidence of any activity of biological agents, PEI regimen, in our opinion, may be a possible therapeutic option, with high activity and an acceptable toxicity profile.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>BC, PM, BL and ZF conceived and designed the study, collected the clinical data and wrote the manuscript.
