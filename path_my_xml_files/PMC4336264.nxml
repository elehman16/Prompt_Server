Here, we investigate the effectiveness of single-dose administration of IVIG in sepsis patients in Japan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We analyzed 79 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care institution due to severe sepsis or septic shock. Patients were randomly divided into a group that was administered standard divided doses of IVIG (5 g/day for 3 days, designated the S group) or a group that was administered a standard single dose of IVIG (15 g/day for 1 day, H group); freeze-dried sulfonated human IVIG was used. The longitudinal assessment of procalcitonin (PCT) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, white blood cell count, blood lactate levels, IL-6 levels, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) was conducted. We also assessed mechanical ventilation duration (days), ICU stay (days), 28-day survival rate, and 90-day survival rate.</p></sec><sec><title><bold>Results</bold></title><p>The study showed no significant differences in PCT levels, CRP levels, 28-day survival rate, and 90-day survival rate between the two groups. However, patients in the H group showed improvements in the various SIRS diagnostic criteria, IL-6 levels, and blood lactate levels in the early stages after IVIG administration. In light of the non-recommendation of IVIG therapy in the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines 2012, our findings of significant early post-administration improvements are noteworthy. IVIG's anti-inflammatory effects may account for the early reduction in IL-6 levels after treatment, and the accompanying improvements in microcirculation may improve blood lactate levels and reduce SOFA scores. However, the low dosages of IVIG in Japan may limit the anti-cytokine effects of this treatment. Further studies are needed to determine appropriate treatment regimens of single-dose IVIG.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of single-dose IVIG treatment in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. Although there were no significant effects on patient prognoses, patients who were administered single-dose IVIG showed significantly improved IL-6 levels, blood lactate levels, and disease severity scores.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><kwd>Severe sepsis</kwd><kwd>Intravenous immunoglobulins</kwd><kwd>Single-dose administration</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; BioMed Central Ltd 2013</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Sepsis refers to a set of syndromes that occur as a result of a systemic inflammatory response to an infection. Without appropriate treatment, there is a high incidence of supervening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) or multiple organ failure (MOF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], leading to extremely poor outcomes for patients.</p><p>In 2004, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines (SSCG), a set of comprehensive management guidelines for the treatment of sepsis, were published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; the most recent revision&#x02014;SSCG 2012&#x02014;was published in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These guidelines contain details on initial resuscitation, antimicrobial therapy, and infection source control. Although the use of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) has been approved for the treatment of immune diseases such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and Kawasaki disease, its use in severe infections or sepsis has yet to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has also been discouraged in SSCG 2012 as a treatment for adult sepsis patients. However, IVIG has been shown to be effective in treating severe infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and several reviews have demonstrated the efficacy of IVIG as a supplemental drug for treating sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the early stage of sepsis, low concentration of immunoglobulins is predicted because IgG production in patients with primary infection needs 1&#x02013;2 weeks, and lots of IgG are burned up for inhibiting bacteria and toxin in secondary infection. Therefore, it is expected that IVIG administration for treatment of sepsis is effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, there are reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] that a single dose of IVIG for Kawasaki disease and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is more effective than divided doses. In Japan, IVIG administration is approved for severe infection, but the standard dosages and administration (5 g/day for 3 days) are far below the amount on several reports set forth above. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a single-dose IVIG treatment in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock in Japan is more effective than divided doses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by an internal ethics committee at its inception. In addition, the purpose of the study was explained to candidate research subjects or their legal representatives either verbally or in writing, and written informed consent was obtained for each participant before their inclusion in the study.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study sample</title><p>The study sample comprised patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care urban hospital between July 2009 and August 2012, and fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for severe sepsis or septic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. All study participants were immediately started on early goal-directed therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] after diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock, using therapeutic strategies compliant with SSCG 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Patients were excluded from analysis if they fulfilled the following criteria: patients aged 17 years or younger, patients with existing allergies to IVIG or antibiotics, patients with severe liver dysfunction or kidney disease (except for organ dysfunctions that can be caused by sepsis), patients with malignant neoplasms, patients in an immunodeficient state, patients who had acute myocardial infarctions or heart failures within 6 weeks prior to the index admission, patients (or their legal representatives) who did not consent to participating in the study, and patients deemed inappropriate for the study by the principal investigating clinician.</p><p>Research subjects were randomly allocated into two groups: a standard divided IVIG dose (5 g/day for 3 days) group designated as the S group and a standard single dose (15 g/day for 1 day) group designated as the H group. These regimens were based on dosages and administration approved for severe infection in Japan.</p><p>In both groups, treatment using freeze-dried sulfonated human IVIG was initialized within 24 h of diagnosing sepsis. Patient characteristics were evaluated using age; gender; height; weight; Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score; APACHE II score excluding Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), APACHE(&#x02212;GCS); Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score; SOFA score excluding GCS, SOFA(&#x02212;GCS); disease severity classification; and underlying disease that led to sepsis.</p><p>The various values of the following diagnostic criteria were longitudinally assessed throughout each patient's hospitalization episode: procalcitonin (PCT) levels, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, white blood cell (WBC) count, blood lactate levels, SOFA score, SOFA(&#x02212;GCS) score, and Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS).</p><p>In addition, we also analyzed the following outcome measures to evaluate patient prognosis: mechanical ventilation duration (in days), ICU stay duration (in days), 28-day survival rate, and 90-day survival rate. With the day of initial IVIG administration designated as day 1, the longitudinal assessments of patient baseline and clinical characteristics were conducted on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Various parameters for day 1 were assessed on ICU admission, and assessments for days 2 and 3 of the S group were conducted prior to IVIG administration for that day. Also, plasma IL-6 was extracted and cryopreserved at the various time points, and IL-6 plasma concentration was measured using chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (Human IL-6 CLEIA, Fujirebio Corp., Tokyo, Japan).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Therefore, we have included APACHE II scores and SOFA scores that omit GCS assessment, which measures the level of patient consciousness. In addition, APACHE II scores should be evaluated by using the worst value in the first 24 h, under normal circumstances. However, we evaluated APACHE II scores by the worst value from ICU admission to initial IVIG administration, as IVIG should be administered as soon as possible for treating sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For assessments of patient characteristics between the two groups, we used the unpaired <italic>t</italic> test, Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, chi-square test for independence, and Fisher's exact test as appropriate for the data type for each variable.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] has shown the mortality rate associated with septic shock patients to be 49.7%. Factors such as the overall increases in patient age, advances in drug therapies, increasingly complex surgical procedures, and the emergence of multiple drug-resistant bacteria are thought to contribute to the continued increase in the number of patients with sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. There is, therefore, an urgent need to further advance treatment modalities and adjunctive therapies.</p><p>In SSCG 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the administration of IVIG was recommended in children due to a study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] that demonstrated reduced mortality as a result of this treatment. However, this recommendation did not extend to include adult patients. Subsequently, the recommendation for IVIG administration was rescinded in the SSCG 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] due to studies such as the large-scale multi-institutional collaborative SBITS study involving 624 adult patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and an investigation of 3,493 children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In contrast, while the Japanese Guidelines for the Management of Sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] have not acknowledged the ameliorative effects of IVIG treatment on mortality rates, they have recognized that its use may be considered in the early stages of therapy as a means to reduce mechanical ventilation duration and improve survival rates in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The regimen and dosage of IVIG in Japan are substantially lower than in many other countries. A study conducted in Japan in 2000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] analyzed the effects when patients with infections who showed no improvement in symptoms after 3 days of antibiotic therapy were administered IVIG (5 g/day for 3 days). When compared with similar patients who were not administered IVIG, the IVIG group showed significant improvements in disease symptoms. Although the negative conversion rate of the causative organism and the CRP rate of change were not significantly different between the two groups, a composite score comprised of fever and other symptoms was developed to measure the effectiveness of the therapy, which showed that the IVIG group had significantly higher effectiveness. However, the definition for severe sepsis was unclear, and the outcome measures used (reductions in fever and improvements in symptoms) were relatively ambiguous. Therefore, the utilization standards, regimen, and dosages reported in this study may be inconclusive.</p><p>Accordingly, we have conducted an investigation of the effectiveness of single-dose IVIG in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. In this randomized controlled study, we did not observe significant differences between the two groups in CRP levels (a standard infection marker), PCT levels (which are thought to reflect the severity of sepsis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], ICU stay duration, and patient prognoses. However, when compared with the standard divided doses IVIG group, the standard single-dose IVIG group was shown to have better results in the early post-administration stages for factors such as IL-6 levels, blood lactate levels, and SOFA score.</p><p>The mechanism of action for IVIG against infections has been reported to include the stimulation of Fc receptor-mediated antibiotic-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, neutralization of toxins and viruses, suppression of cytokine activity, promotion of complement-mediated bacteriolysis, and opsonization of targets to promote phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. As some aspects of the mechanism still remain unclear, it would not be possible to conclusively explain the findings of this study. However, the fact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] that IVIG formulations include anti-IL-6 antibodies may account for the early reduction in IL-6 levels after treatment, and the accompanying improvements in microcirculation may ostensibly improve blood lactate levels and reduce the SOFA score. A multi-institutional study has shown that improvements to blood lactate levels are associated with reductions in mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and these findings resulted in the reestablishment of the normalization of blood lactate levels at a recommended measure in SSCG 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. From this perspective, the single-dose administration of IVIG could therefore also be thought of as being an effective treatment. In this study, we did not observe any adverse events occurring as a result of IVIG administration such as anaphylactoid symptoms or thrombocytopenia.</p><p>There were several limitations in this study. First, there may be a large degree of variation in the time to treatment among the research subjects. Next, the dosage of IVIG was not based on subject body weight but was standardized for all subjects. Also, we did not account for the anti-cytokine effects from other treatments such as blood purification therapy, steroids, sivelestat, and recombinant thrombomodulin. Additionally, there is a possibility that the pathology of sepsis differs according to the underlying illnesses. Finally, the levels of IgG in the blood were not assessed prior to administering IVIG, and there may therefore be a large degree of variation in these levels among the subjects.</p><p>A minimum of 2.0 g/kg body weight of immunoglobulins has been reported to be necessary in order to sufficiently neutralize the rise of IL-6 levels due to sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], which would be difficult to achieve in Japan given the reduced anti-cytokine effects from the lower immunoglobulin dosages. More studies are needed to further understand the costs, risk of infection, mechanism of utility, appropriate dosages, and modes of administration of single-dose IVIG treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, we shed light on the effectiveness of single-dose IVIG treatment in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in Japan. Although the study did not show any significant effects on patient prognoses, subjects who were administered a standard single dose of IVIG showed significantly improved early-stage IL-6 levels, blood lactate levels, and disease severity scores when compared with patients administered with standard divided doses.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors' contributions</bold></p><p>KN contributed to the initial conception of the study and participated in its design.
