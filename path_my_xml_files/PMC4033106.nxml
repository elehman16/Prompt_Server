Psoriatic Arthritis Long-term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy 1 (PALACE 1) compared apremilast with placebo in patients with active psoriatic arthritis despite prior traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) and/or biologic therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In the 24-week, placebo-controlled phase of PALACE 1, patients (N=504) were randomised (1:1:1) to placebo, apremilast 20&#x02005;mg twice a day (BID) or apremilast 30&#x02005;mg BID. At week 16, patients without &#x02265;20% reduction in swollen and tender joint counts were required to be re-randomised equally to either apremilast dose if initially randomised to placebo or remained on their initial apremilast dose. Patients on background concurrent DMARDs continued stable doses (methotrexate, leflunomide and/or sulfasalazine). Primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving 20% improvement in modified American College of Rheumatology response criteria (ACR20) at week 16.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>At week 16, significantly more apremilast 20&#x02005;mg BID (31%) and 30&#x02005;mg BID (40%) patients achieved ACR20 versus placebo (19%) (p&#x0003c;0.001). Significant improvements in key secondary measures (physical function, psoriasis) were evident with both apremilast doses versus placebo. Across outcome measures, the 30-mg group generally had higher and more consistent response rates, although statistical comparison was not conducted. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal and generally occurred early, were self-limiting and infrequently led to discontinuation. No imbalance in major adverse cardiac events, serious or opportunistic infections, malignancies or laboratory abnormalities was observed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Apremilast was effective in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, improving signs and symptoms and physical function.

The institutional review boards at each participating medical centre approved the protocol and all patients provided written informed consent before study entry. Patients were required to meet the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR)<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> at screening and have a minimum of both three swollen and three tender joints, despite prior treatment with traditional DMARDs and/or biologic treatment or concurrent treatment with traditional DMARDs. Prior tumour necrosis factor blocker efficacy failures were limited to &#x02264;10% of enrolled patients. Patients taking methotrexate, leflunomide or sulfasalazine must have been treated for at least 16&#x02005;weeks and on a stable dose (oral or parenteral methotrexate &#x02264;25&#x02005;mg/week; leflunomide &#x02264;20&#x02005;mg/day; sulfasalazine &#x02264;2&#x02005;g/day; or a combination) for at least 4&#x02005;weeks before the screening visit. Stable doses of oral corticosteroids (prednisone &#x02264;10&#x02005;mg/day or equivalent for at least 1&#x02005;month) and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (&#x02265;2&#x02005;weeks) were permitted.</p><p>Key exclusion criteria were failure of more than three agents for PsA (DMARDs or biologics) or more than one tumour necrosis factor blocker.

Patients with active tuberculosis or a history of incompletely treated tuberculosis could not participate.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study design</title><p>PALACE 1, a phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled study, was conducted at 83 sites in 13 countries beginning 2 June 2010 (clinical trial registration NCT01172938, ClinicalTrials.gov). Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to placebo, apremilast 20&#x02005;mg twice a day (BID) or apremilast 30&#x02005;mg BID stratified by baseline DMARD use (yes/no). Apremilast was dose-titrated over the first week of treatment (10&#x02005;mg on the first day, with increases of 10&#x02005;mg/day until the target dose was reached). Study visits were conducted at weeks 4, 16 and 24 for safety and weeks 16 and 24 for efficacy assessments. Patients whose swollen and tender joint counts had not improved by &#x02265;20% were considered non-responders at week 16 and were required to enter the protocol-defined early escape. Patients receiving placebo were re-randomised (1:1) to apremilast 20&#x02005;mg BID or 30&#x02005;mg BID, while those on apremilast remained on their initial apremilast dose. Treatment was continued through week 24, at which time all remaining placebo patients were re-randomised (1:1) to apremilast 20&#x02005;mg BID or 30&#x02005;mg BID. Subsequently, all patients entered the 28-week randomised, double-blind, active-treatment phase until week 52. Individual patient treatment assignments remained blinded to the investigators until final data analyses were completed after week 52. The active-treatment, long-term safety phase started at week 52, and patients are continuing their assigned treatment up to a total of 5&#x02005;years. This report describes outcomes from the 24-week placebo-controlled phase.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients meeting 20% improvement in modified ACR response criteria (ACR20)<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> at week 16. The key secondary endpoint was change from baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire&#x02013;Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at week 16. Additional efficacy outcome measures at week 24 included improvements in the signs and symptoms of PsA, physical function, enthesitis, dactylitis and psoriasis (see online supplementary table S1).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Safety assessments</title><p>Safety was evaluated at all scheduled clinic visits based on adverse events (AEs), vital signs, weight, physical examination and clinical laboratory investigations; a 12-lead electrocardiogram was obtained at screening, baseline and weeks 16 and 24. Safety assessments were also conducted in the event of early termination. There was no protocol requirement to stop study medication for an infection, no exclusions for vaccinations (including live virus) and no screening required for latent tuberculosis. AEs occurring after randomisation were classified using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities Classification System.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size estimations were based on the results of a phase 2 study of apremilast<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>; thus, it was estimated that 165 patients would be needed to provide 95% power to detect a 20% absolute difference in the ACR20 response between apremilast treatment and placebo using a two-group &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test with a 0.025 two-sided significance level. Efficacy was evaluated for the per-protocol population, which included all patients in the safety population (ie, randomised patients receiving at least one dose of study medication) who had at least one post-treatment ACR evaluation and no critical protocol violations. Protocol violations excluding patients from the per-protocol population were determined before unblinding of the 24-week database. The primary analysis of ACR20 response at week 16 was compared between apremilast treatment groups and placebo using a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test adjusted for concomitant DMARD use at baseline. Patients who terminated the study early, before week 16, or did not have sufficient data for assessment at week 16 were considered non-responders (non-responder imputation approach); last-observation-carried-forward methodology was used for the sensitivity analysis. Pairwise comparisons of each apremilast group versus placebo were performed. The Hochberg procedure was used to maintain type 1 error at the 0.05 significance level. Results were considered statistically significant if both the apremilast 20&#x02005;mg BID and 30&#x02005;mg BID versus placebo comparisons achieved p&#x0003c;0.05, or one of the apremilast versus placebo comparisons achieved p&#x0003c;0.025.</p><p>Analysis of covariance was used to compare the change in HAQ-DI score from baseline to week 16, with treatment and DMARD use as factors and baseline HAQ-DI score as a covariate. Categorical variables were analysed using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and continuous variables were analysed using the analysis of covariance model. Safety data were summarised descriptively for the safety population.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Patients</title><p>A total of 615 patients were screened and 504 were randomised and received at least one dose of study medication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013205056F1">figure 1</xref>). The pre-specified per-protocol efficacy population included 489 patients; 15 (3.0%) were excluded for critical protocol violations, which included not having at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment that allowed for ACR20 calculation; one patient also had very low treatment compliance (41%). In all, 444 (88.1%) patients completed week 24.</p><fig id="ANNRHEUMDIS2013205056F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition through week 24.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-205056f01"/></fig><p>Baseline demographics, disease characteristics and prior or concurrent therapy were comparable across treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013205056TB1">table 1</xref>).

As would be expected, relative to the overall population, patients with biologic experience tended to have a longer duration of both PsA and psoriasis, a greater proportion had baseline psoriasis body surface area &#x02265;3%, and a lower proportion were taking concomitant DMARDs at baseline. At baseline, 327 (64.9%) patients were taking DMARDs, of whom 273 (83.5%) were taking methotrexate; 119 (23.6%) had prior biologic exposure, and 47 (9.3%) were considered biologic therapeutic

Traditional DMARDs remain the mainstay of PsA treatment. However, currently available DMARDs have demonstrated variable efficacy in treating all of the rheumatologic and dermatologic manifestations of PsA. The biologic agents, particularly tumour necrosis factor blockers, have demonstrated substantial responses for many, but not all, patients. All available agents have some potential safety concerns. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for novel therapeutic agents that address the varied clinical manifestations of PsA and offer a favourable benefit/risk profile.</p><p>This study presents the first phase 3 data demonstrating the efficacy of apremilast, an oral phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor, in patients with PsA and prior experience with traditional DMARDs and/or biologic therapies, including treatment failures. The majority of patients (&#x0003e;74.0%) had received prior treatment with one or more traditional DMARDs; 64.9% were on at least one DMARD at baseline, most commonly methotrexate. Of note, 23.6% of the patients had previous biologic exposure and 9.3% were considered biologic therapeutic failures. The enrolled patients were representative of a population with active, long-standing disease and a history of treatment experience. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at baseline were lower than other PsA studies that, unlike the current study, had enrolment requirement criteria for CRP,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and, as expected, may be lower than patient populations with rheumatoid arthritis, as PsA is generally associated with lower CRP levels compared with rheumatoid arthritis.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Both doses of apremilast significantly improved the signs and symptoms of PsA at week 16. Efficacy was observed with apremilast regardless of prior biologic experience or concomitant DMARD use, with a higher absolute rate of ACR20 response in biologic-na&#x000ef;ve patients. Apremilast demonstrated statistically significant improvements in physical function, as measured by the HAQ-DI score at week 16. Continued dosing through week 24 maintained or further improved the signs and symptoms of PsA and physical function. Results based on additional efficacy measures, including ACR50, ACR70, swollen and tender joint counts, 36-item Short-Form Health Survey v2 Physical Functioning domain and PASI-75 score, were consistent with the positive ACR20 response rates and change in HAQ-DI score. A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving apremilast 20&#x02005;mg BID and 30&#x02005;mg BID achieved DAS-28 (CRP) remission (&#x0003c;2.6) compared with placebo. Across most efficacy measures, response rates and improvements were greater with apremilast 30&#x02005;mg BID versus apremilast 20&#x02005;mg BID, although the study was not designed to make formal efficacy comparisons.</p><p>Apremilast at doses of 20&#x02005;mg BID and 30&#x02005;mg BID was generally well tolerated over 24&#x02005;weeks. The most common AEs were largely gastrointestinal, including diarrhoea and nausea; most of these occurred in the first month of treatment, were predominantly mild or moderate in severity, and did not lead to discontinuation. Two serious infections (gastrointestinal clostridial infection, pneumonia) occurred in the apremilast treatment groups; each resolved with appropriate antibiotic treatment, and patients continued apremilast without interruption. No imbalance was observed between placebo and apremilast in terms of major adverse cardiac events, serious infections including systemic opportunistic infections or malignancies, including lymphoma. No cases of active tuberculosis or vasculitis were reported. Apremilast use did not result in clinically meaningful laboratory abnormalities, suggesting that routine laboratory monitoring may not be required when using apremilast.</p><p>The study was limited in duration, and results from the ongoing long-term phase are anticipated. This is the first study in the PALACE apremilast clinical trial programme, which comprises four phase 3 randomised, placebo-controlled trials with long-term, open-label extensions for up to 5&#x02005;years. The programme is one of the largest to date in PsA patients who have prior DMARD and/or biologic experience. The significant efficacy observed in PALACE 1, across multiple domains of PsA, along with the safety and tolerability profile, and potential lack of requirement for laboratory monitoring, suggest apremilast may become an important addition to the current PsA treatment armamentarium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings demonstrate that apremilast is effective for the treatment of active PsA across a diverse group of patients with prior treatment experience, alone or in combination with traditional DMARDs. Furthermore, apremilast was well tolerated in the majority of patients and demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. These results confirm the therapeutic potential of apremilast BID for treatment of patients with PsA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-205056-s1.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1494" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Maricar Postaski (data management, clinical operations), Peter Maes, Colleen Newman, Rosemary Petric, Yufang Lu, and Adele Vessey (clinical research), Elisabeth Kurkimilis (clinical operations), Andrew Wang (programming), and Xiaojiang Zhan (statistics) of Celgene Corporation for their contributions to the manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> AK: study design, data acquisition, data analysis and manuscript drafting.
