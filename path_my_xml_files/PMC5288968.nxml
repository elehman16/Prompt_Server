Therefore, this study investigated the efficiency and safety of topical tacrolimus in treatment of patients with vitiligo. This study was a clinical randomized designed study pre- post-test method, has been conducted on thirty cases with vitiligo who have referred to polyclinic and dermatology clinic. Participant's evaluated and demographic information recorded in designed checklist. In the next stage, the disease activity scored by vitiligo index disease activity system. Photography and depigmentation percent has recorded before treatment and further in 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks. Finally, gathered data compared through SPSS-20 software. The final sample comprised 30 persons including: 12 men (40%) and 18 women (60%). The average of patient's age in this study was 26/13 &#x000b1; 18/20 (2-76-year-old). Eleven persons was &#x02264;15 years old and rest was older than 15. Sixty-six lesions have funded in patients that maximum has accrued on face and neck (37/87%) and trunk (21/21%). In addition, minimum of lesions is related to genitalia (9/09%). In the in 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup> weeks, improvement in face and neck had increased significantly, into the past weeks. In the 20<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks, the improvement has increased although it was not significant enhancement. Also about trunk, in the 4<sup>th</sup> week the improvement does not have significant increasing in compare to the past week. In the eighth, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks the improvement has been increased significantly in compare to the past weeks. Although in the case of limbs and genitalia, the improvement was lower. There was no significant difference between male and females and age. Although the improvement was, slow in older persons. Study results, has presented applying topical tacrolimus in vitiligo, particularly in face and neck, could be effective and does not seen any specified adverse effects during consumption of tacrolimus, it could be effective in decreasing effects in use of corticosteroid.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>topical tacrolimus</kwd><kwd>vitiligo</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Vitiligo is characterized by achromatic spots related to the loss of melanocytes in the epidermis and the hair follicle. It happens at any age, affects both sexes and in some regions, affects up to 2% of the population. It influences considerably the quality of life of the patients. None of the therapeutic alternatives is fully satisfactory either because its improvement is unpredictable and the treatment is long or because of the side effects and operational difficulty of application of the medication.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Vitiligo is characterized by the progressive disappearance of melanocytes, resulting in depigmentation of the skin and/or hair. The etiology of vitiligo is unknown.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Genetic studies support a non-Mendelian inheritance, suggesting that vitiligo is a multifactorial, polygenic disorder. The autoimmune theory remains the most widely accepted. Vitiligo has frequently been reported in association with autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, diabetes mellitus, and alopecia area.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] This disease is not a severe physical condition, but it leads to several complications in beauty while most of the clinicians neglects its impact on quality of life and self-esteem of patients.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In one recent study, results showed that depression in vitiligo patients is related to the presence of lesions in a visible area, leading to poor body image and compromised self-esteem.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] They feel shame in communications,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] social isolation in some cases even results to suicide.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Treatment of this disease is divided to medication and surgery. Medication also included two types of topical and systemic split. Topical treatments include topical steroids, intralesional steroids, tacrolimus, calcipotriol topical, topical psoralen ultraviolet A (PUVA). Systemic treatments include systemic steroids and systemic PUVA. None of the above therapies are not considered as first-line treatment method, but therapeutic approaches is depended to the condition of patient and therapist.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In a study aimed to the treatment of vitiligo Tamler <italic>et al</italic>. ten patients took part in the present study: six patients with lesions on the cephalic and cervical regions had more than 75% of re-pigmentation. As for extremities and trunk results varied from good to excellent in 27% of the cases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In a recent review, study conducted by Sisti <italic>et al</italic>. found 29 studies from 2002 to 2014. Overall, 709 patients were treated in 29 studies. Pooling the lesions, 50% re-pigmentation of vitiligo patches was never achieved before 2 months of treatment, with a peak after 6 months of therapy. The best results were obtained on lesions of the cephalic region, especially the face, with tacrolimus 0/1 ointment two times daily. The percentage of nonresponsive patients ranged from 0% to 14%. Treatment was generally well tolerated; only localized adverse effects were reported. In general, expensive, and time-consuming when done in the absence of some of the above treatment methods, it is possible that steroids systemic in stopping the spread of lesions and even re-pigmentation them effective.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, this study is aimed to investigated efficiency and safety of topical tacrolimus in the treatment of vitiligo patients during 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks of treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a clinical trial with pre- and post-test design method.

The most prevalent start point also was in head and neck, and lowest was genitalia. In the present study, results indicated that in 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, and 16<sup>th</sup> weeks after treatment the improvement was significant in head and neck area. The improvement was continued in 20<sup>th</sup> and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks also but the changes was not significant in 0/05 level. In body area in 4<sup>th</sup> week steel there is no significant change in compared to before treatment but in 8<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup> 20<sup>th</sup>, and 24<sup>th</sup> weeks after treatment the improvement was significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0/05). In upper and lower lamp and genitalia, improvement was less in compare to other body region.</p><p>In general, 90% of patients showed high improvement in head and neck and 30% reported good improvement in other body regions. This may be is related to environmental factors such as sunlight although we considered this point and tried to omit this factor. In Germany, Hartman <italic>et al</italic>. found 81% improvement after 12 months in head and neck and 80% in upper limb.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This difference could be explained by treatment duration which was shorter in present study. In study conducted in New York by Travis and Silverberg also, 89% of head and neck and 63% of body and limbs pigments were responsive to Taklorimus ointment. In addition, segmental type vitiligo in the face was the most responsive type and region. Therefore, they concluded this ointment is and effective alternative during childhood especially in head and neck area.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In Brazil, Tamler <italic>et al</italic>. reported 75% in head and neck and 27% in other regions responsive to this ointment.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Udompataikul <italic>et al</italic>. in Thailand indicated 94%, 76 and 56% responsiveness of vulgaris &#x02013; focalis, segmentalis, and acrofacialis pigments respectively.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] In more recent study in the USA, Mattox <italic>et al</italic>. in line with our findings introduced tacrolimus as an excellent alternative for optical corticosteroids.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Therefore, according results and previous findings head and neck regions are more responsive to tacrolimus and in early weeks of disease it is more effective. Although in our study improvement, speed gets down by the time that can be explainable with the resistance of medication doses.</p><p>In the present study, complications or side effects do not seen except slight irritation in 3 cases which is in line with findings of Travis and Silverberg who reported slight irritation in 2 cases.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This finding approves tacrolimus preference in compare to similar medications. As steroids are one of most common effective medicines in the treatment of vitiligo's through creating immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effect improves pigments. Although side effects of long steroids using, incorrect usage and high doses are not ignorable.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] While according our findings and other studies this ointment has minimum side effects. In some studies, effectiveness of tacrolimus and steroids was same. For example Vijayalakshmi <italic>et al</italic>. in India compared effectiveness of clobetasol 0/05 with tacrolimus 0/1 in the treatment of vitiligo. During 3 months in clobetasol group, 64% of cases and 76% of cases in tacrolimus group showed significant improvement.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Lepe <italic>et al</italic>. also reported higher effectiveness of tacrolimus in compared to clobetasole.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Park <italic>et al</italic>. showed effectiveness of leister therapy increased in integration with tacrimulus ointment.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Although in past decades the patients who applied this ointment suggested to avoid ultraviolet (UV) ray. This decreased risk of cutaneous malignancies among transplant patients due to systemic treatment with tacrolimus. However, in vitiligo patients, this skin reaction is natural and penetrate of tacrolimus into the epidermis is very low. In addition, experimental studies revealed tacrolimus protects DNA from UV ray.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Finally, it is recommended to combination these two methods with caution.</p><p>In this study 40% of patients were male and rest were female. There was not a significant difference between male and females in improvement. Although in last week's males improvement was higher. This disease prevalence is same in both gender, but females referee and proceed for treatment more frequently in compared to males. The age mean was about 26 years old. This a disease which appear frequently below 20 years old as in results also seen most of cases were below 15. Results also indicated no significant difference between improvement and age of participants. Although older cases improved later. In study conducted by Udompataikul <italic>et al</italic>. also, age average of patients was 27.8 and children had 9 times more higher chance of improvement.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The mean of disease duration was about 4 years and 30% had treatment history. Hartman <italic>et al</italic>. also mentioned the patients who proceed early for treatment had higher chance.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In study of Udompataikul <italic>et al</italic>. also higher therapy responsive has seen among patients with history lower than 5 years.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>According to results of their study tacrolimus ointment is effective treatment especially in head and neck without serious side effect. The patients were satisfied with treatment. This is recommended to conduct the same study in compare to different medications and in a longer time. In addition, patient's satisfaction, commitment, and integration with other methods also recommended for future researchers.</p><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Financial support and
