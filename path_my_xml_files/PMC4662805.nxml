Although emerging research has indicated that CBT-I is also effective for comorbid insomnia, CBT-I has not been tested among a complex sample of older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression. Furthermore, no study has explored whether modifying CBT-I to target associated depressive symptoms could potentially enhance sleep and mood outcomes. Therefore, this study aims to report a protocol designed to test whether an advanced form of CBT for insomnia and depression (CBT-I-D) is more effective at reducing insomnia and depressive symptoms compared to a standard CBT-I and psychoeducation control group (PCG) for older adults in a community mental health setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>We aim to recruit 150 older adults with comorbid insomnia who have presented to community mental health services for depression. Eligible participants will be randomly allocated via block/cluster randomisation to one of three group therapy conditions: CBT-I, CBT-I-D, or PCG. Participants who receive CBT-I will only practice strategies designed to improve their sleep, whereas participants who receive CBT-I-D will practice additional strategies designed to also improve their mood. This trial will implement a mixed-methods design involving quantitative outcome measures and qualitative focus groups. The primary outcome measures are insomnia and depression severity, and secondary outcomes are anxiety, hopelessness, beliefs about sleep, comorbid sleep conditions, and health. Outcomes will be assessed at pre-intervention (week 0), post-intervention (week 8), and 3-month follow-up (week 20).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This CBT study protocol has been designed to address comorbid insomnia and depression for older adults receiving community mental health services. The proposed trial will determine whether CBT-I is more effective for older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression compared to a PCG. It will also establish whether an advanced form of CBT-I-D generates greater reductions in insomnia and depression severity compared to standard CBT-I. The results from the proposed trial are anticipated to have important clinical implications for older adults, researchers, therapists, and community mental health services.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=367576">12615000067572</ext-link>, Date Registered 12 December 2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cognitive behaviour therapy</kwd><kwd>insomnia</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>older adults</kwd><kwd>mental health services</kwd><kwd>randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Leaders in the field of cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) have suggested that this form of psychological treatment needs to be tested in more diverse samples and settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Promising research has indicated that CBT-I is effective at treating comorbid or secondary insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]; however, the effectiveness of CBT-I has not been examined among a complex sample of older adults receiving community mental health services for depression.</p><p>Insomnia and depression are commonly co-occurring conditions experienced by older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Studies have reported that up to 90&#x000a0;% of individuals with depression report problems with comorbid insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Historically, insomnia was believed to have been primarily a symptom or natural consequence of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. More recent evidence has demonstrated that insomnia often precedes the onset of depression among older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and can serve as an influential risk factor for depressive relapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Furthermore, studies have suggested that many of the symptoms required for the diagnosis of depression (for example, tiredness, amotivation, depressed mood, hopelessness, and poor concentration) can be attributed to increased levels of insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Collectively, these findings have led researchers to hypothesise that, in some cases, the relation between insomnia and depression is reciprocal, as the two disorders can aggravate and maintain each other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, insomnia becomes not only a symptom of depression but can become an independent dysfunctional process and a comorbid disorder that can subsequently jeopardise depression treatment.</p><p>There is preliminary data that suggests CBT-I could have a positive effect on comorbid depression (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]). This body of research, however, is still in its infancy and contains several significant limitations that restrict the strength and generalisability of the findings (for example, younger participants, small sample sizes, homogenous groups, and no randomisation design or comparison/control group). Therefore, constructing a study protocol that investigates whether CBT-I is effective for older adults who are engaged with a mental health service for depression would significantly contribute to this body of literature.</p><p>No CBT-I trial has specifically investigated whether additional therapeutic modifications need to be considered when treating depression among older adults. Researchers have suggested this is an important area of future research because older adults with depression may require a more advanced treatment program than standard CBT-I alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. The original CBT for depression manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] briefly discussed strategies to address symptoms of insomnia, most notably cognitively reframing negative predictions about poor sleep and increasing meaningful activities during the day. Integrating CBT for insomnia and depression (CBT-I-D) could be particularly helpful when staying in bed becomes an escape from the distress associated with the depression itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. This increased desire to sleep and withdraw from daily activities is likely to increase the attempts to sleep, which in turn, can exacerbate cognitive and somatic arousal and interfere with overall sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Thus working simultaneously on both issues could create an increased therapeutic effect and further enhance sleep and mood outcomes. To date, no study has examined whether an advanced form of CBT-I-D produces greater reductions in insomnia and depression severity compared to CBT-I alone.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and hypotheses</title><p>The purpose of this study is to present a protocol that has been designed to evaluate whether CBT-I is effective for older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression in community mental health settings. This study aims to investigate whether there are significant differences between the three conditions (CBT-I, CBT-I-D, and PCG), with a particular focus on whether CBT-I-D produces greater reductions in insomnia and depression severity compared to CBT-I. The final aim of the study is to qualitatively explore the participants&#x02019; experience of taking part in the trial. This feedback will play an important role in improving future studies that explore the delivery of CBT-I for older adults with complex conditions.</p><p>There are two central hypotheses in this study. First, it is expected that participants who are randomised to the CBT-I condition will report a significant reduction in insomnia severity compared to participants who are randomised to the PCG condition at post (week 8) and follow-up (week 20) assessments. Second, it is hypothesised that participants who are randomised to the CBT-I-D condition will report greater reductions in insomnia and depression severity compared to participants who are randomised to the CBT-I and PCG conditions at post- and follow-up assessments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Trial design</title><p>This trial will follow the International CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) guidelines and evaluate conditions using a randomised control trial (RCT) design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>].

Interested participants will be asked to sign an informed consent document prior to commencing the eligibility assessment. Once consent is obtained, participants will be invited to participate in a preliminary insomnia screen. This screen will correspond with the <italic>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders 5</italic><sup><italic>th</italic></sup><italic>edition (DSM-V)</italic> criteria for Comorbid Insomnia Disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and follow Morin and Benca&#x02019;s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] insomnia assessment guidelines. Participants meeting comorbid insomnia criteria will then be invited to participate in a clinical interview eligibility assessment.</p><p>Demographic information will be collected, including age, sex, relationship status, education level, income source, accommodation type, religious beliefs, past occupation, medical history, and medications. Participants will be asked if they have been diagnosed with a sleep disorder, and if so, their treatment (for example, CPAP) and perceived treatment effectiveness. Participants will also be screened for sleep apnea and other comorbid sleep conditions (for example, restless legs) by administering the SLEEP-50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. It is important to note that participants with comorbid medical, sleep, and psychiatric conditions will be included in this trial.</p><p>The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI 6.0; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]) will be administered to assess Major Depressive Disorder (past/current episode) and other high prevalence mental disorders. The MINI is a clinical psychiatric diagnostic tool with structured &#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019; responses, (for example, &#x02018;Were you ever depressed or down, most of the day, nearly every day, for two weeks?&#x02019;). The MINI is more efficient to administer compared to other structured diagnostic instruments (for example, SCID), taking approximately 15 to 30&#x000a0;minutes to complete. The MINI corresponds with the <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic criteria, which is commonly applied in research settings. The MINI has demonstrated inter-rater and test-retest reliability and validity across diverse populations (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]) including older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Since the MINI was standardised on the <italic>DSM-IV</italic>, the principal investigator updated the items for each disorder to be consistent with the <italic>DSM-V</italic> criteria.</p><p>The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]) will be used to screen for possible cognitive impairment. The MMSE contains 30 items that assesses a range of cognitive functions, such as orientation, short-term memory, language, comprehension, attention and calculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Total scores on the MMSE range from 0 to 30. Participants with scores of 23 or below are considered likely to have a cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The MMSE has shown high levels of reliability and validity; for instance, studies have reported internal consistencies of up to Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;.90, and test-retest reliabilities over a 24-hour period above <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.85 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In addition, Mitchell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] found the MMSE demonstrated adequate sensitivity (71.1&#x000a0;% to 85.1&#x000a0;%) and specificity (81.3&#x000a0;% to 95.6&#x000a0;%) across a range of settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measures</title><p>Once the eligible clinical assessment has been completed, eligible participants will be asked to complete a self-report questionnaire package at pre-treatment (week 0) to collect baseline outcome measures. Participants will also be asked to complete the outcome measures at post-intervention (week 8) and 3-month follow-up (week 20).

The ISI assesses the subjective symptoms and consequences of insomnia, as well as the degree of concerns or distress caused by those difficulties during the previous two weeks. The ISI comprises seven items assessing the severity of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties (both nocturnal and early morning awakenings), satisfaction with current sleep pattern, interference with daily functioning, ability to notice the level of sleep impairment, and degree of distress or concern caused by the sleep problem. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;none, to 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;very). Total scores range from 0 to 28, with higher scores representing more severe levels of insomnia. Total scores of 0 to 7 indicate no clinically significant insomnia; scores of 8 to 14 indicate sub-threshold insomnia; and scores of 15 to 28 indicate moderate to severe levels of insomnia. Bastein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] conducted a psychometric study of the ISI among older adults. It was found that the mean item-total correlations were <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.56 at pre-treatment, <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.69 at post-treatment, and <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.72 at follow-up. The internal reliability coefficients remained stable from .76 at baseline to .78 at follow-up. Bastein et al. concluded that the ISI was a useful clinical tool for screening insomnia severity among older adults or as an outcome measure in insomnia treatment research.</p><p>The Consensus Sleep Diary (CSD; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]) allows individuals to record information about their nightly sleep pattern. A recent panel of international sleep experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] developed the CSD as the current standardised sleep diary measure for insomnia research. The CSD contains nine items that were considered by the expert panel to represent the most critical sleep parameters (for example, &#x02018;What time did you get into bed?&#x02019;). The CSD was formatted so that 1&#x000a0;week of nightly sleep data could be recorded on a single diary page. The CSD instructions included general information, such as what to do if the respondent misses recording on a particular day, and an item-by-item instruction guide to enhance the likelihood of correct item interpretation. Additional instructions indicate that all items should be completed in the morning within 1&#x000a0;hour of getting out of bed. Previous research (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]) has reported that sleep diaries were accurate when compared to polysomnographic data (kappa&#x02009;=&#x02009;.87; sensitivity&#x02009;=&#x02009;92.3&#x000a0;%; specificity, 95.6&#x000a0;%). Researchers agree that having individuals prospectively self-monitor their sleep with a sleep diary is a useful psychometric tool for insomnia assessment and for examining treatment effects (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]).</p><p>The SLEEP-50 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] is designed to measure the intensity of an individual&#x02019;s subjective sleep complaints on a range of sleep conditions, including sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, restless legs, circadian rhythms, sleepwalking, nightmares, other factors influencing sleep, and functioning impairment. The SLEEP-50 is scored on a four-point Likert scale from 1 &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; to 4 &#x02018;very much&#x02019;. An example sleep apnea item includes &#x02018;I am told that I hold my breath when sleeping&#x02019;. The SLEEP-50 is considered a reliable and valid screening tool for comorbid sleep conditions, Spoormaker et al. reporting a 3-week test-retest reliability of <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.78 and Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of .85.</p><p>The Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep 10-Item Scale (DBAS-10; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) measures the intensity of maladaptive beliefs about sleep (for example &#x02018;When I have trouble getting to sleep, I should stay in bed and try harder&#x02019;). Espie et al. redeveloped this measure into a shorter version of 10 items from the original 30-item DBAS scale of Morin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Participants complete each question using a 10-cm visual analogue scale, anchored with strongly disagree and strongly agree. Added together, the 10 item responses provide the final DBAS score. Total scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores representing more rigid or stronger levels of dysfunctional beliefs and attitudes about sleep. The DBAS-10 was has been found be a reliable measure of dysfunctional beliefs about sleep among older adults (Cronbach&#x02019;s <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.88; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]).</p><p>The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]) is a 30-item clinician-rated questionnaire used to assess depression severity specifically for older adults. Participants are asked to respond &#x02018;yes/no&#x02019; to each item, for example, &#x02018;Over the past week have you felt that your life has been empty?&#x02019; Possible scores range from 0 to 30, with higher scores indicating the presence of more depressive symptomatology. A total score of 0 to 9 indicates normal levels of depression, 10 to 19 indicates mild to moderate levels of depression, and 20 to 30 indicates severe depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>].

For example, a participant that answers &#x02018;True&#x02019; to the follow question, &#x02018;My future seems dark to me&#x02019;, would score 1 point and represent a pessimistic response. Each of the 20 statements is scored 0 or 1, with the total being calculated by summing the pessimistic responses for the 20 items. The total BHS score ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores reflecting higher levels of hopelessness. A total score ranging from 0 to 3 identifies minimal hopelessness, from 4 to 8 identifies mild hopelessness, from 9 to 14 identifies moderate hopelessness, and greater than 14 identifies severe hopelessness. The BHS has been used widely among older adult community samples (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]).

The results from this trial will represent a significant step forward in this field and assist in advancing CBT-I for older adults receiving mental health services for depression. Several important clinical implications could result from this project.</p><p>One of the primary aims is to evaluate whether CBT-I is effective among a complex sample of older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression in a community mental health setting. We predict that CBT-I will be more effective at reducing insomnia severity compared to the PCG. If this hypothesis is supported, it will demonstrate that CBT-I is helpful at reducing insomnia severity for older adults with depression in a community mental health setting. This evidence will add to a growing research base that suggests CBT-I needs to be considered as a treatment option for individuals with comorbid insomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>].</p><p>Since previous research has suggested that comorbid insomnia is often misunderstood and inadequately treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], education and training play a vital role to address this disparity between research and clinical practice. This could involve providing workshops to mental health practitioners to raise their awareness of addressing comorbid insomnia during the assessment, case conceptualisation, and treatment planning phases. To ensure older adults with comorbid insomnia have access to this form of psychological treatment, mental health services could also consider training a therapist on their multidisciplinary team in CBT-I, or at least source an external CBT sleep specialist as a referral option. These implications could potentially improve therapeutic outcomes for older adults receiving mental health services by ensuring clinicians are better equipped to address comorbid insomnia.</p><p>This project also plans to explore whether improving an older adult&#x02019;s sleep pattern with CBT-I has an associated positive impact on their mood. Recent preliminary evidence suggests CBT-I can have a positive effect of depression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]; however, these studies have substantial methodological limitations that restrict the generalisability of the results. Consequently, this study aims to test whether CBT-I generates greater reductions in depressive severity compared to a PCG. If the results indicate that CBT-I is more effective at improving depression compared to the control condition, aged psychiatric services could consider adding CBT-I as a regular treatment option for their clients presenting with comorbid insomnia and depression.</p><p>A unique feature of this trial involves testing an advanced form of CBT-I that includes additional strategies to address comorbid depression among older adults. Although recent studies (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]) have suggested that specifically designed CBT-I programs may produce better overall outcomes for targeted populations (for example, older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression), no study has tested whether an advanced CBT-I-D program is more effective than a standard CBT-I program. The results following this specific investigation could highlight that CBT-I is sufficient to address both insomnia and depression or indicate CBT-I-D is clinically indicated to better treat these conditions simultaneously. This result could guide future CBT-I treatment programs in relation to either broadening or lessening the scope of treatment.</p><p>Finally, we are interested in studying the participants&#x02019; experiences from taking part in a CBT trial for insomnia and depression. The information gained from a mixed methods design will provide an opportunity to gather rich, personal data through older adults that can either confirm or disconfirm the questionnaire outcome measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This can open new avenues of explanation for particular findings that traditional quantitative measures cannot detect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. For example, results from the reflective focus groups may indicate participants benefitted from specific CBT strategies that would not be revealed through quantitative data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, participants may provide innovative feedback that is particularly relevant to the delivery of CBT-I among this complex aged population. Therefore, it is expected that the qualitative findings from this project will enhance the direction of future research in this field.</p><p>Despite the important implications that may result from this study protocol, the project will likely include limitations. First, no physiological measure of sleep (for example, polysomnography) will be assessed to cross-validate the clinical interview and self-report data. This means that the assessments throughout the trial will be reliant on subjective measures from the participants and researchers, as opposed to objective biological data. Since no standardised clinical diagnostic instrument has been established yet for the <italic>DSM-V</italic>, the authors updated existing <italic>DSM-IV</italic> diagnostic instruments (for example, MINI 6.0) to be consistent with the <italic>DSM-V</italic> diagnostic criteria. Finally, participant recruitment and retention rates could be negatively affected due to this population likely experiencing stronger symptoms of tiredness, hopelessness, and amotivation. Hence, recruiting participants and keeping them engaged throughout the program will likely create significant challenges. Notwithstanding these limitations, the results following this study protocol will likely contribute important knowledge that improves case formulation and treatment planning for older adults with comorbid insomnia and depression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment began in August 2014 and will continue until June 2016.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CBT</term><def><p>cognitive behaviour therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT-I</term><def><p>cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CBT-I-D</term><def><p>cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia and depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCG</term><def><p>psycho-education control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare there are no competing interests in this study.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PS is the principal investigator of the project and is responsible for directly supervising the recruitment, assessment, and intervention phases of the trial.
