Parents with high levels of distress are found to respond less adequately and sensitively to their infant, which in turn affects infant well-being and health. The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and enhance the quality of caregiving and infant well-being. In contrast to other interventions, this intervention will be (1) offered already before birth, (2) offered to all parents-to-be, regardless of their risk of postpartum distress, and (3) include fathers. The proposed study examines the effectiveness of this intervention on (1) parenting distress, (2) quality of caregiving, and (3) the infant&#x02019;s well-being.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">In this randomized controlled trial, 128 pregnant women and their partners will be recruited through midwifery practices and general media. Women with a complicated pregnancy, current psychopathology, insufficient Dutch language proficiency and without Internet access will be excluded. Parents will be randomized to either the intervention or a waitlist control group. The intervention consists of a booklet and video (offered prenatally), a home visit at 34&#x02013;36 weeks of pregnancy and a telephone call 4&#x000a0;weeks after birth. Information and practical tools are provided on (1) sensitive responding and making contact with the baby, (2) crying, (3) feeding, and (4) sleeping. Assessments will take place at baseline (26&#x02013;34 weeks of pregnancy), during the home visit (34&#x02013;36 weeks of pregnancy), and 2, 6, and 10&#x000a0;weeks after birth. The control group will be offered the intervention after the end of the study. The primary outcome is maternal parenting stress. Secondary outcomes are: paternal parenting stress, parental well-being, quality of caregiving, and infant well-being and health.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The goal of this study is to test the effects of a psycho-educational prenatal parenting intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and to enhance well-being in both parents and infants. When the intervention appears effective it can be implemented broadly because of its low costs. It will make support available for a large number of parents and their children.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Netherlands National Trial Register, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=6065">NTR6065</ext-link>.

While this life event often brings joy and happiness, the first months can also be challenging for parents (van Scheppingen, Denissen, Chung, Tambs, and Bleidorn, in press [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]). Parents have to develop a range of new skills in taking care for their infant, which requires extra effort and energy, while at the same time they have to deal with a significant lack of sleep. It is not surprising, therefore, that roughly 14% of mothers and 10% of fathers experience moderate or severe levels of postpartum distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], mainly consisting of depressive symptoms (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]). This study examines the effectiveness of a psycho-educational intervention to prevent postpartum parental distress and enhance infant well-being.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Parental distress and sensitive responding to the infant&#x02019;s needs</title><p id="Par16">Parental distress (including, but not limited to, stress related to the parental role) has been related to decreased quality of caregiving. Both maternal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] as well as paternal depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] have been associated with a range of negative outcomes for the child&#x02019;s emotional, cognitive and behavioral development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The supposed mechanism underlying this link is that depressed parents are less able to respond sensitively to their infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Sensitivity refers to the extent to which caregivers timeously and appropriately respond to the infant&#x02019;s needs and signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Caregiver sensitivity has been identified as one of the most robust predictors of the development of a secure attachment bond between parent and child [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Moreover, sensitivity has also been associated with increased social competence, resilience, regulatory capacities, and lower stress levels later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Other important characteristics of caregiving behavior are the type of feeding and the infant sleeping location that parents have arranged. Current Dutch guidelines advise parents to exclusively breastfeed for 6&#x000a0;months, and to share their room with the infant for 6&#x000a0;months (infant sleeping in its own crib in the parents&#x02019; room, but not in the parental bed) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The World Health Organization (WHO) also recommends exclusive breastfeeding until the infant is 6&#x000a0;months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Breastfeeding has been related to important health benefits for the child, including protection against of infections, overweight, and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Moreover, breastfeeding has been related to increased cognitive development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Next to breastfeeding, there is international agreement on the benefits of room-sharing during the first 6&#x000a0;months of the infant&#x02019;s life. Room-sharing protects from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]). Also, being close to the infant facilitates the process of breastfeeding at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There are indications that the proximity of the parent functions as a buffer against the infant&#x02019;s distress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Despite these recommendations, it has been demonstrated that both breastfeeding and room-sharing are frequently discontinued in the first 2&#x000a0;months of the infant&#x02019;s life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Interventions to reduce parental distress</title><p id="Par18">There are a number of interventions available that have been proven effective in reducing parental distress ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]). These interventions mostly start during the postpartum period and are tailored at families from high-risk populations, such as families with low socioeconomic status (SES), parents of an infant born prematurely, foster parents, and parents from children at risk for developing autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, these previous interventions mostly focused on only the mother. This is remarkable because research has shown that the father can play an important role; for example, in supporting the mother with breastfeeding and prolonging the breastfeeding period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Also, intervention studies aimed at treating maternal depression showed that inclusion of the father in treatment led to greater successes of the treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Paternal support might protect against maternal stress and the development of postpartum depression, and mitigate the negative effects of depression on the mother-infant interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Furthermore, it has also been found that fathers tend to decrease their involvement in childcare when they suffer from psychological adjustment difficulties around the transition to parenthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, previous research has pointed to the importance of including fathers in the intervention as this might have positive effects on the well-being of both parents as well as on the quality of their caregiving.</p><p id="Par19">To our knowledge, there is only one intervention to date that focused on parents from both low- and high-risk groups. This intervention consists of psycho-education about infant sleep and crying patterns, in combination with a telephone consult and a parent group, and showed positive results in a randomized controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, the intervention did not include information on sensitivity or feeding, and it was offered postpartum. Furthermore, as only data of the primary caregiver was collected, almost only data from the mother was available as a result.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The current study</title><p id="Par20">We developed an intervention which can be offered during pregnancy, to both mothers and fathers, regardless of their risk of postpartum distress. The intervention consists of psycho-education (booklet and video) as well as a prenatal home visit and a postpartum telephone call.</p><p id="Par21">We expect that the proposed intervention will reduce maternal parenting stress. Furthermore, we expect that the intervention will reduce paternal parenting stress and parental distress in general. Moreover, we expect that parental well-being will be enhanced. By psycho-educating parents during pregnancy, we expect parents to experience more self-efficacy and satisfaction in fulfilling their roles. In this way, parents should be better able to provide high-quality caregiving (including breastfeeding and co-sleeping), leading to enhanced infant well-being (less problems with sleeping, crying and feeding, and better well-being and health) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Primary and secondary study outcomes (jpeg)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2348_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par22">The primary objective of this study is to determine the postpartum effect of the intervention on maternal parenting stress.

Alternatively, parents can contact us directly by responding to online advertisements in which a link to the website is provided. On the website, a registration form can be filled out. Upon registering, parents will receive the digital information brochure of the study and an informed consent form. Following the Declaration of Helsinki, it will be clearly indicated on the informed consent form that study participation is entirely voluntary and that participants can withdraw from participation at any time without any negative consequences for them or their child.

Furthermore, women need sufficient Dutch language proficiency to understand the information offered to them during the intervention (through a booklet and a video). Also, access to the Internet is required to be able to complete the online questionnaires. Women with current psychopathology (defined as current treatment for psychopathology or treatment in the 6&#x000a0;months before inclusion) will be excluded.

We will use random sequence blocks (blocks between 6 and 8), stratified by birth order (first child/ no first child) and paternal participation (yes/no). An independent researcher will allocate each consenting participant to either the control or the intervention group. Given the nature and design of the study, blinding after randomization is not possible. Participants will receive the outcome of randomization by e-mail.&#x000a0;Please refer to Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> for an overview of participant's flow through the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intervention</title><p id="Par28">Parents will receive access to the psycho-education materials (booklet and video) directly after randomisation, which is between the 26th and the 34th weeks of pregnancy (depending on when the parents apply for participation). The intervention further consists of two support sessions: one home visit between 34 and 36&#x000a0;weeks of pregnancy and one telephone call 4&#x000a0;weeks after birth.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Psycho-educational booklet and video</title><p id="Par29">In general, the intervention conveys the importance of responding sensitively to the needs of the infant. The psycho-educational booklet developed by Hiscock et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] was used as a starting point. We developed and extended the intervention further based on recent empirical research and together with a number of different experts on attachment (researchers), breastfeeding (lactation consultants), and pre and postnatal care for both mother and child (midwives). Our booklet consists of four chapters about: (1) sensitive responding and making contact with the baby, (2) crying, (3) feeding, and (4) sleeping. The first chapter includes information about contact-seeking behavior of the baby and how to interpret infant&#x02019;s signals of distress and respond to these adequately (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]). The chapter also includes information explaining the needs of the infant (such as the need for closeness, skin-to-skin contact, and sensitive care), followed by a discussion about the parent&#x02019;s own needs and how to attend to these. Then, the booklet continues with a chapter about crying. The normal crying curve is addressed, and different tools are provided on how to sooth a baby. Also, potential causes of excessive crying are discussed. The third chapter about feeding includes information about hunger signals that the baby might convey. Information is given on breastfeeding, and its positive effects for both mother and child. Practical information about the use of formula milk is also provided. The fourth and final chapter on sleeping provides information on average sleeping patterns and sleep signals that a tired baby might convey. Moreover, the importance of room-sharing during the first 6&#x000a0;months will be discussed and suggestions on when and how to support the infant in learning to sleep alone in a separate room are given. It is also important to note here that sensitive care is put central in our intervention, and that, for example, &#x0201c;crying it out&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;camping it out&#x0201d; techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], in which parents are instructed to let infants cry for a specified amount of time, are not included in our intervention. The booklets ends with a section about common baby myths, such as &#x0201c;Keeping the baby awake all day, will make the baby sleep better during the night&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;When I pick up my baby every time, I will spoil the baby.&#x0201d; The booklet consists of written text and pictures. Most importantly, the booklet provides many examples on how to use the information in daily life. In the booklet, it is explained that the provided information is not meant to be prescriptive; rather, it encourages parents to distil those elements that are most helpful for them in their specific situation (while keeping the principles of sensitive care in their mind). This way, parents can start discovering which tools fit best with their and their infant&#x02019;s preferences and needs.</p><p id="Par30">At the same time as the booklet, participants receive access to an online video. This video is developed by psychologists who are experts in promoting the mental health of babies and their parents by translating academic knowledge into easily accessible interventions (Stichting Babywerk, The Netherlands). The video serves as an illustration of the topics which are described in the booklet and shows practical examples. It is a story format in which the experiences of (upcoming) parents are shown. An expert on infant development comments on each of the fragments. Also, after each fragment, participants are confronted with a thought-provoking question about what they just have seen. The aim of these questions is to stimulate participants to think about the information in relation to their lives. For example, in the story, the upcoming mother is worried that she will be unable to put her mobile phone away when her baby is awake. At this point, the participant will be asked what their thoughts are about this issue. Next, the expert explains why being able to recognize and respond to the infant&#x02019;s signals is important. After the explanation, the video shows how to notice and respond to an infant seeking eye contact. Watching the video and responding to the questions takes about 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;min. The parents are encouraged to put this advice into practice after the birth of their child.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Support sessions</title><p id="Par31">Parents will be visited at home during weeks 34&#x02013;36 of the pregnancy. The primary aim of this home visit is to discuss the provided information (booklet and video) and to answer any questions about the materials the parents might have. The secondary aim is to explain that the provided information is not meant to be prescriptive; rather, we aim to provide parents with a set of tools (the practical examples) that they can choose from. By means of provided materials, we ask participants to start discovering which tools fit best with their and their infant&#x02019;s preferences and needs.</p><p id="Par32">Four weeks after the birth of their child, parents will be contacted by telephone. During this call, we will ask the parents how they and their child are doing, and whether they are experiencing any problems in implementing the information from the booklet and the video in their daily lives. Also, parents are given the opportunity to ask questions with regard to their infant&#x02019;s feeding, crying, sleeping, and contact-seeking behavior. They can also ask questions with regard to their own well-being (i.e., experienced stress or feelings of anxiety).

In contrast to other interventions, this intervention will be offered (1) already before birth, (2) to all parents-to-be, regardless of their risk of postpartum distress, and (3) to include fathers.</p><p id="Par67">We expect parents to experience less distress and higher well-being after the birth of their child compared to parents who do not receive this intervention. In turn, we expect that this will have positive effects on the quality of their caregiving, and ultimately on the infant&#x02019;s well-being and health, resulting in less parent-reported problems with sleeping, crying, and feeding, and increased infant health.</p><p id="Par68">The intervention is focused on sensitive caregiving; that is, responding timely and adequately to the infant&#x02019;s needs. The booklet consists of four chapters; on making contact and sensitive responding, crying, feeding, and sleeping. A video is available to illustrate the topics mentioned in the booklet. During a prenatal home visit, the provided materials will be discussed. After birth, parents receive a supportive telephone call. Throughout the intervention, it will be underlined that no part of the intervention is meant to be prescriptive; rather, the intervention has been developed to support parents in choosing those elements that are most helpful for them in their specific situation. Indeed, by offering the intervention we aim to stimulate parents to think about and discuss the information provided, whether or not they will implement everything that they have learned. This way, we expect both parents to be better equipped for the transition to parenthood.</p><p id="Par69">In our view the timing of implementation of our psycho-educational intervention is crucial. By intervening already during pregnancy (and continuing to offer support during the first months after birth), our aim is to prevent or mitigate distress among parents and infants &#x02013; and related problems with breastfeeding and co-sleeping &#x02013; during the first hours, days, and weeks of the infant&#x02019;s life. In this way, the infant&#x02019;s health and early development can optimally benefit. The intervention is low-cost, easy to implement, and can be distributed on a large scale: a large number of parents and infants can thus be supported during a crucial period of their lives.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par70">Recruitment started in November 2016 and is ongoing.
