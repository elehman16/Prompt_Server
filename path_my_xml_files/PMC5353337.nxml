The proposed Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) &#x02018;Goals of Patient Care&#x02019; (GOPC) form incorporates a resident's prior advance care plan into medical treatment orders. Where none exists, it captures residents' preferences. This documentation helps guide healthcare decisions made at times of acute clinical deterioration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a mixed methods study. An unblinded cluster randomised controlled trial is proposed in three pairs of RACFs. In the intervention arm, GOPC forms will be completed by a doctor incorporating advance care plans or wishes. In the control arm, residents will have usual care which may include an advance care plan. The primary hypothesis is that the GOPC form is superior to standard ACP alone and will lead to decreased hospitalisation due to clearer documentation of residents' medical treatment plans. The primary outcome will be an analysis of the effect of the GOPC medical treatment orders on emergency department attendances and hospital admissions at 6&#x02005;months. Secondary outcome measurements will include change in hospitalisation rates at 3 and 12&#x02005;months, length of stay and external mortality rates among others. Qualitative interviews, 12&#x02005;months post GOPC implementation, will be used for process evaluation of the GOPC and to evaluate staff perceptions of the form's usefulness for improving communication and medical decision-making at a time of deterioration.</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination</title><p>The results will be disseminated in peer review journals and research conferences. This robust randomised controlled trial will provide high-quality data about the influence of medical treatment orders that incorporate ACP or preferences adding to the current gap in knowledge and evidence in this area.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.anzctr.org.au/Trial/Registration/TrialReview.aspx?id=368179">ACTRN12615000298516</ext-link>, Results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Advance Care Planning</kwd><kwd>Medical Treatment Orders</kwd><kwd>Residential Aged Care Facilities</kwd><kwd>End-Of-Life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>New medical treatment order, specifically for aged care facility residents.</p></list-item><list-item><p>First randomised controlled trial examining the effects of the Goals of Patient Care (GOPC) process in Residential Aged Care Facilities.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Quantitative and qualitative methods for thorough examination of the GOPC medical treatment orders' effects.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Small number of residential aged care facilities involved.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The GOPC is not evaluated in this study for its effect on improving compliance of medical treatment with the residents' treatment preferences.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Goals of Patient Care (GOPC) form</title><p>The trial Residential Aged Care Facility (RACF) GOPC form (see online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">supplementary appendix 1</xref>) is a document used to record medical treatment plans for residents in the event of clinical deterioration. It takes into account the current medical condition as well as residents' wishes and any prior advance care planning (ACP). As it is specifically for residents in RACFs, it identifies whether residents are open to hospital transfer for treatment escalation. The form is completed by a physician with the resident or their substitute medical decision-maker (SDM), or both.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-013909.supp1</object-id><label>supplementary appendix</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2016-013909supp_appendix1.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material><p>The GOPC form originated in Tasmania, Australia, where it was developed for their inpatient and RACF populations.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This approach identifies: (1) the overall goals of care; and (2) specific treatment escalation and limitations proportionate to that goal. The aim is to avoid focusing only on interventions in isolation, such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), intubation or intravenous antibiotics. In 2013, this approach was adapted by one of the authors (BH) to replace the hospital &#x02018;limitation of medical treatment&#x02019; form in use by Northern Health, Victoria.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> From this, BH developed the trial version of the GOPC specifically for RACF residents addressing limitations to treatment and place of care. The form was developed in consultation with geriatricians working with the RACF inreach service. This is the first study examining its effects on RACF residents. The form has been made available to other health services in the state of Victoria and there are plans for its wider use.</p><p>There are three overall goals with six potential goal options, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016013909F1">figure 1</xref>:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Goal A and B apply to residents for whom the plan is to treat reversible illness, even if the burdens of that treatment might be considerable; hospital transfer would be appropriate. Goal A identifies residents for no treatment limitation and for whom attempted CPR would apply. Goal B identifies residents for whom some treatment limitations apply, including not for attempted CPR or intubation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Goal C applies to residents for whom investigations or treatment should only be undertaken if non-burdensome. Goal C1 identifies residents for trial of treatment at facility and for hospital transfer if required. Goal C2 identifies residents for trial of treatment at the facility but not for hospital transfer in the event of deterioration. Goal C3 identifies residents who are not for further treatments of new illnesses, and who are opting for symptom management only.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Goal D identifies residents who are in the terminal stage of illness (last hours and days of life), and for whom all interventions should be for comfort only.</p></list-item></list></p><fig id="BMJOPEN2016013909F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The options on the Goals of Patient Care medical treatment orders as seen on the complete Goals of Patient Care Residential Aged Care Facility form are shown here.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016013909f01"/></fig><p>The GOPC form is different from, but related to, an advance care plan. An advance care plan is usually regarded as a communique between residents or their SDM and staff, and is completed by the resident/SDM. The GOPC, however, is a communique between staff and is completed by a doctor. Using a shared decision-making discussion with the resident and/or SDM, information about the resident's illness trajectory, potential for deterioration and medical management options is provided. Within this context, prior ACP is translated into clinical language to guide healthcare professionals in their treatment decisions for that resident. In the absence of formal prior ACP, medical treatment planning can still take place by exploring, and taking into account, the resident's values and what matters most to them. This can be done with a resident who retains capacity or with the SDM of a resident lacking capacity to participate. Availability of a GOPC form can be particularly helpful when a resident is being reviewed by a doctor or nurse who is unfamiliar with that person, their values or their treatment plans. Availability of a completed GOPC form is not intended to replace a discussion with the SDM at the time of deterioration. It does provide a starting point for that discussion by a clinician who does not know the resident and can be particularly helpful when the SDM is unable to be contacted in a timely way. Additionally, the language is unambiguous and directive in nature.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Background</title><p>Systematic review identifies ACP as a beneficial intervention for aged care facility residents.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Studies in the USA have shown improvements in treatment decisions for residents with the introduction of medical treatment forms such as the Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST) and others adapted from it.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Such studies have not been conducted in Australia and the intention of this study is to show that such innovations are translatable to our target population. We hypothesise that the introduction of this medical treatment order will lead to decreased acute healthcare usage, when compared with usual care, by improving communication of the residents&#x02019; wishes to all healthcare staff leading to more appropriate healthcare decisions.</p><p>The POLST was first introduced to address shortcomings found with advance care plans, including difficulty with their interpretation<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;9</xref> and not being in a form that ambulance paramedics could follow.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A systematic review of the literature has shown that extensive ACP interventions have resulted in increased compliance with patient wishes and satisfaction with care, but needs to include more than just a written document.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The POLST intervention, like the GOPC form, was developed to help ensure the wishes of individuals with advanced illness or frailty were honoured by documenting their preferences as medical treatment orders.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Studies have shown that patients with such orders were less likely to receive unwanted interventions including hospitalisation,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13&#x02013;15</xref> and intravenous fluids,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> than those with traditional ACPs alone.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>The incidence of transfers from RACFs to the emergency department (ED) has been measured at &#x0003c;30 transfers per 100 bed days,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> but varies depending on facility and location. Hospitalisation can be burdensome for nursing home residents,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> and many, when asked, would prefer to be treated in their RACF where possible.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Given their frailty, high incidence of dementia and multimorbidity RACF residents have an increased incidence of acute illness compared with the ambulatory population. This is reflected by a high incidence of acute healthcare usage.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Up to 48% of these hospital transfers are thought to be avoidable.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>

<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> hinders the decision-making capacity of the resident, especially at times of acute illness. The prevalence of dementia also means that at the time of admission to the RACF, many residents will no longer be able to undertake their own ACP. Local RACF practice for this situation is to invite the SDM to complete an ACP on behalf of the resident, a document that cannot have the same authority as a resident-completed advance care plan. The introduction of the RACF &#x02018;GOPC&#x02019; medical treatment orders will make the wishes of frail residents clearer, but within the parameters of treatment that might be effective for their condition. We hypothesise that the GOPC implementation will result in medical decisions being more congruent with residents' wishes, and more appropriate for residents' medical conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to show that the introduction of the &#x02018;GOPC&#x02019; medical treatment orders will lead to decreased ED attendances and admissions for RACF residents at 6&#x02005;months post implementation as compared with usual care, by improving communication of the residents wishes leading to more appropriate usage of acute hospital care.</p><p>The secondary objectives are to demonstrate that between intervention and control facilities the intervention will result in:

It will be placed in the residents notes in their section on ACP.

In some facilities the RACF staff is involved in the ACP discussion and form completion. In others, the GPs are either required to be involved in the discussion or simply to sign the completed form.

This trial design will allow for clustering of sites with similar key baseline characteristics thus limiting the intracluster variance and allowing for better comparison. By clustering residents by site, contamination of effect between residents in the same facility will be minimised. By using a control arm, it will be possible to examine and compare the effect of the intervention versus that of usual care. By minimising exclusion criteria, it is expected that a representative sample of all nursing home residents will be recruited for the study.</p><p>Hospitalisation has been chosen as the primary outcome measure for this study as it is well described as a positive effect of other types of ACP.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>

The GOPC form clearly states whether residents are open to a trial of treatment in the facility and if they wish for hospital transfer for treatment escalation if not improving. The clear language should avoid ambiguity and should help staff more easily decide on a treatment plan according to the prior choices made on the form.</p><p>Death rates and place of death are being examined to identify whether the form leads to a greater number of residents dying within the facility, which is the preference of the majority of residents and their SDMs.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Prior studies have shown that ACP can increase the rates of residents dying in their home by 29&#x02013;40%.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>

Additionally, the effect the GOPC form had on the decisions made for residents when they became unwell will be explored, together with whether the decisions made were consistent with the medical treatment plan documented on the form. It is expected that the GOPC form, with clearly stated intentions for treatment, will help decision-making at a time of clinical deterioration and decrease conflict between healthcare staff. There is rich information about use of the form that can only be identified through this qualitative analysis. It is expected that the reported experiences of nursing staff, management staff and GPs with ACP, and with the GOPC form, will provide valuable insights about the use of medical treatment orders in RACFs.</p><p>Limitations in the study include a small number of included RACFs; it would provide further confidence in the results to repeat it with an increased sample size. The primary outcome is hospitalisation rather than congruency with wishes, which is a secondary outcome; however, due to an inability to accurately identify all the times in which actions would be congruent with wishes as well as not, it was felt hospitalisation would be a more accurate observation. The reasons for any identified hospitalisations against proposed wishes will then be reviewed.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The GOPC medical treatment orders are an innovation in the field of ACP.
