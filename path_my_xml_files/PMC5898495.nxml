There is evidence, however, that home fortification at this iron dose may cause gastrointestinal adverse events including diarrhoea. Providing a low dose of highly absorbable iron (3&#x000a0;mg iron as NaFeEDTA) may be safer because the decreased amount of iron in the gut lumen can possibly reduce the burden of these adverse effects whilst resulting in similar or higher amounts of absorbed iron.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>To show non-inferiority of home fortification with 3&#x000a0;mg iron as NaFeEDTA compared with 12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as encapsulated ferrous fumarate, with haemoglobin response as the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>338 Kenyan children aged 12&#x02013;36 months will be randomly allocated to daily home fortification with either: a) 3&#x000a0;mg iron as NaFeEDTA (experimental treatment), b) 12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as encapsulated ferrous fumarate (reference), or c) placebo.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends daily universal home fortification with iron for children aged 6&#x02013;23 months in populations where the prevalence of anaemia in children under 5 years of age is&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;20% <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

We perceive a placebo arm to be ethical in the presence of an active control because in our study area there is no national policy for preventive, community-based supplementation or home fortification with iron in children and yet the children under five year are at a greater risk of iron deficiency anaemia. Because there is an on-going uncertainty about the safety of iron interventions in children living in malaria-endemic areas, our trial represents the only chance for eligible children to receive fortificants of iron with micronutrients for the iron arms and fortificants of micronutrients for the placebo arm with malaria chemoprevention. Thus prohibition of the trial on ethical grounds would be against the interest of eligible children and their guardians.</p><p id="p0235">Use of a placebo is necessary in our explanatory trial because we aim to demonstrate that the experimental treatment (3&#x000a0;mg iron as NaFeEDTA) is non-inferior to the active control (12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as encapsulated ferrous fumarate). The demonstration of non-inferiority in a trial with only two arms can have two meanings only: both interventions are equally effective, or both interventions are equally ineffective against placebo. Furthermore, a placebo matches the comparative treatments in all ways except for the therapeutic components, and therefore the use of a standard treatment alone may not necessarily control for the same set of non-specific factors as a placebo <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Overall, the placebo group is useful for a) demonstration of superiority of home fortification with 3&#x000a0;mg iron as NaFeEDTA over placebo (proof of efficacy); b) demonstration of superiority of the reference (12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as encapsulated ferrous fumarate) over placebo (proof of assay sensitivity) c) demonstration that home fortification with 3&#x000a0;mg iron as NaFeEDTA retains most of the efficacy of the reference over placebo (proof of non-inferiority) because failure for a test drug to demonstrate effectiveness does not necessarily mean it is not efficacious.</p><p id="p0240">Increased medical knowledge has mistakenly been used to justify dropping the use of placebo in trials; conversely, increased medical knowledge has subsequently propell the production of new treatments.

European Medicine Agency regulatory guidelines <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> clearly state that when interpreting a non-inferiority trial for a potentially superior outcome there is no need to do multiplicity adjustment because a statistical significance test must be done to reject the non-inferiority. In line with these regulatory guidelines for non-inferiority trials we will not adjust for multiplicity for various reasons; first, our study has only one pre-defined primary variable (haemoglobin concentration at the end of the 30-day intervention period) that will be used to demonstrate the treatment effect. Second, as outlined in the preceding section, all three comparisons of treatment effects must show statistical significance of the haemoglobin concentration. We will therefore conduct multiple regression analysis to investigate evidence for group differences in the intervention effects and to determine the extent of bias due to irregularities between end points, because we believe that results from multiple comparisons should be mutually reinforcing, not mutually debasing <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref> and hence no need for multiplicity adjustments. Third, any absence of treatment effect differences will be interpreted by confidence interval in the context of the set threshold for haemoglobin concentration (at a pre-set margin of 4.7&#x000a0;g/L) and all reported p-values will be 2-sided. The use of confidence intervals and statistical tests are of an exploratory nature and therefore no justification for a claim is anticipated. In addition, any multiple secondary endpoints analysis will provide supportive evidence related to our primary objective (proof of efficacy) and therefore no confirmatory conclusions are necessary.

Before you decide you need to understand why the research is being done and what it would involve for you. Please take time to read the following information carefully. Talk to others about the study if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information. Take time to decide whether or not you wish to take part.</italic></p><sec id="appsec3.1"><title>What is the purpose of the study?</title><p id="p0275">We want to conduct a study to compare home fortification with two iron formulations. Many young children in Kenya have anaemia, a disorder that is characterized by blood with a light red colour, instead of a healthy dark red. The red pigment in blood is necessary to transport oxygen from inspired air to muscle. Children with anaemia often feel weak or tired, and may have difficulty learning. To prevent anaemia in children, medical doctors often prescribe supplements that contain 12.5&#x000a0;mg iron in a specific form (ferrous salts). A new form of iron has recently become available that can probably be given at lower doses, because the body is better able to absorb this type of iron.</p><p id="p0280">In our study, we will divide young children into three groups and give each group a different treatment. Group 1 will receive the form of iron that has been used so far (12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as ferrous fumarate), Group 2 will receive the new form of iron (3&#x000a0;mg iron as sodium iron EDTA), and Group 3 will receive no iron. The results will be compared to determine if the new type of iron (3&#x000a0;mg iron as sodium iron EDTA) can prevent anaemia, and to determine if it is equally as good as the form of iron that has been used so far (12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as ferrous fumarate).</p><p id="p0285">We will provide both forms of iron in sachets (little bags). Each day, the mother should empty and mix the contents of a single sachet into ready-prepared <italic>uji</italic> or some other type of food, before giving it to the child. This should be repeated every day for a period of 30 days. The child will be followed for some time afterwards.</p><p id="p0290">Although iron is good to prevent anaemia, there are some concerns that it may increase the risk of malaria. For this reason, we will treat each child with a special medicine against malaria (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) at the start of the study, before the first dose of iron is provided. This medicine will protect the child against malaria for the time period in which the child will receive iron. In addition, all children will be dewormed at the start using two drugs (albendazole and praziquantel).</p></sec><sec id="appsec3.2"><title>Do you have to participate?</title><p id="p0295">We have asked you to take part because your child is within the age range suitable for our study. In total, we want to study 324 children. You can let your child join the study at your own free will, and withdraw your child at any moment, with or without giving reasons. . If you decide not to participate, or to withdraw from the study, this will not affect the normal care you receive in clinics or hospital elsewhere.</p><p id="p0300">Read this information sheet and listen to our explanation of the study. We will then ask you to sign a consent form to show you have agreed to take part.</p></sec><sec id="appsec3.3"><title>What will happen to you if you take part?</title><p id="p0305"><italic>Screening visit:</italic> Our staff will invite you and your child to our research clinic to tell you about the aims and procedures of the study. If you agree for your child to participate, we will ask you to sign their fingerprint on a consent form. To decide whether your child can participate in the study, we will then ask you questions about your child, we will carry out a medical examination, and we will then collect samples of blood (6&#x000a0;mL, a volume equal to one table spoon) by arm prick, urine and stool from the child. This will take at least several hours. We will ask you to stay until if the child has produced stool. If necessary we will invite to and your child again the next day to try again. After sample collection, your child will be administered medicines (albendazole, praziquantel against worms, and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine against malaria). You will be asked to bring your child again to the research clinic 3 days later.</p><p id="p0310"><italic>Randomisation visit:</italic> At this visit, we will use the information collected so far to decide if your child can take part in the rest of the study. Participating children will receive sachets with powder. These sachets will be contained in a special dispensing bottle that you will receive with instructions for use. For one-third of children, these sachets will contain 12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as ferrous fumarate, one-third will contain 3&#x000a0;mg iron as sodium iron EDTA, and one-third contains no iron. For all three groups, the sachets also contain a mixture of other vitamins and minerals that are important for health. The allocation to group will be decided by chance (randomly). All sachets will look identical; we will not know which supplements contain iron until after the study. The first sachet will be given with food at the research dispensary. From 2&#x000a0;h before this point until 3&#x000a0;h afterwards, children will be allowed to drink but can only eat foods selected by the project team. We will then collect another blood sample (about 5&#x02013;6 drops) by finger prick. From then on, community volunteers will daily supervise the supplementation in or close to your homestead.</p><p id="p0315"><italic>During the 30-day intervention period:</italic> In the next 30 days, you should add and mix the contents of a single sachet to <italic>uji</italic> or any other food given to the child. Community volunteers will visit your home at least once a week to answer questions that you may have about the study. Children who become sick during this 30-day period will be referred to receive routine care by the regular health services. You may decide to withdraw your child at any point from the study. You may refuse to give reasons for your refusal, or to give permission for future collection of samples.</p><p id="p0320"><italic>End-of-intervention survey:</italic> At the end of the 30-day period, we will collect the dispensing bottle and ask you some questions. We will again collect samples of blood (6&#x000a0;mL) by arm prick, stool and urine, using the same procedures as earlier. For each child, we will then break the randomisation code. Those who received placebo will be given antimalarial medicines (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) and 30-day supply of sachets with iron (12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as ferrous fumarate).</p><p id="p0325"><italic>Follow-up after the 30-day intervention period:</italic> For children who received placebo, field staff will collect the dispensing bottle with the electronic device at the end of this 30-day period. Children who received iron will continue to be followed for a maximum of 100 days. In this period, we will collect a single sample of blood (5&#x02013;6 drops, by finger prick). The time point for this collection will be decided by chance: for some children it may be as early as 1 week after home fortification was stopped; for others, it may be at the end of the 100-day period. Immediately following blood collection, children will be withdrawn from further study and will receive antimalarial medicines (dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine) and 30-day supply of sachets with iron (12.5&#x000a0;mg iron as ferrous fumarate). Field staff will also collect the dispensing bottle with the electronic device at this time.</p><p id="p0330">To summarise, we will collect four blood samples from each child:<list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0335"><italic>Randomisation visit:</italic> 1 sample of 6&#x000a0;mL (a volume equal to one table spoon), to be collected by arm prick;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0340"><italic>3&#x000a0;h later:</italic> 1 sample of 5&#x02013;6 drops, to be collected by finger prick;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0345"><italic>At the end of the 30-day period:</italic> 1 sample of 6&#x000a0;mL, to be collected by arm prick;</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0350"><italic>After the 30-day intervention period:</italic> 1 sample of 5&#x02013;6 drops, to be collected by finger prick.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="p0355">We will store part of the blood samples in frozen condition, so that we can subsequently conduct tests to assess the success of the interventions.
