When this hermetic seal cannot be obtained through an orthograde filling, a surgical procedure is conducted to place a retrograde root filling to prevent leakage of irritants from the root canal into the periradicular tissues, and vice versa.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>The materials used for this procedure, ideally, should have the best sealing ability with no microleakage and they should also possess properties like biocompatibility with periradicular tissues, should be non-resorbable, non-toxic, dimensionally stable, impervious to dissolution or breakdown by the tissue fluids and capable of being adapted as closely as possible to the dentinal walls of the root end preparation exhibiting no/or minimal microleakage so as to prevent penetration of tissue fluids into root canal or leakage of microorganisms and/or their toxins through the apical foramina into the surrounding tissues. In addition, it should be electrochemically active, easy to manipulate and radioopaque.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Various materials are flooded in the market that claim their supremacy regarding microleakage, e.g., Direct filling gold, Silver-amalgam, Glass ionomer cement, Light cure glass ionomer cement (LC GIC), Composite, Super&#x02013;ethoxy benzoic acid Super-ethoxy benzoic acid (EBA), Zinc oxide eugenol, Cavit, Gutta-percha, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] None so far has been declared ideal and only recommendations have been made on what appeared to be the best tolerated and clinically successful material.</p><p>Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is one of the recent innovations in dentistry that has multiple uses/applications, including as a retrograde filling material. Torabinejad <italic>et al</italic>. studied the sealing ability of a MTA when used as a root end filling material, and they concluded that leakage with MTA was significantly less compared with other root end filling materials.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The present study is envisaged to evaluate and compare the microleakage of MTA and other commonly used retrograde filling materials, e.g., LC GIC, composite and resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol, using the dye penetration method.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Ninety freshly extracted non-carious single-rooted maxillary and mandibular human anterior teeth were collected and stored in saline. Clinical crowns were sectioned at the cementoenamel junction using a high-speed air-rotor handpiece. The working length was determined by subtracting 0.5 mm from the length at which a no. 15 K file appeared at the apical foramen. The root canal was biomechanically prepared by using the step-back technique and obturated with gutta percha using the lateral condensation technique.</p><p>Roots were then stored at 37&#x000b0;C in an incubator at 100% humidity for 1 week. The apices of the obturated teeth were resected by removing 3 mm of each apex at 90&#x000b0; to the long axis of the tooth with a straight fissure diamond bur in a high-speed air-rotor handpiece with water coolant. A 3-mm-deep root end cavity was prepared. The prepared teeth were randomly divided into four experimental groups of 15 teeth each and two control groups of 15 teeth each. Each group was further divided into three subgroups of five teeth. The root end fillings, i.e., light-cured composite with-dentin bonding agents, LC GIC, resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol and MTA, were placed as per the manufacturer's instructions and according to the groups divided.</p><p>Samples of each group (except negative control) were coated with two coats of nail polish to the whole surface of the total length of each root except the tip of the root where the retrograde filling was applied. Roots with no retrograde preparation and with two coats of nail polish all over the tip were selected as negative control.</p><p>The samples were then immersed in 1% methylene blue at room temperature for 72 h, 96 h and 1 week [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. The teeth were then sectioned buccolingually and were fractured with the help of osteotome and mallet.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Division of samples</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JNSBM-4-403-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The sections with the retrograde filling were then examined under a travelling microscope (&#x000d7;10 magnification manufactured by quality apparatus) to evaluate for dye penetration.

This was in accordance with the study done by Bates <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] who determined the longitudinal sealing ability of the MTA as a root end filling material and found almost similar microleakage results with MTA throughout 2 weeks. The potent sealing ability of MTA was probably due to its hydrophilic nature and slight expansion, which might have occurred on being cured in a moist environment. This was further supported by Torabinejad <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] who concluded that hydration of the powder might have resulted in formation of the colloidal gel that solidified to a hard structure in less than 4 h. Least microleakage was shown by MTA in the present study, which is also in accordance to some other study conducted in Brazil.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Light-cured composite resin with a dentin bonding agent</title><p>The mean microleakage values for composite increased with time period, but this increase in microleakage was found to be non-significant. This potent sealing ability of composite with dentin bonding agent could be because the contraction gaps that formed between the composite resin and the dentin walls during polymerization might have been sealed by a resin impregnation technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Light-cured glass ionomer cement</title><p>The mean microleakage values of LC GIC slightly decreased at 96 h and further slightly increased at 1 week interval. The results were found to be non-significant. The high value of dye leakage with LC GIC could be explained by the fact that cement might have well adapted to one cavity wall but the gaps might have been developed on the other cavity wall, resulting in microleakage. Chong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] confirmed the above fact and suggested that polymerization contraction probably contributed to this phenomenon.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol</title><p>The results of the study indicated an increase in the mean microleakage values at all the time intervals, and this increase was found to be non-significant. This could be due to the development of larger gaps as a result of marginal deterioration and moisture contamination during the procedure, leading to increased dye leakage. It is also possible that resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol, which is reinforced with polystyrene, might have suffered marginal breakdown resulting in its poorer sealing ability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Positive control possessed maximum microleakage among the experimental materials. A positive control was required so as to ensure that our experiment was showing true results. Roots with no retrograde filling in the retrograde cavities were selected as positive control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The mean microleakage of positive control remained constant at all the time intervals.</p><p>Negative control roots with no retrograde preparation and with two coats of nail polish all over the tip were selected as negative control to ensure that microleakage around the experimental materials was not just because of errors in retrograde filling. Aqrabawi[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] emphasized the importance of taking a negative control during the dye leakage test.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Intergroup comparisons</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Mineral trioxide aggregate versus composite resin with dentin bonding agent</title><p>At 72 h, Student t test showed that the MTA (Group I) was highly significant when compared with the other groups, except Group II (Composite resin with dentin bonding agent), although it demonstrated less microleakage than composite, which is also in accordance with some other study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>The comparative sealing ability of composite resin at 72 h could be explained on the basis that the contraction gaps between composite resin and dentinal walls might have been formed during polymerization, which might have been sealed by the resin impregnation technique, leading to less microleakage values. MTA also showed expansion on setting in moisture, leading to comparable microleakage values. At 96 h and 1 week, one-way ANOVA analysis and Student t test showed a statistically significant difference in the microleakage values of MTA and composite resin with denting bonding agent, and this could be due to increase in polymerization shrinkage of the composite resin with time.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Mineral trioxide aggregate versus light cured glass ionomer cement</title><p>The Student <italic>t</italic>-test showed a highly significant relation between MTA and LC GIC throughout 1 week.

Chong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] suggested that polymerization contraction probably contributed to this phenomenon. On the other hand, MTA might have exhibited expansion while setting, leading to least microleakage.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Mineral trioxide aggregate versus resin modified zinc oxide eugenol</title><p>Resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol also showed significantly more microleakage than MTA when compared using the Student <italic>t</italic>-test.

Resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol might have suffered marginal breakdown, contributing to its poorer sealing ability.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] In contrast to our finding, Bates <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] in their study found that microleakage of MTA was almost similar to Super-EBA, which is also a zinc oxide eugenol-reinforced cement. This could be because of the difference in components used for reinforcement and variation in methodology.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Light cured glass ionomer cement versus composite resin with dentin bonding agent</title><p>The microleakage results of composite when compared with LC GIC using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test showed a highly significant difference in microleakage throughout the 1 week time interval.

A similar finding was reported by Chong <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] This could be because of marginal breakdown of resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol and high polymerization shrinkage of LC GIC. However, Alhadainy and Himel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] reported less dye penetration for LC GIC followed by Cavit &#x02013; a zinc oxide eugenol-based cement. According to them, the superiority of glass ionomer was because of its ability to adhere to dentin. In addition, LC GIC had good flow property that helped it seal the apical end of the furcal perforation.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-7"><title>Materials versus positive control</title><p>Highly significant results were found when the microleakage values for MTA and composite resin (except LC GIC and resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol) were compared using one-way ANOVA analysis and Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.

But, when LC GIC and resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol were compared with the positive control, although the mean values for microleakage with LC GIC and resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol were less, the difference found was non-significant. This could again be due to marginal breakdown of resin-modified zinc oxide eugenol and high polymerization shrinkage of LC GIC.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-8"><title>Materials versus negative control</title><p>Similarly, when MTA was compared with the negative control group using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test, a highly significant relation was found.
