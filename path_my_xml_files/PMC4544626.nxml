Physical and cognitive training have differential positive effects on cognition, but have been rarely applied in combination. This study evaluates synergistic effects of multicomponent physical exercise complemented with novel simultaneous cognitive training on cognition in older adults. We hypothesized that simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical components would add training specific cognitive benefits compared to exclusively physical training.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Seniors, older than 70 years, without cognitive impairment, were randomly assigned to either: 1) virtual reality video game dancing (DANCE), 2) treadmill walking with simultaneous verbal memory training (MEMORY), or 3) treadmill walking (PHYS). Each program was complemented with strength and balance exercises. Two 1-hour training sessions per week over 6 months were applied. Cognitive performance was assessed at baseline, after 3 and 6 months, and at 1-year follow-up. Multiple regression analyses with planned comparisons were calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Eighty-nine participants were randomized to the three groups initially, 71 completed the training, while 47 were available at 1-year follow-up.

This was confirmed by a large Italian epidemiological study demonstrating that aging-associated cognitive decline has a prevalence rate of 28% for people from 65 years to 84 years.<xref rid="b1-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Additionally, another 17% of this Italian population (n=4,785) showed objective evidence of cognitive decline without cognitive complaints, which add up to a total of 45% of people showing some kind of cognitive impairment without dementia. Since cognitive decline potentially threatens independence and quality of life for older adults, prevention and treatment of cognitive impairment in the elderly has assumed increasing importance.<xref rid="b2-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Two factors that may positively affect cognition in the elderly are physical activity and cognitive training.</p><p>Research has pointed out recently that physical activity may be relevant for healthy brain aging and may protect from cognitive decline and dementia.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Most physical intervention studies that focused on adaptations in cognitive performance, brain function, or brain structure, applied aerobic type exercise. Two meta-analytic studies reported that aerobic exercise is effective in increasing cognitive performance, in general, and executive function in particular.<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> More recent studies also found that strength and coordination training may positively affect cognitive abilities.<xref rid="b10-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Voelcker-Rehage et al<xref rid="b11-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> demonstrated training specific functional plasticity in the brain based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Thereby, aerobic training increased activation in the sensorimotor network and coordination training led to a higher activation of the visuospatial network,<xref rid="b11-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> whereas strength training changed the hemodynamic activity of brain regions associated with response inhibition processes.<xref rid="b12-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Cognitive training studies have often shown highly task specific effects.<xref rid="b13-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b17-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> More widespread transfer effects were found when different cognitive abilities were combined in complex interventions or lifestyle changes.<xref rid="b18-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Nevertheless, effects were often small, while aerobic training elicited both broad transfer and relatively large effects.<xref rid="b18-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These findings led to the assumption that not only the combination of different cognitive abilities but also the combination of cognitive and physical training improves cognitive performance in old age to a greater extent than the training of an isolated ability.<xref rid="b5-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b7-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b18-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Therefore, more and more studies pursue exactly this goal by administering a combined cognitive&#x02013; physical training approach.</p><p>Some studies applied the physical and cognitive training sessions in a sequential manner,<xref rid="b23-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> whereas others performed the physical and cognitive training units simultaneously.<xref rid="b27-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> An advantage of simultaneous training designs might be that they include dual tasking and switching attention between the cognitive and physical activity. For instance, Theill et al<xref rid="b27-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> investigated the effects of simultaneous memory training and treadmill walking and revealed benefits in cognitive&#x02013;motor dual-task walking compared to a single cognitive training and a passive control group. Virtual reality video game dancing represents a novel mode of simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training and has been applied by Pichierri et al.<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Intervention groups demonstrated increased cognitive&#x02013;motor dual-task performance in a stepping accuracy task<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> or during fast walking,<xref rid="b29-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> respectively. Nonetheless, interpretation of the existing studies on combined cognitive&#x02013;physical training is often limited due to small sample sizes,<xref rid="b24-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b26-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> inconsistent training exposures between intervention groups,<xref rid="b23-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> or the lack of reference groups with only physical training.<xref rid="b27-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Moreover, transfer to different cognitive domains was not assessed in some studies<xref rid="b28-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and most interventions lasted for 4 months at most.<xref rid="b23-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b26-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b30-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This duration might be too short since physical training interventions of 6 months or longer have shown most consistent effects on cognition.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Therefore, we suggest that the promising findings in previous research are worth further investigation.</p><p>This study aims to compare two variations of simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training with an exclusively physical multicomponent program and to evaluate the effects of these programs on cognition in healthy elderly people. We hypothesize, first, that simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training may create additional beneficial effects on cognition, and second, that the two cognitive&#x02013;physical training variations may lead to differential cognitive adaptations. Based on previous findings, reported earlier, we expect cognition to improve in all three programs. Furthermore, we aim to investigate the performance maintenance 1 year after the training interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This study was a randomized, controlled trial (RCT), including a three groups parallel 6-months training intervention and a 1-year nonintervention follow-up.

Verbal memory training consisted of a computer-based serial position training that was presented on a computer screen in front of the treadmill, with a standard computer mouse as an input device. E-Prime 2.0 Professional software (Psychology Software Tools, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) was used to program the training. Participants were asked to memorize the correct sequence of 3&#x02013;20 words lighting up one after the other for 3 seconds on the computer screen. Thereafter, a distraction task was followed where participants had to define if three presented words had a meaning or not. Then, the initially memorized words were presented again, either in the same or another sequence, and participants had to decide if the sequence remained the same or not, by pressing the mouse button. The initial level for this training was set at a sequence of three words and was extended by one word as soon as the participants reached 80% of correct answers within the level. Treadmill speed and inclination were set individually for each participant, such that a subjective rate of perceived exertion of five to seven points on the ten-point Borg scale was reached as recommended by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) position stand on exercise with older adults.<xref rid="b39-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Treadmill walking (PHYS)</title><p>Program PHYS included aerobic treadmill walking without an additional cognitive task and acted as a reference group with exclusively physical training components.

Multiple regression analysis with planned comparisons, including orthogonal contrast and polynomial trend coding, were applied to investigate training effects on the cognitive test battery for the 6-months training period.

The second contrast compared the two cognitive&#x02013;physical training groups (DANCE versus MEMORY). According to the study design, comprising three time points of measurement, we created polynomial trend coding variables to assess the linear and quadratic trend.

Dropouts were equally distributed between groups, and therefore, the final analyses were performed only in individuals who completed the 6-months intervention. Forty-seven participants were available for the 1-year follow-up test session and were included in the analysis of these outcomes. The following missing values from persons who completed the 6-months training were replaced by the group mean value: at pretest, three persons from DANCE and two persons from MEMORY missed TMT A and B, one person from DANCE missed four other items, and one person from PHYS missed seven test items; at 3-months test, one person from MEMORY missed all nine tests (this person did not miss any pretests). No missing values were evident at 6 months and follow-up tests. One cognitive task, the Digit Backward Task, was not analyzed because some participants applied a strategy that defeated the idea of the test. Participants&#x02019; recruitment lasted from August 2012 until the end of September 2012, when pretests were performed.

The study comprised a 6-months training intervention and a 1-year follow-up. The two main findings were first, that the cognitive&#x02013;physical programs were partially advantageous to boost performance in two measures of executive function (switching attention and working memory), thereby video game dancing resulted in transfer to an untrained cognitive domain (working memory); and second, that cognitive performance, including executive functions, long-term visual memory (episodic memory), and processing speed, was maintained until 1-year follow-up. These findings are important since executive functions, episodic memory, and processing speed are particularly affected by aging-related decline.<xref rid="b55-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> Therefore, we suggest that simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical</p><sec><title>Does simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training boost cognitive performance?</title><p>We found one indication in our results that supported the hypothesis that the simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical programs (DANCE, MEMORY) had advantages over an exclusively physical intervention (PHYS) in terms of cognitive adaptations. Both cognitive&#x02013;physical interventions showed larger improvements in the TMT-B compared to PHYS within the initial 3-months training period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cia-10-1335">Figure 4B</xref>). This result showed a trend to statistical significance but seems worth mentioning due to the small to moderate effect size. The TMT-B reflects the ability of shifting attention, which is a dimension of executive function. This ability might have been trained through the simultaneous performance of cognitive and physical activities in DANCE and MEMORY in the way that attention had to be shifted continuously between the two activities. The dual-task situation in the treadmill memory training possibly had some impact on cognitive shifting ability because treadmill walking itself required a certain amount of attention from the elderly participants to be executed safely. A similar result related to cognitive shifting was demonstrated in an investigation that compared effects on cognition after contemporary dancing, Tai Chi, or balance training.<xref rid="b56-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> Thereby, only contemporary dancing, which can be regarded as a modality of simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical activity, had an effect on cognition and particularly on switching attention as assessed with the Rule Shift Cards Sorting Test.<xref rid="b57-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Interestingly, a recent extensive investigation with 182 participants by van het Reve and de Bruin did not show this additional effect on shifting attention after 3 months of sequential cognitive and physical training compared to exclusively physical training (strength and balance exercises).<xref rid="b58-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> This observation supports the benefits from simultaneously performed cognitive&#x02013;physical training over sequential cognitive and physical training programs. In our study, participants of PHYS had about 2 years less school education compared to the other groups despite randomization. However, we would argue that this difference had no influence on the development of cognitive outcomes, since baseline cognitive measures and MMSE scores were not statistically different. Furthermore, adaptation patterns were similar in PHYS compared to the other groups in several cognitive outcomes. We conclude that additional cognitive functions, particularly switching attention, are promoted by the dual-task situation in simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical programs and further research is warranted to substantiate or refute this assumption.</p><p>The expected differential adaptation patterns from DANCE versus MEMORY were confirmed in the results of the Executive Control Task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cia-10-1335">Figure 4C</xref>), which reflects working memory as another dimension of the executive functions: different time courses of adaptation from pretest, to 3-months, and 6-months tests for DANCE versus MEMORY were found, with superior performance in DANCE after 6-months training. This result was supported by a significant time&#x000d7;intervention interaction with small to moderate effect size in the specific analysis of the second 3-months training period. Within this period DANCE improved, whereas MEMORY deteriorated and PHYS remained unchanged. Our finding confirms the previously noted importance of applying longer training durations (6 months or longer) to assess cognitive adaptation patterns and to achieve larger training gains from physical interventions.<xref rid="b3-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b59-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> More importantly, the result represents an adaptation from video game dancing in an untrained cognitive domain (working memory) or a so-called transfer effect. Previous studies on combined cognitive&#x02013;physical training failed to produce cognitive transfer effects but reported training specific adaptations: for instance, Theill et al<xref rid="b27-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> demonstrated performance gains in the Executive Control Task after simultaneous cognitive&#x02013; physical and single cognitive training, which both contained specific working memory exercises. Similarly, van het Reve and de Bruin<xref rid="b58-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> reported a training specific adaptation after a 3-months computerized divided attention training, which was contained in a sequential cognitive&#x02013;physical program. In summary, the present study provides first indications that simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training boosts particular executive functions (shifting attention and working memory) depending on the duration of the intervention, and that the video game dancing leads to cognitive transfer in working memory. However, further investigations are necessary to substantiate this finding. Improvements of executive functions in seniors are clinically important because they are critical for the regulation of gait, are related to fall risk,<xref rid="b60-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> and are prone to aging-related decline in general.<xref rid="b55-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Are cognitive training effects maintained after cessation of the training intervention?</title><p>Training gains were preserved in our study in three out of four follow-up tests over 1 year without any further training intervention being applied. Surprisingly, performance kept increasing in the TMT-B from 6-months test to follow-up test in all groups, which may reflect a delayed response to the intervention. We did not systematically assess the amount of training that participants might have taken up individually after cessation of the intervention. Therefore, we cannot estimate a possible effect of additional individual training on cognitive measures at follow-up. Maintenance of cognitive performance was reported previously after different kinds of training interventions. For instance, a 1-year follow-up cognitive assessment after 6 months of either indoor cycling or stretching and coordination training demonstrated maintenance of selective attention (d2 test) and episodic memory learning.<xref rid="b61-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> However, only the subgroup with a high level of cardiovascular fitness, measured at follow-up, was able to preserve performance in episodic memory recognition, while the low-fit subgroup deteriorated from postintervention to 1-year follow-up. This finding indicates the importance of cardiovascular fitness as a mediator to maintain certain cognitive abilities. A 5-year follow-up study also reported sustained effects in a composite &#x0201c;cognitive function&#x0201d; score after sequential cognitive&#x02013;physical training (effect size <italic>d</italic><sub>+</sub>=0.75),<xref rid="b62-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> but no performance maintenance was found after exclusively physical training comprising balance and coordination exercises. This finding stands in contradiction to our own result and may support the necessity of multicomponent physical programs containing aerobic endurance and muscular strength exercises for long-term performance maintenance of cognition. Finally, a meta-analysis including seven studies with exclusively cognitive interventions found persistent cognitive enhancements over different follow-up periods from 3 months up to 5 years.<xref rid="b63-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> Considering the existing literature and our own results, it may be summarized that long-term cognitive performance maintenance can be evident after both, exclusively cognitive or multicomponent physical training containing aerobic endurance and strength exercises, as well as after sequential or simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical interventions. However, which type of intervention might be superior in this respect needs further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Can simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical and exclusively physical multicomponent training programs elicit broad cognitive adaptations?</title><p>A significant global linear time effect in the regression analyses of eight out of nine cognitive tests was found in this study for all three interventions taken together.

Nonetheless, based on similar results from the literature, the long intervals of 3 months between test sessions and the application of parallel versions in some of the cognitive tests, we assume that performance improvements can at least partly be accounted for as training effects.</p><p>Several neurobiological and physiological mechanisms have been suggested to link physical training with benefits on cognitive performance: these are increased neurogenesis and synaptogenesis in the cortical structure, promotion of cerebral metabolism, alterations of neurotransmitter and neurotrophic factor levels, availability of cerebral oxygen and glucose, and reduced oxidative stress.<xref rid="b69-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> In particular, the cardiovascular fitness hypothesis has been promoted to relate aerobic fitness and cognition. Thereby, aerobic training was found to affect certain mechanisms, such as cerebral blood flow, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and cerebral structure, which are also associated with increased cognitive performance.<xref rid="b69-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> Nevertheless, a meta-analysis by Etnier et al<xref rid="b70-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> failed to support the relation between aerobic fitness and cognition. The authors argued that aerobic fitness itself might not be sensitive enough to indicate cognitive adaptations from aerobic exercise training, whereby the underlying adaptations of aerobic training might be more sensitive.<xref rid="b70-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">70</xref> For instance, the cerebral circulation hypothesis relies on studies that have found elevated oxygen and glucose transport to the brain, leading to improved cognitive performance.<xref rid="b71-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">71</xref> Furthermore, the neurotrophic stimulation hypothesis suggests that training-induced enhancement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor stimulates neurogenesis and thereby positively affects learning and mental performance.<xref rid="b69-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> Finally, the neuroadrenergic hypothesis proposed that cardiovascular training promoted neurotransmitter availability, such as noradrenaline, adrenaline, and serotonin, which are thought to be related to memory storage and retrieval.<xref rid="b70-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="b72-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> As indicated earlier, some recent studies also demonstrated that strength<xref rid="b12-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and coordination<xref rid="b11-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> training induced changes in hemodynamic brain activity or elevated activation of certain brain networks, respectively, which were associated with improved cognition.</p><p>The importance of the physical part of a simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training intervention in older adults was supported by Theill et al<xref rid="b27-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> who reported improvements in long-term visual memory (Paired-Associates Task) after simultaneous treadmill walking and memory training, but not after exclusively cognitive training. Additionally, two meta-analytic studies pointed out that exclusively cognitive training programs increased performance only on related or training-specific tasks and no cognitive transfer effects were evident.<xref rid="b15-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> This was also confirmed by the recent review from Oei and Patterson<xref rid="b17-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> who investigated transfer effects in video game training studies. However, some cognitive training studies reported broad improvements from cognitive training, particularly from extended but not from strategy training approaches.<xref rid="b14-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Extended practice refers to the training of basic cognitive abilities, such as choice response time or phoneme span, which are used in different cognitive activities. Additionally, a recent meta-analysis by Hindin and Zelinski<xref rid="b13-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> found similar effect sizes in extended cognitive training compared to aerobic exercise training, although different neurophysiological mechanisms would likely have led to these effects. Nevertheless, it appears that physical and combined cognitive&#x02013;physical training interventions may be more beneficial than exclusively cognitive training interventions for older adults to enhance a broad range of cognitive abilities. Such training programs should therefore be implemented in the clinical prevention of cognitive impairments, which are widely prevalent in older adults.<xref rid="b1-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Methodological strengths of this study were the comparably large number of participants, the long training period with follow-up measurements, and the broad cognitive testing battery to assess several dimensions of cognition. Some limitations have to be considered as well. First, the specific effects of the two simultaneous training modalities could not be identified exactly because of the combination with the multiple physical components (strength and balance training). However, this was not the focus of this study, since we explicitly aimed at evaluating effects from different multicomponent programs. Second, the conclusions and recommendations from this study are limited to physically and mentally healthy seniors, because following the selection criteria such participants were recruited. Training effects might have been even larger in a population of lower physical and mental status. This assumption is based on the exercise training principle &#x0201c;Initial Values&#x0201d; stating that improvement in the outcome of interest will be greatest in those with lower initial values.<xref rid="b42-cia-10-1335" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Those with lowest levels of fitness theoretically have greatest room for improvement. It seems, therefore, important and warranted to repeat the study design in a more vulnerable population exhibiting impairments in fitness and/or cognitive domains. Further, as mentioned earlier, we did not include a passive control group in the design of the study, which means that we could not exactly differentiate between training effects and learning effects from repeated testing. However, this was not the main focus of the present study. Although participants were blinded to the expected study outcome, blinding of the investigators was not possible since they also supervised and conducted training and testing sessions. This is an additional limitation to this study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We demonstrated that multicomponent simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training programs have the potential to boost particular executive functions (including shifting attention and working memory) in healthy older adults compared to an exclusively physical multicomponent program. Importantly, performance levels in executive functions, long-term visual memory (episodic memory), and processing speed were maintained over 1 year after all three programs. The novel training concepts of simultaneous cognitive&#x02013; physical activity tended to be enjoyed more by seniors than traditional training and led to training specific as well as to transfer adaptations in cognition. Therefore, we recommend multicomponent simultaneous cognitive&#x02013;physical training programs to enhance particular executive functions in older adults. Such programs may potentially counteract the large prevalence of cognitive impairments and decline in the elderly, inherently leading to more independence and a better quality of life. Future studies should also investigate the neurological background of cognitive behavioral performance enhancements to shed light on the interconnection between plasticity of cognition, brain function, and brain structure.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the Z&#x000fc;rcher Kantonalbank within the framework of sponsoring of movement sciences, sports, and nutritional sciences at ETH Zurich.
