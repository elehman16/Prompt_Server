This number will almost double every 20 years. In North Africa and the Middle Eastern region, prevalence estimates increased from 5.9% in 2009 to 8.7% in 2015. Future projections for that region expect an increase in the number of people living with dementia by 86% in 2030.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In Egypt, the prevalence rate of dementia ranges from 1.4% to 21.95%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Among the chronic diseases, dementia is responsible for the largest contribution to dependence,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] as well as caregivers' burden, and psychological problems.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Psychiatric morbidity among caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) ranged from 40% to 75% in the developing countries.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In Egypt, the rate of caregivers' burden was 37%.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Compared to caregivers of other chronic diseases, Egyptian caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease showed higher levels of worries, fears, distress, negative emotions, and stigma.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The nature of dementia care is associated with an intensity of needs, exceeding those required in other conditions, making care recipients highly dependent on their caregivers to achieve basic daily activities.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Meanwhile, home care is preferred by families as an essential policy for reducing the costs of long-term care in the developing countries,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which may exacerbate caregivers' burden.</p><p>Studies that assessed the needs of caregivers of PWD highlighted their needs to attain better knowledge about the disease, the ways of handling cognitive and behavioral problems of PWD, as well as psychological support needs such as stress management and emotional expression skills.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In Egypt, many of the older people who are ready to be discharged from hospitals are not taken home because their families cannot care for them alone. In addition, the health-care system facilities targeting the needs of older people and their caregivers are limited.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>A wide range of interventions supporting dementia caregivers were developed and were evaluated on different outcome measures, including psychological well-being, caregivers' burden, social outcomes, and knowledge.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Multidimensional interventions incorporating mainly psychoeducation, supportive interventions, and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are particularly effective.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5<sup>th</sup> edition (DSM-5), the term dementia has been placed under the &#x0201c;neurocognitive disorders&#x0201d; (NCDs) entity; however, &#x0201c;dementia&#x0201d; is retained in the etiological subtypes and in settings where it is more proper than the new term.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In the current study, both terms are used interchangeably whenever appropriate.</p><p>This study aimed at developing and evaluating the short-term efficacy of a multicomponent psychosocial intervention program for informal caregivers of persons with NCDs in Alexandria, Egypt.

Short-term goals included (1) improving caregivers' knowledge about dementia, (2) helping caregivers to identify different problematic behaviors of care recipients and different strategies to handle such behaviors, and (3) providing social support for caregivers. Long-term goals incorporated (1) acquiring the skills of handling problematic behaviors of care recipients, (2) enhancing caregivers' skills and strategies for managing the burden of care, and (3) improving caregivers' emotional status through acquiring skills of coping and stress management.</p><p>The program included three components: group psychoeducation (two sessions), brief group CBT (six sessions), and group support sessions that were held throughout the program covering topics similar to psychoeducation/CBT topics as illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Each session took 45&#x02013;60 min. Training was conducted through a collaborative approach using illustrations, vignettes, role playing, brainstorming, group discussion, and audio-visual aids. Different methods were used to achieve different objectives of the program. An intervention protocol with all details covering the above-mentioned sessions was prepared based on caregivers' needs reported by them in the early assessment phase, and on reviewing literature for other programs directed to caregivers' of people with NCDs, worldwide. Culturally sensitive sessions were designed taking into consideration the characteristics of participants.

One author, who was situated off site, supervised the randomization process and was responsible for concealment of allocation. Allocation into intervention and control groups was concealed from the principal investigator until all cases (120) were recruited and provided baseline data. The principal investigator (second author) was the one who enrolled intervention participants based on the sequence received from the supervisor of randomization, and participants were further assigned into six groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Blinding</title><p>Because of the interactive nature of the intervention program between the participants and the principal investigator (second author), they were unblinded.

These findings were in agreement with other RCTs. In the UK, a program consisting of psychoeducation and cognitive-behavioral component (e.g., changing unhelpful thoughts, assertive communication, relaxation), involving carers of family members with dementia, revealed a significant reduction in their depression and anxiety symptoms.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In Spain, M&#x000e1;rquez-Gonz&#x000e1;lez <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] conducted a group CBT intervention, revealing a successful reduction in caregivers' level of depression and dysfunctional thoughts, as well as successful modification of their appraisal of the care recipient's problem behaviors. In Brazil, Fialho <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] reported a significant reduction of caregivers' anxiety levels and improvement in their coping strategies following an eight-session CBT intervention. In a more recent study in Columbia (2014),[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] the authors delivered a group CBT to the caregivers that proved to be effective in lowering depression and burden in the intervention group compared with the controls across the posttest and 3-month follow-up.</p><p>This trial supports the effectiveness of psychoeducation in improving caregivers' knowledge. Systematic reviews that investigated studies in the area of educational interventions indicated that these studies had inconclusive evidence and focused primarily on outcome measures other than knowledge, such as emotional status and burden.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] On the other hand, evidence was found for the effectiveness of interventions targeting information on improving caregivers' knowledge and ability.[<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] These interventions included different forms of education about dementia such as psychoeducation,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] technology-based education,[<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and information/support interventions.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>Systematic reviews showed variability of evidence for the effectiveness of multicomponent interventions in reducing caregivers' burden, depression, and anxiety.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] A meta-analysis showed that small to medium effect sizes of caregivers support programs regarding caregivers' burden (least effect size), depression, and stress (highest effect size).[<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] In partial agreement with this meta-analysis, we found large effect sizes of all program components with the least for caregivers' burden, followed by depression, then anxiety, and the highest for knowledge. These findings provide evidence for success of the educational component of the program in satisfying some of the pressing needs of caregivers who were highly motivated to acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to handle their care recipients' problems. The relatively large effects recorded in this RCT especially for the knowledge outcome may be attributed to the low level of standard care and services directed to caregivers, as well as their baseline characteristics, which revealed that they were highly burdened, depressed, anxious, and less knowledgeable about dementia. The needs reported by the caregivers before starting the program support this explanation, where all of them reported their need for psychoeducation, and more than half indicated that they need psychological support.</p><p>The variability of evidence for the effectiveness of caregivers psychosocial interventions could be attributed to wide variations in the methodology, the intervention program content, techniques, and outcomes as well as in care recipient- and caregiver-related factors, such as presence of other life stressors, financial problems, dementia course, and emerging individual and environmental factors during the course of the program (temporal factors), which may cause deviation from the baseline recruitment data.</p><p>The evidence that can be derived from results of this study should be interpreted in light of its strengths and limitations. Being an RCT with a quite sufficient sample size is one of the strength points. Although the nature of the trial did not allow blinding, pre- and post-assessment for the outcome measures was carried out by a psychologist, and not by the principal investigator who conducted the sessions, which is another strength.</p><p>Study limitations included mainly nonassessment of secondary outcomes related to PWD and focused only on caregivers-related measures. Furthermore, the short-term follow-up makes the long-lasting effects of the intervention unpredictable. In addition, all participants in this study belonged to a specific stratum in the community, those who receive free governmental health services, while attendants of the private sector were not included.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The current RCT provided an evidence for the short-term efficacy of a of a culturally sensitive multicomponent psychosocial intervention program in improving dementia-related knowledge and the emotional status of informal caregivers of people with NCDs. This program is recommended to be included as an integral component of neuropsychiatric services provided to people with NCDs and their informal caregivers, particularly those with evident perceived burden and/or emotional problems. Offering training opportunities to mental health professionals, psychologists, and nurses in such settings ensures continuity and better service quality.</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Additional information</title><p>The trial is registered in the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR) with the registration number PACTR201602001450196.
