In areas of preferred habitat (amenity grassland), counts of hedgehogs more than doubled over a 5-year period from the start of badger culling (from 0.9 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> pre-cull to 2.4 ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> post-cull), whereas hedgehog counts did not change where there was no badger culling (0.3&#x02013;0.3 hedgehogs ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>).

As a consequence, anthropogenic activities which reduce or remove top predator species may have major and often unintentional effects on the structure, productivity or diversity of the wider ecosystem <xref rid="pone.0095477-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Wallach1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In particular, top predators may suppress smaller mesopredators, either by direct intraguild killing or predation or via changes in behaviour such that the smaller predators avoid locations or habitats utilised by the top predator <xref rid="pone.0095477-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Chakarov1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

For example, in southern California, Coyotes <italic>Canis latrans</italic> suppress meso-predators (Gray foxes <italic>Urocyon cinereoargenteus,</italic> Striped skunks <italic>Mephitis mephitis</italic> and domestic cats <italic>Felis catus</italic>) such that in habitat patches where coyotes are rare or absent, mesopredator abundance is higher, resulting in the decline of scrub breeding birds <xref rid="pone.0095477-Crooks1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Top predators and mesopredators may therefore interact to shape community structure in a wide range of ecosystems, with important implications for both predator and ecosystem management <xref rid="pone.0095477-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>There is a growing body of research, which identifies interactions between apex predators and mesopredators that are consistent with the mesopredator release hypothesis <xref rid="pone.0095477-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Prugh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. However, the majority of studies have not provided experimental measures of how changes in the abundance of top predators result in changes in mesopredator abundance, but rather describe interactions or associations between species <xref rid="pone.0095477-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Prugh1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The paucity of field data relates in part to the logistical and ethical problems associated with accurately estimating and manipulating predator populations <xref rid="pone.0095477-Salo1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In this study we investigated the relationship between a top predator, the European badger <italic>Meles meles</italic> and a sympatric mesopredator, the western European hedgehog <italic>Erinaceus europaeus,</italic> in the UK. The European badger is a medium-sized mustelid carnivore and has become an apex predator in parts of its range, due to the extirpation of larger terrestrial carnivores <xref rid="pone.0095477-Roper1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Badgers have a broad omnivorous diet, primarily consisting of invertebrates and plant matter <xref rid="pone.0095477-Roper1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, though they also eat smaller mammals including hedgehogs. Hedgehogs are themselves mesopredators predating upon invertebrates, small mammals, reptiles, amphibians and the eggs of ground nesting birds <xref rid="pone.0095477-Reeve1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Previous surveys and manipulations of hedgehog abundance indicate that food availability and badger predation play key roles in determining the abundance, distribution and behaviour of hedgehogs <xref rid="pone.0095477-Doncaster1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0095477-Doncaster2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Badgers and hedgehogs are not only predator and prey, but also share many of the same food resources and have therefore been considered to interact via intraguild predation, as well as competing for food <xref rid="pone.0095477-Doncaster2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus there is the potential for badgers to exert a strong influence on hedgehog abundance, as the former can be supported at high density through alternative food resources, even as hedgehog numbers decline <xref rid="pone.0095477-Polis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Holt1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The opportunity to experimentally test the effects of a reduction in predator abundance on populations of a competing prey species arose from the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT) which was a replicated, controlled field experiment to investigate the effect of culling badgers on the incidence of bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle <xref rid="pone.0095477-Donnelly1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Previous research has shown that the reduction in badger abundance by culling was associated with increases in the density of red foxes <italic>Vulpes vulpes</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0095477-Trewby1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Hence wide-scale badger culling may affect other species that also interact with badgers. We tested the hypothesis that hedgehog abundance and/or behaviour would change, in line with predictions of mesopredator release, as a result of reductions in badger abundance after culling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>(a) Experimental Design</title><p>The design and implementation of the RBCT are fully described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0095477-Bourne1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Briefly, 10 triplets were established, each consisting of three matched trial areas of approximately 100 km<sup>2</sup> and which were randomly assigned to proactive badger culling, localized reactive culling following the identification of TB in cattle, or experimental controls with no badger culling. We studied four of the 10 triplets: A (Herefordshire), E (Wiltshire), G (Staffordshire/Derbyshire) and I (Cotswolds). In each triplet, the study ran for 4 to 6 years, including 3 to 5 years of successive annual badger culling (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095477-t001">Table 1</xref>). For logistical reasons it was not possible to survey for hedgehogs prior to culling in triplets A and E. Hedgehog surveys were also carried out in reactive culling areas before badger culling was implemented but not afterwards and so here they are treated as additional experimental controls.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0095477-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0095477.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>The number of years of hedgehog surveys that were carried out in each triplet.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0095477-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0095477.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Triplet</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Location</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Year of initial cull</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of years ofpre-culling surveys</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number ofyears ofsurveys during culling</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cullingarea</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Estimatedreduction inbadger density</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

The model was fitted with an Iterative Reweighted Restricted Maximum Likelihood (IRREML) procedure with a negative binomial error structure and a logarithm link function. The area (m<sup>2</sup>) of each field was log-transformed and entered as an offset into the IRREML model, to take account of variability in field size (i.e. survey effort). Treatment had two levels: culled (an area after the initiation of badger culling) or not culled (treatment areas before the initiation of badger culling and experimental control areas with no culling). The term field, nested within triplet and treatment, was entered as a random term.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In amenity grassland, there was a significant effect of the interaction between badger culling and the year of culling on hedgehog count (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8.61, d.f. 1, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.004) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0095477-t002">Table 2</xref>).

Hedgehog populations and/or behaviour may, therefore, be constrained due to competition and/or predation, or the threat of predation, by a larger predator. This result, suggests that lethal control of badger populations may result in changes to the structure of the wider predator community.</p><p>Over the course of this study, the numbers of hedgehogs caught in amenity grassland fields increased by approximately 100% in the areas where badgers were culled, but not in the control areas where culling did not take place. Larger predators may suppress smaller mesopredators either by direct predation/conflict, or by changing their behaviour such that they avoid habitats or locations where the larger predator is present <xref rid="pone.0095477-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Salo2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. It is therefore possible that increased captures of hedgehogs in the current study were due not to changes in hedgehog numbers, but to changes in hedgehog behaviour, with hedgehogs being more visible or active in amenity grassland sites where badger numbers had been reduced. Female hedgehogs may avoid larger garden habitats associated with increased badger activity, presumably due to high risk of predation <xref rid="pone.0095477-Dowding1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. However, badgers and hedgehogs have also been observed regularly using the same areas <xref rid="pone.0095477-Haigh1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In addition, a concurrent telemetry study of hedgehogs in the Cotswold triplet of the RBCT <xref rid="pone.0095477-Young2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> found no significant effects of badger culling on ranging behaviour that would be consistent with increased counts in amenity grassland sites. This suggests that the increase in hedgehog observations was unlikely to be due to changes in behaviour.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that badger predation is one of the main causes of hedgehog mortality <xref rid="pone.0095477-Doncaster1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Hof1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Doncaster2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and that badger density correlates negatively with hedgehog abundance. It therefore seems likely that the observed increase in the counts of hedgehogs in the current study reflects an increase in hedgehog abundance facilitated by reduced predation and higher survival. This is also consistent with previous research suggesting that badger predation has negative impacts on hedgehog population growth <xref rid="pone.0095477-Doncaster1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>The analyses in this study were carried out on the numbers of hedgehogs caught on amenity grassland sites, as very few hedgehogs were observed in pasture fields. Amenity grasslands and fields close to villages or houses may be key habitat for hedgehogs and offer a potential refuge against predation by badgers, which are typically less active in these areas, presumably due to human disturbance <xref rid="pone.0095477-Micol1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Hof1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Hedgehog presence on amenity grassland shows that prey species can coexist with predators at a landscape scale by occupying areas of habitat that are more favourable to the prey species, perhaps in terms of reduced predation risk or improved food availability <xref rid="pone.0095477-Micol1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Polis1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In the context of mesopredator release, interspecific interactions are often viewed as a simplistic three level interaction between top predator, mesopredator and small prey, particularly when the apex predator in question is an obligate carnivore with little dietary overlap with mesopredators <xref rid="pone.0095477-Ritchie1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In such circumstances, mesopredator release may increase predation pressure on the species that are preyed upon by the mesopredator, potentially resulting in population declines <xref rid="pone.0095477-Crooks1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0095477-Letnic1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. The consequences to the wider ecosystem of changes in badger and hedgehog numbers are harder to predict, as both species have broad and largely overlapping dietary niches <xref rid="pone.0095477-Roper1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. The role of omnivores in food web dynamics is not well understood, although they may have stabilising effects by feeding across habitats and trophic levels <xref rid="pone.0095477-Morris1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Increases in hedgehog numbers may result in increased predation pressure on certain prey species. Hedgehogs may occasionally predate large numbers of single invertebrate and vertebrates species <xref rid="pone.0095477-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For example they have been shown to have significant impact on populations of ground nesting birds under certain conditions, via predation of nests <xref rid="pone.0095477-Jackson1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. However, it is also possible that a decline in badgers and resultant increase in hedgehogs will have negligible effects on lower trophic levels, either because prey species were already being consumed by badgers, or because specific prey species constitute a small component of hedgehog diets. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a medium-sized, mustelid omnivore may act to constrain a smaller mesopredator. This study also illustrates the value of field experiments to assess the potential effects of management strategies on the abundance of wildlife populations. European badgers are a wildlife reservoir for bovine tuberculosis in the UK and Ireland and are consequently of intense management interest <xref rid="pone.0095477-Woodroffe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. This study provides information for assessing the potential ecological consequences of badger culling and further confirmation that a reduction in badger numbers will have direct impacts on other mammal species <xref rid="pone.0095477-Trewby1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0095477-Ritchie1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
