However, successful treatment of opioid dependence using opioid-substitution therapy with long-acting opioids such as buprenorphine can substantially reduce these costs and improve patients&#x02019; functioning (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2014</xref>). A retrospective study of 2 large US health systems found that mean total healthcare costs for opioid-dependent patients receiving buprenorphine treatment and counseling were less than half of the costs for patients receiving little or no treatment ($13,578 vs $31,035) (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Lynch et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Effective pharmacologic maintenance treatment approaches reduce opioid cravings, prevent withdrawal, improve treatment retention, and reduce participation in risky behaviors (eg, injection drug use) (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Gunderson and Fiellin, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Mattick et al., 2014</xref>). Patient engagement in psychosocial and behavioral counseling is recommended in addition to pharmacologic treatment to promote healthy behaviors and self-motivation (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2009</xref>). Individualized treatment plans should address factors that influence recovery, including past treatment history, living conditions, social and cultural factors, and patient acceptance and satisfaction with treatment (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2009</xref>). Of these factors, patient satisfaction with opioid-substitution treatment may be affected by patient perception of the convenience of treatment and sensory properties (eg, taste, mouthfeel) of medication (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Osterberg and Blaschke, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Montesano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Assessing patient satisfaction with treatment is a potential target to improve adherence and maximize the clinical and societal benefits of therapy (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Montesano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Tkacz et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Although improved clinical outcomes are understandably the primary goal for mental health treatment interventions, specific patient-focused outcomes may have fundamental value as well, including the importance of patient preference when selecting treatment and patient engagement in clinical decision-making (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Kroenke, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Sublingual buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone (BNX) combinations are effective options for office-based treatment of opioid dependence, with a low potential for toxicity and misuse (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Apelt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Lyseng-Williamson, 2013</xref>). Zubsolv (Orexo US, Inc., Morristown, NJ) is a buprenorphine/naloxone rapidly dissolving sublingual tablet formulation (BNX-RDT) with improved absorption and bioavailability that was developed as an alternative to sublingual BNX tablet and film formulations (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Lyseng-Williamson, 2013</xref>). This formulation incorporates sucralose and menthol to mask the bitter taste of active ingredients, has improved bioavailability compared with other sublingual BNX tablet and film formulations, and has a fast dissolution rate (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Lyseng-Williamson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). A sublingual 5.7/1.4-mg dose of BNX-RDT was found to provide equivalent buprenorphine exposure and 12% lower naloxone exposure than an 8/2-mg buprenorphine/naloxone dose of a previously available BNX tablet (ie, a 30% lower dose of BNX-RDT can be used compared with the previously available BNX tablet) (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Lyseng-Williamson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, the availability of multiple dose strengths of BNX-RDT (1.4/0.36, 2.9/0.71, 5.7/1.4, 8.6/2.1, and 11.4/2.9&#x0200a;mg) (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Zubsolv Package Insert, 2015</xref>) might simplify dosing and allow patients to be treated with fewer tablets daily.</p><p>Although patient preference for various buprenorphine products has not yet been proven to influence clinical outcomes and prevent relapse, enhancing patient experience with buprenorphine-based medication has been posited to potentially facilitate treatment engagement (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Daulouede et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Clay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Teruya et al., 2014</xref>), which, in turn, could influence retention in treatment (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Tkacz et al., 2012</xref>). Regarding preference data for the BNX formulations, in a study of healthy volunteers, BNX-RDT received higher ratings for taste and overall acceptability than BNX film and a previously available BNX tablet formulation (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, participants reported preferable taste and greater overall acceptability compared with the previously available BNX tablet, and preferable mouthfeel and less unpleasant aftertaste compared with sublingual BNX film (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Overall, 89% and 77% of participants preferred BNX-RDT over BNX film and the previously available BNX tablet, respectively (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Whereas data from healthy volunteers may suggest preferable characteristics of BNX-RDT (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>), clinical data with opioid-dependent patients are needed for further validation. Although several studies assessed the efficacy and safety of switching from generic buprenorphine to BNX formulations (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Daulouede et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Montesano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Stimolo et al., 2010</xref>), clinical evidence is lacking with regard to switching between different BNX formulations, including BNX-RDT, which has a 5.7/1.4&#x0200a;mg buprenorphine/naloxone ratio as determined by a pharmacokinetic bioequivalence trial rather than clinical outcome data (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, comparative data between BNX products are needed to evaluate patient preference and also clinical efficacy. Such data are of paramount importance for patients and clinicians to make informed decisions when selecting treatment. To address these gaps in treatment knowledge, the current study examined the effect of switching treatments between 2 sublingual BNX formulations&#x02014;BNX film and BNX-RDT&#x02014;on treatment efficacy, safety, and preference ratings in opioid-dependent patients participating in the Induction, STabilization, Adherence and Retention Trial (ISTART).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>The ISTART was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, noninferiority trial conducted at 43 centers in the United States, from August 2013 to April 2014; the primary efficacy and key secondary outcomes of ISTART were previously reported (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Gunderson et al., 2015</xref>). The study comprised a 2-day induction phase and a 20-day stabilization phase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Visits were scheduled on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 15, and 22 (final study visit). Opioid-dependent patients were randomly assigned to induction with either BNX-RDT or generic buprenorphine tablets for 2 days. On day 3, patients allocated to buprenorphine were switched to BNX film, whereas those allocated to BNX-RDT continued on the same treatment. On day 15, patients receiving BNX film were switched to BNX-RDT, and those on BNX-RDT were switched to film. The current study presents secondary analysis data focusing on the phase after the transition between products at day 15. Although patients were stabilized on treatment with sublingual BNX-RDT or BNX film during the first 15 days of the study, patients were evaluated for an additional 6 days after the treatment switch for clinical symptoms of withdrawal, which was anticipated to be an adequate timeframe for such symptoms to occur. Measuring withdrawal after the switch was especially important for patients switched to the higher-bioavailability BNX-RDT formulation, which has a lower dose (derived from pharmacokinetic data) and, until the present study, had not been evaluated in a clinical setting with opioid-dependent patients.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Study design.

Generic buprenorphine was selected as the comparator agent for induction as it was the only product approved for use as induction therapy when the study was designed and initiated. On days 1 and 2, patients received a fixed dose of BNX-RDT (5.7/1.4&#x0200a;mg on day 1 and 5.7/1.4 or 11.4/2.8&#x0200a;mg on day 2) or generic buprenorphine (8&#x0200a;mg on day 1 and 8 or 16&#x0200a;mg on day 2). On day 3, patients in the generic buprenorphine group were switched to BNX film. During the open-label stabilization period (days 3&#x02013;22), individual daily dosing regimens could be titrated to a bioequivalent maximum of 17.1/4.2&#x0200a;mg for BNX-RDT and 24/6&#x0200a;mg for BNX film based on clinical symptoms. On day 15, patients switched treatments according to a fixed conversion factor of 5.7 to 8&#x0200a;mg based on the corresponding dose strengths of BNX-RDT and BNX film; patients were switched to a dose commensurate to the dose they were taking in the previous week.

This serious AE was considered moderate in intensity and resolved after 6 days.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>This study indicates that clinical efficacy and safety are maintained when opioid-dependent patients entering maintenance switch between BNX-RDT and BNX film formulations after completion of a 15-day stabilization period. The findings provide important practical information needed by clinicians and patients when considering a transition between BNX formulations during maintenance treatment, particularly as the more recently available BNX-RDT formulation is a departure from other previously and currently available BNX products in terms of per tablet dose, physical characteristics (eg, taste), absorption, and bioavailability (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Lyseng-Williamson, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>). Clinicians and patients alike may question if the 5.7:8.0&#x0200a;mg conversion factor, established based on bioequivalence data, is clinically comparable. Our findings indicate clinical comparability based on continued reduction in opioid withdrawal and cravings. Although most participants preferred the tablet formulation, additional data are needed regarding the potential impact on adherence and longer-term patient outcomes.</p><p>Regarding comparable efficacy data, of patients who switched treatments at day 15, more than 90% of patients in both groups completed through day 22 of treatment after switching. Although no formal statistical analysis was performed for patient discontinuations, rates were numerically similar in both treatment groups after the switch (8.7% and 6.1% of patients who switched from BNX-RDT to BNX film or BNX film to BNX-RDT, respectively). Opioid withdrawal and craving results were similar for both formulations at day 15 (before switching), with no indication of a change in symptoms by day 22 after the switch from either product. By day 15, mean COWS total scores in both treatment groups indicated that, on average, patients were withdrawal-free (ie, mean total score &#x0003c;5). Safety results showed that AEs through the end of the study were similar in frequency to AEs recorded from days 3 to 15 before the switch. The incidence of constipation-related AEs was low, and on average, preexisting constipation symptoms improved from baseline to the end of the study for both medications. In addition, titrated doses remained essentially the same based on bioequivalence for both groups from day 15 to day 22, indicating that the 5.7 to 8-mg conversion ratio is appropriate when switching between products.</p><p>The efficacy data provide clinical evidence that doses determined to be bioequivalent in a previous pharmacokinetic study (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>) are also clinically comparable when transitioning between products (ie, a 5.7/1.4-mg buprenorphine/naloxone dose of BNX-RDT is clinically similar to an 8/2-mg buprenorphine/naloxone dose of BNX sublingual film). Thus, it is noteworthy that comparable efficacy can be expected when patients are treated with an approximately 30% lower dose of BNX-RDT than of BNX film. In clinical practice, patients might express concerns about switching to a lower dose (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Lintzeris et al., 2013</xref>). To the extent that expectations can influence perceived drug effects (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Johanson and Preston, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Kirk et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Volkow et al., 2003</xref>), the findings from the current study may help alleviate patient concerns about a transition to a lower bioequivalent dose of the tablet formulation and thus avoid a potentially unnecessary dose increase. Although the study indicates efficacy and tolerability when changing between products, practitioners should continually monitor patients for signs of overmedication, withdrawal, or underdosing, as dose adjustments may be necessary when switching treatments (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Suboxone Package Insert, 2014</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Zubsolv Package Insert, 2015</xref>).</p><p>A substantial majority (&#x0003e;70%) of patients who had experience with both BNX formulations reported that they preferred BNX-RDT over BNX film in terms of taste, mouthfeel, ease of administration, and overall acceptability. Previously reported preference data on sublingual buprenorphine-containing products have been mixed. Although patients reported preferring the first approved BNX tablet formulation (Suboxone) over buprenorphine alone in terms of taste, size, and sublingual dissolution time (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Daulouede et al., 2010</xref>), the palatability of the first BNX tablet formulation received less favorable ratings in a separate study (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Montesano et al., 2010</xref>). In that study of patients who switched from a buprenorphine tablet to a BNX tablet formulation, approximately 50% of participants reported disliking the sensory properties (taste, color, odor, and mouthfeel) of the BNX tablet.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that increased adherence may result in greater clinical benefits, lower relapse rates, and reduced direct healthcare expenditures (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Montesano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Tkacz et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Further study in a real-world setting with longer treatment duration is needed to examine if strong patient preference for a BNX formulation will improve adherence and result in better clinical outcomes.</p><p>There are several possible limitations of this study. Firstly, patient familiarity with the BNX film formulation could have biased outcomes; however, it seems likely that any bias introduced by previous experience with BNX film might favor that formulation over the higher-bioavailability BNX-RDT. Secondly, this study was conducted at selected clinical research sites, and findings may not be generalizable to all office-based practices. Finally, study treatment was open-label rather than blinded, which was necessary to allow for assessments of patient preference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>These data indicate that among opioid-dependent patients receiving BNX maintenance treatment, transition between BNX film and BNX-RDT may be undertaken with comparable efficacy and safety. Patient discontinuation rates during the treatment switch phase were similar for each group, and the transition between both products was associated with continued withdrawal suppression, craving reduction, and similar safety profiles. Thus, there is no apparent clinical rationale from the findings indicating limitations when switching patients between the film and tablet products tested in the study. Most patients preferred BNX-RDT over BNX film; however, further study is required regarding the clinical implications of patient preference. Overall, the study provides important data to guide clinical decision-making during buprenorphine maintenance treatment, and hopefully will help mitigate the public health burden of opioid use disorder.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Funding: This study was designed and funded by Orexo AB.
