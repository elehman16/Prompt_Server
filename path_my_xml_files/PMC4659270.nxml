SWAT-1 provides an initial example.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To evaluate the effects of a site visit on recruitment rates in a multi-centre randomised trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Using the SWAT-1 design, a before-and-after comparison used the date of the site visit as the time point for the intervention. Site A received the site visit. Sites B and C did not receive it and acted as the controls. The primary outcomes were the difference in recruitment in each site from 1 and 3 months pre-intervention to 1 and 3 months post-intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Recruitment rates increased in Site A post-intervention (17% and 14% percentage point increases at 1 and 3 months, respectively). No differences in recruitment occurred in Site B or in Site C. At 3 months post-intervention, a significant difference was detected in favour of higher recruitment in A compared to B+C (34% versus 25%; odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.09-2.26). These findings suggest that recruitment might increase from 2 participants per week before the site visit to 4-5 per week after it.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This initial example of a SWAT provides evidence that a site visit increases recruitment rates in a trial. Further SWAT-1s are required to substantiate these findings and to examine the effects in different trials in different settings.</p></sec></body></article>
