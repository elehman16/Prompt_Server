There has been a considerable progress in practice of sedation and analgesia during endoscopic procedure. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment of pancreaticobiliary pathologies and its use has increased in recent years.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] 
</p><p>Most endoscopic procedures like ERCP are performed with the patient under moderate sedation, a practice that is referred to as &#x02018;conscious sedation&#x02019;. Conscious sedation is required mainly to minimize patient anxiety, discomfort and pain and to enhance patient cooperation throughout the procedure and facilitate the performance of the procedure by the endoscopists.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] 
</p><p>There are various agents available to provide conscious sedation. Current drugs include benzodiazepines[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] (most commonly midazolam and diazepam) with an opioid[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] (often fentanyl or remifentanil), with or without propofol.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Ketamine has also been used in low doses for moderate sedation. Newer agents such as dexmedetomidine[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and fospropofol are also being used now a days.</p><p>Most endoscopists favour midazolam because of its fast onset and short duration of action and high amnestic properties. Midazolam is a water-soluble agent that causes sedation, anxiolysis and amnesia. It is the shortest-acting benzodiazepine available.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Common adverse effects of midazolam include prolonged recovery after long-term or high dose use, hypoxemia, hypotension and respiratory depression when paired with an opioid.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] 
</p><p>In recent years, dexmedetomidine has been used as an alternative to midazolam in conscious sedation. It is a potent and highly selective &#x003b1;-2 adrenoceptor agonist with sympatholytic, sedative, amnestic and the analgesic properties[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and has been described as a useful and safe adjunct in many clinical applications. It is the most recently developed drug of this class. It provides a unique &#x02018;conscious sedation&#x02019; (patients appear to be asleep, but are readily aroused) and analgesia, without respiratory depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>

We excluded patients who had ASA physical status Grade III and more, baseline SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%, mechanically ventilated patients, patients with comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension (HTN) or hepatic or renal insufficiency to see the pure effect of both these drugs and to avoid any interaction with any simultaneous drug intake, which could have altered the results. We also excluded patients who had difficulty in communication (due to language problem or deafness), patients with history of operative intervention within the past 72 h, because we wanted to record their Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) and MAS which might not have been possible in these subsets of patients. Patients with a known allergy to these drugs and with a history of sulphite, egg or soya bean allergy and pregnant patients were also excluded.</p><p>A detailed pre-operative check-up including general examination and systemic examination of the patient was carried out. On the arrival of patient in Endoscopy Room, all vital parameters such as HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation (SpO2 %) were recorded and thereafter, readings were taken following the loading dose and every 5 min until the completion of the procedure. Venous access was secured on on non-dominant hand of every patient by 18G/20G cannula and Ringer Lactate drip was started.</p><p>Subjects were randomised with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The allocated intervention was written on a slip of paper, placed in serially numbered, opaque envelopes and sealed. As consecutive eligible subjects got enrolled, the envelopes were serially opened and the allocated intervention was implemented. The chief investigator, medical and nursing personnel were not blinded as it was an open-label trial. Subjects were followed from the point of randomisation until complete recovery. The numbers of patients were equally distributed in both groups. The groups were also similar in respect to time of intervention by endoscopist, i.e., after achievement of RSS 3-4. The intervention was in the form that both group patients were given fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg at the beginning of the procedure. Subjects in the study Group D received dexmedetomidine at loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg IV over 10 min followed by 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h infusion until RSS reached 3-4. Control Group M received a single dose of 0.04 mg/kg IV midazolam and additional 0.5 mg doses until RSS reached 3-4. We used these doses of midazolam and dexmedetomidine to preserve sufficient consciousness to allow communication, but provided the necessary degree of sedation to enable surgical comfort and an adequate quality of recovery with no negative effects on haemodynamics and respiratory parameters.</p><p>The following parameters were monitored and recorded[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] : (1) time to achieve RSS of 3-4, along with the total dose of drug needed, (2) the FPS 0-10 to evaluate pain (performed by anaesthesiologist at 5 min intervals throughout procedure) [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] and (3) in the recovery room, patient FPS noted till MAS reached 9-10.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Facial Pain Rating Scale (Wong baker face scale)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-58-18-g001"/></fig><p>During the procedure if patient required more than three episodes of personal restraint by the assistant or if either patient or endoscopist was uncomfortable, the rescue IV sedation was provided with propofol in top up incremental dose of 10 mg until patient reached RSS 3-4. The requirement of rescue sedative drug was also recorded. During procedure, any of the following complications were observed, recorded and treated accordingly. Oxygen desaturation was considered when SpO<sub>2</sub> level dropped below 92% for more than 10 s. A HR under 50 beats/min or a 20% decrease from the baseline was labelled as bradycardia, whereas a HR over 110 or an increase of more than 20% from the baseline level was considered as tachycardia. MAP levels that were lower than 60 mmHg or 20% less than the baseline were regarded as hypotension and a MA<italic>P</italic> value of over 150 mmHg or a 20% increase from the baseline was regarded as HTN. Possible complications, such as respiratory depression, allergies, coughing, gagging, nausea and vomiting, were recorded. After the procedure, the satisfaction of the surgeon and patients was assessed using satisfaction score [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Satisfaction score</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJA-58-18-g002"/></table-wrap><p>In the recovery room, MAS and vital parameters of patients were recorded every 5 min by Anaesthesiologist along with any adverse effect such as restlessness, shivering, nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort and respiratory depression.

The dose regimen of both dexmedetomidine and midazolam used in our study were similar to that used by Kilic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Arain and Ebert.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In Group D induction dose was given by infusion in 10 min followed by maintenance, but in Group M drug was given as a bolus. This explains the faster onset of sedation (RSS 3-4) in Group M compared with Group D (mean time 3 min vs. 12 min; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>Our study showed no significant difference in SBP, DBP, MAP, RSS, RR and SpO<sub>2</sub> in the Group D when compared with Group M. Patients in Group D had statistically significant lower HR (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) after infusion of loading dose and at 5, 10, 15 and 20 min during ERCP [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. These results are in accordance with previous studies by Kilic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Alhashemi[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and Dere <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] where they also found statistically significant lower HRs in dexmedetomidine group compared with midazolam group. Hypotension and bradycardia are recognized as two major adverse effects associated with &#x003b1;2-agonist agents. It has been suggested that these effects are mediated by activation of &#x003b1;2-adrenoceptors, imidazoline preferring receptors or both in the ventrolateral medulla and especially in the solitarius nucleus tract.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In the present study, we observed decrease in HR and comparatively stable B<italic>P</italic> values in Group D. In Group M, HR and BP were found to be higher during the operation in subsequent measurements compared with both baseline values and Group D. These findings suggest that dexmedetomidine has clinical advantages over midazolam with regard to controlling hemodynamic variability.</p><p>In our study, MAS during recovery was statistically different between two groups in the 5<sup>th</sup> min (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). About 90% of Group D patients achieved MAS of 9-10 in 5<sup>th</sup> min and only 17% in Group M. There was no significant difference in MAS at 10 min of recovery.

In contrast, few patients in the midazolam group had oxygen desaturation, lost capnography wave form, nausea and vomiting while no cases of hypotension or bradycardia was reported. In the recovery room too, the total complications were significantly more in the Group M. About 23% patients in Group M had complications, in which 10% experienced cough and vomiting and 3% patients had hiccough. None of the patients in Group D suffered from any complications in the recovery room.</p><p>In our study, we did FPS throughout the procedure, to measure the comfort of patient during procedure. Results were statistically different at 5 and 10 min in both groups and Group D showed better FPS score. At 15 min of procedure, both groups had similar FPS. Kilic <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in his study concluded that there were no significant differences in FPS values between groups during the procedures. Though, there was no significant difference between two groups regarding the requirement of propofol as rescue drug, but there was an increasing trend of using it in Group M.</p><p>In our study, we compared patients and endoscopist satisfaction by a scoring system and there was statistically significant difference between two groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).
