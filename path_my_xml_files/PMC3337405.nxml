These receptors include wild-type and mutant variants of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3), c-KIT, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-&#x003b2;, and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Mutations leading to constitutive activation of FLT3, which is involved in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis of myeloid progenitors, occur in the blasts of about 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], highlighting the potential utility of therapies targeting FLT3 in AML treatment. Furthermore, in vitro analysis of FLT3 inhibitors with varying levels of selectivity suggests that less-selective FLT3 inhibitors or those with broader tyrosine kinase inhibition profiles may offer a cytotoxic advantage in patients with newly diagnosed AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Midostaurin has demonstrated activity as a single agent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], has induced complete remissions in combination with chemotherapy in patients with AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and is currently under evaluation in a phase III registration trial in patients with newly diagnosed FLT3-mutant AML at a dose of 50&#x000a0;mg twice daily in combination with standard chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The inhibitory activity of midostaurin against c-KIT is also of interest because of the role that mutations in c-KIT play in aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM). Mutations in c-KIT are found in approximately 80% of patients with ASM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Preliminary results of a multicenter, phase II study of midostaurin (100&#x000a0;mg twice daily) in 26 patients with ASM, mast cell leukemia, or systemic mastocytosis without an associated hematologic clonal nonmast cell lineage disease (AHNMD) demonstrated that patients achieved a high overall response rate of 69%, regardless of c-KIT mutation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A global phase II study was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of midostaurin (100&#x000a0;mg twice daily until progressive disease, intolerability, or withdrawal) in patients with ASM or mast cell leukemia with or without an AHNMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The plasma concentrations of midostaurin and its metabolite CGP62221 accumulate in a time-linear manner in the first 3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;days of daily oral dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Thereafter, the pharmacokinetics (PK) become nonlinear, with a large increase in bioavailability between day 5 and day 28 to reach a new &#x0201c;pseudo steady state.&#x0201d; In contrast, the longer-lasting hydroxymetabolite CGP52421 continues to accumulate to reach approximately seven times the concentration of midostaurin and CGP62221 at steady state. Biliary excretion is the major pathway for elimination of midostaurin, CGP62221, and CGP52421.</p><p>Some TKIs have been shown to affect cardiac repolarization, as detected by heart rate&#x02013;corrected QT (QTc) prolongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although no previous clinical studies have suggested a substantive risk for cardiac abnormalities with midostaurin, a dedicated study has not been conducted to investigate the possible effects of midostaurin on the QTc corrected using Fridericia&#x02019;s correction (QTcF) interval. Described here are the results from a randomized study using placebo and active control arms to determine whether midostaurin administered at a dose of 75&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 2&#x000a0;days and 75&#x000a0;mg once daily for 1&#x000a0;day affects QTcF intervals in healthy adult volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Inclusion criteria for healthy volunteers, aged 18&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years, included no clinically significant deviations from normal in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, or clinical laboratory determinations. A body weight between 50 and 100&#x000a0;kg and a body mass index between 18 and 33&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were also required. Exclusion criteria included, but were not limited to, a history or family history of long QT-interval syndrome, heart disease, and any other severe or uncontrolled medical or psychiatric condition. Smoking and drug and/or alcohol abuse within 30&#x000a0;days of randomization, use of prescription drugs within 14&#x000a0;days of randomization, and use of CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing or enzyme-inhibiting agents within 4&#x000a0;weeks of dosing were prohibited. Participants were discontinued if they had abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) results on day &#x02212;1, during placebo run-in, and were followed until resolution of abnormality. These participants were replaced, as is standard in QTc studies, to ensure that a sufficient number of participants were evaluable for the ECG analysis.</p><p>Participants randomized into 1 of the 3 arms of the study were evaluated as the randomized set, regardless of whether they ever received study medication. The safety population consisted of all participants who received at least 1 dose of study medication. The PK set consisted of all participants who completed at least 1 dose of midostaurin or moxifloxacin and had evaluable PK profiles on day 1 and/or day 3. The ECG set consisted of participants who completed all scheduled doses of study medication from day 1 to day 3 and had an available baseline ECG measurement and at least 1 ECG measurement on day 3.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This study was a phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled, 3-way, parallel-group study conducted at a single center in the United States and approved by the Arkansas Research Medical Testing, LLC, Institutional Review Board. The design followed the recommendations of the International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) E14 guideline on &#x0201c;The Clinical Evaluation of QT/QTc Interval Prolongation and Proarrhythmic Potential for Non-Antiarrhythmic Drugs&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As such, the trial included a concurrent positive control group and addressed intrinsic variability by conducting multiple ECGs at baseline and during the study. The study was conducted according to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and written informed consent was obtained from each subject during screening.</p><p>Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms: midostaurin administered orally at 75&#x000a0;mg twice daily on days 1 and 2 and a single dose on day 3, moxifloxacin administered orally at a single 400-mg dose on day 3, or placebo (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The treatment regimen was selected to achieve maximal plasma exposure for QTc evaluation while minimizing the risks of excessive or prolonged exposure in healthy volunteers. In a prior study, patients with diabetes mellitus treated with multiple oral doses of midostaurin for 28&#x000a0;days at 4 dose levels (25&#x000a0;mg twice daily, 50&#x000a0;mg twice daily, 75&#x000a0;mg twice daily, and 75&#x000a0;mg 3 times daily) as well as a single oral 100-mg dose, demonstrated a marked increase in frequency of adverse events at doses above the 75-mg twice-daily dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Thus, the 75-mg twice-daily dose was expected to be safe and effective and was associated with a midostaurin cumulative <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> similar to that observed with a 50-mg twice-daily dose of midostaurin in a phase Ib study of patients with newly diagnosed AML treated with various doses of midostaurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study drug administration per treatment arm</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="280_2012_1825_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>Moxifloxacin (400 mg) was used in the active control arm because this agent is known to prolong QTc intervals in a dose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The difference in QTcF interval prolongation between the moxifloxacin and placebo arms served as an indicator of assay sensitivity. Moxifloxacin was overencapsulated to make the capsules visually identical to the placebo. Novartis supplied capsules for blinding of the active control via overencapsulation by the pharmacy of the site. Dissolution testing was performed on moxifloxacin overencapsulated tablets, and they were determined to have equivalent dissolution to regular moxifloxacin.</p><p>Because the metabolite CGP52421 exhibits a very long half-life (up to 1&#x000a0;month) in human participants, a parallel study design was used instead of a crossover design to avoid the potential carryover effect of this analyte. This study did not evaluate the effect of CGP52421, which would require 21&#x02013;28&#x000a0;days of treatment to reach the steady state, because of ethical and safety concerns related to long-term exposure to a drug in healthy volunteers. Study drugs were administered at 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM; breakfast and dinner were provided at 10:00 AM and 5:30 PM, respectively.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of multiple doses of midostaurin on the QTcF interval. The primary variable evaluated was the change from baseline (day &#x02212;1) in the QTcF interval over the protocol-defined time points on day 3 with midostaurin. The baseline comparison was from day &#x02212;1 to day 3 at matched time points. The secondary objectives were safety, tolerability, cardiac intervals (QT, QTcB [corrected using Bazett&#x02019;s correction], QTcI [individually corrected], length of QRS complex of waves, interval between RR waves [RR], interval between PR waves [PR]), and heart rate following multiple doses of midostaurin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>To claim a lack of effect of multiple doses of midostaurin on QTcF interval, the following hypothesis was tested predose (0&#x000a0;h) and at all 8 post dose time points on day 3:<disp-formula id="Equa"><alternatives><tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}

If any of the 5 adjusted <italic>P</italic> values were &#x0003c;.05, assay sensitivity was claimed. Only the participants who completed all scheduled doses of study medication from day 1 to day 3 and had at least 1 ECG on day &#x02212;1 (baseline) and at least 1 ECG on day 3 (time-matched day 3 data for the time-matched analysis) were included in the assay sensitivity test.</p><p>Electrocardiogram measurements at each time point were calculated as an average of 3 separate ECG extractions or replicates. (Each extraction was the mean of 3 beats.) If fewer than 3 measurements were available, the available samples were averaged (i.e., a minimum of 1 measure was required). For each subject, the time-matched baseline value was subtracted from the QT/QTc intervals to determine the change from baseline in QT/QTc intervals for that subject. The 2 null hypotheses described above were tested in a linear mixed-effect model with a compound symmetry covariance structure. The model included the baseline measure as covariate and treatment, time, and the treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, where time was a categorical variable and subject was a random effect.</p><p>The time-matched analysis was conducted on the QTcF change from the time-matched baseline as recommended by the ICH E14 guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Although modeling change from the time-matched baseline was the primary analysis, the change from the time-averaged baseline was also analyzed using the same model. For the averaged baseline, each triplicate ECG collection was averaged first, and then the averaged baseline was calculated based on all the averaged triplicate ECG and unscheduled ECGs.</p><p>Exploratory analyses were performed to characterize the relationship between drug concentrations and changes in QT intervals to assist with interpretation of the study results. A linear random-effects model was fit to the QTcF/QTcB/QTcI/QT change from day &#x02212;1 (baseline) to day 3 and concentration data for midostaurin or its 2 metabolites (CGP52421 and CGP62221) or moxifloxacin. Baseline QTcF was included in the model as a covariate.

This exploratory analysis was applied to both the change from the time-matched baseline and the change from time-averaged baseline.</p><p>Outlier analysis for QTc was also exploratory because this study was not powered to detect individuals with genetic sensitivity to potential QT-prolonging drugs.

Moxifloxacin, midostaurin, CGP62221, and CGP52421 concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry with a limit of quantification of 50 and 10&#x000a0;ng/mL respectively.

In particular, FLT3 is recognized as a major target in the treatment of AML, and agents specifically designed to target this receptor, including AC220 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and MLN518 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], have been shown to induce prolongation of the QT interval in clinical trials, as has the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that midostaurin, an inhibitor of FLT3, c-KIT, and other tyrosine kinases with established efficacy in patients with AML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and ASM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], was not associated with prolonged cardiac repolarization or its related proarrhythmic effects. In a time-matched analysis for QTcF, midostaurin had no or minimal effect on the QT interval, with an upper bound of the 95% CI for QTcF values corrected for both baseline and placebo &#x0003c;5&#x000a0;ms. The threshold level of regulatory concern, as established in the ICH E14 guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], is a 10-ms mean increase in QTc as the upper bound of the 95% CI. The results for the time-averaged analysis were consistent with those determined using the time-matched analysis.</p><p>Despite historical reliance on the QTc change from baseline for determining a drug&#x02019;s proarrhythmic risk, the importance of the concentration&#x02013;QT relationship in interpreting thorough QT studies is increasingly being realized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Concentration&#x02013;QTcF slopes for midostaurin and its metabolites CGP62221 and CPG52421 were either negative or not statistically significant, which further supports the lack of prolonged cardiac repolarization with midostaurin. Furthermore, the placebo arm&#x02019;s mean QTcF change from baseline was within 5&#x000a0;ms, demonstrating that spontaneous factors were very well controlled.</p><p>On the basis of previous studies, the expected effect of the active control moxifloxacin on the QTcF interval was 8&#x02013;13&#x000a0;ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Our results were consistent with this finding, with the lower CI &#x0003e;5&#x000a0;ms at hour 1 post administration, QTcF increases between 5 and 10&#x000a0;ms at 0.5, 2, 3, and 8&#x000a0;h post administration, and upper CIs between 10 and 15&#x000a0;ms with moxifloxacin treatment. In the time-matched analysis, these increases were not significantly different from placebo after multiple time point correction methods to establish the sensitivity of the assay. In a time-averaged analysis, however, the maximum mean change from baseline in the moxifloxacin arm compared with the placebo arm was significant. The lack of significance in the time-matched analysis may be related to the slightly lower moxifloxacin <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> observed in this study (2544 ng/mL) compared with what has been previously reported (2830&#x000a0;ng/mL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The PK profile of moxifloxacin was somewhat flattened, which was most likely due to overencapsulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Linear regression analyses showed a statistically significant positive slope of QT change from baseline with increasing moxifloxacin plasma concentrations. The moxifloxacin slope for QTcF (3.2&#x000a0;ms&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL) was consistent with those found in 5 other thorough QTc studies, in which the mean slope estimates were 2.5, 2.4, 3.3, 3.5, and 4.3&#x000a0;ms&#x000a0;per&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This positive slope, and the fact that moxifloxacin concentrations reached levels expected for overencapsulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], established the sensitivity of the assay. These findings support the value of determining the slope of the QT-concentration curve when overencapsulation is used for a double-blinded positive control.</p><p>Electrocardiogram analysis demonstrated that midostaurin had no effects on heart rate, atrioventricular conduction, or cardiac depolarization, as measured by the PR and QRS interval durations. No participants in any group met the specific outlier criteria for U-wave or QTc interval, although the analysis was exploratory. No QTcF, QTcB, or QTcI changes from baseline &#x0003e;60&#x000a0;ms or results &#x0003e;480&#x000a0;ms were detected in any arm. Overall, these data indicate that no clinically relevant changes in ECG parameters were detected in the midostaurin arm.</p><p>The adverse events experienced in this trial were mainly mild (97% were grade 1), and the gastrointestinal events in the midostaurin arm were expected and occurred at a lower frequency than has been observed previously in patients with AML treated with midostaurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Overall, midostaurin at a dose of 75&#x000a0;mg twice daily was safe and generally well tolerated in these healthy participants in a 4-day evaluation period.</p><p>The results of the concentration&#x02013;QTcF regression analysis showed no evidence that midostaurin or its metabolite CGP62221 affected QTc duration, whereas the positive control moxifloxacin demonstrated the expected relationship between its concentration and the change in QTc. Despite the lack of prolonged cardiac repolarization with midostaurin in this carefully conducted study, we recommend continued ECG monitoring in clinical trials, but at a reduced frequency, as the QT effects of the long-lasting metabolite CGP52421 were not fully addressed in this relatively short study with a 4-day evaluation period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="280_2012_1825_MOESM1_ESM.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (DOC 148 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Financial support for medical editorial assistance was provided by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.
