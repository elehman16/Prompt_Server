Though the available scientific literature is mostly from observational studies, and is fraught with controversy, BCG vaccination at birth may protect infants in high-mortality populations against serious infections other than TB. Yet, other studies indicate that giving BCG later in infancy may modify immune responses to non-TB antigens and potentially enhance immunity, potentially also against tuberculosis (TB). It is unclear whether BCG vaccination very early in life offers adequate protection against TB and other infections among HIV-1-exposed children because even those who remain uninfected with HIV-1 show signs of impaired immunocompetence early in infancy. This study will compare BCG vaccination at birth with BCG vaccination at 14&#x000a0;weeks of age in HIV-1-exposed infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is an individually randomized controlled trial in 2200 HIV-1-exposed infants. The intervention is BCG vaccination within 24&#x000a0;h of birth while the comparator is BCG given at 14&#x000a0;weeks of age. The study co-primary outcomes are severe illness in the first 14&#x000a0;weeks of life, and production of tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and interferon-&#x003b3; in response to mycobacterial and nonmycobacterial antigens.

Importantly, the Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#x000e9;rin (BCG) vaccine may have effects on morbidity and mortality that cannot be attributed to the vaccine&#x02019;s protective effect against tuberculosis (TB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. A case control study among infants in Guinea-Bissau showed that infants who had received the BCG vaccine were at least 60% less likely to have acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRI) and respiratory syncytial virus infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] than those who had not been vaccinated. A small Malawian study indicated that the likelihood of septicemia among infants with a BCG scar was lower than that among infants without a scar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A Senegalese prospective study analyzing data from two birth cohorts (a total of 11,369 children under 2&#x000a0;years of age) found an association between a combination of BCG/DTP administered simultaneously and reduced mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial among low-birth-weight preterm infants indicated that there may be an association between early BCG vaccination and lower perinatal mortality, but not lower infant mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In a birth cohort study in Uganda, we previously showed that children between 1&#x000a0;month and 5&#x000a0;years of age who had received BCG had a substantially lower mortality than those who had not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In fact, this association was even stronger in the neonates but we decided not to display this potentially important finding because of the possibility that some of the association could have been due to reverse causality, as vaccinators could to some extent have refrained from giving BCG to sick babies. Other observational studies among older children, adolescents and adults have shown mixed results for the effects of the BCG vaccine against atopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and helminthic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Nonspecific effects of vaccines, are now receiving increased attention, all the more so when the incidence of the TB is decreasing worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) recently established a Strategic Advisory Group of Experts working group on NSEs of vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methodological challenges in existing studies</title><p>The medical literature on the NSEs of vaccines is fraught with controversy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Much of this controversy stems from interpretational challenges of the observational studies carried out in high-mortality areas, and in heavily burdened health care systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It has been argued that children with a lower morbidity and mortality are more likely to be vaccinated than higher-risk children, resulting in a spurious nonspecific protective effect of vaccines in observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. There is also the possibility of survival bias if death (a common study outcome) is associated with missing vaccination cards. This has been observed in some retrospective studies in Africa where child deaths were quickly followed by destruction or loss of vaccination cards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. These selection challenges can be alleviated by well-designed and well-executed randomized controlled trials. However, as most childhood vaccines are part of routine national and international child health programmes, it has been considered unethical to randomize children to not receive BCG. For this reason, the medical literature on NSEs has continued to be overshadowed by controversy and continues to be dependent on initial studies carried out several decades ago when morbidity and mortality patterns, as well as the vaccines themselves, were different from what they are now [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Two recent systematic reviews concluded that the currently available evidence, which is mainly from observational studies, was of low quality and reiterated the need for randomized controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no other, long-term, ongoing randomized trials with clinical endpoints similar to ours.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Immunological reprogramming induced by BCG</title><p>In order to strengthen the medical literature, one of the most important aims of the study is to identify any immunological reprogramming induced by BCG, which has been recently suggested to be responsible for NSEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The immunological responses thought to account for the NSEs of BCG may, in broad terms, be considered to involve two processes: trained innate immunity and heterologous immunity. Trained immunity is a novel concept that describes the functional reprogramming of innate immune cells (such as monocytes, macrophages or natural killer (NK) cells) after an infection or vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The molecular mechanism mediating trained immunity is represented by epigenetic modifications due to changes in histone methylation and acetylation, leading to a looser chromatin structure and increased gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Similar epigenetic reprogramming has been described in monocytes of individuals vaccinated with BCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition to trained immunity, a second important immunological mechanism that is likely to be involved in the NSEs is heterologous immunity: the capacity of memory T-lymphocytes to respond in an interleukin (IL)-12/IL-18-dependent manner with increased production of cytokines upon stimulation with different stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Timing of BCG vaccination among HIV-1-exposed children</title><p>Based on studies showing a nearly 1000-fold increased risk of disseminated BCG infection among HIV-1-infected infants, recent WHO guidelines consider HIV-1 infection a contraindication to BCG vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, the practical implementation of this guideline has been difficult as HIV-1 diagnosis at birth (when the vaccine is to be given) is not available in many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As a result, all HIV-1-exposed infants, including those yet to be diagnosed as HIV-1 infected, continue to receive BCG at birth in several LMICs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. To circumvent this, an alternative approach has been proposed in which the vaccine is delayed until these infants are diagnosed as not having HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>On the one hand, if vaccinating HIV-1-exposed babies with BCG at birth protects them against serious infections other than TB, i.e., through NSEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], delaying vaccination could result in increased morbidity and even mortality. In addition, delaying BCG vaccination to a later time when a definitive diagnosis is made could reduce its coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The Ugandan Ministry of Health has decided that all infants, including those with HIV-1 infection, but without symptomatic HIV-1 disease, are to receive BCG.</p><p>On the other hand, recent studies put into question the age at which the BCG vaccine is best given to HIV-1-exposed and uninfected children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It is presently unclear whether BCG vaccination very early in life provides them with adequate protection against TB and other infections. HIV-1 infection during pregnancy may transiently modulate their responses to the BCG vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. It appears that they have an impaired response to purified protein derivative (PPD) and heat-killed BCG in comparison to unexposed children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. These effects seem to be greatest among younger HIV-1-exposed uninfected children. A recent study in Brazil found the cellular immune response to BCG among younger HIV-1-exposed uninfected children to be impaired in comparison to their unexposed counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. BCG-specific T-cell proliferation and interferon (IFN)-&#x003b3; concentrations were lower in the younger than in the older HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants and than in the unexposed infants. This signified a delay in immune system maturation of HIV-1-exposed infants. Moreover, a Gambian study showed that children vaccinated at a median age of 14&#x000a0;days were less likely to develop a BCG scar if they were HIV-1-exposed uninfected than if they were HIV-1-unexposed and uninfected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. A Rwandese study did not replicate this finding but found that HIV-1-exposed uninfected children vaccinated at birth were substantially less likely than HIV-1-unexposed children to react to a tuberculin skin test at 6&#x000a0;months of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Other studies have linked negative tuberculin skin tests and absence of BCG scars to high morbidity and mortality in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. These BCG-specific immune abnormalities are consistent with a wider range of other anomalies reported among very young HIV-1-exposed uninfected children and are thought to result from in-utero exposure to the HIV-1 infection and/or antiretroviral drugs. These include: a reduced CD4/CD8 ratio, reduced CD4+ and CD8+ naive T-cell percentages, an increased percentage of activated CD8+ T-cells, augmented percentages of CD3(+)/4(&#x02212;)/8&#x02009;(&#x02212;)&#x02009;(DN) and DN/25(&#x02212;)/44&#x02009;(+)&#x02009;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], altered cell-mediated immunity and T-cell maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], reduced IL-12 production that persists until 6&#x000a0;months of age that could possibly be immunosuppressive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], and several cytokine and other immune abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Importantly, many of these anomalies appear to be transient, disappearing as children grow older.</p><p>A small trial in South Africa in which newborn HIV-1-unexposed babies were randomized to receive BCG at birth or at 10&#x000a0;weeks of age, showed that delaying the vaccination resulted in increased numbers of BCG-specific CD4 T-cells, most importantly polyfunctional T-cells co-expressing IFN-&#x003b3;, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and IL-2, at 1&#x000a0;year of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. A recent study among HIV-1-exposed children reported robust T-cellular responses to <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> and tetanus toxoid in infants in whom BCG vaccination was delayed to 8&#x000a0;weeks of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. It is unknown, whether these effects of delayed BCG administration translate into enhanced protection against TB or, for that matter, against other serious infections.</p><p>The most appropriate timing for BCG vaccination that maximizes both specific and possible NSEs, particularly in HIV-1-exposed children, is thus presently unknown. This uncertainty compels us to study the NSEs of the BCG vaccine with a design that overcomes the methodological challenges of observational studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Purpose and rationale of this study</title><p>A rapid increase in the number of HIV-1-positive pregnant women receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) to prevent mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV-1 in the last 10&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], coupled with stagnating or increasing adult HIV-1 prevalence in LMICs, has resulted in an increase in the number of HIV-1-exposed uninfected children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. While data on HIV-1-exposed uninfected children is scanty, available evidence suggests that these children have a higher morbidity and mortality in comparison to their unexposed counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In comparison to unexposed children, HIV-1-exposed uninfected children are more likely to contract the common childhood infectious diseases in severe forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to be resistant to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. They are also vulnerable to diseases previously reported among immunocompromised children, such as cytomegalovirus colitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>], hemorrhagic chicken pox, <italic>Pneumocystis jiroveci</italic> pneumonia and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>].</p><p>Bearing the above considerations in mind, we believe that there is clinical equipoise between early and deferred BCG vaccination in HIV-1-exposed, and probably even in HIV-1-unexposed infants. Moreover, the long-term cost-implications and cost-effectiveness of the alternatives have never been investigated.</p><p>It is possible that well-timed BCG vaccination could have important NSEs in HIV-1-exposed children. We therefore propose a parallel-group superiority trial that could inform the development of programmatically appropriate timing of BCG vaccination for HIV-1-exposed infants by measuring the safety, potential benefits or disadvantages, costs and cost-effectiveness of early versus late BCG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>

</p><p>Home visits will be made for participants missing clinic visits while those coming to their scheduled clinic visits will have the transport fees reimbursed to reduce losses to follow-up. Data on illness, hospital visits and hospitalization is collected from interviews with the mother, with more detailed information obtained from the hospital records. Illness and hospitalization data is based on recall between a previous visit and a current visit.</p><p>Upon enrollment and on subsequent visits, mothers and other caregivers are informed about symptoms and signs of severe illness, and are encouraged to contact the study clinic in case the baby develops any of these symptoms. Each mother is provided with a durable note book, in which she is instructed and trained to note down all relevant events in her child. The front page of the book will have clear reminders that she needs to contact the study team in case the child visits a health clinic, a physician or is admitted to a hospital. A child who comes to a clinic with such symptoms is examined by a study nurse/midwife. If the child does not attend after the mother/caregiver has informed the study team of such signs or for a scheduled visit, the study nurse/midwife will make a visit to the child&#x02019;s house. If the nurse/midwife classifies the condition as possible severe illness, a study physician will be called to examine the child. If the physician classifies the child as having severe illness, they will collect a blood specimen for blood culture (using BACTEC) and a sepsis screen (CRP, TLC, differential count, and band cell:neutrophil count ratio) as soon as possible. A repeat specimen will be collected again for CRP between 24 and 48&#x000a0;h. The study team will do its utmost to obtain specimens for such a sepsis screen from as many infants with signs of severe illness as possible. However, we have yet to learn what percentage of them in this way can actually be screened for &#x0201c;clinical sepsis.&#x0201d; When 200 enrolled babies have been followed until the age of 6&#x000a0;months, the percentage of infants registered as having had severe illness who are screened for clinical sepsis will be calculated. If this percentage is less than 80%, measures will be taken to increase it above this value, if these measures are unsuccessful, we will need to abandon the attempt to identify clinical sepsis with the sepsis screen.

Between-group comparisons for continuous variables that are symmetrically distributed will be made using <italic>t</italic> tests or, if adjustment for other variables are required, linear regression, while Wilcoxon rank sum tests will be used to compare continuous variables where even their log-transformed values remains nonsymmetrically distributed. Group comparisons for categorical variables will use chi-square tests and regression with generalized linear models of the binomial family with a log link (&#x0201c;relative risk regression&#x0201d;) or logistic regression.

All relevant data; from both scheduled and unscheduled visits will be included in the analysis.</p><sec id="Sec38"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>The main study outcomes are severe illness during the first 14&#x000a0;weeks of life and immunological parameters. Although the sample size estimations are based on specified relative risks, i.e., the occurrence of one or more illness episodes per child, our final analysis will also use incidence density and use Poisson regression or, in case of overdispersion, negative binomial regression analyses, to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR), enabling us to capture more than one illness event in each child. Further, children who are lost to follow-up will be included in time-to-event analyses, censoring children during periods when data could not be recorded.

The effect of the intervention on the occurrence of severe illness will be estimated using both relative (relative risks (RR), IRR and hazard ratios (HR)) and absolute (risk differences and incidence rate differences (IRD)) measures of effect. In the event that the &#x0201c;relative risk regression&#x0201d; model fails to converge, risk ratios will be obtained from logistic regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] or from a modified Poisson regression model with robust variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].</p><p>Also, autoregressive correlation approaches will be used to account for multiple and possibly correlated observations within the same study participant.

Efficacy will be calculated as 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;RR), 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;IRR) or 100&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;HR).

The decision model will have two arms, one for early, the other for delayed BCG administration (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A Markov life-cycle will be attached to each delivery arm, in which infants are followed in weekly cycles from 0 to 14&#x000a0;weeks, monthly cycles between 14 and 52&#x000a0;weeks, and thereafter yearly cycles. The model will track one annual Ugandan cohort of HIV-1-exposed infants until they are 5&#x000a0;years old.<fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>The decision model</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_1881_Fig4_HTML" id="MO4"/></fig>
</p><p>The main focus of the model will be severe illness during the first year of life, and will rely on prospectively collected trial data (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). For each cycle (weekly, monthly or annual) children may experience disease, or they may remain healthy. Children aged below 1&#x000a0;year are assumed to be at risk of experiencing a disease other than TB which may persist or from which they recover before the next period. In all health states, individuals may die from that illness or from other causes. At birth, all children are assumed to be alive and well.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Economic evaluation data requirements and sources</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Source</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2">Epidemiology</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Age-specific disease incidence</td><td>Primary data (for each condition)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Background mortality</td><td>Secondary data (Ugandan life table)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Effectiveness</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Disease-specific efficacy</td><td>Primary data</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Uptake of intervention</td><td>Secondary data: effective coverage of vaccination</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Aggregate health</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Years of life lost</td><td>Secondary data (Ugandan life table)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Disease weights</td><td>Secondary data (Burden of Disease Study)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Costs</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Intervention costs</td><td>Primary data (prospectively costed)</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;Treatment costs</td><td>Primary data (retrospectively costed)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>
</p><p>The model represents a simplification of clinical reality, and a simplifying assumption is that BCG-induced protection against severe illnesses occurs only during the first 5&#x000a0;years of life. This reflects the availability of primary data and follow-up from the controlled trial. Modeling of the health outcomes may be divided into three phases: (a) the observation period, (b) the period of assumed but gradually waning impact of the vaccine (less than 5&#x000a0;years) and (c) the post-vaccine period, where no further vaccination effects are assumed. Extrapolation is required to capture probable health benefits during the second of these phases, but the actual functional shape and other assumptions about continued treatment benefits need to be informed by data through survival analyses, and cannot be decided ex-ante. Transition probabilities are assumed to depend on vaccination strategy, and will be informed by the trial. More specifically, transition probabilities, i.e., probabilities of moving between the health states, will be calculated based on hazard functions from the survival analyses (above). After the extrapolation period, children are not assumed to be protected by BCG, but are assumed to experience background mortality and morbidity for their remaining life time. Long-term health effects will be aggregated using disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) as the instrument, while incremental cost-effectiveness will be expressed in terms of US dollars per DALY averted. Costs will be collected from the perspective of the national health care system, and include those related to providing the BCG vaccine as well as those averted due to the prevention of common illnesses in the short and long term.</p></sec><sec id="Sec41"><title>AE reporting/clinical and safety monitoring</title><p>An adverse event (AE) is defined as any harmful manifestation occurring in a trial participant, whether this manifestation is related or not to the study BCG vaccine.

We will also prepare contextualized evidence briefs for policy to relevant stakeholders including Ugandan authorities (Ministry of Health, National Drug Authority, Uganda National Academy of Sciences) and development partners supporting the Uganda National Expanded Programme on Immunization (UNEPI), WHO (Vaccines and Biologicals) and UNICEF. We will, also in collaboration with CISMAC, prepare plain language summaries and press releases for consumer groups and mass media, respectively. Finally, we will engage the clinic staff and study participants and their communities to inform them of our findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec49"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>According to WHO guidelines, BCG vaccination is contraindicated in children with known HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] because of their increased risk of disseminated BCG disease. But implementation of this guideline in many LMICs, including Uganda, is challenging. According to the expanded programme of immunization, the vaccine is to be given as soon as possible after birth. Diagnosing HIV-1 infection in infants requires a PCR which is not accessible to Ugandan children at birth. Therefore, Ugandan HIV-1-exposed newborns receive BCG at birth. On the one hand, receiving the vaccine at birth could be of potential benefit through morbidity and mortality reduction in the initial weeks of life. On the other hand, recent medical literature indicates that HIV-1-exposed uninfected infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and maybe even HIV-1-unexposed infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], who receive BCG somewhat later may yield more vigorous immune responses than those who receive it at birth. It is conceivable that such a delay translates into better protection against TB. Delaying vaccination may also carry the advantage of increasing the likelihood that HIV-1-exposed infants may be reliably diagnosed with respect to HIV-1 infection, both for logistic reasons but also because there is a genuine risk of HIV-1 transmission via breast milk during the first months of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. This trial will compare BCG take and risk of severe illness (including death) among HIV-1-exposed children receiving the vaccine shortly after birth to such a risk in infants receiving BCG at 14&#x000a0;weeks of age.</p><p>The main ethical concerns specific to study are:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Acquisition of TB before BCG has engendered a protective immune response (delayed BCG trial arm)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Severe BCG disease among HIV-1-positive infants (early BCG trial arm)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Higher incidence of severe illness during the first 14&#x000a0;weeks of life among the children who receive delayed BCG</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>To address the first concern, the study will exclude children with household members who have signs or symptoms of TB or who have a diagnosis of TB. The risk of TB infection among trial babies will, therefore, be negligible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In addition, the study will continue to actively screen and refer suspected cases to the national TB clinics until the participating infants have received BCG (at 14&#x000a0;weeks of age). The study will support diagnosis and initiation of treatment at the TB clinics, of any of the participants&#x02019; household members with signs and symptoms of TB from randomization until 14&#x000a0;weeks of age. Moreover, the study team will collaborate closely with the families to identify, treat and actively follow up the babies should there be a history of exposure to active TB or should they develop any symptoms indicative of TB. Should our study show that delayed vaccination is beneficial in terms of protecting HIV-1-exposed babies against severe illness and in the long run it leads to a policy shift, with HIV-1-exposed children from households without TB being vaccinated late, our findings will inform subsequent programmes and would thereby contribute to improved infant health.</p><p>To mitigate the second concern, an HIV-1 diagnosis using DNA PCR is obtained at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age. All children who are allocated to receive BCG at birth and are found to be infected with HIV-1 will be referred to a pediatrician for assessment, while the HIV-1-infected participants allocated to receive BCG later will be referred to government clinics for a decision to vaccinate or not. In a sample of 1100 children, the probability of disseminated BCG is extremely low. This is because in the presence of the current Ugandan peripartum ART prophylaxis the risk of HIV-1 infection assessed at 6&#x000a0;weeks of age is less than 3.5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Therefore, among the 1100 babies who receive BCG at birth, fewer than 40 children are likely to acquire HIV-1. Among children with immunodeficiency, it is estimated that the risk of disseminated BCG infection following vaccination is less than 1.6 per 1,000,000 vaccinated children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Therefore, the likelihood of any child contracting disseminated BCG in our study is less than 0.015% if the government clinics decide to vaccinate all the HIV-1-infected infants at 14&#x000a0;years of age, and 0.007% if they decide not to vaccinate any of them. So, this risk will be equal to, or lower than, that outside of the study, given that Ugandan HIV-1-exposed infants receive BCG shortly after birth. In the study, we shall reduce this risk further with prompt standard TB prophylaxis using isoniazid as soon as an HIV diagnosis is made.</p><p>With regard to the third concern, appropriate diagnostic procedures and treatment will be provided according to national guidelines to all severely ill children.</p><p>Ethics permission to conduct the study has been obtained from the School of Medicine, Research and Ethics Committee (Makerere University) as well as from the Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics in Norway (REK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The trial has also been approved by the National Council of Science and Technology and the National Drug Authority in Uganda. The study is performed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines for Good Clinical Practice. Written individual informed consent in local language is obtained from each of the participating mothers by trained study staff. The consent process will explain the nature of the study, the risks and benefits of participating in the study, the intervention and that intervention allocation is by a random process. In situations requiring translation or in cases where the mother is unable to read and write, the consent process will take place in the presence of an independent third person, who will act as a witness and also co-sign the Consent Form. Additional consent is obtained from study participants for the collection and storage of blood specimens for ancillary studies. Confidentiality of information and the right of the participant to withdraw from the study at any time during the study is explained to the mothers. All study staff are trained on participant confidentiality and autonomy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec50"><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial compares the effect BCG vaccination at birth with BCG vaccination at 14&#x000a0;weeks of age in HIV-1-exposed babies on (1) severe illness in the first 14&#x000a0;weeks of life, (2) TNF, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22 and IFN-&#x003b3; in response to mycobacterial and non-mycobacterial pathogens and (3) severe illness in 14&#x02013;52 weeks of life and throughout infancy.</p><p>The study circumvents the methodological challenges of earlier observational studies that reported an association between BCG vaccination and NSEs. The exclusion criteria combined with the random allocation and large sample size will substantially reduce the likelihood that children with higher morbidity end up in either group. There will be no survival bias linked to missing vaccination cards as BCG is administered before outcome measurement. This study will be further strengthened by an exploration of immunological mechanisms for the vaccine&#x02019;s hypothesized NSEs. The study will explore the trained innate immunity and heterologous immunity processes that underlie the immunological responses thought to account for the NSEs of BCG.</p><p>This trial, comparing NSEs when the vaccine is given at birth and when it is delayed, could inform the development of programmatically appropriate timing of BCG vaccination for HIV-1-exposed infants. This, in turn could importantly impact morbidity and mortality among these infants, who will constitute an increasing part of sub-Saharan African child cohorts in the years to come.</p><sec id="Sec51"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruiting since July 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec52"><title>Additional file</title><p>
