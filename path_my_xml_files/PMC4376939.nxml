It is a progressive disease, and most patients with T2DM eventually require insulin therapy to achieve optimal glycemic control[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Insulin is the most effective glucose-lowering agent; however, since increased risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and fear or unwillingness to inject limits optimization of the dose and number of insulin injections, many patients treated with insulin still do not achieve their glycemic goal[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors slow the degradation of incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and thereby enhance the action of endogenous incretin[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Since incretin hormones stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, DPP-4 inhibitors improve hyperglycemia without an increase in risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. DPP-4 inhibitors have also been shown to improve glucagon dynamics[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, animal studies suggest that chronic exposure to GLP-1 may increase beta cell mass by promoting proliferation and differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis of beta cells[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Based on these characteristics of DPP-4 inhibitors, adding a DPP-4 inhibitor to insulin is expected to improve glycemic control without an increase in risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Previous studies conducted in USA and Europe have shown that adding a DPP-4 inhibitor to insulin in patients with T2DM reduced HbA1c[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], but the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased in one study in which sitagliptin was used[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, since the glucose-lowering effect of DPP-4 inhibitors appears to be greater in Asians compared with Caucasians[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the efficacy and safety of DPP-4 inhibitors added to insulin need to be clarified in the Asian population as well as in other ethnic groups.</p><p>In Japan, the first DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, has been marketed since 2009. Therefore, in this study we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding sitagliptin in Japanese patients with T2DM whose glycemic control is suboptimal despite insulin therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Research Design and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Subjects</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0121988.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 CONSORT Checklist</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121988.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0121988.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref> Protocol. We enrolled outpatients with T2DM who had been treated with at least twice daily injections of insulin for at least 2 months, and who had a suboptimal level of glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (i.e., &#x02265;7.0%, according to the guidelines of the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS)[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]) between January 2011 and March 2013. A total of 54 patients were enrolled in the study, but four patients withdrew their consent before randomization (<xref rid="pone.0121988.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). No patients had been treated with sitagliptin or other DPP-4 inhibitors prior to study entry, since combination therapy with sitagliptin, the first approved DPP-4 inhibitor in Japan, and insulin was not approved in Japan until September 2011. Patients with type 1 diabetes, patients who had changed oral hypoglycemic agents within 2 months prior to study entry, and patients with severe liver disease or renal failure were excluded from the study. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the ethical review committee of Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.

A total of 50 subjects were randomized to the insulin (Insulin) group or the insulin plus sitagliptin (Ins+Sita) group based on a table of random numbers (simple randomization), and the treatment allocation was blinded to both attending physicians and patients until day 0 of the study. Subjects in the Insulin group continued their previous treatment during the study, and the insulin dose was adjusted by the attending physicians at each visit according to the guidelines of the Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) to achieve HbA1c below 7.0% as well as fasting plasma glucose levels below 130 mg/dL and 2 h postprandial plasma glucose level below 180 mg/dL[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In subjects in the Ins+Sita group, sitagliptin 50 mg once daily was added to the previous treatment at week 0, and if the patient randomized to the Ins+Sita group was treated with a sulfonylurea or glinide, these drugs were discontinued at week 0. Further, insulin dose, regardless of the type of insulin, was decreased by 20% at week 0 if the patient&#x02019;s HbA1c was less than 8.0% at week 0. Then, the insulin dose was adjusted by the attending physicians at each visit during the study according to the JDS guidelines[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Adherence to sitagliptin treatment (75% or greater administration) was confirmed at each visit by assessing the medication possession ratio (%MPR; 99.1 &#x000b1; 2.7%). If HbA1c did not achieve a level below 7.0% at week 12, the attending physicians were able to uptitrate the dose of sitagliptin to 100 mg daily. Other treatment including lifestyle modification was continued in both groups during the study. Patients in both groups were asked to visit the clinic every 4 weeks and received standard care similarly, except that patients allocated to the Ins+Sita group were also asked to attend for an additional visit at week 2, when the attending physicians judged whether further reduction in insulin was needed. The primary outcome of the study was change in HbA1c at week 24.</p><p>Blood and urine sampling was conducted at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24, together with body weight and blood pressure measurement. The patients were allowed to continue their self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) during the study and instructed to measure glucose level if they felt hypoglycemic. In addition, the patients were asked to conduct 7-point SMBG at week 0 and 24 to assess the daily glycemic profile. Seven-point SMBG was conducted seven times a day, before and 1 h after three meals and at bedtime, for two consecutive days, and mean values were used for analysis. The incidence and severity of hypoglycemia were assessed by a questionnaire in the patients at each visit. Hypoglycemia was defined as having hypoglycemic symptoms and/or blood glucose less than 70 mg/dL. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as hypoglycemia requiring the assistance of a third party for recovery. The patients were also asked to answer the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ)[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and the Diabetes Medication Satisfaction Questionnaire (DiabMedSat)[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] to assess treatment satisfaction at weeks 0 and 24.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Meal tolerance test</title><p>A mixed meal tolerance test (MTT) was administered at weeks 0 and 24. On the day of MTT, patients were asked to attend the hospital after an overnight fast and instructed to consume a meal within 15 min. The meal consisted of crackers, pudding and bisque soup (460 kcal; 56.5 g carbohydrate, 18 g fat and 18 g protein, Janefu E460F18, Kewpie Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). During MTT, the patients were asked to take medication as usual, except that the insulin dose was reduced by 50% to prevent hypoglycemia. Blood sampling was conducted at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min after ingestion of the meal.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Laboratory measurements</title><p>All measurements, unless otherwise indicated, were performed by the Department of Laboratory Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine using routine automated laboratory methods as previously described[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121988.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. HbA1c was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the values were expressed as National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP) values in this paper[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Serum glycated albumin (GA) and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) were measured by enzymatic methods. Serum C-peptide immunoreactivity (CPR) was measured by chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLIA). Plasma intact proinsulin was measured by CLIA (Invitron Limited, Monmouth, UK), and the intact proinsulin (pmol/L)/CPR (pmol/L) ratio was calculated. CPR index was calculated as CPR (ng/mL) /glucose (mg/dL) x 100, and the area under the curve (AUC) of CPR to the AUC of glucose ratio was expressed as ng/mg. Glucagon was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA) (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). Total GLP-1 was measured by electro-chemiluminescent immunoassay (Meso Scale Discovery, Gaithersburg, MD, USA), and intact GLP-1 and total GIP were measured by ELISA (Millipore), as previously reported[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Urinary 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was measured by ELISA (Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Nikken Seil Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan). Urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-iso-PGF2&#x003b1;) was measured by EIA (Cayman Chemical Company, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Total and intact GLP-1, total GIP and proinsulin were measured at 0 and 60 min during MTT. Urinary excretion rates of 8-OHdG and 8-iso-PGF2&#x003b1; were assessed at week 0 and 24. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR: mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was calculated according to the Statement of the Japan Nephrology Society (JNS) as follows: 194 x serum creatinine (mg/dL)<sup>-1.094</sup> x age (years)<sup>-0.287</sup> (x 0.739 for women)[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study was powered to show superiority in the primary endpoint, HbA1c, at week 24.

id="sec021"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, adding sitagliptin effectively reduced HbA1c by 0.9% without an increased risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain in Japanese patients with T2DM whose glycemic control was suboptimal despite at least twice daily injections of insulin. On the other hand, there was no significant improvement in HbA1c in the Insulin group, in which physicians tried to achieve the glycemic goal by adjustment of insulin dose. Improvement of glycemic control by adding sitagliptin was also confirmed by a significant reduction in GA and a concomitant increase in 1,5-AG during the study. The reduction in HbA1c in this study was comparable or greater than that in previous studies conducted in USA or Europe (0.5&#x02013;0.7%) despite the comparable baseline HbA1c level[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which was consistent with the previous report showing a greater glucose-lowering effect of DPP-4 inhibitors in Asians compared with Caucasians[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, in this study, we also examined the daily glycemic profile by assessing 7-point SMBG, and showed that adding sitagliptin to insulin significantly reduced the postprandial glucose level.</p><p>Vilsboll et al. have reported that adding sitagliptin to insulin increased the incidence of hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM [<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The improvement of glycemic control by adding sitagliptin without an increased incidence of hypoglycemia observed in this study might be due to difference in the study protocol. In this study, insulin dose was reduced if initial HbA1c level was less than 8%, and the concomitant use of insulin secretagogues was discontinued during the study. Although the attending physician was able to adjust insulin dose during the study, the daily insulin dose remained significantly lower in the Ins+Sita group compared with the Insulin group. Thus, our results suggest that reducing the insulin dose by up to 20% and discontinuing insulin secretagogues may prevent hypoglycemia when a DPP-4 inhibitor is added to insulin therapy. Hong et al. have also recently reported the efficacy and safety of adding sitagliptin in patients with T2DM whose HbA1c was poorly controlled with insulin[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Adding sitagliptin resulted in a 0.6% reduction in HbA1c without an increase in incidence of hypoglycemia compared with the control group in which insulin dose was up-titrated by 25% during the study.</p><p>Treatment satisfaction assessed by DTSQ was also improved in the Ins+Sita group, which was mainly derived from the improvement of patients&#x02019; satisfaction with controlling hyper- and hypoglycemia. On the other hand, there was no change in DiabMedSat. The reason for this inconsistency is unclear, but the results of the latter might be affected by ceiling effects[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Since there was no serious adverse event during the study, consistent with prior reports[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], our results proved that adding sitagliptin to insulin effectively and safely improves glycemic control and patients&#x02019; satisfaction in Japanese patients with T2DM. In addition, in this study, sitagliptin treatment showed some reduction in oxidative stress markers, which may also be favorable to prevent the development or progression of vascular complications, although a favorable effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcome remains to be established[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121988.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>To explore the mechanism by which sitagliptin improved glycemic control, MTT was also performed. As a result, MTT revealed that adding sitagliptin decreased postprandial glycemic excursion through enhancing postprandial insulin secretion. This change was accompanied by an increase in intact GLP-1 level after adding sitagliptin, confirming enhancement of incretin action. On the other hand, we did not observe a significant change in glucagon level after adding sitagliptin. It has been reported that DPP-4 inhibitors suppress glucagon level[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This inconsistency may be in part due to the inaccuracy of current methods of glucagon measurement[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It has been reported that GLP-1 suppresses glucagon secretion through enhancing insulin secretion[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Thus, the insufficient glucagon suppression observed in this study may have been due to marked beta cell dysfunction in our patients with diabetes duration of about 20 years, although it has also been reported that GLP-1 suppresses glucagon secretion through stimulating somatostatin secretion from delta cells[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we tried to explore the predictors of HbA1c reduction by adding sitagliptin. As a result, baseline HbA1c level was a strong predictor of HbA1c reduction, consistent with previous reports[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121988.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, baseline GA and 1,5-AG levels were more strongly correlated with HbA1c reduction by adding sitagliptin than with baseline HbA1c, and were also associated with HbA1c reduction in the Insulin group as well as in all patients, suggesting that baseline GA and 1,5-AG levels similarly or even more sensitively predict a reduction in HbA1c after intensification of treatment than does baseline HbA1c. Our study also revealed that baseline beta cell function and improvement of beta cell function during the study were also predictors of HbA1c reduction after adding sitagliptin. It has been reported that baseline beta cell function and its progressive decline are important predictors of future glycemic control in patients with T2DM[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Thus, these findings suggest that beta cell function as well as baseline HbA1c level is a major contributor to the glucose-lowering effect of sitagliptin added to insulin in Japanese patients with T2DM.</p><p>The small sample size and open-labeled design are limitations of this study. However, this study was conducted at a single institution and all attending physicians were specialists in diabetes, reflecting the &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; clinical practice setting. Treatment allocation was blinded to both the physicians and patients until day 0 to avoid selection bias, and both groups similarly received standard care during the study. In addition, half of the patients were also randomized to a control (Insulin) group; therefore, we believe that we could at least partly eliminate the effects of study enrollment by comparison to the control group. In this study, we did not use a strict algorithm for insulin titration during the study and the insulin dose was mainly adjusted by the attending physicians at each visit, also reflecting the &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; usual care setting. This may be the reason that the change in insulin dose in this study was relatively small. Recent studies have suggested that self-titration of insulin dose by patients based on their SMBG values resulted in better glycemic control compared with titration by physicians[<xref rid="pone.0121988.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0121988.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Thus, introducing self-titration of insulin dose by patients might have resulted in better glycemic control in this study, although this would have been the case in both groups. On the other hand, comprehensive assessments including MTT and treatment satisfaction in addition to other clinical outcomes were a strength of this study, which allowed us to better understand the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin added to insulin therapy.</p><p>In conclusion, adding sitagliptin to insulin reduced HbA1c level by 0.9% without weight gain or increase in hypoglycemia, and improved treatment satisfaction in Japanese patients with suboptimally controlled T2DM. Adding a DPP-4 inhibitor may be an option when the glycemic goal is not achieved by at least twice daily injection of insulin. Longer-term efficacy and safety should be tested in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec022"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121988.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121988.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121988.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Changes in body weight (a), insulin dose (b) and incidence of hypoglycemia (c) at each month during the study.</title><p>* <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 vs. insulin group.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0121988.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0121988.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Changes in triglycerides, free fatty acids, intact GLP-1, total GLP-1 and total GIP during MTT between 0 and 24 weeks in insulin group (a, c, e, g, i) and insulin plus sitagliptin group (b, d, f, h, j).</title><p>* <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 vs. baseline.
