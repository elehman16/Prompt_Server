humans are uncertain despite a growing body of literature.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>We investigated the influence of a Universal Mobile Telecommunications
System (UMTS) base station-like signal on well-being and cognitive performance
in subjects with and without self-reported sensitivity to RF

strength of 0, 1, or 10 V/m, incident with a polarization of 45&#x000b0; from
the left back side of the subject, weekly intervals) in a
randomized, double-blind crossover design. A total of 117 healthy subjects (33 self-reported
sensitive, 84 nonsensitive subjects) participated
in the study. We assessed well-being, perceived field strength, and
cognitive performance with questionnaires and cognitive tasks and conducted
statistical analyses using linear mixed models. Organ-specific

variation analysis was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In both groups, well-being and perceived field strength were not associated
with actual exposure levels. We observed no consistent condition-induced
changes in cognitive performance except for two marginal effects. At 10 V/m

adjustment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In contrast to a recent Dutch study, we could not confirm a short-term
effect of UMTS base station-like exposure on well-being. The reported
effects on brain functioning were marginal and may have occurred by chance. Peak

short-term effects of cell phone exposure or the effects of long-term
base station-like exposure on human health.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>base station</kwd><kwd>cognitive function</kwd><kwd>electromagnetic hypersensitivity</kwd><kwd>human exposure</kwd><kwd>mobile phones</kwd><kwd>RF EMF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>In 2003 a Dutch study on the effects of controlled exposure to mobile communication
system radio-frequency electromagnetic fields (RF EMF) at
base station intensities on human well-being and cognitive function was
published (<xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. 2003</xref>), hereafter called TNO study (TNO - Netherlands Organization for Applied
Scientific Research, Physics and Electronics Laboratory). Effects of
two systems were explored: the second-generation Global System for Mobile
Communication (GSM) widely used around the world, and its successor, the
Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), the third
generation of mobile networks. Two groups of subjects were investigated, consisting
of individuals with and without self-reported health complaints
attributed to daily life exposures to RF EMF. Although exposure
to GSM-like EMF had no effect at the time-averaged incident electric
field (E-field) strength of 0.7 V/m, UMTS-like exposure at an E-field
strength of 1 V/m reduced well-being in both groups. No consistent effects
on cognitive performance were found. The 3 dB difference of the
averaged incident fields was unlikely to have contributed to the different
outcome of GSM and UMTS exposure on well-being. The results were
hypothesized to be due to the different modulation schemes.</p><p>The TNO study was the first to investigate a base station-like exposure
and to indicate a reduction in well-being. Regarding the stronger but
much more localized exposure by mobile phone handsets, there is an abundant
yet controversial body of research on potential nonthermal effects
on humans. Data on well-being are inconclusive [<xref rid="b27-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al. 2006</xref>; for a review, see <xref rid="b28-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Seitz et al. (2005)</xref>], yet various studies identified subtle effects regarding changes
in brain activity or influences on cognitive function such as reaction
times, working memory, and attention (e.g., <xref rid="b2-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Curcio et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="b3-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Freude et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b8-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Huber et al. 2002</xref>, <xref rid="b9-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; <xref rid="b10-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Hyland 2000</xref>; <xref rid="b13-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Koivisto et al. 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="b15-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al. 2000a</xref>). Some of the reported changes (e.g., acceleration of response times in
certain cognitive tasks, altered oscillatory activity in the electroencephalogram
as a function of time and task), however, were inconsistent
and could not be replicated (<xref rid="b5-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Haarala et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b14-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b22-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Preece et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>An ongoing debate in RF EMF research and the general public concerns self-reported
electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) relating to persons
attributing subjective complaints of impaired well-being (e.g., headache, nausea, sleep
disturbances) to EMF exposure comprising radio frequency
as well as extremely low-frequency fields of domestic power supplies (e.g., <xref rid="b20-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b25-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">R&#x000f6;&#x000f6;sli et al. 2004</xref>). To date, no causal link has been found between exposure to mobile phones
and EHS symptoms [for a review, see <xref rid="b26-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al. (2005)</xref>], and objective criteria for EHS specification could not be established.</p><p>The persisting uncertainty associated with potential adverse health effects
of the new UMTS technology, together with its rapidly ongoing implementation, has
led to widespread public concern in many countries. We
designed the present experiment as a follow-up study to clarify the
reliability of the TNO study that was largely debated in the scientific
community. Meanwhile, additional follow-up studies have been initiated
in Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Japan (Andersen J, Challis L, Watanabe
S, personal communications). We used validated measuring instruments
and an improved setup yielding better uniformity of exposure, as
well as an additional E-field strength (10 V/m) to establish a dose&#x02013;response
relationship. Based on the results reported by <xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. (2003)</xref>, we hypothesized that exposure to UMTS-like radiation would attenuate
subjective well-being in both sensitive and nonsensitive subjects, possibly
in a dose-dependent manner, but would not affect cognitive performance.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods|subjects"><title>Study participants</title><p>We investigated the effects of UMTS-like EMF in subjects with self-reported
sensitivity to RF EMF (<italic>n</italic> = 37) and a reference group without complaints (<italic>n</italic> = 91). Because of noncompliance of three subjects and eight dropouts, the
final study group included <italic>n</italic> = 33 sensitive (14 males, 19 females) and <italic>n</italic> = 84 nonsensitive subjects (41 males, 43 females). Both groups
were recruited from the general public by advertisement in a local newspaper, by
flyers, and from databases of two previous studies with sensitive
participants willing to participate in future research projects. Because
of a lack of an operational tool for measuring sensitivity
to EMF (<xref rid="b30-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization 2005</xref>), criteria for recruitment were based on self-reported sensitivity to
RF EMF, that is, purported sensing of RF EMF or afflictions related to
RF EMF as emitted by mobile or cordless phones and antennas.</p><p>Subjects were contacted by telephone and preselected by a standardized
interview. Exclusion criteria comprised pacemakers, hearing aids, artificial
cochleas, regular consumption of narcotics or psychoactive drugs
in the previous 6 months, smoking, polymorbidity with respect to chronic
diseases, pregnancy, a medical history of head injuries and or neurologic/psychiatric
diseases, sleep disturbances, and an average consumption
of alcohol &#x0003e; 10 drinks/week or of caffeinated beverages amounting
to &#x0003e; 450 mg caffeine/day (e.g., approximately three cups of
coffee). We also excluded shift workers and persons undertaking long-haul
flights (&#x0003e; 3 hr time zone difference) within the last month before
the experiment.</p><p>On their first appointment, all subjects filled in a questionnaire to verify
the exclusion and matching criteria (age in decades, sex, and residential
area). The entire reference group was frequency matched to the
sensitive group, and a subgroup was 1:1 matched, also including body
mass index (BMI). Subjects were between 20 and 60 years of age (mean &#x000b1; SD, 37.7 &#x000b1; 10.9), right-handed (<xref rid="b21-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield 1971</xref>), and of normal body weight (BMI 19&#x02013;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). They gave their written informed consent and were reimbursed for participating. The
cantonal ethical committee of the Canton Z&#x000fc;rich
approved of the study protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design</title><p>We performed the study at the Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University
of Z&#x000fc;rich, between 1 February and 20 May 2005. It
consisted of three experimental sessions at 1-week intervals (&#x000b1; 1 day) that
were preceded by a training session 7 &#x000b1; 1 days ahead
and that were always scheduled at the same time of day (~ &#x000b1; 2 hr). Subjects
were evenly distributed across experimental period, weekdays, and
time of day. We asked them to abstain from any medication 24 hr
before each session and also requested them not to use a mobile
or cordless phone for 12 hr preceding the sessions.</p><p>Exposure was computer controlled providing double-blind conditions, which
we applied in a randomized crossover design. Before and after exposure, subjects
filled in the questionnaires in an office room and were
then escorted to the exposure chambers. Exposure took place in two identical
and specially adapted but separate rooms with constant temperature
and light conditions. We randomly assigned pairs of subjects to one
of six possible sequences of the three exposure conditions [0 (sham), 1, 10 V/m] but shifted the subjects in each pair by 20 min
to minimize contact between them. Each exposure session lasted 45 min, during
which subjects performed two series of cognitive tasks (sessions 1 and 2), starting at the beginning and after 22 min of exposure, respectively. Between sessions, subjects remained in front of the
computer and were allowed to read magazines.</p></sec><sec><title>Exposure and dosimetry</title><p>Each experimental room included an exposure area installed as a one-side-open
chamber shielded with RF radiation absorbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0114-001270">Figure 1</xref>). We placed the antenna (SPA 2000/80/8/0/V; Huber &#x00026; Suhner, Herisau, Switzerland) at 1.5 m
height and 2 m distance from the subjects, targeting
the left side of the body from behind, with a field incidence
angle of 25&#x000b0; with respect to the ear-to-ear vertical plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0114-001270">Figure 1</xref>). To produce the same polarization as in the TNO study, we tilted the
antenna and thus the E-field 45&#x000b0; from vertical. The antenna possessed
a &#x02013;3-dB beam width of approximately 75&#x000b0; in horizontal
and vertical directions, resulting in a uniform E-field distribution
in a manner similar to that of the far field of a base station. We
verified field uniformity before and after the experimental phase
by scanning the exposure area with a field probe. The UMTS signal format
was identical to the one used by <xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. (2003)</xref>, consisting of four control and synchronization channels (primary synchronization
channel, &#x02013;8.3 dB below total RF power; secondary synchronization
channel, 8.3 dB; primary common control physical channel, &#x02013;5.3 dB; common
pilot channel, &#x02013;3.3 dB) with a center
frequency of 2,140 MHz and chip rate of 3.84 microchips/sec. The signal, generated
by a commercial generator (E4433B Options 200, 201, UN8, UN9; Agilent
Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA), corresponded to a UMTS
base station frequency division duplex mode downlink configuration
with no active voice calls. Exposure was continuously monitored and regulated (three-axis
E-field probe). Each chamber was equipped with a
wooden table and chair, a flat-panel monitor with keyboard, a plastic
response box for the cognitive tasks, and the UMTS antenna with a field
probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ehp0114-001270">Figure 1</xref>). The web camera that recorded the subjects from top left (1 frame/sec) and
the computer hardware were outside the exposure chamber. The sum
of all magnetic fields (frequency range, 30 Hz&#x02013;400 kHz) was below 0.2 &#x003bc;T. We
measured background RF radiation levels (80 MHz&#x02013;4 GHz) before
and after the experiment, and they remained below 1 mV/m
over the whole exposure area.</p><p>We conducted numerical dosimetry according to <xref rid="b17-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Kuster and Sch&#x000f6;nborn (2000)</xref> using the finite-difference time-domain simulation platform Semcad X (SPEAG, Zurich, Switzerland) and three whole-body anatomical phantoms (two
male, one female). We treated reflections from furniture as uncertainty, reducing
the computational space to 2.6 &#x000d7; 1 &#x000d7; 1.8 m<sup>3</sup> (length &#x000d7; width &#x000d7; height). We modeled the floor as concrete (i.e., relative
permitivity of 7.5, and conductivity of 0.12 Siemens
per meter), whereas the walls and ceiling were modeled as perfectly
absorbing boundaries. The numerical discretization of the chamber was 5 &#x000d7; 5 &#x000d7; 5 mm<sup>3</sup>; of the human model, 2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 2 mm<sup>3</sup>; and of parts of the antenna, 1 &#x000d7; 0.5 &#x000d7; 1 mm<sup>3</sup>, resulting in approximately 335 million voxels.</p><p>The sources contributing to the absolute uncertainty of the average dosimetry
were <italic>a</italic>) antenna modeling; 0.1 dB (experimentally verified); <italic>b</italic>) deviation of incident field exposure with respect to the target field
including transfer calibration, sensor linearity, feedback control, and
reflections from furniture, 0.7 dB; and <italic>c</italic>) average anatomy, dielectric parameters, and discretizations. The variation
as a function of weight, sex, and position was assessed separately
by scaling the three phantoms in the range of our subjects (47&#x02013;110 kg; head
tissues were based on nonscaled phantoms) and by rotating
the phantoms &#x000b1; 25&#x000b0; around their axis. Because of
good uniformity of the field, we could neglect the effect of movement.</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>The short Questionnaire on Current Disposition (QCD) (<xref rid="b19-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ller and Basler 1993</xref>) measures subjective well-being within short test&#x02013;retest intervals
using six bipolar items (tense&#x02013;calm, apprehensive&#x02013;unperturbed, worried&#x02013;unconcerned, anxious&#x02013;relaxed, skeptical&#x02013;trusting, uneasy&#x02013;comfortable) and was applied
before and after each experimental condition. Outcomes of the QCD comprise
the difference between post-and preexperimental scores (QCD<sub>diff</sub>) as well as postexperimental scores (QCD<sub>post</sub>).</p><p>We used the modified Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (<xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. 2003</xref>), henceforth referred to as the TNO-Q, as a reference questionnaire for
comparison with the TNO study. The validated, original questionnaire
had been developed to estimate &#x0201c;quality of life&#x0201d; during
trials of an antihypertensive drug treatment (<xref rid="b1-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Bulpitt and Fletcher 1990</xref>) and was modified by <xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. (2003)</xref> by using a selection of 23 items separated in five subscales (anxiety, somatic
symptoms, inadequacy, depression, hostility).</p><p>We applied a self-designed Questionnaire to include Other Factors (QOF) potentially
related to well-being [sleep duration, quality of
previous night, suffering from a cold, amount of alcohol and caffeine
consumed and medication taken on the day of the experimental session, (pre-)menstrual
complaints, and stressful events]. Moreover, subjects
had to rate the perceived field strength of the same day&#x02019;s
exposure condition on a visual analogue scale ranging from &#x0201c;not
at all&#x0201d; (0) to &#x0201c;very strong&#x0201d; (100 mm). We
applied the TNO-Q and the QOF after each experimental condition. Completion
of all questionnaires took 5&#x02013;15 min.</p><p>One week before the training and 1 week after the last session, we applied
a paper version of the Bern Questionnaire on Well-being (BQW) (<xref rid="b4-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Grob 1995</xref>). It measures well-being over a few weeks [39 items separated
into two main scales (satisfaction, ill health)] and was used
to assess whether participation per se had an influence on well-being, regardless
of exposure.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive tasks</title><p>We investigated the effects of UMTS-like radiation on brain functioning
with the Simple Reaction Time Task (SRT) and Two-Choice Reaction Time
Task (CRT) (<xref rid="b13-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Koivisto et al. 2000b</xref>; <xref rid="b24-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Preece et al. 1998</xref>, <xref rid="b23-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>), the N-back Task (N-back) (<xref rid="b12-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Koivisto et al. 2000a</xref>), and the Visual Selective Attention Task (VSAT) adapted from <xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. (2003)</xref> and applied the tasks in fixed order (SRT, CRT, 1-, 2-, 3-back, VSAT). We
implemented the tasks using software from e-Prime (Psychology Software
Tools Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA). We instructed subjects to respond
as quickly and accurately as possible by using their right index (targets) and
middle (nontargets) finger. Completion of one series took 15&#x02013;20 min.</p><p>In the SRT, a &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; appeared on screen until the subjects
pressed the corresponding &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; button on the response
box. In the CRT, either &#x0201c;JA&#x0201d; (yes) or &#x0201c;NEIN&#x0201d; (no) was
shown, and subjects had to press the &#x0201c;J&#x0201d; (targets) and &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; button (nontargets).</p><p>In the N-back, single consonants were randomly presented. Subjects had
to compare each current letter with any letter presented one, two, or
three trials back (1-, 2-, 3-back, respectively) and press &#x0201c;J&#x0201d; for
same letters and &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; for different letters.</p><p>In the VSAT, a random combination of four letters and/or crosses in a square
was presented. The targets were &#x0201c;U&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;F&#x0201d; appearing
on the diagonal from upper left to lower right. Subjects
had to press &#x0201c;J&#x0201d; when one or both targets appeared
and &#x0201c;N&#x0201d; when no target was presented.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We used linear mixed models for statistical analyses (questionnaires: STATA 9.0, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA; cognitive tasks: SAS version 8.2; SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). With respect to reaction
times, we excluded individual outliers over all sessions according to
a robust rejection-estimation procedure (4 &#x000d7; median deviation) (<xref rid="b6-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Hampel 1985</xref>). We transformed reaction times (1/reaction time), which are referred
to as speed [1/sec; correct responses only], and checked
residuals for normal distribution.</p><p>We performed stratified analyses for the sensitive and nonsensitive groups
by using a random intercept model presuming an identical intraclass
correlation for all subjects. The base model included the factor condition (sham, 1, 10 V/m) and week (1, 2, 3) to account for possible order
effects. The model for cognitive data also contained session (session 1, session 2) as
a factor and corresponding interaction effects. We
modeled condition as a continuous variable to test for a dose&#x02013;response
relationship and assessed differences between groups with an
overall model including the factor sensitivity and a sensitivity &#x000d7; condition
interaction. We evaluated the robustness of results by
adjusting the model for potential confounding factors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0114-001270">Tables 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp0114-001270">2</xref>).</p><p>We used the percentage of correct answers in the CRT, 1-, 2-, 3-back and
VSAT as a measure of accuracy. Except for the 3-back data, residuals
were not normally distributed, and differences were assessed using non-parametric
Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We performed comparisons of 1 V/m
versus sham and 10 V/m versus sham for session 1, session 2, and
the difference between the two sessions. The resulting <italic>p</italic>-values were adjusted for multiple testing (six tests) according to Bonferroni-Holm (<xref rid="b7-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Holm 1979</xref>).</p><p>To generally control for multiple testing, we performed a multiple end

With respect to the six items in the QCD and the five subscales of the
TNO-Q, we found no significant exposure&#x02013;response associations
in any of the two groups. Regardless of the actual condition, sensitive
subjects generally reported more health problems, particularly in
the TNO-Q. Neither group showed a relationship between perceived field
intensity and true exposure status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ehp0114-001270">Table 1</xref>). Sensitive subjects indicated higher field strengths in all conditions (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), even though score values were not associated with exposure
levels. Seventeen of 31 sensitive subjects had a positive correlation
between perceived and real field intensity, and 13 had a negative correlation (nonsensitive
group, 22 and 27 of 57 subjects, respectively), which
can be expected by chance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-ehp0114-001270">Table 3</xref>). Regardless of exposure condition, perceived field intensity was positively
correlated with impaired well-being in 68% of sensitive (QCD<sub>diff</sub>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.043) and 64% of nonsensitive (<italic>p</italic> = 0.001) subjects. Similar results were found with respect to
the QCD<sub>post</sub> and the TNO-Q (data not shown).</p><p>In the BQW, comparison of scores 1-week before and after study participation
showed no significant changes for satisfaction and ill health in

SRT, 1-, 2-, 3-back and VSAT. In the CRT, speed decreased in the sensitive
group from session 1 to session 2 in the sham and 1 V/m condition (~ 20 msec) but
not in the 10 V/m condition (condition &#x000d7; session, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp0114-001270">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, we observed a decrease in speed between sessions irrespective
of exposure condition in the nonsensitive group (<italic>p</italic> = 0.254; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-ehp0114-001270">Table 2</xref>). A mixed-model analysis of variance including the factor sensitivity (sensitive, non-sensitive) corroborated the observed differences between

in any of the cognitive tasks except the 1-back task in the nonsensitive

values were at least 100 times below recommended safety limits (<xref rid="b11-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection 1998</xref>). Compared with use of a mobile phone at the ear or exposure levels used

lower at 10 V/m in our study. SAR values for head tissues and left&#x02013;right

angle and polarization at the same field strength will lead to
considerable changes of the SAR values in different parts of the body.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In contrast to our hypothesis, well-being as assessed by the QCD and TNO-Q
questionnaires was not affected by UMTS radiation, either in the 1 V/m
or in the 10 V/m condition. Even though sensitive subjects generally
reported more health problems, we found no difference overall between
the two groups with respect to the applied field conditions. Similarly, cognitive
performance was not affected except for two separate and
marginal effects in the 10 V/m condition. In the CRT we could not observe
a slight decrease in speed across sessions in sensitive subjects
as observed in the 0 V/m and the 1 V/m condition, and in the 1-back
task accuracy was reduced in nonsensitive subjects compared to the sham
condition.</p><p>Cognitive tasks with moderate to high workload frequently have been used
as a tool to assess RF EMF effects on brain physiology by measuring
simple motor responses requiring selective attention and higher cognitive
functions such as working memory (e.g., <xref rid="b16-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Krause et al. 2000b</xref>). Except for the VSAT, which was taken from the TNO battery of cognitive
tasks for follow-up reasons, we chose the SRT, CRT, and N-back on the
basis of recently published work attempting to assess EMF-induced changes
with respect to brain physiology (<xref rid="b12-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Koivisto et al. 2000a</xref>, <xref rid="b13-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">2000b</xref>; <xref rid="b23-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Preece et al. 1999</xref>). However, the described effects showed no consistent picture and could
not be replicated (<xref rid="b5-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Haarala et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="b22-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Preece et al. 2005</xref>).</p><p>In general, exposure in these studies was poorly defined, and the inconsistencies
in cognitive outcome may be due to differences in the design, blinding, study
population, and sample size, thus preventing a comparison
of the results. Alternatively, cognitive tasks used so far may
not be sensitive enough to reliably measure potential RF EMF effects on
brain functioning, leading to a masking of existing effects or resulting
in significant effects of tests that stochastically respond to RF
EMF. Moreover, statistical analysis of several tests increases the risk
of false-positive findings.</p><p>In the present study, speed was affected in the sensitive group in one
of six cognitive tasks and accuracy in the nonsensitive group in one of
five tasks. Although we cannot exclude an actual condition &#x000d7; session
interaction in the CRT in sensitive subjects and, similarly, a
condition effect in the 1-back task in nonsensitive subjects, the findings
seem to be coincidental because they did not reach significance
after multiple end point adjustment.</p><p>Both the sensitive and the nonsensitive groups were unable to identify
the applied fields better than expected by chance. Because we investigated
only three conditions per subject, the likelihood of correct field
rating by chance was relatively high. The observed distribution of 39 individuals
with a positive correlation between the applied and estimated
exposure conditions and 40 individuals with a negative correlation
was likely to be expected by chance. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude
that among these subjects a minority was actually able to perceive the
applied exposure. The identification of such individuals has failed
in several provocation studies so far (reviewed by <xref rid="b26-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et al. 2005</xref>) and would require a multiple testing approach to reduce the likelihood
of a correct rating by chance. Perceived field strength correlated with
an impairment of current well-being in both groups irrespective of
exposure condition. Also, sensitive subjects rated perceived field strengths
higher than did nonsensitive subjects, yet ratings in both groups
were not better than expected by chance and not associated with exposure
levels. This indicates that sensitive subjects overestimate their
ability to better perceive RF EMF than does the general public (<xref rid="b18-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Leitgeb and Schr&#x000f6;ttner 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our results differ with respect to both well-being and cognitive performance
from the results reported by <xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. (2003)</xref>. The TNO-Q is an adapted and not validated version of the original questionnaire (<xref rid="b1-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Bulpitt and Fletcher 1990</xref>) and was not designed for short retest intervals. Our findings were corroborated
by the results of the QCD, a standardized questionnaire that
more reliably measures changes in well-being over short test&#x02013;retest
intervals (<xref rid="b19-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">M&#x000fc;ller and Basler 1993</xref>). Contrary to the TNO study, we found no significant effect on speed in
the VSAT. It was, however, the only task applied in both studies; all
other cognitive tasks were distinct. <xref rid="b31-ehp0114-001270" ref-type="bibr">Zwamborn et al. (2003)</xref> found other effects with respect to cognitive tasks and exposure conditions (GSM
and UMTS), and we also report an effect on speed in one of
six tasks and an effect on accuracy in one of five tasks used. No clear
picture, therefore, emerges across the two studies showing reproducible
effects of exposure condition or cognitive task.</p><p>A number of other factors may contribute more generally to the discrepancies
between the TNO study and our study. Sample sizes differ substantially (sensitive
subjects, 24 vs. 33; nonsensitive subjects, 24 vs. 84). Our
reference group was frequency matched to the sensitive group, and
a subgroup was 1:1 matched with respect to sex, age, residential area, and
BMI. In the TNO study, all conditions in a particular subject
were carried out on a single day, whereas we investigated the subjects
at the same time of day in weekly intervals to rule out possible circadian
and carryover effects. We further controlled circadian influences
by a uniform distribution of experimental sessions across the time
of day. Carryover effects may lead to an accumulation of RF EMF radiation
over time, thus falsifying potential effects of discrete conditions. Furthermore, inclusion
of an additional E-field strength of 10 V/m
is likely to have contributed to a more reliable assessment of RF EMF
effects.</p><p>Technical improvements necessitated the modification of the exposure setup
used in the TNO study to achieve a more uniform and reproducible base
station-like exposure. Although the signal (carrier frequency and
modulation) and the angle of incidence were identical, the spatial incident
field distribution was less uniform in the TNO study, where a narrow
exposure beam of only 5&#x000b0; width was used, resulting in a larger
variation because of differences in height and position of the subjects. In
addition, the whole-body exposure conditions applied in this
study correspond better to a base-station exposure scenario. However, exposure
of head tissues was equivalent in both studies, even though
we had a smaller intersubject variability. Further insights regarding
the discrepancies between the present and the Dutch study might be gained
from other follow-up studies under way in Denmark, the United Kingdom, and
Japan, which are also investigating the effect of UMTS base
station-like radiation on well-being and cognitive function (Andersen
J, Challis L, Watanabe S, personal communications).</p><p>In summary, we found no causal relationship between RF EMF and a decrease
in well-being or adverse health effects under the given exposure conditions
but cannot exclude an effect of UMTS-like EMF on brain functioning. The
described effects were weak and not consistent in the two groups
of sensitive and nonsensitive subjects. Regarding the implications
for public health because of widespread exposure in the living environment, no
conclusions about long-term effects of UMTS base station-like
EMF can be drawn from the present study, since only a short-term exposure
was applied.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>We thank N. Burgermeister and E. Honegger for help with the experiment, D. Sp&#x000e4;t
