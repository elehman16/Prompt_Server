HBV contributes directly to the increased risk of liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A linear dose&#x02013;response relationship exists between the concentration of HBV DNA in serum and the risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC in this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]<italic>.</italic> Suppressing replication of HBV with nucleoside analogues reduces morbidity and mortality in patients with CHB and advanced hepatic fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The goal of therapy for CHB, therefore, is a rapid and sustained reduction of the serum HBV DNA to the lowest possible level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Durable suppression of HBV DNA replication, in turn, results in histologic improvement, normalization of ALT, and in some patients with HBeAg(+) infection, seroconversion to an anti-HBe state.</p><p>The emergence of resistant viral strains is an important consideration when selecting a nucleoside analogue. The very large pool of HBV in circulation, the rapid turnover rate, and the high error rate in HBV replication mean that any potential mutant, including those that give rise to drug resistance, may be present in a patient before he or she starts therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The emergence of lamivudine resistance before and during therapy limits the usefulness of this drug. The prevalence of lamivudine genotypic resistance is reported to be 24, 42, and 70% after 1, 2, and 4&#x000a0;years of continuous treatment, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An adefovir phase III trial in HBeAg(&#x02212;) patients reports cumulative probabilities of genotypic resistance to adefovir at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5&#x000a0;years of 0, 3, 11, 19, and 30%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Telbivudine selects for mutations in the YMDD motif and, although it is associated with lower resistance than lamivudine, recently reported virologic breakthrough due to resistance substitutions was 21.6% and 8.6% in HBeAg(+) and HBeAg(&#x02212;) patients after 2&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The lowest reported rates of resistance after 5&#x000a0;years of treatment have been obtained with entecavir (&#x0003c;1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Entecavir, a potent guanosine analogue, significantly increased survival in an animal model of chronic HBV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Entecavir (0.5&#x000a0;mg/day for nucleoside-na&#x000ef;ve patients or 1&#x000a0;mg/day for lamivudine-refractory patients) produced significant virologic, histologic, and biochemical improvement in a series of large randomized multicenter phase III trials that encompassed a broad spectrum of clinical situations, including nucleoside-na&#x000ef;ve patients with HBeAg(+) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and HBeAg(&#x02212;) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and treatment-experienced patients with lamivudine-refractory HBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In nucleoside-naive patients, entecavir was superior to lamivudine (100&#x000a0;mg/day) for histologic, virologic, and biochemical outcomes, and entecavir resistance after 1&#x000a0;year of treatment was rare (&#x0003c;1%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Long-term follow-up demonstrates that suppression of HBV DNA replication is maintained throughout 2 and even 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;years of treatment with entecavir and that the rate of resistance is less than 1% after 4&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of entecavir have also been studied in nucleoside-na&#x000ef;ve Chinese patients with CHB, 76% of whom had HBV DNA&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;300 copies/ml by PCR assay after 48&#x000a0;weeks of treatment (vs. 43% with lamivudine, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

The protocol-defined management of patients after week 52 was based on the HBV DNA level as determined by Quantiplex&#x02122; bDNA assay (approved assay at the time of protocol development), HBeAg status, and serum ALT level at week 48.

The results presented here confirm and extend the original 48-week findings, presenting follow-up data for (1) patients who achieved a <italic>consolidated response</italic> and discontinued therapy; (2) patients who were <italic>partial responders</italic> and continued in year 2; and (3) an additional analysis evaluating cumulative confirmed responses. Patients who continued or discontinued treatment in year 2 were dependent on response achieved in year 1 and had varied response for each drug. Therefore, no statistical analysis is presented for treatment arms of either cohorts, and results for this cohort are descriptive of what happened to patients who continue or discontinue treatment during the second year.</p><p>Among the year 2 cohort, suppression of HBV replication was maintained among patients treated with entecavir but waned in those treated with lamivudine. The proportion of patients with HBV DNA &#x0003c;300&#x000a0;copies/ml by PCR after 48&#x000a0;weeks and at EOD with entecavir was 76% and 74%, respectively, but 52% and 41%, respectively, among those treated with lamivudine.</p><p>This same pattern is apparent in the rate of ALT normalization in the year 2 cohort.

These cumulative end points were achieved in 46% and 92% of patients who initiated treatment with lamivudine.</p><p>Overall, 240 of 258 (93%) patients who initiated treatment with entecavir had a <italic>consolidated</italic> or <italic>partial response</italic> through 96&#x000a0;weeks of follow-up. In contrast, 139 of 261 (53%) patients who initiated treatment with lamivudine had a <italic>consolidated</italic> or <italic>partial response</italic> during the study. It is important to comment that the protocol-defined management criteria used in this study (undetectable HBV DNA by bDNA assay and HBeAg loss [instead of seroconversion]) were selected more than 5&#x000a0;years ago and no longer reflect current practice. Therefore, it is possible that off-treatment results may underestimate the durability of responses that would be observed in patients who had achieved undetectable HBV DNA by PCR and had instead a consolidated HBe seroconversion.</p><p>Another limitation is that this population was not analyzed for the lamivudine resistance genotype, which may explain the lamivudine results. However, nucleoside-na&#x000ef;ve patients have been shown to possess less resistance to entecavir than lamivudine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This may be the product of the rapid, maintained suppression of HBV replication with entecavir, combined with a requirement for multiple substitutions in nucleoside-na&#x000ef;ve patients.</p><p>These data compare well with that obtained in two large randomized international phase III trials in patients with CHB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], both of which had similar inclusion and exclusion criteria and management protocols to that of the present study. Among HBeAg(+) patients, 67% of entecavir recipients and 36% of lamivudine recipients had HBV DNA &#x0003c;300&#x000a0;copies/ml after 52&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Patients with a virologic response (&#x0003c;0.7&#x000a0;MEq/ml), who remained HBeAg(+) after 1&#x000a0;year (i.e., partial responders), were eligible to continue therapy for a second year. Through 96&#x000a0;weeks, the cumulative proportion of patients with HBV DNA &#x0003c;300&#x000a0;copies/ml was 80% in those treated with entecavir and 39% in those treated with lamivudine (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

At week 48, mean HBV DNA changes from baseline were &#x02212;7.28 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml for entecavir as compared with &#x02212;5.08 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml for adefovir (difference [95% CI]: &#x02212;1.86 [&#x02212;2.69, &#x02212;1.03]), and 58% of entecavir-treated patients as compared with 19% of adefovir-treated patients achieved undetectable HBV DNA (&#x0003c;300 copies/ml) by PCR at week 48 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>The short-term differences in potency between entecavir and adefovir would be expected to translate into long-term differences in clinical efficacy, although these two drugs have not been directly compared in a large, long-term study. The mean reduction in HBV DNA at EOD with entecavir in the present study was &#x02212;6.04 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml. In a separate study, the corresponding decrease in HBV DNA after 2&#x000a0;years of treatment with adefovir in HBeAg(&#x02212;) patients was &#x02212;3.47 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. These data from different studies must be interpreted with caution, but suggest that entecavir provides more profound long-term suppression of HBV DNA replication. If this is the case, then entecavir may be preferred over adefovir as a first-line treatment option for CHB.</p><p>Treatment was well tolerated throughout 2&#x000a0;years of therapy, with no substantial differences between entecavir and lamivudine. Fewer ALT flares (on- and off-treatment) were observed with entecavir than with lamivudine. Most ALT flares during treatment with entecavir were associated with reductions in HBV DNA. In contrast, 44% of those that occurred with use of lamivudine were associated with increased HBV DNA.</p><p>In conclusion, entecavir provides profound suppression of HBV replication that is durable for a period of at least 2&#x000a0;years in nucleoside-na&#x000ef;ve Chinese patients with CHB. In contrast, the efficacy of lamivudine was shown to wane over time. Among those treated with entecavir, the proportion of patients with a <italic>consolidated response</italic> actually increased in year 2 of treatment. The results of this study confirm and extend the findings of the phase III clinical trial program that has demonstrated superior virologic and biochemical efficacy with entecavir than with lamivudine. Available data suggest that entecavir is a preferred first-line nucleoside analogue for CHB.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>This study was supported by a research grant from Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schiff</surname><given-names>ER</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevention of mortality from hepatitis B and hepatitis C</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2006</year><volume>368</volume><fpage>896</fpage><lpage>897</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69347-1</pub-id></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Schiff ER.
