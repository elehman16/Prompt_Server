Following injection of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, higher <italic>C<sub>max</sub></italic>, longer <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and T<sub>max</sub> in comparison with rhGH indicated the prolonged presence of GH in the circulation (data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-10-013">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PD changes</title><p>The IGF-1 response after once-daily injections of rhGH and once-weekly injections of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-10-013">Figure 2</xref>). After dosing with rhGH, the serum IGF-1 level rose gradually and reached a steady-state concentration (157.4&#x000b1;65.5 ng/mL) after the third dose. The accumulated increase in the IGF-1 AUC by the seventh dose of rhGH was 16,834.6&#x000b1;6,732.1 ng&#x000b7;h/ mL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-10-013">Table 2</xref>). After the first dose of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, the serum IGF-1 level climbed steadily and reached a peak concentration at 230.4&#x000b1;65.1 ng/mL after 2 days, and this elevation lasted for 7 days. The serum concentration of IGF-1 (114.2&#x000b1;43.9 ng/mL) remained greater than the baseline concentration 7 days after the first injection, suggesting that the biological effect of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was maintained for at least 7 days in children with GHD. The increment in the IGF-1 AUC from baseline after the first dose of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was 21,973.9&#x000b1;5,886.9 ng&#x000b7;h/mL, while the increment after the sixth dose of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was 18,641.7&#x000b1;4,783.0 ng&#x000b7;h/mL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-10-013">Table 2</xref>).

These results indicated that the PD profiles of weekly Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administration and daily rhGH were comparable.</p><p>Serum IGFBP-3 concentrations after administration of rhGH and Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-dddt-10-013">Figure 3</xref>. After dosing with rhGH, the serum IGFBP-3 level increased gradually and reached a steady state after the fourth dose.

After the first dose of Jin-trolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, the serum IGFBP-3 level rose steadily, reached a peak (3,948&#x000b1;788 ng/mL) after 5 days, and then gradually declined. Consistent with the changes in IGF-1, the concentration of IGFBP-3 remained greater than the baseline concentration 7 days after the first injection, indicating that the biological effect of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was maintained for at least 7 days in children with GHD. The increase in the IGFBP-3 AUC after the first dose of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was 239,726&#x000b1;86,217 ng&#x000b7;h/mL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-10-013">Table 3</xref>). The IGFBP-3 AUC after 7 days of rhGH daily injections and after the first week injection of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was not significantly different (<italic>P</italic>=0.133). However, the increase in IGFBP-3 after the sixth weekly administration of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was significantly lower than that after the first weekly administration (<italic>P</italic>=0.004), which might be attributed to the significantly higher IGFBP-3 concentration before the sixth dose of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in comparison with that before the first administration. These results likely indicated that IGFBP-3 reached a saturated state after multiple doses of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Laboratory tests were performed before compound administration and after six doses of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>.

IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 increased slowly following the peak concentration of rhGH in a manner independent of the pulsatile nature of GH secretion.<xref rid="b20-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> A study performed by Jorgensen et al showed that continuous infusion of GH and small, but frequent, intravenous boluses (resembling endogenous GH secretion) was equally effective in generating an increase in IGF-1 in GHD human subjects, whereas administration of the same amount of GH as two large boluses every day resulted in a significantly smaller rise in serum IGF-1.<xref rid="b1-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This study indicates that continuous infusion of GH better resembles the biological effects of GH pulses in comparison with intermittent administration of short-acting GH (two injections per day). Another study compared the metabolic effects of GH after continuous and intermittent sc delivery<xref rid="b6-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and found that serum levels of IGF-1 tended to increase in the patients switched to continuous infusion in comparison with that of the patients who received daily injections, but the difference was not significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.34). Our PD study produced similar results, and the difference in the accumulated increase in the IGF-1 AUC for 7 days of rhGH injection and the first and the sixth weekly administration of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was not significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.059 and <italic>P</italic>=0.456, respectively), indicating that weekly Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administration and daily rhGH administration had comparable PD profiles. Nevertheless, after the first weekly dose of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, the increase in the IGF-1 AUC tended to be higher than the accumulated increase after 7 days of rhGH injection (<italic>P</italic>=0.059). We concluded that the long-acting GH formulation Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> produced effects that better resembled the biological effects of GH pulse release in comparison with daily GH injections, for three reasons. First, Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> produced a stable GH concentration within the physiological range, resembling continuous intravenous infusion. Second, continuous infusion of GH produced effects that resembled the biological consequences of pulsatile GH secretion by generating a higher level of IGF-1 in comparison with that produced by a regimen of two injections per day.<xref rid="b1-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Third, this study showed that the increase in IGF-1 content from baseline tended to be higher than the corresponding increase produced after rhGH injection.</p><p>Injection site pain was the most frequently reported treatment-related adverse event after administration of long-acting GH encapsulated in microspheres.<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b21-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In a pilot study of the once-weekly PEGylated GH formulation PHA-794428 in GH-deficient adults, PEG-GH was associated with an increased risk of developing lipoatrophy at the injection site.<xref rid="b22-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, there were no signs of injection-site reactions or lipoatrophy in any subject during the current trial.</p><p>Laboratory studies documented a significant increase in serum alkaline phosphatase after Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment. Serum alkaline phosphatase serves as a useful marker for bone formation and a potential predictor of the effectiveness of GH therapy.<xref rid="b23-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> The elevated serum alkaline phosphatase level observed in this study reflected increased osteoblast activity following accelerated bone growth. A previous study showed that total cholesterol and LDL levels in children with GHD were higher than those of control patients.<xref rid="b24-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> In the current trial, Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment improved lipid profiles in children with GHD by reducing total cholesterol and LDL levels, which was consistent with other reports.<xref rid="b24-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In this study, the serum TT4 level was below the normal range in four patients. Decreased serum TT4 may be due to increased conversion of T4 to T3 as a consequence of compensatory augmentation of 5&#x02032;-deiodinase in order to meet the demands of rapid growth.<xref rid="b26-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Short-term Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> treatment did not exert an unfavorable effect on glucose metabolism in this trial.</p><p>Administration of PEGylated proteins to animals has been associated with cellular vacuolation in macrophages in some cases.<xref rid="b27-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Following long-term, high-dose PEGylated protein exposure, vacuolated macrophages appear in some organs, including the liver, kidney, urinary bladder, and brain choroid plexus (CP). Vacuolation of macrophages is generally considered a normal physiological response that removes foreign bodies via scavenger phagocytes, with no obvious effects on cell function or viability.<xref rid="b29-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, distortion of vacuoles might compress nuclei and thereby potentially influence cellular functions, and in the case of the CP, this change could result in decreased production of cerebrospinal fluid. Unfortunately, whereas liver and renal function can be monitored, there are no clinical markers of CP function. In addition, while some PEGylated proteins have been used for a long term in pediatric patients, it is currently uncertain whether this patient group is more sensitive than adults to the effects of PEGylated proteins on the CP.<xref rid="b30-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>In our previous long-term study of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> toxicity in cynomolgus monkeys and juvenile rats, we performed hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue sections of 39 organs from all animals that received Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. We did not observe tissue or organ vacu olation in cynomolgus monkeys that received Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for 6 months (with rhGH at a maximum dose of 6 mg/kg/w) or in juvenile rats that received Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for 13 weeks (with rhGH at a maximum dose of 45 mg/kg/w). Monthly PEG exposure in cynomolgus monkeys was calculated to be 1.09 &#x000b5;mol/ kg/month.</p><p>PEG vacuolation within CP ependymal cells has been observed only when the following conditions were fulfilled: 1) the subjects were cynomolgus monkeys; 2) the PEG moiety size was at least 40 kDa; 3) the study duration was at least 6 weeks; and 4) monthly PEG exposure was at least 0.4 &#x000b5;mol/kg/month (PEGylated rhGH). Our toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys fulfilled the above-mentioned four conditions; however, we did not observe tissue vacuolation for reasons that could not be explained. It is likely that differences in PEG structure could play a role in PEG vacuolation. In Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a 40 kDa branched PEG is conjugated to rhGH instead of a linear PEG. The advantage of this branched PEG residue is that it may slowly release one of the two PEG lysine-linked chains by cleavage of the carbamate linkage between polymer chains and the branching unit, thus expediting its clearance from the body. The ease with which polymer chains in branched PEGs are cleaved may play an important role in their removal from the body.<xref rid="b31-dddt-10-013" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Further long-term toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys must be undertaken to explore this safety issue of PEGylated proteins.</p><p>In this study, we compared the PK and PD profiles of a long-acting GH formulation after multiple doses of daily rhGH in prepubertal children with GHD. The elimination rate of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was slower than that of rhGH injected daily. IGF-1 increased following a single administration of Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, and this increase lasted for 7 days, suggesting a profile suitable for once-weekly treatment. No accumulation of GH was observed with continued Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administration. The changes in IGF-1 produced by daily GH and Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were comparable. Importantly, multiple Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> administrations appeared to be safe and were well tolerated, and no injection-site reactions were observed. Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> offers a feasible option for patients receiving daily GH and is a suitable candidate for long-term treatment in children with GHD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-dddt-10-013"><table-wrap id="ts1-dddt-10-013" position="float"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Pharmacokinetic parameters for rhGH and Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in healthy adults</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2" valign="top" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1">Jintrolong<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (mg/kg/w)
