No formal neurocognitive testing was included in trials. The trials included in the analysis did not employ a screening tool for evaluating cognitive impairment, and there were no selection criteria related to concomitant medications or cognitive status that may affect cognition. Patients who prematurely discontinued study treatment were followed up where possible for at least 10&#x02009;weeks or until recovery or stabilization of any TEAEs. All TEAEs were recorded, regardless of their severity or potential relationship to alirocumab. Severity of neurocognitive events was determined by investigators.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analysed in two pools according to the control used in the trials (placebo or ezetimibe) and also in an overall pool of all studies. Event rates were calculated by dividing the number of patients by the duration of exposure (in 100 patient-years). To compare treatment groups in the placebo and in the ezetimibe pools, the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) levels were calculated using a Cox model stratified in the study. Event rates were also calculated in patients treated with alirocumab who had two consecutive LDL-C levels &#x0003c;25&#x02009;mg/dL (&#x0003c;0.65&#x02009;mmol/L) separated by at least 21&#x02009;days, with HR and 95% CI calculated using a Cox model stratified on the propensity score to achieve LDL-C &#x0003c;25&#x02009;mg/dL (quintile) and including the covariate for two consecutive LDL-C &#x0003c;25&#x02009;mg/dL (yes/no) as fixed effect and study as random effect. Further details on the propensity score analysis are given in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary material online</xref>. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves are presented for each pool to describe the cumulative incidence of neurocognitive events. An analysis was also performed by age group (&#x0003c;65, &#x02265;65 to &#x0003c;75, and &#x02265;75&#x02009;years). Average percentage and absolute LDL-C reductions during treatment were determined for patients with and without neurocognitive TEAEs from the area under the curve and taking into account all LDL-C levels to the end of treatment period or occurrence of a neurocognitive TEAE, whichever came first. Previous reports have suggested an association between low HDL-C and memory decline;<xref rid="ehx661-B22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ehx661-B23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> hence, neurocognitive TEAEs were also analysed by baseline HDL-C levels (<italic>post hoc</italic> analysis).

One of the placebo-treated patients who discontinued had dementia of unknown origin (classified as moderate in severity), whereas the other had delirium (classified as moderate) and dementia (classified as severe and leading to death). In the ezetimibe-controlled pool, neurocognitive events led to discontinuation in one patient in the alirocumab group (0.1%; memory impairment, classified as mild) and three (0.5%) patients in the ezetimibe group (disturbance in attention, mild; transient global amnesia, moderate; and confusional state, moderate).

Also, it is acknowledged that the overall number of neurocognitive events observed in alirocumab trials to date is too small to draw definitive conclusions. Due to the small number of neurocognitive events and the relatively small number of patients in this study, the CIs for the HRs are wide and do not exclude HRs&#x02009;&#x0003e;2. A study of a greater dimension in terms of number of events and patients would permit more precise estimations of the HRs of neurocognitive events in alirocumab vs. control. Moreover, the statistical analysis did not explicitly take into consideration the competing risk of death. However, the incidence of death was low and similar between alirocumab and control arms (alirocumab vs. placebo: 15 (0.6%) vs. 9 (0.7%), alirocumab vs. ezetimibe: 6 (0.7%) vs. 6 (1.0%); number and percentage of patients who died prior to any neurocognitive event as per sponsor CMQ; results were similar with the FDA CMQ). The effect of alirocumab on neurocognitive events will require further investigation in the ongoing large cardiovascular outcomes trial of alirocumab (ODYSSEY OUTCOMES; NCT01663402). Results from a recent outcomes trial of a different PCSK9 inhibitor (&#x0003e;27&#x000a0;000 patients) showed no significant difference between evolocumab and placebo in terms of physician-reported neurocognitive events, although mean follow-up was limited (2.2&#x02009;years).<xref rid="ehx661-B31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref></p><p>No dedicated tool was used to assess neurocognitive TEAEs; all were patient reported. However, although formal neuropsychological testing with well-validated tests have been shown to detect small differenes in performance on a group-mean basis, in some instances, only fairly large changes in cognitive performance on the part of individual changes can be reliably detected. For example, Woods <italic>et al.</italic><xref rid="ehx661-B32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> found that a minimum of 50% change in recall memory performance was required to meet the criteria for being a reliable change in an individual patient. Such a large change on the part of an individual seems unlikely to go undetected by clinical observation and would likely be noticed and self-reported by patients as in the current analysis.</p><p>No specific survey was used for assessment and severity was not assessed using a validated scale. The study designs did not capture or screen for neurocognitive deficits at entry; neurocognitive decline was not assessed during the studies and the use of concomitant medications that could influence neurocognitive state was not a prespecified analysis in any of the studies.</p><p>In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, a Neurocognitive Expert Panel Charter has been established to review in a blinded manner all neurocognitive TEAEs and to explore possible aetiology. Furthermore, a dedicated study of neurocognitive events using formal testing and comparing alirocumab with placebo over 2&#x02009;years is now under way (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02957682).

However, further monitoring in long-term outcomes studies is needed, with specific assessment of any effect on cognition over a longer period and consideration given to potential contributing factors such as concomitant medication and comorbid conditions. A further study is now under way to specifically evaluate neurocognitive function and neurocognitive TEAEs occurring with longer term exposure to alirocumab, using formal testing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary material</title><p>
