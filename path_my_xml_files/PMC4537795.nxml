Furthermore, we wished to explore attitudes towards feedback and simulator training among medical students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Sixteen medical students were included in the study and randomized to laparoscopic simulator training with or without feedback. A teacher provided individualized feedback continuously throughout the procedures to the target group. Validated questionnaires and scales were used to evaluate self-efficacy and flow.

Qualitative data was collected by group interviews and interpreted using inductive thematic analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Sixteen students completed the simulator training and questionnaires. Instrument path length was shorter in the feedback group (median 3.9 m; IQR: 3.3-4.9) as com-pared to the control group (median 5.9 m; IQR: 5.0-8.1), p&#x0003c;0.05. Self-efficacy improved in both groups. Eleven students participated in the focus interviews. Participants in the control group expressed that they had fun, whereas participants in the feedback group were more concentrated on the task and also more anxious. Both groups had high ambitions to succeed and also expressed the importance of getting feedback. The authenticity of the training scenario was important for the learning process.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study highlights the importance of individualized feedback during simulated laparoscopy training.

Finding a balance between doctors' training and patients' safety demands a structured, and preferably evidence-based, approach to surgical education. Such an approach needs, among other things, to include; training of technical skills, continuous assessment of skills and also attention to non-technical skills.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> The learning environment can facilitate or obstruct the learning process by influencing these factors.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref></p><p>Education of surgeons is rooted in apprenticeship methods developed over a century ago, as originally championed by William Halsted in 1904.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The Halsted "<italic>see one, do one, teach one"</italic> surgical training method is, however, associated with unacceptable cost from a patient safety perspective. Although this approach has fostered excellent surgeons, we can suspect that some of this excellence came at the expense of the patients. There is now ample evidence to suggest that more structured training programs can, in fact, enhance patient safety.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The teacher, not the least, may have a profound influence on the learning process.<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> Teachers' skills, assessment of skills and feedback are factors that influence the learning process and therefore the education.<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>In gynecology and general surgery, the laparoscopic approach is nowadays the first choice in the majority of, at least benign, abdominal procedures. This development has been driven by the lesser surgical trauma inflicted on the patients, faster post-operative recovery, shorter absence from work and also the fact that it is cosmetically more pleasing than traditional, open, surgery.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> In laparoscopy, the learning process for novices is, however, longer than in open surgery.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> Particular abilities are needed in laparoscopy. For example, the ability to convert the two-dimensional video-image to a three-dimensional mental picture.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Therefore the curriculum in laparoscopic education demands a different set of tools compared to that of traditional open surgery. Simulators are important tools for improving the technical skills needed in laparoscopic surgery.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> A recent review by Thomas<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref>, concludes that surgical simulation should be tailored to the individual needs and include feedback by tutors. Feedback has been defined as: "<italic>Specific information about the comparison between a trainees&#x000b4; observed performance and a standard, given with the intent to improve the trainees&#x000b4; performance</italic>".<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Feedback ought to be informative and non-judgmental. As an integral part of the learning process, such feedback allows the student to remain on course in reaching a goal.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Feedback can be both positive and negative, but needs to be constructive. Feedback may, however, result in decreased self-efficacy, negative self-reactions, and decreased interest in performing the task at hand.<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref></p><p>While teacher feedback has a long-standing tradition in surgical training, it has in most settings been unstructured and informal.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr"><sup>18</sup></xref>. Inasmuch as it has been evaluated, some studies suggest that instructor feedback improves the laparoscopic result.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr"><sup>19</sup></xref><sup>-</sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22</sup></xref> Others, however, report that an independent approach, without feedback, in simulated laparoscopy, might actually better facilitate learning.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> Moreover, one study suggests different perceptions of feedback among teachers and students. For example, whereas 86% of surgeons felt that feedback was given often/always immediately after the activity, only 12.5% of residents agreed.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24</sup></xref> Previous studies of feedback in laparoscopic simulator training, suggest that feedback is best given according to the individuals' needs.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref>. However, little is known on how individual feedback is best structured.</p><p>Several non-technical factors, like self-efficacy, also appear to contribute to learning in laparoscopy and simulated laparoscopy. Self-efficacy; one&#x000b4;s belief in one&#x000b4;s ability to succeed in specific situations,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr"><sup>26</sup></xref> has been reported to be relevant for learning and to correlate with simulated laparoscopic performance among surgical residents.<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr"><sup>27</sup></xref> According to Banduras&#x000b4; social cognitive theory; successful performance enhances, whereas repeated failures reduce, perceived self-efficacy.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> Efficacy beliefs are essential in the development of motor skills and how well they are executed under pressure. Belief in one&#x000b4;s abilities to learn the patterns of the action and successfully deliver them, contribute independently to better performance.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> The learning environment can also contribute to perceived self-efficacy.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> Some previous studies suggest thatfeedback improves self-efficacy and provides a feeling of proficiency. However, feedback may also be a source of anxiety<bold>.</bold><xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> The experience of flow is another non-technical factor that appears to contribute to simulated and real-life laparoscopic learning.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref><italic>"When in flow an individual operates at full capacity".</italic><xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Experiencing flow is to move or progress smoothly with unbroken continuity, with concentration and complete absorption in what you do. Flow depends on perceived action-capacities and opportunities. The balance between capacity and opportunity is, however, delicate. If a challenge begins to exceed your skills, you eventually become anxious. On the other hand, if your skills begin to exceed the challenges in the task at hand, you relax and run the risk of becoming bored.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> Thus, it is reasonable to assume that enhancing self-efficacy and flow in the operating room will potentially improve the surgical result and thereby patient safety. Additionally, assessments of these factors may be useful for evaluating feedback. In light of the controversies regarding feedback described above, the aim of this study was to explore the potential benefits of individualized feedback on the surgical result, self-efficacy and flow in a standardized setting involving simulated laparoscopy. In addition, we investigated students' perceptions of the learning process in a laparoscopic simulator with or without feedback during this learning processto collect information on how, when and how much feedback ought to be given.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a mixed methods study investigating the value of individualized feedback on the simulated surgical experience and on self-efficacy and flow.

Participation in the study was voluntary. Laparoscopic simulator training was not part of the participants' academic curriculum, but was offered as an extra-curricular activity within the study. We chose medical students since they had no experience of laparoscopy and were novices to simulated laparoscopy. We obtained oral and written informed consent from each participant. Simulator results, interviews and questionnaires were de-identified upon transcription.</p><p>Sixteen medical students (eight females) were included in the study. The median age was 25 years (range 24-29). Ten of the students had one prior experience of simulator training, more than one year prior to participation in the present study.

A mixed study method<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> was used in order to evaluate learning with feedback by quantitative and qualitative methods. The surgical instruments pathways were measured in the simulated operation. We chose to measure this particular parameter since the complication risk is dependent on handling of the instruments, the length of the pathway of the instruments and the duration of surgery.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref><sup>, </sup><xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref><sup>, </sup><xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> Furthermore, a visual analogue scale and a validated questionnaire evaluated students' experience of flow and self-efficacy.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Finally students' views on the learning process in the surgical simulator with and without feedback were captured by group interviews.</p><p>All participants had individual discussions with an instructor, (the same instructor for every participant), regarding a patient case with an extra-uterine pregnancy in preparation for the simulated surgery. The training session in the simulator started with the instructor performing a laparoscopic tubal occlusion, to demonstrate the simulator and its instruments. Each student then performed one laparoscopic tubal occlusion to get familiar with the simulator. The instructor continued the demonstration with a salpingectomy, the actual patient case. Each student subsequently performed three laparoscopic salpingectomies. The students randomized to the feedback group received feedback throughout the procedures. Feedback was given continuously, individualized by reinforcing and correcting each step. Feedback was also provided after each procedure, based on the parameter scores of each student. The control group performed the salpingectomies without feedback. Hence, they did not receive the feedback given by the simulator by the parameter scores or feedback given by the instructor. Feedback was evaluated by the parameter score in the simulator, by self-efficacy scores, by flow scores and furthermore by focus group interviews.</p><sec><title>Quantitative data</title><sec><title>Simulated laparoscopy</title><p>For laparoscopic gynecological simulation we used the LapSimGyn<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> VR simulator (Surgical Science AB, Gothenburg, Sweden).

Both groups had high ambitions to succeed and also expressed the importance of getting support and being acknowledged.</p><sec><title>Simulator performance</title><p>The feedback group used a significantly shorter path (i.e. moved the instruments less) compared to the control group, indicating a positive effect of feedback. Both groups, however, improved, regardless of feedback, which is in line with previous studies<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr"><sup>42</sup></xref> indicating an independent training effect of the simulator. The performances of the individuals in the feedback group were also less varied compared to the individuals in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). This indicates that feedback is especially important for those students/trainees experiencing difficulties, perhaps in part due to a lesser visuospatial ability.<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Previous studies suggest that such individuals benefit the most from simulator training.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> This finding underlines the importance of individualizing feedback.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-efficacy</title><p>In the current study, self-efficacy scores were similar between the two groups. Interestingly, these scores were significantly higher for males than for females concerning the item <italic>"I am confident I will succeed in future simulator tasks" </italic>both before and after training. Males did, however, not perform better than females in the simulator. Gender appears to affect the learning process and therefore needs to be considered during the construction of a curriculum.<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Self-efficacy scores increased for the whole group following training in the simulator, supporting the notion that simulator training has a positive effect on self-efficacy, as previously reported.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Flow</title><p>Both groups in this study scored relatively high on overall flow, suggesting that they approved of the simulator and its authenticity, regardless of feedback. The feedback group stated a high level of concentration, whereas the independent group stated more enjoyment. According to Ghani and Deshpande,<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> concentration and enjoyment are key characteristics of flow, which can explain why no differences in the overall flow experience were observed between the groups and the lack of correlation with simulator performance. Whereas feedback appeared to enhance concentration and focus, despite a higher anxiety level, the independent approach seemed to enhance enjoyment and creativity.</p></sec><sec><title>Learning</title><p>The students in this study stated that the authenticity of the situation, i.e. face validity (the simulator's ability to resemblance the real tool/ situation), was important for the learning process. Introducing the simulator session in the context of a patient case seemed to be an important factor.</p><p>The feedback group stated that they experienced a more realistic situation as compared to the control group. The feedback group was focused on the patient and the whole procedure, whereas the control group focused on procedural details, one at a time.</p></sec><sec><title>Feedback</title><p>The instructor provided guidance and feedback to the feedback group during the simulator procedure, depending on the individual needs of each student. The parameter scores in the simulator also provided support for feedback on the performance. The control group received neither. The aim was to use constructive individualized feedback that is feasible and that can easily be transferred to the operating room. In a few cases, help was provided to allow the students of the control group to move on with the procedure, however, no feedback was given concerning these students techniques. This approach was chosen to somewhat mimic traditional surgical training and also to contrast the structured feedback.</p><p>The control group stated that they suffered from lack of feedback. On the other hand, some of the students that received feedback felt that it made them more passive or, as stated in some cases, that the instructor was too passive. The students in the present study wished for predetermined structures for both the instructor and the training. This is in line with the conclusions drawn by Evans et al. who report that the learning objectives need to be clear.<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref></p></sec><sec><title>Experience of simulator training</title><p>Students in the feedback group expressed more anxiety as compared to the control group. They felt more pressure to succeed. This can be explained by the "mentor effect". Paskins et al. reported an increased anxiety level among medical students, during training with a whole body simulator, under teacher supervision.<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> The students in the feedback group expressed an understanding of the whole procedure, whereas the control group was more focused on details, like instrument handling. The students in the control group felt more freedom to explore the instruments and their own capacity as well as the surgical approach. This indicates that students can benefit from an independent approach to learning. However, you cannot ignore the fact that technical skills improved more in the group that received feedback in this study. A mixture of feedback and independence might be the golden choice as indicated by Strandygaard et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> Moreover, feedback and being supported were factors that all the students felt facilitated learning.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>A limitation of this study is the relatively small study sample. The sample consisted of medical students and not residents in OBGYN, which is the main target-group for training and learning in gynecological laparoscopy. The reason for choosing novices was the advantage of their inexperience of simulators and lack of prior experience of laparoscopy, thus providing a homogenous test group. Another limitation is the way feedback was given. We did not use a validated tool, like for example Non-technical Skills for surgeons.<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> A recent Danish study evaluated this tool adjusted for Danish circumstances in relations to feedback style.<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr"><sup>48</sup></xref> They found the tool useful, albeit still in need of improvement, for mentorship to reach its full potential. In the present study, we wanted the students' demands to guide the feedback style and to objectify it by using the parameter score in the simulator. We encourage future studies to use a tool/ checklist, but still allow the feedback to be adapted to the individual student and the specific situation.</p><p>Another limitation of the present study is the fact that we investigate the effect of feedback during simulated and not real laparoscopy and the findings can therefore not be generalized to the clinical situation. The simulator, however, provided a standardized patient scenario and procedure, which is impossible to obtain in a clinical setting. Different approaches to feedback in the operating room therefore need to be explored among residents in OBGYN.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study suggests that feedback enhances simulated laparoscopic learning. Students appear to benefit from support if it is carefully matched to their different needs. Compared to previous work, this study adds value as it highlights and meets the individual needs of feedback and explores students' views on feedback while learning laparoscopy. The next step is to optimize the amount and form of feedback and to transfer standardized and individualized feedback from the simulated setting to the operating room.</p><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Mr. Armand Sadeghi, Department for Biomedical Engineering and Center for Advanced Medical Simulation and Training, at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden for excellent technical assistance.
