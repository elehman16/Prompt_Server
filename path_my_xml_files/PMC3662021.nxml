The current study sought to evaluate the efficacy of a working memory training scheme in improving memory in a group of older adults. A 5-week online training scheme was designed to provide training in the main components of Baddeley&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2000</xref>) working memory model, namely auditory and visuospatial short-term and working memory. A group of older adults aged between 64 and 79 were randomly assigned to a trainee (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) or control (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) group, with trainees engaging in the adaptive training scheme and controls engaging in a non-adaptive version of the program. Before and after training and at 3- and 6-month follow-up sessions, trainees and controls were asked to complete measures of short-term and working memory, long-term episodic memory, subjective ratings of memory, and attention and achievement of goals set at the beginning of training. The results provided evidence of an expansion of auditory short-term memory span, which was maintained 6&#x02009;months later, and transfer to long-term episodic memory but no evidence of improvement in working memory capacity <italic>per se</italic>. A serendipitous and intriguing finding of a relationship between time spent training, psychological stress, and training gains provided further insight into individual differences in training gains in older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>cognitive training</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>cognitive decline</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="6"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="40"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="7824"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Baddeley (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">1992</xref>) defined working memory as a &#x0201c;brain system that provides temporary storage and manipulation of the information necessary for such complex cognitive tasks as language comprehension, learning, and reasoning&#x0201d; (p. 556). Working memory has come to be recognized as having a central role to play in general cognition (Engle et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">1999</xref>; Cowan et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2005</xref>). In youth, the importance of working memory in learning has been demonstrated in studies showing strong associations between children&#x02019;s working memory capacity and their academic attainments (Gathercole and Pickering, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2000</xref>; Gathercole et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2003</xref>; Jarvis and Gathercole, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2003</xref>; Holmes and Adams, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2006</xref>). In older adulthood, working memory has been identified as one of the cognitive processes that shows significant decline with age (Park, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">2000</xref>; Park et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">2001</xref>; Park and Reuter-Lorenz, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2009</xref>). The discovery of the importance of working memory in facilitating complex cognition and its vulnerability to decline with age, has led to a recent surge in the development of training programs aimed at enhancing working memory capacity.</p><p>A number of reviewers in the area have concluded in favor of the efficacy of working memory training in improving working memory capacity and the extension of its effects to other cognitive processes such as fluid reasoning and attentional control (Klingberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>; Morrison and Chein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2011</xref>). However, a recent fine-grained analysis of the training literature has cast doubt on this conclusion. Having conducted a detailed review of working memory training in relation to children, young adults, and older adults, Shipstead et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>) criticized previous research on a number of grounds, including: inadequate measurement of working memory, either in relation to the use of single tasks as criterion measures or the conflation of working memory with short-term memory; the use of no-contact control groups, which create a host of confounds when used as a comparison groups; and the use, as outcome measures, of subjective reports, which are vulnerable to participant expectations. They concluded that the efficacy of training schemes in improving working memory capacity has yet to be demonstrated.</p><p>Other researchers have reached similarly disappointing conclusions regarding the efficacy of working memory training for older adults. A trend has been identified in which older adults improve their performance on the training task or very similar criterion measures but show limited transfer to dissimilar measures of working memory or other cognitive tasks. It has been speculated that reduced cognitive plasticity in older age limits the amount of possible improvement to be gained through training (Morrison and Chein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2011</xref>; Shipstead et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>). For example, Dahlin et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2008b</xref>) examined the effects of 5&#x02009;weeks of updating training on a criterion updating task and two transfer tasks (<italic>n</italic>-back and stroop) in a group of young and older adults. They reported significant training gains in both groups but transfer effects in the young group only. A second study conducted with a larger sample and a broader battery of tasks found a similar pattern of results (Dahlin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2008a</xref>). Buschkuehl et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2008</xref>) examined the impact of a mixture of span and complex span training in a sample of participants with a mean age of 80. The trainee group showed significant improvements on the training tasks and near transfer to a similar visual short-term memory task but no improvements on several other transfer tasks of digit span, verbal recall, and visual recall. Li et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2008</xref>) found that updating training using an <italic>n</italic>-back task led to training gains and improvement on a near transfer <italic>n</italic>-back task but a lack of far transfer to complex span tasks in either young (aged 20&#x02013;30) or older (aged 70&#x02013;80) participants. In a group of older adults aged between 60 and 70, Brehmer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2011</xref>) reported significant improvements on trained tasks and transfer to short-term memory, working memory, and episodic memory tasks. Their training tasks were largely focused on short-term memory span tasks, however. Examining the effects of complex span training, Richmond et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2011</xref>) reported significant training effects and near transfer to another complex span task, a far transfer effect to some but not all aspects of verbal learning tested, some evidence of a self-reported improvement in everyday attention but no significant transfer to measures of short-term memory, fluid intelligence, or attention.</p><p>In a systematic review of randomized controlled trials conducted to examine the efficacy of cognitive training in improving memory in people in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease or Dementia, Clare and Woods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2004</xref>) pointed to the lack of evidence for the efficacy of such training. They suggested that cognitive training, involving guided practice on a set of standard tasks, lacked immediate relevance or applicability to the everyday lives of older adults. They advocated the development of a more meaningful, individualized approach, termed Cognitive Rehabilitation, which would involve identifying personally relevant goals and developing strategies to achieve these goals. In a single case study and a randomized controlled trial, Clare et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2010</xref>) presented evidence for the efficacy of the approach in improving the activities of daily living in older adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or in the Early Stages of Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease, through the identification and achievement of personal goals.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to examine the efficacy of a working memory training scheme in improving the working memory capacity of a group of older adults (aged 64 to 79). The 5-week computerized training scheme was designed to provide practice in each of the main components of working memory represented in Baddeley&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2000</xref>) model, namely, auditory short-term memory, auditory working memory, visuospatial short-term memory, and visuospatial working memory. In an attempt to combine the Cognitive Training and Cognitive Rehabilitation approaches, participants were also asked to set goals in relation to aspects of daily functioning that they would like to see improve following training. The goals were based on aspects of daily functioning which participants felt were impeded by slips of attention or memory. Trainees were compared to a control group that trained on a non-adaptive version of the program. The two groups were compared pre- and post-training and at 3- and 6-month follow-up sessions on a series of measures of short-term memory, working memory, episodic memory and subjective ratings of attention and memory slips, and goal performance and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifty-two participants were recruited and randomly allocated to the Trainee or Control Group using a minimization procedure (Altman and Bland, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2005</xref>) to balance the two groups in terms of gender and age.

During the pre-training assessment session, participants were, first of all, asked to identify from a prepared list, those attentional and memory slips which happen to them from time to time in their daily lives. The list was motivated by examples in the ARCES and MFS questionnaires and participants were also prompted to supply personal examples, if missing from the list. In a second step, participants returned to the list and rated each chosen attentional or memory slip in terms of how troublesome it was in their daily lives, along a scale ranging from 1 (does not trouble me at all) to 10 (extremely troubling). In Step 3, participants were prompted to adopt the five slips which they had rated as being most troublesome in daily life as their goal activities, activities that they would most like to improve as a result of the working memory training. They then rated each of the five goal activities in terms of their current performance of the activity, along a scale ranging from 1 (not able to do it at all) to 10 (able to do it extremely well) and their satisfaction with this performance, along a scale ranging from 1 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (extremely satisfied). An average performance and satisfaction rating was calculated by adding ratings across goals and dividing by the number of goals. During each of the subsequent assessment sessions (post-training, 3-month follow-up, and 6-month follow-up), participants revisited their goal list and supplied current performance and satisfaction ratings. During the post-training assessment session only, participants also indicated the extent to which they felt they had achieved their goals following working memory training, along a scale ranging from 1 (fully achieved) to 10 (not achieved). A single achievement rating was calculated by averaging ratings across goals.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2-6"><title>Working memory training scheme</title><p>The working memory training scheme was designed to provide participants with practice in the components of working memory outlined in Baddeley&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2000</xref>) model, which were auditory short-term and working memory and visuospatial short-term and working memory.

The program consisted of a mixture of psycho-education on the nature of working memory and strategies to support its function in everyday life and practice of nine training exercises, which were introduced gradually over the 5&#x02009;weeks. Participants were asked to practice the training exercises for at least 30&#x02009;min each day, for 5&#x02009;days out of each week, for 5&#x02009;weeks. The training exercises consisted of the following:</p><p><italic>Span tasks</italic> were fashioned after the classic digit span tasks (e.g., Wechsler, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1997</xref>).</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Span Numbers</italic> &#x02013; participants listened to a series of numbers played by the computer and at the end of the sequence, re-entered the numbers either in the same (Span Numbers Normal) or reverse (Span Numbers Reverse) order.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Span Colors</italic> &#x02013; participants observed on a colored grid a sequence of flashing colors and reproduced the sequence either in the same (Span Colors Normal) or reverse (Span Colors Reverse) order.</p></list-item></list><p><italic>Focus exercises</italic> were similar to the classic running span tasks (Pollack et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">1959</xref>).</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Focus Faces</italic> &#x02013; participants observed a series of faces appearing one by one on screen and indicated the last <italic>n</italic> faces observed when the sequence ceased.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Focus Names</italic> &#x02013; participants observed a series of names appearing one by one on screen and indicated the last <italic>n</italic> names observed when the sequence ceased.</p></list-item></list><p>The <italic>Snap! exercises</italic> were modeled upon the classic <italic>n</italic>-back task (Kirchner, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">1958</xref>).

Participants listened to a series of numbers (between 1 and 9) being played by the computer and added the current to the previous digit.</p><p>The program was designed to be adaptive, beginning with the easiest level for each participant and presenting levels of increasing difficulty as participants&#x02019; performance improved. Participants had access to a results graph for each exercise, which they were encouraged to check regularly in order to follow their own progress on each task. The online arrangement also enabled the researchers to monitor each participant&#x02019;s participation, performance, and time spent training.</p><p>At the end of each week, participants were given information on strategies that could be used to support working memory function in everyday life situations, such as remembering phone numbers and checking change in shops and restaurants. The recommended strategies included chunking, visualization, rounding and estimation, reading techniques, and thinking on one&#x02019;s feet.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2-7"><title>Control training</title><p>The control group engaged in a non-adaptive version of the training program, which maintained all exercises at the easiest level. A number of exercises (Span Numbers Reverse, Span Colors Reverse, Double Snap!, and MathsMad) were removed from the program entirely as it was felt that even at the easiest level, these exercises taxed working memory. Information on strategies to support working memory function in daily life was also removed from the non-adaptive version of the training program.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S3"><title>Results</title><sec id="S3-3"><title>Effects of working memory training</title><sec id="S3-3-8"><title>Objective measures</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> presents the mean values and standard deviations obtained by the trainee and control groups on each objective memory measure during each assessment session.

One possible explanation for this pattern of correlations is that those trainees who put more effort into the training were more anxious or depressed during the post-training assessment and these feelings of psychological stress impeded their performance on the Digit Span Forwards Task during the post-training assessment session.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The current study sought to examine the efficacy of an online working memory training scheme in a group of adults aged between 64 and 79. In comparison to the control group, the trainees showed a significant improvement on a test of auditory short-term memory, Digit Span Forwards, which was maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up assessment sessions. They also showed a significant improvement in episodic memory on Immediate and Delayed Word Recall Tasks but this improvement was not maintained at follow-up. Trainees did not improve significantly more than controls on auditory working memory (Digit Span Reverse and Letter-Number Sequencing) or in Story Recall episodic memory tasks. There were no significant changes in either group in relation to self-reported memory and attention slips. Both groups gave significantly higher Performance and Satisfaction Ratings for their chosen goal activities during the Post-Training Assessments.</p><p>The current findings are in keeping with previous training literature in so far as they indicate a significant improvement in short-term memory but fall short of demonstrating an improvement in working memory, despite the provision of extensive training on tasks modeled upon classic updating and <italic>n</italic>-back tasks. Shipstead et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>) have suggested that an improvement in working memory capacity following cognitive training has yet to be demonstrated and describe how current claims of enhanced working memory capacity can be explained by other aspects of experimental design or measures used.</p><p>Previous studies of working memory training in older adults have identified a trend in which older adults show improvements on trained tasks or on tasks similar to those used in training but show limited transfer of gains to tasks dissimilar to the training tasks. Some researchers have speculated that reduced cognitive plasticity precludes the transfer of training gains in older adults (Dahlin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">2008a</xref>; Morrison and Chein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2011</xref>; Shipstead et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>). The improved short-term memory span found in this study is in keeping with this trend in so far as the Digit Span Forwards measure was very similar to the Span Numbers training task. The maintenance of the training effect is particularly impressive, however, given that a rather small amount of training (around 15&#x02009;h on average) served to expand span of auditory short-term memory on a rather prolonged basis (up to 6&#x02009;months). Furthermore, the significant improvement in Immediate and Delayed Word Recall identified during the Post-Training Assessment provides evidence of transfer to episodic memory. Links between short-term and long-term memory have been made (Nee and Jonides, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">2008</xref>). The expansion of auditory short-term memory span may have facilitated trainees in encoding or retrieval of words during the Word Recall Task (see Cantor and Engle, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">1993</xref>; Burgess and Hitch, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2005</xref>).</p><p>The serendipitous finding of the relationship between time spent training, psychological stress, and proportional improvement may also shed some light on lack of improvements in older adults following training. The effect of individual differences on training outcomes has remained largely unexplored (Morrison and Chein, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2011</xref>). In this study, a significant negative correlation between time spent training and proportional improvement on the Digit Span Forwards task indicated that those trainees who spent more time training tended to improve less. Further exploration of this curious finding uncovered a significant positive correlation between time spent training and self-report scores on the HADS questionnaire supplied during the Post-Training Assessment, indicating that those who trained more had a tendency to report a higher degree of psychological stress during the Post-Training Assessment. Crucially, the correlation between time spent training and proportional improvement was reduced to a non-statistically significant level when the HADS score was partialed out, prompting the possible explanation that those trainees who put more effort into the training were more anxious or depressed during the Post-Training Assessment and these feelings of psychological stress impeded their performance. The negative impact of stress on memory has been documented (Neupert et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2006</xref>). It is indeed possible that previous findings of limited training gains or transfer effects identified in older compared to young adults were due to performance-impeding levels of psychological stress rather than limited cognitive plasticity. Certainly, this finding deserves further exploration. At the very least, future research should be cognizant of the possibility of anxiety or depression impeding performance in older participants.</p><p>An attempt was made in this study to combine the Cognitive Training and Cognitive Rehabilitation (Clare and Woods, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2004</xref>) approaches by asking participants to specify goals or activities they would like to see improve as a result of training. The top 10 goals chosen by trainees and controls were presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>. The top three goals referred to improving concentration, remembering people&#x02019;s names, and quick or speedy recall. Unlike the approach used in Cognitive Rehabilitation, participants were not given any strategies aimed specifically at achieving their goals. They were simply told to be aware of their goals and to attempt to apply their training when situations relating to their goals arose. Both trainee and control participants supplied significantly higher ratings for Performance of and Satisfaction with goal activities during the Post-Training Assessment and ratings were maintained at this higher level during the 3- and 6-month follow-up sessions. The similar improvement reported by both trainee and control groups may represent a placebo effect caused by participants&#x02019; expectations or may reflect a genuine improvement caused simply by attending to goal activities. Either way, there is no evidence that the cognitive training engaged in by the trainees had any effect on the achievement of their goals.</p><p>A significant limitation of this study is its lack of inclusion of a measure of visuospatial short-term or working memory. A considerable proportion of the training was devoted to the visuospatial modality but the inclusion of a corresponding memory measure was neglected. A second limitation relates to the use of a control group that engaged in a non-adaptive version of the training program. Although the use of a non-adaptive training control group has been hailed as the gold standard in this kind of research (Klingberg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2010</xref>), limitations have also been identified in relation to the training experiences received by the two groups. Inevitably, the training given to controls involves much less rigor and they also miss out on feedback on their performance (Shipstead et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>). In this study, controls trained for an average of just under 8&#x000bd;&#x02009;h while trainees spent just under 15&#x02009;h training on average. This likely reflects a lower level of engagement in the control participants engendered by very simple and repetitive training tasks. As an alternative to non-adaptive training, it has been suggested that controls engage in an adaptive training scheme that is focused on another cognitive process or activity (Shipstead et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>). Another possibility would be to provide control participants with training designed to expand short-term memory span only while trainees receive training designed to expand working memory capacity in addition to short-term memory span.</p><p>Shipstead et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2012</xref>) have claimed that a true enhancement of working memory capacity following cognitive training has yet to be demonstrated. The working memory training scheme employed in this study was designed to provide practice in the core elements of Baddeley&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">2000</xref>) model and training exercises were based upon classic tasks of short-term and working memory, such as span, updating, and <italic>n</italic>-back tasks. Despite this theoretically motivated and comprehensive training package, an increase in working memory capacity was not detected. There was, however, evidence of a rather durable expansion of short-term memory span coupled with transfer of training gains to a long-term episodic memory task, suggesting a degree of cognitive plasticity in this sample of older adults. The unexpected and intriguing relationships uncovered between time spent training, psychological stress, and training gains should stimulate ideas for further avenues of investigation into individual differences in the enhancement of cognition in older adults.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the support of Atlantic Philanthropies for their generous support of the NEIL (Neuroenhancement for Independent Lives) programme.
