Using a crossover design, the present study compared trough levels of DPP-4 inhibition provided by these agents in a single cohort of patients with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label, five-period crossover study. Eligible patients were 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years of age, either treatment-na&#x000ef;ve or off prior antihyperglycemic agent therapy for at least 6 or 12&#x000a0;weeks (depending on the prior therapy), and had glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1C</sub>) &#x02265;6.5% and &#x02264;10.0%. In separate study periods, patients received 5&#x000a0;mg saxagliptin q.d. (saxa-5), 100&#x000a0;mg sitagliptin q.d. (sita-100), 50&#x000a0;mg vildagliptin q.d. (vilda-50-q.d.), 50&#x000a0;mg vildagliptin b.i.d. (vilda-50-b.i.d.), or placebo for 5&#x000a0;days. The primary endpoint was trough %DPP-4 inhibition, derived by comparing DPP-4 activity 24&#x000a0;h after the Day-5 morning dose with predose activity in the same period and analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model with fixed-effects terms for treatment and period.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean (range) baseline HbA<sub>1C</sub> was 7.4% (6.4&#x02013;9.0%; <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22). Least-squares (LS) mean trough %DPP-4 inhibition was 73.5%, 91.7%, 28.9%, 90.6%, and 3.5% after saxa-5, sita-100, vilda-50-q.d., vilda-50-b.i.d., and placebo, respectively.

Several DPP-4 inhibitors are widely approved for use as oral antihyperglycemic agents in treating patients with T2DM. All have been shown to provide significant improvements in standard indices of glycemic control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. There may be important differences between them, however, in the extent to which they provide sustained pharmacodynamic (PD) action (DPP-4 inhibition) throughout their recommended dosing cycles. The existing PD data on these agents have come from separate studies in which each agent was evaluated individually, with different study populations and dosing regimens (single versus multiple dose administration) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There is a need, therefore, for comparison of levels of DPP-4 inhibition between different agents within a single study in which conditions are standardized. There also is a need to minimize the impact of dilution and substrate competition artifacts that may be introduced in the process of assaying DPP-4 inhibition ex vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and prevent meaningful comparison between agents even when tested in parallel within the same study.</p><p>Reagent solutions must be added to plasma in order to assay DPP-4 activity. As a result, plasma drug concentrations will be lower in an ex vivo assay than they are in vivo and this dilution effect may lead to underestimation of levels of DPP-4 inhibition. The impact of this effect will vary depending on the rate at which a DPP-4 inhibitor dissociates from its binding site on the enzyme, the amount of plasma dilution, and the length of time between the addition of reagents and the measurement of enzyme activity. In addition, there is the potential for ex vivo underestimation of DPP-4 inhibition due to substrate competition. If inhibition is assessed with substrate present at a level that saturates the enzyme, then competitive DPP-4 inhibitors are likely to appear to be less effective than they are under physiological conditions in vivo, where endogenous substrates are likely to be present at subsaturating concentrations.</p><p>Measurement of DPP-4 inhibition by sitagliptin is expected to be especially sensitive to these two artifacts because binding between sitagliptin and DPP-4 is competitive and rapidly reversible. When plasma containing sitagliptin is diluted, the half-life (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>) for readjustment to the new equilibrium for DPP-4 binding is &#x0003c;2&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], an interval that is brief compared with the length of time over which assays of plasma DPP-4 are typically run. Measurements of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin may also be sensitive to the dilution artifact because the <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for dissociation of vildagliptin from DPP-4 is in the order of 3.5&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Measurements of DPP-4 inhibition by saxagliptin and an active metabolite, 5-hydroxy-saxagliptin, are likely to be relatively insensitive to this dilution effect because these molecular species dissociate slowly from DPP-4, with <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values of 50 and 23&#x000a0;min, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Given these differences in binding kinetics, it follows that valid comparisons between these agents can only be made when DPP-4 inhibition is measured using an assay condition that minimizes the impact of plasma dilution. In the present study, we have directly compared profiles of DPP-4 inhibition over time in patients with T2DM treated with saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin using an assay in which plasma was diluted by only 11%, a level that is likely to have only a minimal effect on outcome, regardless of binding kinetics. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, open-label, crossover design, patients in a single cohort were treated in successive study periods for 5&#x000a0;days (so that all agents could reach steady-state conditions) with the highest recommended doses for each agent. Pharmacokinetic (PK) and DPP-4 inhibition data were obtained at various times throughout these treatments and for an additional 4&#x000a0;days after the last doses were given. The prespecified primary endpoint was the &#x02018;trough&#x02019; level of DPP-4 inhibition measured after patients received their final doses in each study period. It was assessed at 24&#x000a0;h postdose in subjects being treated with study drugs q.d. and at 12&#x000a0;h postdose in one study period in which patients were treated b.i.d. (with vildagliptin).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was performed in accordance with all local laws and regulations, the Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2000, and guidelines established by the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice.

Approximately 14&#x000a0;days after receiving final doses of study drug, patients returned for a follow-up visit.

In total, 10 AEs were reported in 7 of the 22 patients enrolled. Headache was the most commonly reported AE (six events reported in three patients). Five AEs were considered to be study related. These included four events of headache (two that were attributed to saxagliptin treatment and two that were attributed to sitagliptin treatment) and one event of influenza that was attributed to saxagliptin treatment. All AEs were reported to be mild (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6) or moderate (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) in intensity and transient in nature. There were no deaths, no serious AEs, and no AEs that led to withdrawal from the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Other Observations</title><p>In any period in which a patient was administered placebo, plasma concentrations of saxagliptin, 5-hydroxy-saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin were measured predose on Day 1 and these were observed to be below the LOQ in all cases. These findings suggest that there was no carryover of drug concentration from one period to the next. Similarly, predose levels of DPP-4 inhibition on Day 1 were similar among patients in all treatment sequences suggesting no PD carryover, a conclusion that was further supported by the results of a sensitivity analysis in which predose measurements of DPP-4 activity in Period 1, Day 1 were used as the baseline for all subsequent periods (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The findings from this study show that saxagliptin, sitagliptin, and vildagliptin differ significantly in the trough levels of DPP-4 inhibition that they provide when administered to patients with T2DM following recommended q.d. and b.i.d. dosing regimens. Sitagliptin and twice-daily vildagliptin each provided trough inhibition levels of approximately 90%, the maximum inhibition level that was observed at any time in this study. In contrast, saxagliptin and once-daily vildagliptin provided trough inhibition levels of approximately 75% and 30%, respectively. Thus, it was observed that sitagliptin and twice-daily vildagliptin provided sustained, high levels of DPP-4 inhibition throughout 24&#x000a0;h, whereas saxagliptin and once-daily vildagliptin did not.</p><p>The trough level of DPP-4 inhibition observed in this study following saxagliptin treatment corresponded well with the trough level of inhibition (~70%) observed previously in a 2-week study in which patients were treated with saxagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg q.d. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no published DPP-4 inhibition data from patients treated with multiple doses of 50&#x000a0;mg vildagliptin b.i.d.; direct comparison between present and historical data is thus not possible. In a study in which single doses of 50 and 100&#x000a0;mg vildagliptin were given to patients with T2DM, the levels of DPP-4 inhibition observed at 24&#x000a0;h postdose were approximately 14% and 35%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the present study, the mean (&#x000b1;standard error) level of DPP-4 inhibition 24&#x000a0;h after the first dose of vildagliptin 50&#x000a0;mg q.d. was 9.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.0% (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This value is reasonably consistent with the prior result.</p><p>In the present study, sitagliptin provided a greater trough level of DPP-4 inhibition than was previously observed in a Phase I trial in which patients with T2DM were administered a single dose of 200&#x000a0;mg sitagliptin. In that study, plasma samples were diluted 2.5-fold prior to ex vivo assay and the level of DPP-4 inhibition measured at 24&#x000a0;h postdose was 80.1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The greater level of DPP-4 inhibition observed in the present study could be accounted for by the difference in plasma dilution. A statistical method has been described to correct for this dilution, and based on this method one would expect to observe 80% DPP-4 inhibition by sitagliptin after 2.5-fold dilution of plasma when the true level of inhibition in vivo is ~96% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We have not applied this correction in the present analysis because the extent of plasma dilution in our assay was sufficiently small (11%) that its effect could reasonably be regarded as negligible.</p><p>The PK findings in the present study were generally consistent with those reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It was confirmed that all plasma drug concentrations were at steady state when the primary endpoint was measured and that PD effects were stable from Day 3 onwards. Hence, differences in drug exposure did not appear to play a role in the observed differences in PD effect.</p><p>One limitation of this study was that antihyperglycemic efficacy was not evaluated. Hence, uncertainty remains as to whether the observed differences in DPP-4 inhibition have meaningful implications for glycemic efficacy. However, a recent, model-based meta-analysis of published data found evidence for greater reductions in HbA<sub>1C</sub> with more sustained DPP-4 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Increasing reductions in HbA<sub>1C</sub> were found in this meta-analysis even as the weighted average DPP-4 inhibition increased beyond 90%, supporting the concept that maintaining nearly complete inhibition of DPP-4 over entire dosing cycles may be important in order to maximize antihyperglycemic efficacy with this class of drugs. In addition, we note that the finding of similar DPP-4 inhibition during treatment in our comparison of once-daily sitagliptin with twice-daily vildagliptin is consistent with prior reports suggesting generally similar glycemic efficacy when these regimens are compared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>In a study comparing the efficacy of sitagliptin 100&#x000a0;mg q.d. with saxagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg q.d. as an add-on to metformin for 18&#x000a0;weeks, the adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA<sub>1C</sub> was &#x02212;0.62% versus &#x02212;0.52% for sitagliptin and saxagliptin, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Although this difference was within the study&#x02019;s prespecified limit for noninferiority for HbA<sub>1C</sub>, the sitagliptin group had a numerically greater adjusted mean change from baseline in fasting plasma glucose than the saxagliptin group [&#x02212;16.2&#x000a0;mg/dL (&#x02212;0.90&#x000a0;mmol/L) versus &#x02212;10.8&#x000a0;mg/dL (&#x02212;0.60&#x000a0;mmol/L), respectively]. The results of the present study suggest a possible mechanism for this glycemic outcome, in that sitagliptin 100&#x000a0;mg provided significantly greater DPP-4 inhibition at 24&#x000a0;h postdose than saxagliptin 5&#x000a0;mg.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study found that three approved DPP-4 inhibitors provided significantly different trough levels of DPP-4 inhibition when administered to patients with T2DM following recommended q.d. and b.i.d. dosing regimens.
