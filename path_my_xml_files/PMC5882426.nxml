CR313029) and was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">http://clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> (registration number NCT02495038). The participants were 81 patients scheduled for elective mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty, and all patients provided written informed consent. All patients met the criteria for American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I to II, were 20 to 60 years of age, and had a body mass index (BMI) of 20 to 30&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The exclusion criteria were as follows: a history of allergy to the study drugs; neuromuscular disease; smoking; pregnancy or breastfeeding; preoperative medication such as antipsychotics, aminoglycosides, steroid or neuroleptics (which interact with non-depolarizing NMBAs); serum creatinine level &#x0003e;&#x0200a;1.2&#x0200a;mg/dL; or liver transaminase level &#x0003e;&#x0200a;40&#x0200a;U/L. Anthropometric variables, such as height and weight, were measured in the hospital ward before surgery. BMI was calculated as total body weight divided by height squared. Ideal body weight (IBW) was calculated using Devine formula {50&#x0200a;kg&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;2.3&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;(height [inch] - 60) for men and 45.5&#x0200a;kg&#x0200a;+&#x0200a;2.3&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;(height [inch] - 60) for women}. IBW was used to determine the initial doses of NMBAs. Lean body weight (LBW) was calculated using James&#x02019; formula {LBW men&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;(1.10&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;weight (kg)) &#x02013; 128&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;(weight<sup>2</sup>/(100&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;height [m])<sup>2</sup>); LBW women&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;(1.07&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;weight [kg]) &#x02013; 148&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;(weight<sup>2</sup>/(100&#x0200a;&#x000d7;&#x0200a;height [m])<sup>2</sup>)}.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Additive doses of NMBAs were determined using LBW values.

The T1/T4 ratio was measured using TOF-Watch monitors (Organon; Teknica B.V., Boxtel, the Netherlands). Measurements were performed at 5-minute intervals and NIBP was monitored on the arm opposite to the arm used for the intravenous fluid line without disturbing flow.</p><p>Midazolam (2&#x0200a;mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.2&#x0200a;mg) were intramuscularly administered to patients 1&#x0200a;hour before surgery. Anesthesia was induced with propofol 1.5 to 2.5&#x0200a;mg/kg and remifentanil 0.4 to 0.6&#x0200a;mcg/kg, followed by maintenance with target-controlled infusion of propofol 5 to 10&#x0200a;mg/kg/h and remifentanil 0.05 to 2&#x0200a;mcg/kg/min. The infusion pump (Orchestra Module DPS; Fresenius-Vial, Brezins, France) was operated based on Minto and Marshall pharmacokinetic model for effect site target-controlled infusion. Subsequently, the patient was administered 100% oxygen mask ventilation.</p><p>The arm contralateral to the operation side was used for neuromuscular monitoring and was attached to the arm board of the TOF-Watch monitor. Study drugs connected with 3-way stop cocks were administered to the patients simultaneously with flushing 5&#x0200a;mL normal saline; a timer was started for T1/T4 ratio monitoring. Surface electrodes for the ulnar nerve were placed at the wrist and train-of-four (TOF) stimulation was conducted with supramaximal square wave impulses of 200&#x0200a;&#x003bc;s duration, at 2&#x0200a;Hz/12&#x0200a;s. We assessed time to TOF ratio&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0 (onset), first TOF ratio &#x0003e;&#x0200a;25% (duration 25%), TOF 25% to 75% (recovery index), and 90% recovery time (TOF 25&#x02013;90%) under total intravenous anesthesia. We also recorded the rate of additional rescue doses administered with 10% of the initial NMBA doses, operation duration from incision to surgical wound dressing, and anesthesia duration from entry to exit of the operation room. Body temperature was maintained above 35&#x000b0;C, using a warm air blanket. The arterial pressure cuff was placed on the contralateral arm to TOF monitoring.</p></sec><sec><label>2.3</label><title>Randomization and masking</title><p>Eligible patient was designated as their own sequence number and simple randomization was used. Patients were randomly assigned to groups by opening a sealed allocation envelope by an assistant unrelated to study. After data collection, the allocation number was matched to each group and both investigator and participant did not know matching group until analyses. Before patients arrived in the operating room, rocuronium and cisatracurium were prepared by an assistant who was not involved in the study. Each drug dosage was determined by an allocation number. The syringe containing each study drug was given to the researcher with the contents concealed. Separate syringes were used for each drug, although the researcher could not identify the contents because the scale of the syringe was concealed.</p></sec><sec><label>2.4</label><title>Adverse events and management</title><p>Anesthesia levels were assessed based on BIS scores of 40 to 60 for all patients. Moderate hypertension (&#x0003e;120% of baseline) or hypotension (&#x0003c;80% of baseline) were treated by increasing or decreasing the rate of propofol infusion using fluid supplementation. Severe hemodynamic changes (systolic pressure&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;90 or &#x0003e;&#x0200a;200&#x0200a;mm Hg) were controlled by intravenous administration of phenylephrine (50&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g) or nicardipine (250&#x0200a;&#x003bc;g), which were repeated until hemodynamically stable status was achieved. When hiccups or self-contained respiration occurred, additional rescue doses of NMBAs were administered to the patient even if the T1/T4 ratio was &#x0003c;&#x0200a;25%.</p></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data are expressed as means&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;standard deviations, numerical values, and percentages, as appropriate. Between-group comparisons were conducted using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests, Fisher exact tests, or 1-way analysis of variance, as appropriate. Statistically significant differences were further analyzed by Turkey post-hoc analyses. A preliminary study determined that 24 patients would be required in each group to achieve power of 0.9 and a type I error rate of 0.05. By estimating an attrition rate of 10%, we calculated that 27 patients would be required for each group.

Therefore, reduced doses of these NMBAs are appropriate during intubation and operative immobility for minor surgeries, such as mastoidectomy, which involve minimal stimulation during surgery. We did not find differences between groups for the recovery index because the additional rescue dose was 10% of the initial dose in all groups.</p><p>NMBAs are administered on the basis of both intubation and operative requirements. However, the purpose of the initial intubation dose is to maintain neuromuscular blockade during surgery, within the allowable time.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Longer duration surgeries may result in additional rescue doses or continuous infusion of NMBAs. In contrast, short duration surgeries can result in unnecessary prolongation of anesthetic duration if 300% to 400% of the cisatracurium ED<sub>95</sub> is administered.<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> In addition, if the patient has severely decreased liver function or renal creatinine clearance, continuous infusion of rocuronium may produce residual blockade.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Sugammadex is typically used for immediate reversal by entrapment of rocuronium.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> However, anticholinesterase has been universally used for recovery from neuromuscular blockade, due to cost-effectiveness; it is also associated with recurarization, which is minimized by the predictable pharmacodynamics of NMBAs. In minor surgery, although lower surgical stimulation does not mean smaller dosage of NMBAs, the appropriate neuromuscular blockade is able to improve the surgical environment.<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> However, unnecessary, excessive use of NMBAs increases the risk for residual muscle relaxation. The use of combined NMBAs of rocuronium and cisatracurium in minor surgery is beneficial for similar effectiveness with 10% smaller doses, even though sugammadex cannot be applied for reversal. In addition, liver and kidney are less affected by smaller doses of NMBAs.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup></p><p>Continuous infusion of rocuronium can result in residual muscle relaxation, severe hepatic failure, reduced hepatic blood flow, or prolonged renal excretion.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Therefore, the combination of rocuronium and cisatracurium is a promising method to control the timing of muscle relaxation. Cisatracurium is administered additively during long duration surgeries without limitations, after an intubating dose of rocuronium to achieve rapid patient responses.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Neuromuscular blockade can be induced by a single administration, although continuous infusion of additional doses of cisatracurium is also sometime administered.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> This procedure requires estimating the synergic effects of drug combinations, while also considering the duration of surgery. Prolonging the effective duration of muscle relaxation due to synergic effects of NMBAs enables reductions in additional drug administrations.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> However, objective assessment is required to determine the parameters for prolonged synergistic paralysis.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> When rocuronium is used as a priming agent to complement the slow onset of cisatracurium, onset is reduced; however, the duration of muscle relaxation may be prolonged due to synergistic effects of the 2 NMBAs.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> In addition, previous research has found that the duration of muscle relaxation is prolonged by 33% when cisatracurium is administered following an initial dose of rocuronium.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> However, the extent of prolonged muscle relaxation after administration of identical doses of rocuronium and cisatracurium has not been investigated; this information would enable estimates of the effect duration of these NMBAs.</p><p>In the present study, we verified that a 10% reduction of the NMBAs, used in combination, produced comparable effects to ED<sub>95</sub> doses. However, 20% reductions produced statistically significant prolongation of onset, and additional drug administrations were required to compensate for reduced effect durations. Rapid sequence intubation can be challenging to perform; therefore, repetitive administration of additional NMBAs may be required and mask breathing before intubation may be prolonged. A previous study found that administration of 200% of the ED<sub>95</sub> values of rocuronium and cisatracurium produced onset durations of 1.7 and 5.2&#x0200a;minutes, respectively; the durations of time to T1 recoveries of 25% were 36 and 45&#x0200a;minutes, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> In the present study, the onset duration was 3.5&#x0200a;minutes for Group I and the T1 recovery of 25% was 51&#x0200a;minutes, indicating prolonged effect durations. However, reduced early manifestation effects did not occur, likely due to cisatracurium inhibiting rapid early manifestation through competitive binding of rocuronium and cisatracurium to acetylcholine receptors. We set the peak effect time as TOF ratio&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0, and there were therefore no significant differences between intubating conditions. However, the coughing reflex occurred even if BIS was maintained below 60, and the postintubation TOF ratio was &#x0003c;&#x0200a;25% in 2 patients from Group L. Additional NMBAs was administered to these patients regardless of their TOF ratios, after which the coughing reflex disappeared and muscle relaxation resumed.</p><p>Pharmacodynamics of NMBAs are affected by several factors, including aminoglycosides, lincosamides, calcium channel blockers, inhalation agents, temperature, magnesium, local anesthetics, lithium, antiepileptic drugs, diuretics, steroid, dantrolene, and azathioprine.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> We excluded these causes. As well as we selected ASA I-II patients and maintained body temperature of the patients within the normal range. However, the present study has some limitations. First, IBW was used to determine drug doses. Although this process is appropriate for initial rocuronium doses, repeated doses of cisatracurium should be determined on the basis of LBW, due to its low lipid solubility.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In the present study, early manifestation and effect durations were assessed according to initial doses. A second limitation was that patients with BMI &#x0003e;&#x0200a;25&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which corresponds to overweight or obese, were included in the experimental group. Obesity results in an increased volume of distribution and the doses of NMBAs based on IBW may, therefore, be insufficient.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> However, prolonged muscle relaxation has been reported with doses of rocuronium that were determined on the basis of real body weight in morbidly obese patients.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Third, we found that NMBAs could only be reduced by 10% while maintaining clinical effects. We found a marked reduction in the drug effects with 20% reductions compared with 10% reductions in a preliminary study with 7 participants. Furthermore, the peak dose&#x02013;response effect was not diminished with 10% drug reductions. Thus, the reduction interval of doses was determined as 10%, and this finding was supported by the full study data. However, we cannot produce a dose&#x02013;response curve. Ideally, a study of drug effects at ED<sub>50</sub> doses would be conducted to verify dose responses for combined NMBAs.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Finally, the present study did not find reduced oxygen saturation due to rapid heart rate changes, changes in hepatic function, or residual muscle relaxation after administration of the NMBAs. These outcomes likely occurred because the study was performed with selected patients. To minimize the influence on muscle relaxation, the doses of NMBAs were limited to ED<sub>95</sub> values and constant monitoring was performed to assess recovery of muscle relaxation. Therefore, caution is recommended in generalizing the results to other populations.</p><p>The present study verified that clinically unstable muscle relaxation for intubation occurred with a 20% reduction in the doses of combined rocuronium and cisatracurium, and that additional administration of NMBAs may, therefore, be required. There are hypotheses describing the existence of multiple binding sites at presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors, and different binding affinities of 2 &#x003b1; subunits of the acetylcholine receptor, although the pathophysiology of interaction between nondepolarizing NMBAs remains uncertain.<sup>[<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> Through our clinical investigation of synergism of combined NMBAs, binding affinities of acetylcholine receptor of combined NMBAs are considered to potentiate with 10%; however, further evaluation is needed. In addition, we suggest that using a combination of rocuronium and cisatracurium at the 10% reduced initial dose of NMBAs, clinically sufficient muscle relaxation may be achieved for surgery durations &#x02264;50&#x0200a;minutes.</p></sec><sec><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>We found that clinically effective neuromuscular blocking can be achieved with 10% reductions in combined doses of rocuronium and cisatracurium.
