Immunotherapy may shorten tuberculosis treatments and improve the immunity of individuals as well. Hence we study the efficacy of levamisole (LVM) (immunomodulator) as an adjuvant to chemotherapy of pulmonary tuberculosis patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted for 21 months in newly diagnosed sputum positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Patients were subjected initially to clinical examination, sputum acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, tuberculin skin test and weight record. During follow-up, above investigations were repeated. Sixty-five patients were randomly assigned into two groups to receive either tab LVM 100 mg once in a day or matching placebo, orally as a single dose, thrice a week, for 2 months with short-course antituberculosis chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Sputum negativity at 1 week was observed in 11 (44%) patients in LVM group whereas only 3 (12%) in placebo group. All the patients 25 (100%) in LVM group were sputum negative compared to 14 (56%) in placebo group by the end of 3 weeks. In LVM group, 24 (96%) and 11 (44%) patients in placebo group show radiological improvement at 2 months. A direct correlation existed between quantum of immune response and weight gain with LVM. LVM rendered all anergic patients to positive tuberculin reactors. In LVM group, patients with initial Mantoux &#x02265;20 mm and advanced cavitary disease, there was decrease in tuberculin reaction size.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Adjuvant immunomodulation with levamisole has the potential of shortening the total duration of antitubercular therapy.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Immune response</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>immunomodulator</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>mantoux test</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>tuberculosis</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Tuberculosis continues to be a major health problem despite the availability of effective chemotherapy.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] There are estimated 88 million new cases every year corresponding to 52 thousand deaths per week or more than 7000 deaths per day.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Mathematical modeling suggested that 3.2% (or 273,000) of the world's estimated new tuberculosis cases (95% CI: 185,000, 414,000) were drug-resistant cases in the year 2000.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Due to tubercle bacilli (TB) infection, there is immune suppression or dysregulation, where TH<sub>1</sub> type response offers protective immunity while mixed TH<sub>1</sub>-TH<sub>2</sub> response is detrimental.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The tuberculous infection has suppressive effects on cellular immunity.

Patients were recruited from those attending TB Outpatient Department, Department of Respiratory Medicine of a tertiary care teaching hospital. The inclusion criteria were newly diagnosed sputum-positive tuberculosis patients above the age of 15 years of either gender. Clinically, the symptom cough as an indicator of better response but as the bacteriological test is an objective parameter for the assessment of outcome of chemotherapy as per the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also there were supporting studies quoted by various authors,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] hence the bacteriological test (sputum acid-fast bacilli [AFB] smear and culture) was considered. The exclusion criteria were extra-pulmonary tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, pregnant, and lactating women and patients on long-term corticosteroid therapy. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria were explained about the trial, and provided with detailed information sheet in vernacular language understood by them. All their queries were answered. Informed consent was taken from those who agreed to participate. All the participants (<italic>n</italic> = 65) were given the following antitubercular treatment: Intensive phase (2 months treatment-orally) 300 mg isoniazid, 450 mg rifampicin, 1500 mg pyrazinamide and 800 mg ethambutol (daily) followed by continuation phase (4 months) isoniazid 300 mg and rifampicin 450 mg daily. All the patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria for the study were weighing &#x0003c;50 kg and the standard rifampicin dose for such patients was 450 mg in SCC as per the WHO guidelines.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>All 65 participants were randomly allocated to two groups.</p><p>Group 1 (LVM group): Tablet LVM 100 mg once in a day (OD) orally on alternate days under supervision during intensive phase of chemotherapy.

The identical placebo tablets were provided by a local pharmaceutical company. The antituberculosis drugs were supplied from the institutional pharmacy. Sputum smear for AFB, X-ray chest, tuberculin test, and body weight were recorded at the baseline. Bacteriological response (sputum negativity) was measured by microscopic examination of AFB bacilli; radiological response with chest X-ray and immunological response were measured by tuberculin skin test (TST).</p><p>In the follow-up period, bacteriological response as sputum negativity was determined every week for initial 2 months. Radiological response was tested at the end of 2 months while body weight gain was noted at 2 and 6 months. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), if any, were recorded at every visit.</p><p>After decoding it was found that there were 32 patients in the LVM group and 33 in the placebo group. Seven patients from LVM group and eight from placebo group dropped out during the trial as they were lost to follow-up. Independent physician and radiologist evaluated the radiological changes. Response to Mantoux (M<sub>x</sub>) test (delayed hypersensitivity) in the form of indurations measured in millimeters and development of tissue necrosis were used for the assessment of immune-competence status of participants.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Comparison of rate of sputum negativity, radiological improvement, and cavity closure between the two groups was done by using Fisher's exact test whereas unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to compare weight gain.

Early sputum negativity implies early cessation of multiplication and rapid killing of drug-sensitive bacilli. A rapid reduction of the bacterial population in the lesions averts deterioration of the disease and subsequent death as well as the further transmission of infection.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Studies in tubercular immunology have shown that MTB induces very early events dependent on the MTB bacillary load which in turn leads to immunosuppression or dysregulation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Therefore, along with early normalization of the immune response, it is important to kill mycobacteria rapidly.</p><p>It was observed that the degree of radiological improvement was significantly better in LVM-treated group compared to the group receiving the only antitubercular drug at the end of 2 months. Yet another study reported earlier cavity closure in LVM group than usual.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>The clinical improvement with LVM treatment was observed in 93.75% as compared to 50% observed by others.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The better response in our study could be explained on the basis that along with immunostimulant therapy, early killing of bacilli was achieved with effective SCC.</p><p>The increase in M<sub>x</sub> size after chemotherapy is known to be a good prognostic sign.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] In LVM group increase in M<sub>x</sub> size, more than 5 mm is definitely attributed to immunostimulatory action of LVM. However, three patients of LVM group with initial M<sub>x</sub> &#x0003e; 20 mm and one with 18 mm showed reversion in M<sub>x</sub> size. Out of these, two had advanced cavitary disease. These patients probably represent as having type-2 cytokine immune response against MTB. In these patients, immunomodulatory effect of LVM may have shifted the balance from TH<sub>2</sub> or mixed TH<sub>1</sub> and TH<sub>2</sub> toward TH<sub>1</sub> type response. Had it been an unfavorable response, patients would not have shown positive response in bacteriological, radiological responses, and weight gain. The patients became sputum negative within 7&#x02013;14 days, cavitation disappeared and in patients with far advanced cavitary disease, weight gain was more than 4 kg at the end of 2 months. This indicates that LVM shifts the balance from TH<sub>2</sub> type cytokine response to TH<sub>1</sub> type cytokine response. An animal study showed that LVM acts by resetting the immune balance toward type-1 response via induction of IL-18,[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] which we clinically observed.</p><p>The observed weight gain of 7.26% in LVM group suggests better clinical response which might be due to decreased level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or decrease in susceptibility of normal tissue to TNF brought about by immunomodulatory action of LVM through mechanisms unknown. Our observation that higher the M<sub>x</sub> change higher the weight gain favors the hypothesis that more the immune response as induced by LVM, more is the reduction in TNF reflected as increase in weight gain. It has been documented that TNF is responsible for loss of weight due to susceptibility of normal tissue to the destructive action of TNF.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>In this study, no severe adverse events were noted. Only a few patients had reported gastrointestinal upset which was managed conservatively, did not warrant withhold of medication.</p><p>However, there are reports of various side effects with use of LVM, but the incidence and severity of side effects are limited. Patients may complain of nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, shivers, and dizziness.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Furthermore, some reported allergy in atopic patients.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Agranulocytosis and blood dyscrasia were reported in patients receiving LVM for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, although agranulocytosis is reversible on discontinuation of LVM.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Regardless of the modalities of immunomodulation, whether drug (LVM or &#x003b2;-sitosterol)[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or organism (<italic>Mycobacterium vaccae</italic>),[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] immunotherapy along with chemotherapy plays a profound role in early alleviation of the suffering. With combination of immunotherapy as an adjunct to SCC of pulmonary tuberculosis, it may be possible to cut short the existing duration of chemotherapy. This would lead to improvement in patient compliance, early clinical cure, less development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and increase in productive life of the patient.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitation</title><p>During the study period, a total of 65 patients were enrolled fulfilling the inclusion criteria.
