Eighty-one 10-day-old conventional ducklings that were free of DuCV were randomly divided equally into three groups (1, 2 and 3). The ducklings in groups 1, 2 and 3 were inoculated intramuscularly with pIC-Mu2DuCV, wild-type virus GH01 and PBS, respectively. Subsequently, all of the ducklings were examined clinically, which were each given a physical condition score, and their rectal temperatures were taken daily during the experimental period. DuCV genomes in serum samples and in various tissues from all of the ducklings at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 21 and 28 DPC were detected by PCR and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The average daily weight gain (ADWG) of group 3 was significantly higher than those of groups 1 and 2, and the temperature of all ducklings was stable between 41.7&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C and 42.2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The clinical values (physical condition scores) of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 12.5, 15.6 and 0, respectively. In addition, viremia occurred at 15 and 10&#x000a0;days post-challenge (DPC) in groups 1 and 2, and antibodies could be detected in these ducklings at 21 and 15 DPC.

The DuCV virion is icosahedral, non-enveloped, and 15 to 16&#x000a0;nm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. DuCV was originally reported in two female 6-week-old Mulard ducks from a German farm; both ducks had a feathering disorder and poor body condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The virus has since been reported in Hungary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], Taiwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Mainland China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. DuCV has been detected in Muscovy, Mule and Pekin ducks, where it causes stunting and feather abnormalities. Although controversial, lymphoid depletion predisposes the host to immunosuppression, and disease progression is further complicated by co-infections with other bacterial and viral pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>DuCV consists of a single-stranded, circular DNA genome that contains approximately 1988&#x02013;1996 nucleotides (nts) and two major open reading frames (ORFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ORF1, denoted the <italic>rep</italic> gene, encodes the replication-associated protein, which is required for viral replication initiation. Meanwhile, ORF2, denoted the <italic>cap</italic> gene, encodes a viral structural and virulence-associated protein that stimulates the host immune response. The intergenic regions of these ORFs contain a stem loop, which is considered the site of viral DNA replication initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>At present, DuCV is not considered to be directly associated with a particular disease, although recent studies have suggested that DuCV partially contributes to lymphoid depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], may predispose the host to immunosuppression and may serve as an immunological trigger for further complicated disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Indeed, DuCV-affected ducks exhibited a higher prevalence and greater loads of other bacterial and viral pathogens than non-DuCV-affected ducks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the results from the above-mentioned studies do not support a direct association of DuCV with another pathogen or with host damage.</p><p>Due to the lack of a cell culture system for propagating DuCV, little is known regarding the molecular biology and pathogenesis of DuCV. To definitively characterize diseases associated with DuCV infection, an appropriate animal model is needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, reverse genetics is a powerful tool for addressing these questions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because infections with multiple different genotypes or subtypes of DuCV are common events, a biologically pure and isolated form of a specific DuCV that is generated from a full-length infectious DNA clone is also required to study the pathology due to a single phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To date, no infectious DNA clones of DuCV in cultured cells or animals have been reported; therefore, it is important to construct an infectious DuCV DNA clone that can be used as a model for studying the replication and transcription mechanisms of DuCV as well as for dissecting the structural and functional relationships between host and DuCV genes. Here, we describe the construction and initial <italic>in vivo</italic> characterization of full-length DNA clones of DuCV. Furthermore, the rescue of a DuCV containing the introduced genetic markers was confirmed by sequencing of viral DNA obtained from ducks experimentally inoculated with circular DuCV genomic DNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The experimental procedures were performed in strict accordance with the <italic>Guidance Suggestions for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and were approved by the National Institute of Animal Health Animal Care and Use Committee of Sichuan Agricultural University (Approval Number 2012&#x02013;032).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Viruses and animals</title><p>Duck circovirus strain GH01 (GenBank No. JX499186) was isolated and maintained at the Institute of Preventive Veterinary Medicine of Sichuan Agricultural University.

In particular, the molecular basis of the pathogenesis of this virus is unclear.</p><p>Reverse genetics is a powerful tool for addressing these questions, and in this study, we demonstrated the first generation of an infectious DNA clone of Sichuan isolate GH01. The main aim of our work was to produce a tandem-dimerized DuCV DNA clone. We further inserted an <italic>Xho</italic> I restriction enzyme site into the DuCV genome of the pIC-2DuCV clone to introduce a genetic marker that could be used to discriminate between the cloned virus and the potential indigenous viruses in the subsequent animal study. The recombinant pIC-2DuCV and pIC-Mu2DuCV plasmids and the pUC19 vector were inoculated intramuscularly into five ducklings. It appeared that both the pIC-2DuCV and pIC-Mu2DuCV DNA concatemers were replication-competent when transfected <italic>in vivo</italic> because they mimicked the natural DuCV circular genome. The rescue of pIC-2DuCV and pIC-Mu2DuCV was then demonstrated through <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiments.</p><p>Ideally, the sequence of an infectious clone should be completely identical to that of the parental virus, but this goal is difficult to achieve in practice because during clone construction, some mutations will invariably occur during PCR amplification. In addition, other mutations have to be introduced for cloning purposes and for distinguishing the mutant from the parental virus. Thus, comparing the biological properties of an infectious clone-derived virus and its parental strain is important. Subsequent analysis revealed that the rescued and parental viruses had nearly identical biological characteristics in terms of clinical features, antigenicity, proliferation, distribution, and overall infectivity. The genetic marker that was engineered into the clone was used to confirm that the progeny virus was derived from the DNA clone and not from a contaminating virus. The number of copies of the engineered virus genome increased during infection, with the highest numbers (8.34&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>4</sup>) observed at 21 DPC, and this increase was followed by a decline, which was similar to the trend observed for the parental virus (5.47&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>5</sup>). The real-time qPCR results showed that the rescued virus displayed growth kinetics very similar to those of the parental virus. The titers of the parental virus were usually slightly higher than the those obtained for the rescued virus, a result that may be real and reflect mutations and genetic defects of the rescued virus, but the differences in titers and replications were quite small at all times. The virus that was rescued from ducklings infected with this mutated, full-length clone had the same growth properties as the parental virus, which demonstrates that the infectious DuCV clone is an excellent tool for site-directed mutagenesis and, importantly, that the recombinant virus generated in this study is capable of establishing an infection and displays similar pathogenicity as the parental virus in the natural host.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we constructed a genetically stable and similarly pathogenic infectious clone of DuCV, which will facilitate studies of the pathogenesis, host tropism, replication, and transcription of this virus. This study shows that the rescued viruses are not significantly different but exhibit lower pathogenicity and proliferation ability compared with the parental virus. Further study is needed to explore the replication, host-DuCV interactions, and clinical significance of RMDV and WT-DuCV. In summary, we report the first demonstration that cloned DuCV genomic DNA with a genetic marker is infectious when directly injected into ducklings. In addition, we confirmed that the clinical signs of the ducklings injected with RMDV are similar to those of ducklings injected with WT-DuCV.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Pengfei Li, Zhilong Zhang and Renyong Jia contributed equally to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>PFL and ZLZ performed the experiments, data analysis and drafted the manuscript.
