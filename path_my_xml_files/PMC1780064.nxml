Many heroin users spend time in prison. People addicted to heroin often require prescribed medication when attempting to cease their drug use. The most commonly used detoxification agents in UK prisons are buprenorphine, dihydrocodeine and methadone. However, national guidelines do not state a detoxification drug of choice. Indeed, there is a paucity of research evaluating the most effective treatment for opiate detoxification in prisons. This study seeks to address the paucity by evaluating routinely used interventions amongst drug using prisoners within UK prisons.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The Leeds Evaluation of Efficacy of Detoxification Study (LEEDS) Prisons Pilot Study will use randomised controlled trial methodology to compare the open use of buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine for opiate detoxification, given in the context of routine care, within HMP Leeds. Prisoners who are eligible and give informed consent will be entered into the trial. The primary outcome measure will be abstinence status at five days post detoxification, as determined by a urine test. Secondary outcomes during the detoxification and then at one, three and six months post detoxification will be recorded.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In the United Kingdom (U.K), there is an extensive market for the sale of heroin, an illicit class 'A' drug. Precise figures of how many people use and are dependent on heroin are difficult to establish as there has never been a national prevalence survey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The link between crime and illicit drug use, specifically heroin use, is well recognised. In 2002, 63% of injecting drug users (IDUs) in contact with specialist drugs services in England and Wales reported having ever been in prison or a young offenders' institution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Those addicted to illicit opiates such as heroin require medical help in reducing and stopping their use due to the drug's highly addictive properties.</p><p>Neither the current evidence base [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] nor the national guidelines on the clinical management of drug misuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] stipulate a 'drug of choice' for rapid opiate detoxification. In the absence of an established evidence base, a wide variety of agents have therefore been used including methadone, dihydrocodeine, buprenorphine, lofexidine and clonidine. Historically within prisons, the most commonly used drug for opiate detoxification has been dihydrocodeine. Anecdotally this was because of a reluctance to prescribe methadone following a small number of methadone related deaths in the prison setting. Dihydrocodeine is attractive to clinicians as it has a shorter half-life than methadone, and seems equally acceptable to users. However, there has been a move away from prescribing dihydrocodeine due to its potential for diversion by prisoners into the prison shadow economy. Increasingly, buprenorphine is now being prescribed and recent policy supports methadone prescribing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Buprenorphine &#x02013; in the form of sub-lingual tablets &#x02013; is relatively new for the purpose of opiate detoxification in the UK, especially within the prison estate. It has the potential advantage of having a good safety profile, better retention in treatment and lower withdrawal severity when compared to methadone, lofexidine or clonidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Her Majesty's Prison (HMP) Leeds saw a 42% increase in buprenorphine prescribing between April 2002 and January 2004. Buprenorphine is increasingly being prescribed in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>There appears to be a paucity of clinical trials conducted in the UK prison setting which have evaluated medication for opiate detoxification. Whilst one study evaluated the withdrawal severity of methadone and lofexidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the rates of completion were not sufficient to detect a statistically significant difference between the two medications. One study has compared sublingual buprenorphine with dihydrocodeine for postoperative pain, outside of the prison setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In 2004, the Leeds Evaluation of Efficacy of Detoxification Study (LEEDS) team conducted the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to compare buprenorphine and dihydrocodeine for opiate detoxification in the community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The results have recently been submitted for publication. The LEEDS trial has since expanded to evaluate the open use of buprenorphine versus dihydrocodeine in the prison primary healthcare setting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>LEEDS is a pragmatic open label randomised controlled trial.</p><p>Randomisation will be random block size, which will be administered centrally in the Academic Department of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, University of Leeds. Opaque consecutively numbered envelopes will be prepared. If a prisoner is both eligible and agreeable the next envelope will be opened and the intervention allocated.</p><p>Confounding variables i.e. doctor participant relationships, drugs worker participant relationships will all be controlled for by randomisation. Some confounding variables cannot be randomised. These include the inherent difference in the two detoxification programmes, i.e. the daily supervised consumption of buprenorphine.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting and recruitment</title><p>The study will take place in prison primary healthcare at HMP Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. HMP Leeds is a category B local prison, which accepts all adult male prisoners aged 21 and over from West Yorkshire. Participants will be recruited from the medical reception area on first arrival into the prison, where prisoners are routinely offered at detoxification regime.</p><p>LEEDS is intended to complement rather than compete with research taking place in a community primary or secondary care setting. Much of the current evidence base for pharmacological treatment of drug use comes from studies that have taken place in an inpatient or residential setting. There is an urgent need to verify whether such research is applicable to the prison primary healthcare environment. The ethos of the study will be a collaborative project between prison primary healthcare, primary care and the secondary care academic departments and service providers.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>Currently no randomised controlled trials relevant to these comparisons have been undertaken in the prison setting. However, from the results of our community study comparing these agents we estimate that with a sample size of 120 we will have a finding of clinical and statistical significance. Power calculations were undertaken using Sample Power 1.20 developed by SPSS Inc., comparing two groups (60 individuals in each) and for &#x003b1; = 0.05 (two-sided).

Firstly, once data collection is complete, we hope to show either a statistically significant difference between the efficacy of the two detoxification agents or alternatively, that no statistically significant difference exists. We expect that the results will influence prison healthcare policy if the trial demonstrates one detoxification agent is significantly more efficacious than another. This may begin locally within HMP Leeds and potentially influence prison prescribing policy nationally.</p><p>Information about the methodological practicalities of conducting a randomised controlled trial in the prison setting will be enormously valuable. The research team have previously described the practicalities of conducting a detoxification RCT in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Yet, to our knowledge, only one British prison RCT comparing detoxification agents exists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, conducting this current trial will provide a wealth of previously unknown knowledge about the feasibility, practicality and day to day groundwork and management involved in running a trial in the prison environment. This information may be important for future research teams, and will also demonstrate that trials can be done within prisons.</p><p>Given the factors above, the importance of this study cannot be under estimated. Guidelines for substance misuse treatment in prison are not grounded on an established evidence base as there is an extreme paucity of trials conducted in this setting. Consequently, the project team envisage that this trial will provide invaluable data about the efficacy of two routinely used detoxification agents which have rarely been studied within the prison environment.</p><sec><title>Approvals process</title><p>Research Governance approval was granted by Bradford South and West Primary Care Trust (PCT) on 20<sup>th </sup>April 2004.
