Patients in group 2 received injections of Lupuzor 200&#x02005;&#x003bc;g at weeks 0 (baseline), 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10.

The primary end point was the percentage of patients who achieved a response according to the SLE Responder Index (SRI) at week 12. Patients who showed a reduction from baseline in the SLEDAI-2K score of &#x02265;4 points, no increase in the PGA score of &#x0003e;0.3 point on a visual analogue scale of 0&#x02013;3, no new A score on the BILAG-2004 and &#x02264;1 new B score were considered to be SRI responders. Secondary end points included changes from baseline in the SLEDAI-2K, BILAG-2004 changes and PGA scores and the percentages of patients with disease flares according to the Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) Flare Index.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref> Treatment failures were considered to have occurred in patients who had a severe flare according to the SELENA Flare Index, received an increase in steroid dose to &#x02265;80&#x02005;mg prednisone equivalent each week, received intravenous steroids, received an increased dose or initiation of immunosuppressive therapy, or received biological agents, and these patients were withdrawn from the study.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of 204 patients (68 patients for each treatment group) was considered to be sufficient to detect a 20% difference in the proportion of patients achieving a clinical response according to the SRI, assuming that 25% of patients in the placebo group and 45% of patients treated with Lupuzor achieved an SRI response. Efficacy analyses were conducted on all randomised patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of the study drug and had at least one efficacy measurement recorded. Patients who discontinued treatment or for whom treatment had failed (see above) were considered to be non-responders in the efficacy analysis. The last observation was carried forward and used in place of missing values for continuous variables in the efficacy analysis. Discrete variables were analysed using a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. Continuous variables that approximately adhered to a normal distribution according to the D'Agostino k-squared test were determined using an analysis of variance. Continuous variables that were not normally distributed were analysed using a Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test. Statistical significance was set at &#x003b1;=0.050 (two-sided) for each Lupuzor treatment group versus placebo.</p><p>A non-scheduled interim analysis was conducted to determine if the study needed to be stopped for safety and/or efficacy reasons and to inform the clinical development programme. The interim analysis included 114 randomised patients (approximately two-thirds of the initially planned sample size) from the target population who should have completed the treatment period (week 12) at the date of analysis as well as all patients having completed week 24 at the cut-off date. The efficacy measure for the interim analysis was the percentage of patients with a reduction of &#x02265;4 points in the SLEDAI-2K score from baseline to week 12 and week 24. The results of the interim analysis were reviewed by an interim data review committee and the decision was made to stop enrolment of new patients and to let the 149 patients already enrolled complete the study.</p><p>This study is registered under European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials (EudraCT) number 2007-004892-21.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study groups</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202460F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows the trial profile.

The patient in group 1 with pneumonia was the only one to die during the study. In the investigator's opinion, the pneumonia was not related to treatment with the study drug, although the concomitant administration of azathioprine and prednisone was considered to have contributed to the development of pneumonia. No clinically significant changes in haematology, chemistry, urine analysis, vital signs results or electrocardiography findings were reported during the course of the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study show that administration of 200&#x02005;&#x003bc;g Lupuzor via subcutaneous injection every 4&#x02005;weeks significantly reduced disease activity in patients with SLE who were receiving SOC. In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated the subgroup of patients considered as the target population with a clinical SLEDAI-2K score &#x02265;6 at baseline, which constituted about 90% of the overall study population. In this target population the percentage of patients receiving Lupuzor every 4&#x02005;weeks who achieved an SRI response during the treatment period was statistically higher than that of the placebo group. The difference between the group receiving Lupuzor every 2&#x02005;weeks and the placebo group did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>During the course of this study an interim analysis was performed post hoc for licensing purposes, and these results had to be disclosed according to the London Stock Exchange rules. This had an impact on the final ITT week 24 results for both overall and target populations as can be seen when the interim week 24 SLEDAI results (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202460TB2">table 2</xref>) recorded before the disclosure in the target population and those of the ITT target population are compared. The responder rate in group 1 decreased from 84% (interim) to 69% (final), but the absolute number of responders increased, whereas in the placebo group the responder rate increased from 45.8% to 56.5%. In group 2, the changes were limited. The SRI responses in the placebo group were particularly increased and the differences between the Lupuzor and placebo group were no longer statistically significant. It has to be mentioned that in groups 1 and 2 of the interim analysis (the active groups), the 12-week period provided 88% and 83% of the total SLEDAI responders versus 62% in the placebo group, indicating that the disclosure effect was huge. Therefore the week 24 data of the ITT group cannot be properly analysed from a clinical point of view. We wonder if the data recorded before the disclosure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2012202460TB2">table 2</xref>) are not the ones which correctly reflect the efficacy of Lupuzor.</p><p>Another point to discuss is the role of the inclusion criteria&#x02014;namely, the use of clinical SLEDAI compared with SLEDAI. Comparing the number of responders in the target population and those of the overall population it appears that there is no change. Exactly the same number of responders was recorded in the three groups in the overall population and the target population. This indicates that the commonly used inclusion criterion (SLEDAI score &#x02265;6) creates a bias in the evaluation of the study results in falsely reducing the response rate and therefore statistical analysis. In our study, changes in component 20 (complement) and/or 21 (anti-DNA antibodies) inducing a change in the SLEDAI score occurred only once in week 12 and 24 assessments but had no effect on the absolute number of responders. The anti-DNA antibody levels are either below four and remain below four (threshold value of DNA binding in the SLEDAI score when measures are based on the Farr assay) or are very high. In one published study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref> high anti-DNA antibody levels were requested as an inclusion criterion. In a previous study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> we demonstrated that anti-DNA antibody levels decreased by more than 20% during treatment but never reached the threshold level. This was also the case in this study. In summary, if the end point of a clinical study in SLE is a reduction of the SLEDAI score of at least four points only clinical parameters can reasonably be involved. One has therefore to give enough &#x02018;room&#x02019; in the inclusion criteria to allow this modification of four points in the clinical parameters. The use of a clinical SLEDAI inclusion criterion is therefore justified.</p><p>Lupuzor was generally well tolerated. The most common AE was injection-site erythema, which was generally mild. No unexpected serious AEs were reported. One patient who received Lupuzor died owing to pneumonia during the treatment period of the study. This patient had been previously treated with immunosuppressant agents and the investigator did not attribute this event to the study drug. Two patients in the placebo group also had pneumonia during the study. Thus, while there did not appear to be an increased incidence of serious infections with Lupuzor in this short study, longer-term studies are needed to further characterise the overall tolerability profile of Lupuzor.</p><p>Several limitations must be considered when interpreting the results of this study. First, the study was stopped before the planned enrolment was complete. However, the results reached statistical significance, demonstrating that Lupuzor was better than placebo. Second, the treatment period was only 12&#x02005;weeks. However, the response of patients in the Lupuzor groups did not weaken during the subsequent 12-week follow-up period but did not increase strongly. A longer treatment period appears necessary to increase the number of responders.</p><p>The peptide P140/Lupuzor is a promiscuous MHC class II binder that is recognised in this context by the T cell receptor of CD4 T cells from lupus patients and mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> In this molecular pathway it might act as an altered peptide ligand of the T cell receptor leading to a change of autoreactive T cell phenotype and a deviation of cytokines that are secreted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> On the other hand, we showed in MRL/lpr mice that via its interaction with the HSC70 chaperone, P140 peptide might also operate by altering the autophagic flux, thus reducing the stability of MHC class II dimer in antigen-presenting cells and the presentation of self-antigens to autoreactive T cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> This mechanism of action of P140 peptide that targets autoreactive T cells is thus totally distinct from the one of B cell-depleting anti-BLyS monoclonal antibody belimumab, which was recently approved for the treatment of SLE. In phase III clinical trials, significantly higher SRI rates were noted with belimumab than with placebo at week 52.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>
