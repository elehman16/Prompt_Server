Besides, for patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy, stress response and inflammatory reaction harmful for rehabilitation may be also induced by the operation trauma, which manifested as elevated blood pressure, heart rate and blood glucose, and the release of inflammatory factors, such as IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;.</p><p>Pre-emptive analgesia is a way of pain intervention before noxious stimulation which has been reported to be potent to relieve the postoperative pain by relieving the pain of peripheral and central sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the pathogenesis of postoperative pain is complicated involving inflammatory, neurogenic, and visceral mechanisms, and single-mode analgesic medication is not quite efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The combination of different analgesic drugs and different methods of analgesia (multimodal pre-emptive analgesia) is a relatively novel method for pain intervention. Though many studies have been reported on multimodal pre-emptive analgesia, no consensus has been achieved, and the effects on stress response and inflammatory reaction related with multimodal pre-emptive analgesia are seldom reported.</p><p>Therefore, in the present study, we aimed to find the effects of multimodal pre-emptive analgesia by different combination of preoperative and postoperative analgesic drugs on pain control, stress response and inflammatory factors of patients undergoing transabdominal hysterectomy which may provide reference for clinical analgesia.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>The sample size was determined by using the statistical software program PASS 2008 (NCSS, Kaysville, UT, USA) using preliminary data obtained in our hospital with the following assumptions: &#x003b1; of 0.05 (two-tailed), power of 90%, P1 (Treatment Group Proportion) of 0.7, and P2 (Control Group Proportion) of 0.2. Therefore, a minimum of 18 patients per group was calculated.</p><p>One hundred female patients who require transabdominal hysterectomy were enrolled in this randomized and double-blind study from the department of anesthesiology, the Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Nantong University, Jiangyin, Jiangsu, China, with approval from the medical Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Nantong University and written consent obtained from the participants. The inclusion criteria were physical status American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) I- II, aged between 30 and 55&#x000a0;years (mean age of 46.54&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.72), weighted between 50 and 75 kilogram (mean weight of 62.52&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.49&#x000a0;kg) undergoing transabdominal hysterectomy, and the operation time was between 55 and 80&#x000a0;min (mean time of 67.39&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.74&#x000a0;min). Exclusion criteria were contraindication for epidural puncture, known allergy to local anesthetics, the patients with previous history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease or other medical history, the patients consumed opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) preoperatively, and patients with physiological and psychological disorders. A random allocation number table was used for grouping the patients by two experienced chief physician: control group (Group C), multimodal pre-emptive analgesia group 1 (Group P1), multimodal pre-emptive analgesia group 2 (Group P2), and multimodal pre-emptive analgesia group 3 (Group P3). All patients had benign lesions of the uterus, where 83 cases of uterine fibroids, 12 cases of adenomyosis, and 5 cases of endometriosis. No significant difference was found between the groups of patients in age, weight, operation time or history (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05).

Therefore, postoperative pain treatment should be combined with comprehensive measures to improve the analgesic effect and reduce adverse reactions. Perioperative pain can cause systemic stress response, and stimulate the release of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and other cytokines involved in inflammation and immune response by mononuclear macrophages and neutrophils. Studies have shown that adequate analgesia can reduce the level of stress response, reduce immune function suppression and promote postoperative rehabilitation.</p><p>Pre-emptive analgesia, first introduced by Woolf [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] in 1983, is an antinociceptive treatment that reduces central sensitization and prevents establishment of altered processing of afferent input, which amplifies postoperative pain. Pre-emptive analgesia is found to be potent in preventing severe pain perception which may develop postoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Despite advances in pre-emptive anesthesia and analgesia along with improved delivery systems, single-mode analgesia continues to be the mainstay for treatment of postoperative pain. However, single-mode analgesia such as opioids can oftentimes lead to inadequate pain control or increase in the incidence of adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In the last two decades, evidence-based multimodal analgesia has become increasingly widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Multimodal analgesia refers to the combination of different mode of analgesic drugs and incorporation of regional anesthesia to reduce the peripheral and central pain sensitization, and it is a promising alternative that may reduce needs for high doses and dependence on analgesia drugs along with any potential associated adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Therefore, we speculate that the combination of multimodal analgesia and pre-emptive analgesia (multimodal pre-emptive analgesia) may have a better analgesic effect on pain management, reflected by an improved pain scoring, and a reduction of side-effects compared to the morphine group. The aim of this study was to evaluate multimodal pre-emptive analgesia consisting of flurbiprofen, fentanyl and ketamine intravenously or epidurally in patients undergoing transabdominal hysterectomy, and to find the possible mechanisms by exploring the effects on stress response and inflammatory factors.</p><p>In this study, intravenous flurbiprofen, and epidural fentanyl with ketamine were used for pre-emptive analgesia study, and patient-controlled analgesia with fentanyl was used after surgery. The results shows that both pre-emptive analgesia with intravenous flurbiprofen, and epidural fentanyl with ketamine can significantly extend initial press time of analgesia, significantly reduce 24&#x000a0;h dosage of analgesia, and significantly reduce 6&#x000a0;h, 12&#x000a0;h, and 24&#x000a0;h VAS scores after surgery, indicating the pre-emptive analgesia effects of different analgesic drugs intravenously or epidurally which is consistent with most reported literatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Flurbiprofen, Fentanyl and Ketamine are three different modes of analgesia drugs. Flurbiprofen, a member of the phenylalkanoic acid derivative family of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) used to treat inflammation, has been shown to have pre-emptive analgesia effects by clinical studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Fentanyl is commonly used as a potent, synthetic opioid analgesic with a rapid onset and short duration of action. Latest studies demonstrated that pre-emptive low dose of fentanyl could effectively prevent fentanyl-induced cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Epidural Fentanyl has also been shown to have pre-emptive analgesia effects. Ketamine is as an <italic>N</italic>-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. Sub-anesthetic doses of epidural ketamine can significantly reduce intraoperative and postoperative pain, but 0.15&#x000a0;mg/kg ketamine was reported not efficient in inducing pre-emptive analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the present study, we find the possible synergistic effect of epidural fentanyl with ketamine in pre-emptive analgesia. Besides, we find significant lower VAS score with multimodul pre-emptive analgesia compared with single mode pre-emptive analgesia, suggesting the possible synergistic effect of multimodal pre-emptive analgesia drugs. We find no significant difference of initial press time of analgesia, 24&#x000a0;h dosage of analgesia, and adverse reactions between multimodal pre-emptive analgesia group and single mode pre-emptive analgesia group, which may be limited to the small amounts of patients, but also suggesting that the safety of intravenous flurbiprofen, epidural fentanyl and ketamine.</p><p>Glucose and cortisol are two common indicators widely used for evaluating stress response of body. The higher level of glucose and cortisol indicate the stronger stress response. In the study, we find that 1d and 2d postoperative, both the serum level of cortisol and level of glucose in Group P1, P2 and P3 were significantly lower than that in Group C (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and that in Group P2 and P3 were significantly lower that that in Group P1 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), suggesting that multi-mode pre-emptive analgesia effectively suppress the occurrence of postoperative stress response, and the combination of analgesia drugs with multi-mode mechanisms by different routes of administration shows significant inhibition on stress response, which may be related to the inhibition of pain generation.</p><p>IL-6 is an interleukin that acts as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and plays an important role in nerve- endocrine-immune system. IL-6, a functional cytokine with biological activity closely, is associated with immune status, surgical trauma and prognosis. TNF-&#x003b1; is a cytokine with a variety of endogenous biological activity, regulating the inflammatory response and immune response. The elevation of TNF-&#x003b1; is associated with surgical trauma and intensity of pain stimulus. In the study, we found that 1d and 2d postoperative, both the serum level of IL-6 and level of TNF-&#x003b1; in Group P1, P2 and P3 were significantly lower than that in Group C (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05); and that in Group P2 and P3 were significantly lower that that in Group P1 (P&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>), indicating that multi-mode pre-emptive analgesia can effectively suppress postoperative inflammatory reaction in transabdominal hysterectomy, and the combination of analgesia drugs with multi-mode mechanisms by different routes of administration shows better analgesic effect.</p><p>Stress response and inflammatory response are always existed before postoperative rehabilitation. The duration of pre-emptive analgesia should include the entire period of noxious stimuli acting on the central nervous system (central sensitization and postoperative incisional pain caused by surgery, and secondary inflammation). However, in the present study, we only observe the effects at 1&#x000a0;day and 2&#x000a0;days after surgery which is a limitation. However, our preliminary study showed that multimodal pre-emptive analgesia was better than a single-mode pre-emptive analgesia without increasing adverse reactions, and multimodal pre-emptive analgesia could significantly lower VAS score, inhibit stress response, and reduce inflammatory response in patients undergoing transabdominal hysterectomy. Though the ideal multimodal pre-emptive analgesic drugs and mode of administration are still not standardized, we believe that with further elucidation in function of the dorsal root ganglia, the development of molecular biology and pain mechanisms, the ideal multimodal pre-emptive analgesia will be an important strategy for pain control clinically.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The preliminary study showed that multimodal pre-emptive analgesia was better than a single-mode pre-emptive analgesia without increasing adverse reactions, and multimodal pre-emptive analgesia could significantly lower VAS score, inhibit stress response, and reduce inflammatory response in patients undergoing transabdominal hysterectomy, demonstrating that multimodal pre-emptive analgesia could be a rational strategy for pain control. However, the ideal multimodal pre-emptive analgesic drugs and mode of administration are far from standardized which need to be further studied in future.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>The specific contributions of all authors are as follows: JC: designed study, analyzed data, revised the paper and final approval of the version to be published.
