Patients with personality disorders are commonly seen in treatment programs for substance abuse, consume a disproportionate amount of staff time, and are more likely to drop out from substance abuse treatment interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>At the same time, therapists and other professionals tend to react negatively to patients with personality disorders at an emotional level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], this is especially the case with cluster B (dramatic/erratic) personality disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Even if patients with personality disorders benefit from treatment, they often remain more symptomatic than patients without personality disorders, and remain at a lower level of functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, treatment that meets the needs of patients with substance abuse and personality disorders is needed.

After the completion of the intake interview, patients are informed by the caseworker of the fact that a study of psychopathology is ongoing at the unit. If the patient agrees to receive further information, a researcher is contacted, which immediately comes to the office of the key-worker to meet the patient and schedules an intake interview.</p></sec><sec><title>Baseline interview</title><p>At the baseline interview, the interviewer informs the patient of the study, and explains that the study focuses of psychological and behavioural problems that people with substance abuse regularly encounter. He then explains that there are two different interviews, and that patients will be randomly assigned to one of two types. If asked, he will explain that he does not yet know what kind of interview he will conduct the second time they meet, but he will give a further explanation at their second appointment. If the patient gives consent to participate in the study, a brief structured assessment of axis I disorders is conducted.

The patient will first receive a brief description of what personality disorders is, and be given a brief description of personality disorders as inflexible, maladaptive patterns of behaviour that cause significant problems or distress for themselves or others.</p><p>The interview will consist of the following elements:</p><p>&#x02022; The Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disorders Interview Schedule (AUDADIS) section for avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid and histrionic personality disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

The interview is client-driven and follows an ethnographic approach.</p><p>These interviews are taped and used as the basis for a condensed summary in the feedback</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Randomization will be conducted by means of a predefined list of random numbers, stratified by predefined characteristics, which will not be disclosed at this point to reduce risk of breaking of blind. Randomization is executed according to a list, the allocation sequence of which was computer-generated by one of the researchers (MH). The interviewer will be blinded to randomization at the baseline interview.</p><p>The follow-up interviewers will be introduced to the patients at the baseline interview, to assure blinded follow-up assessments.</p></sec><sec><title>Withdrawal</title><p>A participant can withdraw from the trial at any point, although information already given to caseworkers cannot be withdrawn.

Interviewers will be blinded to randomization status. The follow-up interview will contain the same elements as the baseline interview (i.e., the K6, the ASRS, the WSAS, the OTI, and the SDS). Also, patients will be asked to rate the value of the feedback procedure on visual analogue scales representing the skills of the interviewer (on a line ranging from "extremely unskilled" to "extremely skilled"), his knowledge (from very little knowledge, to highly knowledgeable), his degree of interest in the patient, his understanding of the patient, the value of the feedback for the treatment, the value of the treatment for the patient, how much thought the patient has given the feedback, and how much work he has done in regard to the issues discussed in the feedback.</p><p>Finally, the patient is asked to rate his alliance with the caseworker using the Working alliance inventory, patient version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>At each interview point, the caseworker is asked to rate the patient using the clinical global impression scale with anchor points for alcohol and drug abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], externalizing behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and GAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and to complete the Working Alliance Inventory, clinician version [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data handling and record keeping</title><p>Patient information will only be accessible to the research team.

Electronic data will be stored on a central computer at the research centre.</p><p>A personal feedback letter will be given to the patient, in which the patient appears only with his or her first letter. If the patient agrees that the information in the personal feedback should be shared with the caseworker, then the same letter will be given to the caseworker. Raw data will, however, only be kept and stored by the Centre for Alcohol and Drug Research.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome evaluation</title><p>A single measure of outcome will be used as the primary outcome measure: The proportion of areas in which a 30% reduction occurred at each follow-up wave (K6, WSAS, and OTI substance use). This measure can theoretically range from -3 (deterioration in all areas) to +3 (improvement in all areas.</p><p>The data will be analyzed with mixed effects ordinal regression, using baseline values of the three outcome measures as covariates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Risks and anticipated benefits for trial participants and society, including how the benefits justify the risks</title><p>Patients with substance use disorders and co-morbid personality disorder experience a number of serious problems. Patients with co-morbid personality disorder tend to remain symptomatic long after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and patients with some co-morbid personality disorders tend to commit a substantial amount of the crime that substance abusers commit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>If the findings of this study show that personality assessment can significantly improve the functioning of patients with substance use disorders, this can have significant impacts on both the quality of life of patients, and on society.</p><p>The main risk of this study is that patients experience a worsening of psychiatric symptoms or substance use as a reaction to receiving a feedback concerning their own personal functioning. There is some indication that symptoms may fail to improve with focus on personality, even if this focus improves substance use and therapeutic alliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We will monitor psychiatric symptoms every 3 months during the study, and patients have access to caseworker, psychiatrist and psychologist at the treatment centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Institutional Review Boards in Denmark do not approve or disapprove of trials or other studies of psychosocial interventions. The medical director of social medicine in the City of Copenhagen, M.D. Peter Ege, read and approved the protocol in Danish. Patients will be given full information about the nature of the study, and be asked to give informed consent. Patients who refuse participation in the study will be given full access to all regular treatment services in the organisation, similar to the control group.</p><p>Ethically, the issues related to this study concerns the consequences of receiving serious diagnoses for which there is no clear and simple treatment, in particular personality disorders. However, although there is no simple treatment, patients are given suggestions and support, and have access to the support of the treatment centres</p><p>When patients in this trial are assessed, they also receive feedback and advice about how to handle the issues involved, and their caseworkers are given feedback and advice on how to best support patients.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper describes the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial concerning personality disorder assessment and feedback versus an open interview. The aim of this study is to assess the potential value of personality disorder assessment for referral and casework in a real-life setting. The study design described above has specific strengths and limitations.</p><p>The study has a single-blind design, where patients are unaware if their treatment is designated as an "experimental" or "control" treatment. Follow-up interviewers are blinded to allocation, and we have procedures to reduce the risk that follow-up interviewers are made aware of subjects' status (i.e., follow-up interviewers make contact with patients before randomization is known; patients are told not to disclose details about the interview to the follow-up interviewers).</p><p>The study uses an attention placebo design, which means that the effects of time and attention are controlled for. Research has shown strong assessment reactivity in substance use outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], meaning that patients who are exposed to assessment show improvement only for that reason. The amount of contact is controlled for in this trial. This means that if significant effects are found, they give strong support to the efficacy of personality disorder assessment.</p><p>The setting in which the study takes place is a community service. This means that although training and supervision is provided for caseworkers, the caseworkers are not primarily working with the research project. While this may reduce the potential efficacy of the intervention, it means that the study is in a sense between an efficacy trial and an effectiveness study.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The first author of the article, MH, occasionally does paid training in understanding and assessing personality disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MH originally conceived of the study, and wrote the application to the Health Insurance Fund.
