A prospective randomized trial was conducted on 60 patients with stage III and IV diabetic foot ulcers (International Association of Enterostomal Therapy classification) and patients were divided randomly in three different therapy groups - antiseptics, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, recombinant platelet derived growth factor, with 20 patients in each group. Patients were managed initially on inpatient and then on outpatient basis till the ulcer healed completely. Results among three groups were compared using unpaired T test and the level of significance was set at P&#x0003c;0.05 using ANOVA. This study compares the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy, antiseptic dressings, and rhPDGF in grade III and IV diabetic foot ulcers. P value (0.0348) was significant for complete wound contraction while p value healing time (0.6534) and ulcer size (0.0593) in the groups was not significant. PDGF is safe, effective and easy to apply. Results are comparable with hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy and cost of treatment is lower than other therapies. Diabetic foot ulcer management requires multidisciplinary and aggressive approach. PDGF should be recommended for all grade III and IV diabetic foot ulcer at least 8 weeks old. HBO is equally good an option but has limitations and side effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>diabetic foot ulcers</kwd><kwd>antiseptic dressing</kwd><kwd>hyperbaric oxygen therapy</kwd><kwd>platelet derived growth factor gel</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="3"/><table-count count="6"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="17"/><page-count count="5"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes mellitus is characterized by a state of hyperglycemia, resulting from a diversity of etiologies, environmental and genetic, acting jointly [World Health Organization&#x02019;s definition (WHO, 1980)]. Chronic hyperglycemia, from whatever cause, leads to a number of complications- cardiovascular, renal, neurological, ocular and recurrent infections. The WHO defines diabetic foot as the lower limb of a diabetic patient that has the potential risk of pathologic consequences, including infection, ulceration, and/or destruction of deep tissues associated with neurological abnormalities, various degrees of peripheral vascular disease, and/or metabolic complications of diabetes.</p><p>The risk of lower extremity amputation is 15 to 46 times higher in diabetics<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> and lower limb amputations are associated with diabetes in 40% to 90% of cases. Among diabetics, about 15% may experience a foot ulcer in their lifetime and about 14-24% of them may require an amputation.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref> In India the prevalence of foot ulcer is 2.1% to 12.4% among diabetics. Early detection and appropriate treatment of these ulcers may prevent large number of these amputations. Clinical studies show that foot ulcers precede 85% of non traumatic lower extremity amputations among diabetics.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> The factors related to the development of foot ulcers are peripheral neuropathy, minor foot trauma, and foot deformities.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Percentages of 60% to 70% of diabetic foot ulcers are purely due to peripheral neuropathy, 15% to 20% to peripheral vascular disease, and the remaining are related to a combination (neuroischemia). The annual population based incidence of foot ulcers in people with type 1 or 2 diabetes is 1.9% to 2.2%.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5-7</sup></xref> This study is an attempt to compare three treatment options <italic>viz.</italic> simple dressing, hyperbaric oxygen therapy and platelet derived growth factor gel, in patients with stage 3 and 4 diabetic foot ulcer [International Association of Enterostomal Therapy (IAET) classification], and their role in reducing the incidence of amputation. We have utilized IAET<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> classification (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table001">Table 1</xref>) for staging of diabetic foot ulcers in our study as this classification is preferable for evaluation because most of studies have utilized this classification for evaluation of the treatment because of its ease and simplicity.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref><sup>,</sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> An ideal classification system should be easy to use, practical and clear.

Other classifications for diabetic foot ulcers are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table002 table003 table004">Tables 2-4</xref>.</p><p>In this study we have compared platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) gel with antiseptic dressings and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. PDGF consists of a family of growth factors consisting of two polypeptide chains (A and B) which forms the dimers, or protein pairs: PDGF (AA, AB, BB). Recombinant human (rh)PDGF-BB is the only topical growth factor to be approved for the purpose of wound healing. It belongs to selected group of products that claim to improve wound healing by increasing the incidence of wound closure. Published literature shows that daily application of rhPDGF has only negligible systemic absorption.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref></p><p>PDGF mediates tissue repair via:<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> i) mitosis of mesenchymal cells including dermal fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and wound capillary endothelial cells (angiogenesis); ii) chemoattraction of fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, monocytes and neutrophils; iii) induction of extracellular matrix components in fibroblasts, including fibronectin and hyaluronic acid; iv) induction of metalloproteinases involved in wound remodeling.</p><p>Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy is defined as intermittent administration of 100% oxygen inhaled at pressure greater than sea level. The technique may be implemented in a walk-in multiplace chamber compressed to depth with air while the person breathes 100% oxygen via head tent, face mask, or endotracheal tube. Multiplace chambers accommodate up to six patients at a time; each patient is given an individual breathing source.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Alternatively the patient may be treated in one person monoplace chamber pressurized to depth with oxygen. In either case, the arterial pressure of oxygen will approach 1500 mm Hg at the pressure equivalent of 2 atmospheres absolute. Hyperbaric oxygen given in this manner, also referred to as systemic hyperbaric therapy should not be confused with topical oxygen therapy (in limb encasing devices) or pure oxygen inhaled at ambient atmospheric pressure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a single centre study comparing the effect of three different treatment options - antiseptic dressing, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, and platelet derived growth factor on stage III and IV diabetic foot ulcer.

Following the screening visit and confirmation of eligibility, 60 patients were randomized to one of the three treatment groups in 1:1:1 ratio for management of diabetic foot ulcers. The protocol was approved by Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital (New Delhi, India) and Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education &#x00026; Research (PGIMER) Ethical Review Board (New Delhi, India). According to the principles of the declaration of Helsinki 1975, written, informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Participants</title><p>All patients presented in Dr RML Hospital outpatient department and emergency were assessed.

Previously various trials have been done regarding role of HBO therapy and rhPDGF in diabetic foot ulcers. This randomized prospective trial compares the efficacy of HBO, rhPDGF and antiseptic dressings in Grade III and IV diabetic foot ulcers (IAET classification), in 60 Indian patients.</p><p>In the present study P value for healing time is 0.6534 which is not significant. Even the individual P values were not significant. Various international and Indian trials have firmly established better healing time with HBO and rhPDGF compared to conventional dressings. A significant reason for this kind of a result could have been the small sample size of this study. To be a part of the Gaussian population, the sample size has to be adequate. What should be the adequate sample size could not be commented upon but previous international studies have been done with 382<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and 925<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> patients respectively. A bigger study group would have given a better understanding on this issue.</p><p>As we compared the groups using % of patients with complete wound contraction, P value comes out to be 0.0348, which is significant. Complete healing % of rhPDGF (80%) was significantly higher than HBO therapy (60%) which is again significantly higher than those of antiseptic dressings (40%). In all the groups, on comparing ulcer size, the P value was found to be 0.0593, which is not significant (&#x0003e;0.05). All the same, we would call it not that significant because it is very close to 0.05. Again a greater size of the study group would have given a clearer picture. In this on comparing rhPDGF with antiseptic dressings p value came out to be 0.0393 which is actually significant and this could possibly one of the reasons for longer healing time in PDGF group.</p><p>One unique feature of this study was the comparison made between HBO therapy and PDGF. Healing time was not significant but % of patients with complete wound contraction was significantly higher in the PDGF group, which was our primary efficacy criteria. Moreover if we see the actual no of patients leaving the study was higher in HBO group as compared to PDGF. In a country like India where socioeconomic issues play a major role asking them to come daily to hospital for HBO therapy is not always feasible. PDGF can be safely and effectively applied at home. Apart from that side effects seen with HBO therapy like claustrophobia, ear ache, near sightedness, dry cough are not a problem with PDGF (this study has not commented upon the actual no of patients developing these side effects). All the absolute and relative contraindications of HBO therapy are not a problem with PDGF. Cost of treatment is lower with PDGF as compared to HBO therapy and HBO therapy requires and big setup which is only possible with tertiary care hospitals which is not and problem with PDGF which can even be given in primary care settings. So PDGF is equally good an option in diabetic foot patients with added advantages as mentioned above. The current treatment protocol recommends use of growth factor if the wound is not healing after 8 weeks of employing traditional therapy modalities.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref></p><p>Regarding dressings with antiseptics like betadine, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and EUSOL, although mean ulcer healing time is not significantly different among three groups, an international consensus has built up regarding their harmful effects on tissue architecture and they are no longer recommended. Antiseptic agents such as hydrogen peroxide and chlorhexidine are safe for intact skin but toxic to human fibroblasts and other cell types, so are no longer used for diabetic foot wounds.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> Iodide-based agents are toxic and should not be used.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> In a country like India economic losses to the patients in terms of daily wages should also be considered which would be low with PDGF group as shown in other studies because of low healing time with growth factors (although this study does not exactly compare man hours lost among three groups). Moreover they do not have any added advantage over PDGF and HBO therapy (lower complete wound contraction rate). But in India antiseptic agents are still being used at many institutions either because of individual financial constraints or lack of medical expertise. This study does not aim to refute antiseptics altogether and gives due respect to individual clinical experience of doctors treating diabetic foots. A larger multi-institutional study would be required to comment on the above issue.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Diabetic foot ulcer management requires multidisciplinary and aggressive approach.</p><p>PDGF should be recommended for all grade III and IV diabetic foot ulcer at least 8 weeks old. HBO is equally good an option but has all the limitations and side effects as mentioned. Further studies needs to be done to prove the superiority of PDGF over HBO or <italic>vice versa</italic>.
