Management of prehypertension is an appropriate objective for clinicians in a wide range of medical centers.

The results indicated that mean SBP and DBP in the massage group were significantly lower in comparison with the control group immediately after the intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Evaluation of long-term effect of the massage therapy indicated that 3 days after finishing the study, still there was a significant difference between the experimental and control groups in SBP and DBP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), However, 2 weeks after finishing the study, there was not a significant difference in SBP and DBP between the two groups in SBP and DBP (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). It shows that massage therapy does not have a long-term effect. Few studies have examined the long-term effects of massage therapy. Meanwhile Olney's study showed significant differences in SBP and DBP between the two groups only 48 h after the study.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The study of Givi showed the durability of the massage on BP 72 h after the study. After finishing the study, Xiong <italic>et al</italic>.'s[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] meta-analyses showed that massage appears beneficial for reducing SBP for hypertensive patients as compared with antihypertensive drugs. Study results of Liao <italic>et al</italic>.'s (2016) showed that massage contributes to significantly enhanced reduction in SBP and as compared with control treatments in patients with hypertension and prehypertension[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Chen <italic>et al</italic>.'s (2016) meta-analysis study demonstrated a medium effect of massage on SBP and a small effect on DBP in patients with hypertension or prehypertension. All these support the results of this study.</p><p>However, Supa&#x02019;at <italic>et al</italic>. (2013)[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed a significant SBP reduction of 12 mmHg and DBP reduction of 5 mmHg in hypertensive women after four sessions with no significant difference between groups which does not support this study's results. This difference may be due to the difference between the number of sessions and massage technique between the two studies.</p><p>Many of the researchers also have considered that the slight BP reduction is worthwhile and believed that it can cause immunization from the hypertension side effects. Now, according to the obtained findings of the present study, it can be concluded that massage therapy, regardless of its unknown mechanism, can significantly reduce the BP of the clients and prevent from its side effects so that average SBP and DBP from the prehypertension range from the beginning of the study have been led to the normal BP. Furthermore, the effects of massage for at least 3 days after the intervention will remain. However, if you do not use long, loses its effectiveness. Therefore, the researchers introduced the massage therapy as an effective intervention on adjusting BP of the prehypertensive clients, and for the lasting effect, it is better to teach self-massage therapy to clients to do it at home regularly. Researchers are suggesting more studies to evaluate the long-term effect of massage therapy, because this study has some limitations such as low number of samples, the absence of male samples, and only prehypertension clients are evaluated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>There are few studies about the long-term effects of massage. Previous studies all discussed only the effects of massage, but they did not investigate the long-term effects of massage and how long it lasted. Of course, the present study also has limitations that are suggested it comparatively be repeated in men and women, in prehypertensive people, and those with hypertension in further study, and also the sustainability and durability of massage therapy effects on the BP of the prehypertensive clients at different times after the intervention be evaluated.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was financially supported by School of Nursing and Midwifery, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We thank all the clients and also employees at the Sedigheh Tahereh Cardiovascular Center who cooperated.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Givi</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Durability of effect of massage therapy on blood pressure</article-title><source>Int J Prev Med</source><year>2013</year><volume>4</volume><fpage>511</fpage><lpage>6</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23930160</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kearney</surname><given-names>PM</given-names></name><name><surname>Whelton</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Reynolds</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Muntner</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Whelton</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>He</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Global burden of hypertension: Analysis of worldwide data</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2005</year><volume>365</volume><fpage>217</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15652604</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ezzati</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Lopez</surname><given-names>AD</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodgers</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Vander Hoorn</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>CJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Comparative Risk Assessment Collaborating Group, Selected major risk factors and global and regional burden of disease</article-title><source>Lancet</source><year>2002</year><volume>360</volume><fpage>1347</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12423980</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Smeltzer</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Bare</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></name><name><surname>Hinkle</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Cheever</surname><given-names>KH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chapter: Assessment and management of patients with hypertension</article-title><source>Brunner and Suddarth's Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing</source><year>2008</year><edition>11th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Philadelphia</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Lippincott Williams &#x00026; Wilkins</publisher-name><fpage>1022</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lewis</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Heitkemper</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bucher</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>O&#x02019;Brien</surname><given-names>PG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chapter: Nursing management hypertension.
