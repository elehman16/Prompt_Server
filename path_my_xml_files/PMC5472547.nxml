However, lymphatic function has recently been clarified, and it is possible that lymphedema can be cured if early treatment is started. This two-arm randomized clinical trial (UMIN000026124) will prospectively evaluate 24 patients with early-stage breast cancer-related lymphedema at the Nagoya University Hospital and Aichi Cancer Center Hospital. The eligibility criteria will be patients who are diagnosed with stage 0&#x02013;1 breast cancer-related lymphedema, as defined by the International Society of Lymphology, within 12 weeks after breast cancer surgery. The diagnosis of lymphedema will be confirmed using a bioimpedance spectroscopy device (L-Dex&#x000ae;). Participants will be randomized 1:1 into the intervention and control groups. The physicians and patients will be aware of their group assignment, although treatment efficacy will be evaluated by raters who are blinded to the group assignments. The intervention group will complete grasping exercises in the Hand Incubator device for 4 weeks. The primary outcome will be the change in the affected upper limb&#x02019;s volume after the intervention, as measured using the water displacement method. This study may help establish a standard treatment for postoperative lymphedema.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>lymphedema</kwd><kwd>exercise therapy</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>rater-blinded study</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Lymphedema is a common refractory complication that occurs after surgery for various cancers, such as breast, uterine, or prostate cancers, and there is no effective treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</sup> The reported incidence of lymphedema after treatment for breast cancer ranges from a few percent to tens of percent, although this condition does not develop immediately after surgery and can take months or years to emerge.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>)</sup> During the 20<sup>th</sup> century, knowledge of the lymphatic system was extremely scarce and there were no established diagnostic criteria for lymphedema. Thus, the diagnosis was mainly performed using visual inspection, and epidemiological evidence regarding lymphedema occurrence was largely unreliable. However, subsequent elucidation of the molecular mechanism for lymphangiogenesis and the development of diagnostic tools have led to rapid clarification of the pathology of lymphedema that is associated with cancer treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>)</sup> Although lymphatic vessels have a structure that is similar to that of blood vessels, only lymphatic vessels have an intrinsic pumping mechanism. Unno <italic>et al.</italic> and Modi <italic>et al.</italic> used indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence lymphography and lymphatic congestion lymphoscintigraphy to confirm that the lymphatic pumping force was reduced in limbs with secondary lymphedema, and that this &#x0201c;lymphatic failure&#x0201d; could contribute to the pathogenesis of lymphedema.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>)</sup> Br&#x000e4;utigam <italic>et al.</italic> also detected an accelerated rate of lymphatic transport (high lymph volume overload or dynamic insufficiency) in patients with edema, and used lymphoscintigraphy to analyze lymphatic abnormalities in the epifascial and subfascial compartments of patients with a variety of leg edema syndromes.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>)</sup> Chakraborty <italic>et al.</italic> have reported that increases in diastolic lymphatic pressure result in increased contraction frequency and phasic contraction strength in the collecting lymphatic vessels, but beyond a certain point the contractile structures begins to fail and the contraction amplitude decreases.<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup></p><p>The International Society of Lymphology (ISL) modified the clinical staging criteria for lymphedema in 2013 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and added stage 0, which refers to a latent or subclinical condition where swelling is not yet evident despite underlying changes in the lymphatic system.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)</sup> The National Lymphedema Network (NLN) is a driving force behind the American movement to standardize treatment for lymphedema, and has also announced that detection of lymphedema at the earliest stage is a key step in preventing or slowing the progression of lymphedema to a chronic and harder-to-treat stage.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>)</sup> Several other studies have collected cohorts of patients with breast cancer for lymphedema research at major American medical institutions.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>)</sup> These patients underwent surgical treatment for breast cancer and are continuously monitored for lymphatic dysfunctions before and periodically after their surgery. Several randomized controlled trials have also attempted to verify the efficacies of treatments for lymphedema.</p><table-wrap id="table1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The modified International Society of Lymphology (ISL) clinical staging of lymphedema (2013)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" style="border:solid thin;"><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 0<break/>(subclinical)</td><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Swelling is not yet evident, despite the impaired lymphatic system.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 1</td><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Early fluid accumulation that subsides with limb elevation.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 2</td><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Swelling is constant and does not resolve using elevation, and pitting is evident.</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stage 3</td><td align="left" valign="top" style="border:solid thin;" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pitting may be absent, although trophic skin changes have developed.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Subclinical lymphedema can currently be detected using various imaging modalities, such as lymphoscintigraphy, magnetic resonance imaging lymphography, ICG fluorescence lymphography, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). However, scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging are not suitable for regular monitoring because they require large facilities. BIA has been reported as an accurate quantitative method for monitoring the treatment of lymphedema.<sup><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)</sup> One bioimpedance spectroscopy device was developed in Australia (L-Dex&#x000ae;, ImpediMed), approved by the American Food and Drug Administration in 2009 as an early diagnostic tool for lymphedema, and has subsequently become widely used. Nevertheless, BIA cannot identify the cause of the edema or quantitatively evaluate lymphodynamics, because it is an indirect evaluation method that is based on measuring compositional changes in the interstitial fluid. Although ICG lymphography may be an extremely useful tool for diagnosing lymphedema, it has not been approved in any country because of a lack of validation testing.</p><p>Clinical research is gradually providing reliable information regarding the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). The conventional treatments for lymphedema include manual lymphatic drainage or compression therapy using various instruments, such as bandages, garments, and intermittent pneumatic compression devices, although a 2015 Cochrane review could not confirm the efficacies of these treatments.<sup><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)</sup> However, the National Institutes of Health emphasizes the importance of detecting subclinical lymphedema and early intervention, in order to reduce the affected limb&#x02019;s volume and prevent progression to a more advanced stage of BCRL.<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)</sup> Exercise therapy may be effective for patients with BCRL, and attention has been focused on the use of various compression garments during exercise,<sup><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)</sup> although they cannot precisely control the compression pressure and there are several problems with their use. Therefore, as inappropriate lymphatic pressure increases can cause lymphatic failure,<sup><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>)</sup> it is necessary to scientifically define and accurately apply &#x0201c;appropriate compression&#x0201d; for patients with BCRL.</p><p>This clinical trial is designed to evaluate the efficacy of the Hand Incubator (Nippon Sigmax) for treating early-stage BCRL. This device is designed to apply uniform pressure and the operator can freely adjust the pressure. Therefore, the trial will evaluate the device&#x02019;s safety and efficacy during an exercise program that is completed under appropriate pressure, which will be selected based on the individual patient&#x02019;s lymphatic function. Each patient&#x02019;s baseline lymphatic function will be quantitatively assessed using ICG lymphography.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS AND DESIGN</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This multi-center rater-blinded study of early intervention with the Hand Incubator for BCRL (the BEAT-EDEMA trial) is registered in the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000026124).
