Successful control of malaria in pregnancy could save lives of mothers and babies and is an essential part of antenatal care in endemic areas. The primary objective is to determine the protective efficacy of community-scheduled screening and treatment (CSST) using community health workers (CHW) against the primary outcome of prevalence of placental malaria. The secondary objectives are to determine the protective efficacy of CSST on maternal anaemia, maternal peripheral infection, low birth weight, selection of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) resistance markers, and on antenatal clinic (ANC) attendance and coverage of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp-SP).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This is a multi-centre cluster-randomised controlled trial involving three countries with varying malaria endemicity; low (The Gambia) versus high transmission (Burkina Faso and Benin), and varying degrees of SP resistance (high in Benin and moderate in Gambia and Burkina Faso). CHW and their related catchment population who are randomised into the intervention arm will receive specific training on community-based case management of malaria in pregnancy. All women in both study arms will be enrolled at their first ANC visits in their second trimester where they will receive their first dose of IPTp-SP. Thereafter, CHW in the intervention arm will perform scheduled monthly screening and treatment in the womens homes. At time of delivery, a placental biopsy will be collected from all women to determine placental malaria. At each contact point, filter paper and blood slides will be collected for detection of malaria infection and SP resistance markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To reach successful global malaria control, there is an urgent need to access those at greatest risk of malaria infection. The project is designed to develop a low-cost intervention in pregnant women which will have an immediate impact on the malaria burden in resource-limited countries.

Approximately half of the world&#x02019;s population is at risk of malaria and every year this leads to about 207 million clinical malaria cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>In endemic countries, pregnant women have a higher risk of malaria compared to other adults due to the physiological hormonal changes and reduced immunity. In areas of stable, moderate to intense transmission, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> infection in pregnancy is often asymptomatic, yet it is an important contributor to maternal morbidity, preterm delivery, perinatal morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and may be associated with an increased risk of post-partum haemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In areas of low, often unstable, transmission, malaria infection can evolve towards severe disease and result in maternal and foetal death. Such adverse outcomes are more frequent in primigravidae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], in HIV-infected women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] or in those from non-endemic countries as they do not have any immunity acquired before pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The increased susceptibility of pregnant women to infection, and most specifically of primigravidae, is explained by the sequestration of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> in the placenta due to its affinity with the chondroitin sulphate A receptor. Placental malaria causes intrauterine growth retardation and the delivery of low birth weight babies who have a significantly higher risk of dying before their first birthday due to the reduced transfer of essential nutrients to the developing foetus as a result of the placental infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa, over 30 million women living in malaria endemic areas become pregnant each year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with malaria causing an estimated &#x0003e;10,000 maternal deaths and 75,000 to 200,000 infant deaths. In addition, it is responsible for 2 to 15% of maternal anaemia cases and up to 14% of low birth weight babies resulting in poor growth and development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, increasing evidence shows that placental malaria <italic>per se</italic> is associated with an increased risk of malaria infection and anaemia in the first and second year of life of the infant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], possibly mediated by the exposure to blood-stage malaria antigens <italic>in utero</italic> and the acquisition of a tolerant phenotype that persists into childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Importantly, these effects are independent of low birth weight; that is, they can occur in any child born to mothers with placental malaria, and seem to be more pronounced in multigravidae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If these observations are confirmed, the burden of malaria in African pregnant women would extend beyond that observed in primigravidae and could be vastly underestimated.</p><p>Successful control of malaria in pregnancy could save lives of mothers and babies and is an essential part of antenatal care in endemic areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. For sub-Saharan Africa, the World Health Organization has developed guidelines for the control of malaria in pregnancy consisting of a three-pronged approach:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Prompt and effective management of uncomplicated malaria in the second and third trimester with artemisinin-based combination therapy. For the first trimester, it is recommended to combine quinine with clindamycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Long-lasting insecticidal bed nets for all pregnant women in malaria-endemic countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (IPTp-SP) at regular intervals during pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This is a simple, pragmatic policy that has proven very valuable in areas with stable, moderate to high malaria transmission. SP is safe when given in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, widely available, cheap and well tolerated. IPTp-SP can clear any existing malaria infection and provides post-treatment prophylaxis for a certain period of time, depending on SP sensitivity of local parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></list-item></list></p><p>Unfortunately, the coverage of long-lasting insecticidal bed nets and IPTp-SP in many sub-Saharan African countries remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], particularly in peripheral areas with difficult access to health facilities, leaving certain remote, poor populations out of reach of basic services. To add further complexities, SP resistance is increasing and, thus, there is the urgent need to develop alternatives or additional efforts to the current IPTp-SP policy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The project is designed to develop a low-cost intervention for pregnant women that will have an immediate impact on the malaria burden in resource-limited countries. In this study, it is proposed to add an &#x0201c;extension&#x0201d; strategy to the communities in rural areas in addition to the standard IPTp-SP delivered through health facilities. The novelty of this study is to bring health services closer to where women live, using community health workers (CHWs) to provide an antimalarial intervention to women with difficult access to the formal health system. The study will build on the use of CHWs who are already managing malaria cases within the framework of community case management of malaria (CCMm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The main aim is to establish whether maternal and infant health can be improved by adding to existing IPTp-SP at antenatal clinics (ANCs) community-scheduled screening and treatment (CSST) for malaria among pregnant women through CHWs. The study will test the primary hypothesis that CSST plus IPTp-SP will reduce placental malaria compared to IPTp-SP alone.</p><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Primary objective: To determine the protective efficacy of CSST using CHWs against the primary outcome of prevalence of placental malaria.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Secondary objectives: To determine the protective efficacy of CSST on maternal anaemia, maternal peripheral infection, low birth weight, selection of SP resistance markers, and on ANC attendance and coverage of intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy.</p></list-item></list></p><p>These project objectives will be achieved through multidisciplinary research comprising clinical and bio-medical research, health system research, socio-economic and anthropological studies with a focus on CHW, involving policy makers right from the start of the project as full project partners (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cosmicmalaria.eu">http://www.cosmicmalaria.eu</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/designs</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study areas and participant eligibility</title><p>This is a multi-centre trial involving three countries with varying malaria endemicity: low (The Gambia) versus high transmission (Burkina Faso and Benin), and varying degrees of SP resistance (high in Benin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and moderate in Gambia and Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]). This will ensure that the study outcomes would be broadly generalisable in order to facilitate the formulation of recommendations for both the West African region and other sub-Saharan countries. The Gambia, a country where malaria transmission has decreased to levels thought not possible a few years ago (and hence in a so-called &#x0201c;epidemiological transition&#x0201d;), will provide information possibly applicable to countries that may reach a similar status in the (near) future.</p><p>In The Gambia, the study is situated in the eastern part of the country on the southern bank of the Upper River Region (about 170,000 inhabitants). It will be centred around the Basse Health Centre and satellite health facilities. This is an area of seasonal malaria transmission (July-December) that has recently experienced a significant decline in malaria infections. Nevertheless, malaria remains a significant problem with about 15% of pregnant women with placental malaria at delivery as detected by histopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In Burkina Faso, the study is situated in the centre-west of the country in the Nanoro health district catchment area (about 145,000 inhabitants). Malaria transmission is high and extremely seasonal and overlaps with the rainy season (June-October).</p><p>In Benin, the study is situated at the Atlantic Region in the southern part of the country, in the Glo-Djigb&#x000e9;, Zinvi&#x000e9; and Z&#x000e8; district communities (about 136,000 inhabitants). Malaria transmission is perennial and the main burden of the disease occurs during the two rainy seasons (April-July and October-November).</p><p>The current treatment policy of uncomplicated malaria in pregnancy is oral quinine but artemisinin-based combination therapy (artemether-lumefantrine (AL)) may be used in the second and third trimester of pregnancy for all three countries, or amodiaquine-artesunate in Burkina Faso and Benin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>All pregnant women resident in the study area and willing to remain so until delivery will be invited to participate. Women who have a history of sensitivity to sulphonamides and vulnerable persons (for example, the mentally deficient) will be excluded. In The Gambia, pregnant adolescents younger than 16&#x000a0;years will not be enrolled unless consent is given by a responsible adult. In Burkina Faso and Benin, a pregnant woman is considered an adult if married (regardless of age). Study participants are free to withdraw from the study at any time without giving a reason.</p><p>Prior to the trial start, community sensitization and involvement of village leaders will be carried out at each study site. Appropriate community meetings will be held where the trial will be explained to all community members and consent at the community level to participate from community leaders will be obtained. Individual signed informed consent will also be obtained from all participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Design</title><p>This is a multicenter, cluster-randomised controlled trial in which the CHWs and related catchment population (village/community) will be randomised to receive either the intervention (IPTp-SP plus CSST) or continue with current activities, that is IPTp-SP alone at health facilities during ANC visits (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

Sample size calculation was performed according to Hayes and Bennett [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Based on available data, the prevalence of placental malaria (any category, including past infection) is at least 15% in the three study sites. Although the coefficient of variation for placental malaria is not known, it is set at 0.15 within each country. It is assumed that the intervention will decrease placental malaria by 30%, from 15% to 10.5%. Furthermore, the assumption is made that each CHW will recruit at least 40 pregnant women per year, corresponding roughly to a population of 800 people (assuming 5% of the population is pregnant). Within each study site, the study will be able to show a significant difference between intervention and control groups with 15 clusters per arm at 80% power and at the 10% significance level. This translates to 45 clusters per arm across the three study sites. Therefore, the total study population will be 5,400 women, 1,800 women in each country, and will require an 18-month recruitment period in order to enrol at least 60 women per cluster.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Data handling and record keeping</title><p>All data handling and record keeping will be standardised across the three study sites. At the health facility, all pregnant women will be recorded on a study register held at each clinic. Women who are enrolled onto the study will also be given a unique identity number.</p><p>A standardised data collection form on the health status, medical history of the women, and socio-demographic characteristics will be administered by health staff at the time of enrolment at the health facility. A standardised data collection form on current health status will then be administered at subsequent ANC visits (intervention and control arm) and at each monthly visit by the CHWs in the intervention arm only. All data will be double entered using OpenClinica&#x000ae; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.openclinica.com">http://www.openclinica.com</ext-link>) databases at each site. Consistency checks will be performed and any outliers and missing data points will be checked against the original forms and subsequently amended in the dataset. Errors including missing data that may have occurred during the data collection will be reported with a minimum delay for further investigation.</p><p>All names and addresses will be removed from the data collection forms before data entry. The datasets will be password protected and only accessed by the data manager and local investigators at each study site. All samples will be labelled with the woman&#x02019;s unique identity number and date of collection.

IPTp-SP if given at least twice after the first trimester has been shown to be effective in preventing malaria infection and its consequences during pregnancy. However, in the majority of sub-Saharan African countries, IPTp-SP coverage is low, with only 22% of pregnant women receiving IPTp-SP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Systematic screening of pregnant women for malaria, and treating them if positive may further reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy. In Ghana, an area of moderately high transmission, screening by RDT at scheduled ANC visits and treating positive women was as effective as IPTp-SP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, both interventions are currently being implemented through health facilities and thus the health system essentially waits for the women to attend a facility and does not tackle the issue of low or untimely (late in pregnancy) attendance. Further issues with delivery of these interventions include: unclear policy and guidance of IPTp-SP, stock outs at health facilities for both bed nets and SP, and poor quality of care. Low IPTp-SP coverage was also associated with poor education, poor knowledge of malaria, socio-economic status and age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In rural areas, this is a major issue as pregnant women often have limited access to health facilities due to distance, poverty, low levels of education, strong traditional values, limited access to information and poor road infrastructure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Long distances can be an actual barrier for attending a health facility but they can also be a deterrent to seeking care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>In this study, it is proposed to add an &#x0201c;extension&#x0201d; strategy to the communities in rural areas to the standard IPTp-SP delivered through the health facilities and thus bring health services closer to where women live. The study will build on the use of CHWs who are already managing malaria cases within the framework of CCMm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. At this level, RDTs for the diagnosis of malaria are already being used or their implementation is planned. CCMm supported by RDT is at various stages of implementation; in The Gambia, the National Malaria Control Program is planning to introduce nationwide CCMm supported by RDT; in Burkina Faso, CCMm has been implemented and is currently managed by an international non-government organisation (Plan International) and four local non-government organisations under the supervision of the National Malaria Control Program; in Benin, CCMm is part of the National Malaria Policy, though it still needs to be scaled up nationwide.</p><p>The study will extend the CCMm which at present is primarily aimed at children under the age of 5&#x000a0;years to pregnant women. The aim is to improve both IPTp-SP coverage as CHWs encourage women to attend the ANC for the IPTp at the right time, allow systematic screening for malaria infection and provide an opportunity to treat malaria when the prophylactic effect of IPTp-SP has waned. The trial will also investigate the prevalence of SP resistance markers in the positive malaria samples obtained during the study as it could be hypothesized that the beneficial effects of the intervention might be more pronounced in areas with high SP resistance, because women could be more prone to placental malaria when IPTp-SP has a reduced effect and, although not yet observed in West Africa, extremely high levels of SP resistance markers in the parasite population may even lead to adverse effects of SP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p>At time of submission of this paper, ethical approval has been obtained, and recruitment is ongoing in all three study sites.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>AL</term><def><p>artemether-lumefantrine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANC</term><def><p>antenatal clinic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CCMm</term><def><p>community case management of malaria</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CHW</term><def><p>community health worker</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CSST</term><def><p>community-scheduled screening and treatment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPTp-SP</term><def><p>intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCR</term><def><p>polymerase chain reaction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RDT</term><def><p>rapid diagnostic test</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p>serious adverse event.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SS drafted the protocol and wrote the manuscript.
