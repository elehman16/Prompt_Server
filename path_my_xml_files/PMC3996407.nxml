reported that visual information of sound side movement was conveyed and that movement of

inducing improvement of functional movement such as strength and gait ability with

stroke, multiple sclerosis, and spinal cord injury<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Sullivan and Hedman<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that muscle strength, range of motion, and functional

stroke. Sufficient explanation of this study&#x02019;s intent and the overall purpose was given, and
voluntary consent to participation in this study was obtained from all of the subjects. All
procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of Eulji
University Hospital. Subjects were randomly divided into 3 groups. Experimental group I
contained 10 subjects who received mirror therapy in conjunction with FES, experimental
group II contained 10 subjects who received mirror therapy, and the control group contained
10 subjects who received a sham therapy. All subjects performed a PNF neurodevelopment
technique for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week for 6 weeks. The subjects in experimental
groups I and II were instructed to sit on a table for therapeutic purposes based on the
mirror therapy program proposed by S&#x000fc;tbeyaz et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and to use a 60 &#x000d7; 90&#x02005;cm mirror designed such that its angle could
be adjusted. After placing the mirror between the non-affected and affected lower limbs, the
affected lower limb was positioned behind the mirror. The mirror&#x02019;s angle was then controlled
according to the patient&#x02019;s sitting height so that the movement of the non-affected lower
limb could be seen in the mirror. For functional electrical stimulation (FES) equipment,
this study used a Microstim, which consisted of one pair of surface electrodes (50 &#x000d7; 50&#x02005;mm),
a stimulator, and a foot switch. The foot switch was attached to the bottom of the forefoot
on the patient&#x02019;s affected side and set to activate FES as soon as the forefoot on the
affected side came off the ground. In addition, the patients were taught to create
simultaneous active movements for dorsiflexion of the foot on the affected side when
dorsiflexion of the foot on the non-affected side was seen in the mirror. The patients had
to repeat maintenance of dorsiflexion for 10 seconds and then rested for 5 seconds.
Experimental group II was instructed to perform the same training without application of
FES. The control group did not receive FES, and performed the same training after covering
the mirror with a white cloth. Each group performed additional exercise for 20 minutes. A
gait analysis was performed using a three-dimensional motion capture system, which was a
real-time tracking device that delivers data in an infrared mode via reflective markers
using six cameras. The reflective markers were attached to the left and right anterior
superior iliac spines (ASISs), left and right posterior superior iliac spines (PSISs), left
and right femoral regions, lateral epicondyles of the left and right knees, left and right
tibial regions, left and right lateral malleoli, heads of the left and right second
metatarsal bones, and left and right posterior calcaneal bones. The Eva Real-Time (EvaRT)
were used for data processing. To measure gaits, each subject was instructed to walk inside
a 7&#x02005;m capture area from the starting to end points three times at a comfortable speed. The
average of the measurement values after excluding 1&#x02005;m from each of the starting and end
points was adopted for a gait analysis. In addition, temporal gait characteristics of
velocity and cadence and spatial gait characteristics of step length and stride length were
recorded. Paired t-tests were used to verify statistical significance in performances before
and after the experiment. To make comparisons between the groups, a one-way ANOVA was
conducted. In addition, a post hoc test was performed using Fisher&#x02019;s Least Significance
Difference (LSD) test. The statistical significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>General characteristics and results of the homogeneity test of the subjects are shown in

experimental group I were improved after the experiment compared with experimental group II
and the control group. This showed that mirror therapy in conjunction with FES is more
effective for improving gait ability than mirror therapy alone. FES increased activation of
the sensory-motor cortex area of stroke patients and the influence on functional movement.
It is known to improve treatment effects and to have a positive effect on motor
learning<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. We thought that this may be
due to brain reorganization in response to mirror therapy occurring at the same time as
recovery of muscle function due to FES.</p><p>S&#x000fc;tbeyaz et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> randomly assigned 40
stroke patients to a mirror therapy group and a control group. The subjects repeatedly
performed dorsiflexion of the ankles with the non-affected lower limb placed in front of a
mirror. Measurement of their functional ambulation categories (FAC) during exercise showed
that the mirror therapy group achieved a statistically significant higher level of
improvement in gait ability than the control group. This result was similar to that of the
present study. FES increases the activity of the cerebral sensory-motor cortex in stroke
patients and has an effect on functional movement, and it has a positive effect on motor
learning and improves the effect of treatment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. We suspect that the gait abilities were improved due to synergistic
effects of FES and mirror therapy. In a cross-sectional study in which FES was applied to
the ankle dorsiflexors of stroke patients, Sabut et al.<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that statistically significant increases were found in
gait velocity, cadence, and stride length. Kesar et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> noted that application of FES to the tibialis anterior muscle of
stroke patients during walking improved gait ability by correcting foot drop. Limitations of
this study include its small sample size, the difficulty in generalizing its results, and
the fact that we did not confirm the durability of the effects through follow-up. Future
studies should employ larger sample sizes, and compare the effects of mirror therapy with
those of other interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was financially supported by the research fund of Korea Nazarene University in
