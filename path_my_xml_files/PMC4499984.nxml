back muscle activation. We compared pulmonary function and back muscle strength according
to the degree of curvature of the spine of healthy adults. [Subjects and Methods]
Twenty-three healthy volunteers were enrolled. They were divided into two groups according
to the degree of curvature of the spine: the below 2&#x000b0; group, and the above 2&#x000b0; group. The
degree of curvature was assessed using the Adams forward bending test and a scoliometer. A
pulmonary function test (PFT) was conducted, and back muscle strength was measured.
[Results] No significant differences in PFT were found between the below 2&#x000b0; group and the
above 2&#x000b0; group, in terms of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one
second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital
capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC), or peak expiratory flow (PEF). However, back muscle
strength in the below 2 group was significantly higher than that of the above 2 group.
[Conclusion] Our findings indicate that the degree of curvature of the spine is associated
with back muscle strength in subjects who have spinal curvature within the normal range.
Therefore, evaluation and treatment of back muscle strength might be helpful for
preventing the progress of curvature of the spine in adolescents with potential
scoliosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Scoliosis</kwd><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Back muscle strength</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Scoliosis is a 3-dimensional abnormal curvature of the spine, and is the most common
deformity of the spine<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Its causes
include neurological or neuromuscular dysfunction in cerebral palsy, Duchenne myopathy,
medullary lesion, and others<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. However,
even though the main causes of most scoliosis cases are unknown, it can be classified as a
congenital factor by vertebral or rib malformation, a secondary factor by systemic or
neuromuscular disorders, and idiopathic by no specific cause<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence reported by previous studies varies from 0.3 to
15.3%<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
criterion for scoliosis is generally defined as a spinal curvature of 10 degrees in the
sagittal plane<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Most researchers who have studied pulmonary dysfunction in patients with scoliosis agree
that there is a possibility of cardiorespiratory failure in cases with a Cobb angle greater
than over 90 degrees, lung function abnormalities when the Cobb angle is in the range of 50
to 60 degrees, and that there is correlation of the severity of abnormal curvature and
pulmonary function<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, accumulating evidence indicates that abnormal
curvature of the spine is affected by asymmetry of the back musculatures<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Likewise, abnormality of spinal curvature
has a strong effect on pulmonary function and back muscle activation. However, to the best
of our knowledge, few studies have investigated the relationship between pulmonary function
and asymmetry according to the degree of curvature of the spine in normal adolescents<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether or not there are any
differences in pulmonary function and back muscle strength according to the degree of
curvature of the spine of healthy adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Twenty-three healthy subjects with no previous history of neuromuscular or neurologic
dysfunction participated in this study. They understood the purpose of this study, and gave
their written informed consent before experimental participation. The experimental protocol
was approved by the ethics committee of Daegu University. The subjects were divided
according to the angular degree of their spinal curvature: into two groups, the below 2
group (9 males, 4 females, age: 23.2&#x000b1;2.1) and the above 2 group (4 males, 6 females, age:
23.5&#x000b1;2.0).</p><p>The degree of spinal curvature was measured using a scoliometer (National Scoliosis
Foundation, Watertwon, MA, USA) in the Adams forward bending test. The Adams forward bending
test was used to evaluate the rib hump forms on the side of the convexity. All subjects were
instructed to bend forward, starting at the waist until the back became horizontal, with the
feet together, arms hanging and the knees in extension. The examiner stood at the back of
the subject and measured the degree of rib hump in the horizontal plane of the spine using
the scoliometer.</p><p>The pulmonary function test (PFT) was performed by all participants. The PFT was measured
using a spirometer (Vmax 229, SensorMedics, USA), which calculated and recorded forced vital
capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), ratio of forced
expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/(FVC), and peak
expiratory flow (PEF). The subjects sat in a chair with a backrest and were instructed to
breathe in as deeply as possible, and then breathe out through a mouthpiece as quickly as
possible, with their noses occluded. The measurement was performed by the same tester
throughout the entire experiment, and was performed two times with enough rest between each
trial to prevent hyperventilation. The best performance of three trials was adopted.</p><p>Back muscle strength test was assessed using a muscle strength meter (TKK 5102, Takei Co.,
Japan). Before the test, the length from the handle to the footplate was adjusted so that
the subject could reach the handle when the subject bent his/her back by 30 in the standing
position with his/her heels together and the toes 15&#x02005;cm apart. In this position, the subject
was asked to extend his/her back gradually, increasing his/her strength. The back muscle
strength was measured twice in kilograms. The best performance of two trials was
adopted.</p><p>For comparison of demographic data (i.e., age, sex, height, weight, degree of curvature),
PFT (FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and PEF), and back muscle strength between
the two groups, the independent t-test and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test were conducted.
Statistical software, PAWS 18.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), was used to analyze the data, and
statistical significance was accepted at values of p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The degree of curvature of the spine of all subjects was below 5. No significances were

the degree of curvature of the spine of healthy subjects who had spinal curvature within the
normal range. We adopted 2 of spinal curvature as the cutoff point, because it clearly
discriminated between the two-cluster distribution of the scatter plot showing the degree of
spinal curvature of all the subjects. The muscle strength of the back musculatures of the
below 2 group was significantly stronger than that of the above 2 group. However, the
pulmonary function of the above 2 group and the below 2 group showed no significant
difference, in terms of FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, and PEF. Therefore, our
results suggest that the degree of curvature of the spine within the normal range directly
affects back muscle strength, but not pulmonary function.</p><p>Many previous studies have reported that abnormal curvature of the spine has a negative
effect on pulmonary function in various ways, including cardiorespiratory impairment,
decrease in lung volume, and chest wall movement<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These possible items of pulmonary dysfunction are suggested to be caused by thoracic
deformity due to abnormality of the spinal curvature<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, our findings show that the degree of spinal curvature did
not negatively affect pulmonary function. Tsiligiannis and Grivas suggested that mild to
moderate scoliosis actually produced very few respiratory signs and symptoms<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Redding and Mayer reported
that some measurements that are often used, such as the Cobb angle are not related to
pulmonary function<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taken together,
these results strongly suggest that the degree of spinal curvature within the normal range
is not associated with pulmonary function.</p><p>The significant finding in the comparison of back muscle strength according to the degree
of spinal curvature is in agreement with previous<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several studies have
reported that strength asymmetry is observed in patients with scoliosis due to the
difference in the ratio of the convex and concave angles of the spine<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mooney et
al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed that inhibition of the
paraspinal muscles by abnormal curvature of the spine might be a cause of weak trunk muscle
function, which is known to contribute about 5% of the total torque involved in trunk
rotation<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Stiff spine, trunk strength
and asymmetry might occur, due to abnormal curvature of the spine causing abnormal muscle
geometry, and ligament deformity<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Abnormal structure of the spine in the sagittal and frontal planes affects progressive
deformity of the spine and thoracic rib cage, cardiorespiratory function, low back pain, and
neurologic complications<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore,
multiple impairments related to abnormal curvature of the spine need to be considered
carefully when treating patients with abnormal structure of the spine. Our findings suggest
that the degree of spinal curvature is associated with back muscle strength, not with
respiratory function, in individuals with normal spinal curvature. However, limitations of
this study are that radiographic measurement of the degree of spinal curvature was not
performed, and that no comparisons with patients with scoliosis were presented. In further
study, these limitations will be addressed to elucidate clinical features related to the
degree of spinal curvature.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Daegu University Research Grant, 2012.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Stokes</surname><given-names>IA</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Three-dimensional terminology of spinal deformity.
