HM-fed infants typically have frequent, soft stools, whereas formula-fed infants have less frequent, firm or formed stools (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) that may be difficult to pass. Although improvements have been made in the composition and performance of infant formulas, constipation and relatively hard stools remain common in formula-fed infants (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Fat blends used in infant formula may contribute to these problems, and use of fat blends more closely resembling HM fat can improve infants&#x02019; stooling patterns and consistency (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The addition of prebiotics to infant formulas has also led to softer stools and may provide additional health benefits such as support of a more favorable gut microbiota (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Triglycerides, the major source of energy in both HM and infant formula, comprised 3 fatty acids esterified to a 3-carbon glycerol backbone. The stereospecific position of fatty acids on the glycerol, which is identified as <italic>sn</italic>-1 (outer carbon), <italic>sn</italic>-2 (center carbon), or <italic>sn-3</italic> (outer carbon), differs in HM fat compared with vegetable oils used in infant formula (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Palmitic acid, an abundant saturated fatty acid in both HM and infant formula (approximately 20% of total fatty acids), is predominantly esterified (approximately 70%) at the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position in HM, but primarily esterified at the <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-3 positions in fat blends commonly used in infant formulas (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Pancreatic lipase preferentially hydrolyzes fatty acids in the <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-3 positions, yielding 2 free fatty acids and the corresponding <italic>sn</italic>-2 monoglyceride, which is well absorbed regardless of the fatty acid attached. Thus, palmitic acid in HM is well absorbed given its predominant esterification in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position. In contrast, intestinal digestion of infant formula yields relatively high levels of free palmitic acid that can bind calcium in the intestine, forming fatty acid soaps that are excreted in the feces (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and are associated with hard, infrequent stools, and unnecessary loss of both fatty acids and calcium (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Use of a vegetable oil blend rich in <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate (<italic>sn</italic>-2) in infant formula yields a positional distribution of palmitic acid that more closely resembles that of HM. Infants who consumed a formula containing high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate had reduced fecal excretion of palmitic acid soaps and softer stools (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Oligofructose (OF) is a nondigestible, inulin-derived carbohydrate consisting of short chains of fructose polymers (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). OF decreases GI transit time and increases fecal weight and water-holding capacity (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). OF can beneficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or activity of 1 or a limited number of bacteria (eg, bifidobacteria) in the colon (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Studies in term and preterm infants indicate that infant formulas with OF are well tolerated, promote a bifidobacteria-dominant fecal flora, and may increase stool softness (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that formula with high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate in combination with OF would promote improved GI function. This study evaluated stool composition, stool characteristics, fecal bifidobacteria, and GI tolerance in infants receiving a control formula versus infants receiving formulas containing a fat blend with elevated levels of <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate, either alone or in combination with 2 different concentrations of OF.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a randomized controlled double-blind study of healthy, term formula-fed infants receiving 1 of 4 study formulas for 8 weeks. A nonrandomized HM-fed group was included as a reference. Clinic visits were scheduled at baseline, week 4, and week 8, with telephone follow-ups midway between clinic visits.</p><p>Demographic and household characteristics were collected at the baseline visit. Anthropometrics (weight, length, and head circumference) were obtained and a parent questionnaire, the Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire (IGSQ), was administered at the baseline, week 4, and week 8 visits. Stool characteristics (consistency and frequency) were assessed via a stool diary completed by parents/guardians on 3 consecutive days immediately before the week 4 and week 8 visits. Infant stool samples were collected by parents/caregivers at home during a 5-day period before the week 8 visit and analyzed for stool soap fatty acids and mineral content. Additional stool samples were collected from a subset (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;170) during the baseline and week 8 visits and analyzed for bifidobacteria.</p><p>The study was conducted between April 2009 and September 2009 at Muntinlupa Health Center, Muntinlupa City, the Philippines, in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, International Conference on Harmonization guidelines, and the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. The protocol and informed consent form were approved by the National Ethics Committee and the Bureau of Food and Drug in the Philippines. Written, informed consent was obtained from the parent or legal guardian of each infant before enrollment.</p><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Infants were healthy, term (gestational age &#x02265;37 weeks) singleton, ages 7 to 14 days, weight-for-age &#x02265;5th percentile according to Filipino reference standards, and exclusively consuming and tolerating a cow's-milk&#x02013;based infant formula (for formula-fed groups) or exclusively consuming HM (for the HM-fed group). Breast-feeding was encouraged, and only when the mother had clearly decided not to breast-feed was she approached for inclusion of her infant in the formula-fed groups. Main exclusion criteria included the use of medication(s) known or suspected to affect fat digestion, absorption, and/or metabolism; supplements containing calcium; suppositories; bismuth-containing medications; herbal supplements; or medications that may neutralize or suppress gastric acid secretion.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Feedings</title><p>Infants enrolled in the HM reference group continued to receive HM ad libitum. Formula-fed infants were assigned to receive ad libitum 1 of the following using validated randomization software: control&#x02014;a bovine milk-based, whey-predominant, &#x003b1;-lactalbumin-enriched term formula with a 100% vegetable fat blend (S-26 GOLD; Wyeth Nutrition, Askeaton, Ireland); <italic>sn</italic>-2&#x02014;a high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula (control formula modified to contain 60% vegetable fat blend and 40% high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate fat blend [Betapol; Loders Croklaan, Wormerveer, the Netherlands]); <italic>sn</italic>-2+3&#x0200a;g/L OF&#x02014;a high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula supplemented with 3.0&#x0200a;g/L OF (Orafti P95; BENEO-ORAFTI, Tienen, Belgium); <italic>sn</italic>-2+5&#x0200a;g/L OF&#x02014;a high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula supplemented with 5.0&#x0200a;g/L OF (Orafti P95). Formulas were produced in powder form. To ensure double blinding, all formulas were packaged in an identical manner except for package number. Formula labels provided preparation and storage instructions in both English and Filipino. All formulas met Codex Alimentarius standards for infant formula (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> lists fatty acid profiles, percentage of <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate, and selected nutrient levels in the formulas.</p></sec><sec><title>Stool Characteristics</title><p>In a 3-day diary, parents/caregivers recorded the number of bowel movements and stool consistency using standardized pictures of stools corresponding to a validated 5-point scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;watery, 2&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;runny, 3&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;mushy soft, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;formed, or 5&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;hard) (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Stool Biochemical Composition</title><p>Standardized procedures were provided to parents/caregivers to collect infant stool samples at home during a 5-day period before the week 8 visit. Infants were fitted with diapers containing a strip of Tegaderm tape (3M, St Paul, MN) to facilitate retention of stool in the diaper. Freshly passed stool was placed into an amber plastic bag, weighed on a portable scale, and stored in a home freezer until &#x02265;30 g had been collected. Frozen samples were brought to the clinic visit in a collection-kit cooler bag, then shipped on dry ice to Covance Laboratories (Madison, WI) for analysis. Samples were analyzed for soap fatty acids using a modification (ie, acetic acid replaced hydrochloric acid to convert soaps to free fatty acids) of an earlier method (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The limit of fatty acid quantitation was defined as the concentration corresponding to the lowest C16:0 calibration standard (0.5&#x0200a;mg/g). The acceptance criteria with respect to recovery and coefficients of variability for fatty acids were &#x000b1;30% for the performance of replicate analyses related to accuracy as compared with previously established values of targets in quality control samples. Repeatability relative standard deviations (SDs) for a dry quality control level of C16:0 ranged from 2.9% to 12.6%. Total soap fatty acids were calculated as the sum of individual soap fatty acids. Results were expressed as milligrams per gram of dry stool weight. Standard analytical procedures were used to determine stool moisture and solids. Calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry following AOAC International Official Methods of Analysis (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Fecal Bifidobacteria</title><p>An additional 3&#x0200a;g of fresh stool was collected from a subset of infants during baseline and week 8 visits. Samples were collected with a scoop attached to the inner aspect of the lid of a sterile polypropylene vial and immediately stored in a &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C freezer. Frozen samples were shipped on dry ice to NIZO Food Research (Ede, the Netherlands) where they were fixed for fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. Samples were then shipped on dry ice to University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, the Netherlands, where fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses were conducted. Total number of bifidobacteria was analyzed with probe BIF164 as described previously (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Quantitative determination was conducted by automated process; a cumulative coefficient of variation was used to assess quality of automated counting. If cumulative coefficient of variation was &#x0003e;15%, the sample was recounted. Data were reported as bacteria counts per gram of wet stool weight. Parents or legal guardians gave consent for this component of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>GI Tolerance</title><p>The IGSQ is a 21-item standardized, validated, interviewer-assisted questionnaire that allows parents to describe the frequency and intensity of their infant's GI signs and symptoms of distress during the previous 7 days. The questionnaire includes 5 domains: stooling, vomiting, crying, fussiness, and flatulence. An individual score for each question and an overall index score were calculated. The IGSQ index score is a measure of total GI symptom burden; it contains a subset of 13 questions from the IGSQ that are summed to produce a single score. Potential values for the IGSQ index score range from 13 to 65, wherein 13 indicates low and 65 indicates high GI burden (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).</p><p>GI study events were recorded during clinic visits and telephone calls throughout the study. A study event was defined as any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in an infant. The severity of study events and whether they were related to study feedings were determined by the investigators. A subset of symptoms related to the digestive system and GI tolerance were identified of particular interest a priori: hard stool, constipation, difficulty having a bowel movement, acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea, spitting up, regurgitation, vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, colic, and crying/neonatal abnormal crying. To ensure consistency in diagnosis, investigators were provided with standard definitions for these symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Anthropometry</title><p>Infants were weighed without a diaper on an electronic infant scale (Seca 374, Hamburg, Germany) and measurements were recorded to nearest gram. Recumbent length was measured on a pediatric length board (Ellard Instrumentation, Washington, DC) to the nearest 0.1&#x0200a;cm. Head circumference was measured using a pediatric tape measure (Seca 212) to the nearest 0.1&#x0200a;cm. Measures were taken twice at each visit and the mean was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>Data analysis was conducted as outlined in an a priori statistical analysis plan using SAS software version 8.2 or later (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). At least 66 infants per group was required to achieve 90% power (&#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05) to detect a mean difference of 6.0&#x0200a;mg of stool soap fatty acids per 100&#x0200a;mg of dry stool weight (SD 9) between the control and <italic>sn</italic>-2 groups, and to detect a mean difference of 0.4 in stool consistency scores (SD 0.7) between the <italic>sn</italic>-2 group and either of the <italic>sn</italic>-2+OF groups. Assuming a 15% dropout/nonevaluable rate, approximately 300 formula-fed infants (75/group) were required to achieve 264 evaluable formula-fed infants (66/group).</p><p>Endpoints for stool composition and characteristics and IGSQ scores were evaluated in the efficacy evaluable population, defined as all randomly assigned infants who took &#x02265;1 feeding of study formula and had a measurable postbaseline value for the endpoint being analyzed. Fecal bifidobacteria data were analyzed in a per-protocol population. Initially, analyses were conducted including all 4 randomized formula groups and excluding the nonrandomized HM reference group. The prespecified comparison of primary interest was between <italic>sn</italic>-2 and control. Subsequently, each formula group was compared individually with the HM group. The primary efficacy endpoint was stool composition; palmitic acid and total soap fatty acids were the 2 most important stool composition parameters. Stool characteristics included stool frequency and stool consistency data derived from the 3-day diary. Stool frequency was expressed as average number of bowel movements per day, whereas stool consistency was expressed in 2 ways: average stool consistency score and percentage of stools in each consistency category, for each of the 3-day diary periods. Differences in stool composition and stool characteristics in the formula groups were evaluated by analysis of variance followed by pairwise comparisons to test for differences between formula groups. Independent <italic>t</italic> tests were conducted to assess differences between each formula group and the HM group. Differences in stool bifidobacteria concentrations among formula-fed groups were analyzed using analysis of covariance with baseline values and type of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean) included in the model, followed by pairwise comparisons. Differences in IGSQ index scores among formula-fed groups were analyzed using analysis of covariance, followed by pairwise comparisons, including baseline IGSQ index score as the covariate. All tests were 2-sided; &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05 for all tests except those involving individual IGSQ items, which were performed using &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01 to adjust for multiplicity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Study Population</title><p>A total of 300 formula-fed infants were randomly assigned to receive control, <italic>sn</italic>-2, <italic>sn</italic>-2+3&#x0200a;g/L OF, or <italic>sn</italic>-2+5&#x0200a;g/L OF formulas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Outcomes associated with feeding of infant formulas may be improved by the addition of components with specific functions, such as structured lipids rich in <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitic acid (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) and also nondigestible oligosaccharides (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These types of ingredients have been evaluated independently in previous studies; however, the effects of their combination have received only limited attention (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). HM provides approximately 70% of its palmitic acid in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), whereas typical formulas contain vegetable oil fat blends, with 8% to 15% palmitic acid in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In this study, the experimental formulas contained approximately 40% of palmitic acid as <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate, an intermediate level between HM and typical formulas. The present study also evaluated the effects of increasing concentrations of the nondigestible carbohydrate OF in a design that permitted assessment of the addition of structured lipid alone or in combination with OF.</p><p>Triglycerides contribute approximately 50% of the calories in HM and infant formulas and, therefore, their effective digestion and absorption is critical for meeting the substantial caloric requirements of the rapidly growing infant. Triglyceride digestion occurs predominantly in the small intestine and involves the pancreatic lipase/colipase enzyme complex. Hydrolysis is selective for the <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-3 positions, resulting in the generation of 2 free fatty acids and an <italic>sn</italic>-2 monoglyceride (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). All <italic>sn</italic>-2 monoglycerides are well absorbed, as are unsaturated free fatty acids; however, saturated free fatty acids with chain lengths &#x0003e;12 carbons form insoluble, poorly absorbed soaps with intestinal calcium, leading to subsequent loss of both fatty acids and calcium (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). The present study clearly demonstrates that the positional distribution of palmitic acid influences fatty acid absorption in infants receiving formulas containing native oils (low levels of <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitic acid) or structured triglycerides (higher levels of <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitic acid). Stool soap levels of palmitate are much higher in infants receiving the control formula compared with the groups receiving formulas containing structured lipids. This same pattern is seen for other saturated fatty acids, such as myristic and lauric acids. Not surprisingly, the total fatty acid level in stool soaps followed the same pattern as the individual soap fatty acid levels: the control group had significantly higher levels than did the other formula groups. These results are similar to the stool fatty acid data of previous studies in term infants when similar structured lipid preparations were evaluated (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Although we noted some differences in total fecal fat corresponding to different formulas, sufficient calories were absorbed from each formula to ensure normal growth. Anthropometry data showed infants fed high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula, with or without OF, had growth parameters that were similar to those of infants fed control.</p><p>Fecal total fatty acid soaps in the HM-fed group in the present study followed an unexpected pattern. In general, HM-fed infants have lower total fatty acid soaps than infants receiving formulas with fat blends containing high levels of saturated fatty acids in the <italic>sn</italic>-1 and <italic>sn</italic>-3 positions (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In the present study, the HM-fed group had lower palmitic acid soaps than the control group, as expected, whereas lauric and myristic acid soaps were at least as high in the HM-fed group as in control. As a consequence, total fatty acid soaps in the HM-fed group were higher than in the groups receiving high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formulas and only marginally lower than in the group receiving a standard formula. This is in contrast to other studies, but is not unexpected in light of the mothers enrolled in this study. The study population consisted of women of relatively low socioeconomic status from the Philippines. As previously demonstrated in a similar Filipino population, the breast milk fatty acid composition is high in lauric and myristic acids compared with breast milk collected from other countries (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). For example, the proportion of lauric acid in the Filipino population was &#x0003e;13% of the total fatty acids, which is 2 to 3 times higher than the levels from other countries; myristic acid followed a similar pattern. Levels of linoleic acid were approximately 50% lower in the Filipino group than other groups, indicating that this group was consuming a diet limited in both essential fatty acids and in total fat. Such diets result in increased endogenous mammary gland synthesis of fatty acids, with synthesis terminated at carbon chain lengths of 14 carbons or less by thioesterase II, a mammary gland-specific enzyme as opposed to hepatic (and other tissue) fatty acid synthesis in which synthesis is primarily terminated at a chain length of 16 carbons (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). This type of HM composition would result in a substantial increase in lauric and myristic acid intake by the breast-fed infants and the resulting increase in fecal lauric and myristic fatty acid soap output. In addition, stearic fatty acid soaps are elevated in the HM group, which also contributed to their high total fatty acid soap content. HM stearic acid levels from Filipino mothers are relatively low (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), so an elevated level of stool stearic acid soaps is a surprising and unexplained observation.</p><p>Stool calcium concentrations were not significantly different in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 group versus control; however, OF addition to the high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula was associated with a significant reduction in stool calcium at week 8. The amount of calcium in the formulas differed slightly (formula assays revealed 3%, 7%, and 13% less calcium in the <italic>sn</italic>-2, <italic>sn</italic>-2+3&#x0200a;g/L OF, and <italic>sn</italic>-2+5&#x0200a;g/L OF formulas, respectively, compared with the control formula, shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), which may have confounded the findings for stool calcium content; however, the magnitude and dose-response reduction of stool calcium in each experimental formula group versus control (mean stool calcium was 5%, 12%, and 25% lower in the <italic>sn</italic>-2, <italic>sn</italic>-2+3&#x0200a;g/L OF, and <italic>sn</italic>-2+5&#x0200a;g/L OF groups, respectively) suggest that the lower amounts of stool calcium in the experimental formula groups (particularly those with added OF) were likely the result of factors beyond differences in calcium intake. Because this was not a metabolic balance study, no firm conclusions can be drawn from these findings. The fact that stool calcium concentration in infants fed the <italic>sn</italic>-2 and control formulas were not significantly different in our study is consistent with the findings of Carnielli et al (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), who documented significantly lower fecal calcium excretion in infants fed a formula with <italic>sn</italic>-2 levels similar to HM, but not at levels similar to the <italic>sn</italic>-2 formula used in the present study. In addition, Lucas et al (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) reported improved calcium absorption in preterm infants but at a much higher <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate level. Two studies (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) have reported improved bone strength/quality (bone mineral density determined by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry or bone speed of sound by quantitative ultrasound) in term infants fed a high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula compared with those fed a standard formula. The possible effect of incremental lowering of fecal calcium content by OF added to the high <italic>sn</italic>-2 formula in our study is of interest and may be related to the ability of OF to solubilize calcium as well as promote the growth of bifidobacteria and lower colonic pH (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Indeed, several studies (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) have demonstrated improved calcium absorption in pediatric populations as diverse as preterm infants and adolescents receiving supplemental OF. Furthermore, results from a clinical study using formulas with levels of <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate and OF similar to those in the present study, and with similar calcium levels in all study formulas, demonstrated that infants fed <italic>sn</italic>-2+3&#x0200a;g/L OF excreted 25% less calcium in the stool compared with the control group (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>).</p><p>Infants receiving high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula had softer, less-formed stools than infants in the control group, which is consistent with other studies (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The addition of OF was associated with further reductions in the proportion of formed stools compared with controls. The <italic>sn</italic>-2 and <italic>sn</italic>-2+3&#x0200a;g/L OF groups had improved stool softness intermediate between the control and HM groups, whereas the <italic>sn</italic>-2+5&#x0200a;g/L OF group had softer stools, similar to those of the HM group. These findings are consistent with those reported by others for infants fed OF-supplemented formula (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Despite significantly softer stools in the <italic>sn</italic>-2, <italic>sn</italic>-2+3&#x0200a;g/L OF, and <italic>sn</italic>-2+5&#x0200a;g/L OF groups, the frequency of daily bowel movements was not significantly different from that of infants receiving control formula or HM.</p><p>Breast milk contains a variety of nondigestible carbohydrates (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), and these may support populations of potentially beneficial colonic bacteria, such as bifidobacteria, which tend to be higher in HM-fed infants than in formula-fed infants (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Previous studies in adults have demonstrated that OF clearly increases the proportion of colonic and fecal bifidobacteria (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), thus meeting the criteria for classification as a prebiotic (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). The present study evaluated the effects of a structured lipid in infant formula in combination with the nondigestible prebiotic OF. Surprisingly, infants fed the high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula had significantly higher fecal bifidobacteria concentrations than infants receiving the control formula. Although prebiotic function has been clinically demonstrated for OF (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), the possibility that high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formulas may also have a prebiotic function is an important observation and further investigation in this area may prove fruitful. A pilot study (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>) demonstrated that infants fed a formula elevated in <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate (similar to the <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate used in the present study) had fecal flora profiles similar to HM-fed infants and different from those fed a control formula. Infants receiving high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula had significantly higher bifidobacteria and lactobacilli levels compared with those receiving control formula. Support of beneficial bacterial populations may result from direct growth promotion of these populations by <italic>sn</italic>-2-palmitate or from growth inhibition of these populations by palmitate&#x02013;calcium soaps (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>The overall tolerability of a new infant formula is an important consideration in its general use. GI tolerance measured by the IGSQ index score in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 and OF-supplemented formula groups was similar to that of both control and HM-fed infants. OF addition at 3 or 5&#x0200a;g/L did not increase the incidence of watery stools, nor was there evidence of increased gassiness. According to physicians&#x02019; reports, there was no increased incidence of study events in infants fed high <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate formula, either with or without OF. Furthermore, the incidence of GI study events in all formula-fed groups was low and similar to that of HM-fed infants.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, this was a single-center study. Second, the breast-feeding mothers were evidently consuming a relatively lowfat diet, although their diet did not result in production of inadequate breast milk because growth parameters were similar between the HM and formula groups. Finally, we did not collect HM for analysis in the breast-feeding group and were reliant on HM fatty acid data from a previous study in a similar Filipino population (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the present study evaluated alterations to standard infant formula in an effort to improve nutrient absorption, colonic beneficial bacteria levels, and stool consistency in healthy, term infants. The experimental formulas had both a modified lipid system (higher <italic>sn</italic>-2 palmitate levels) and carbohydrate system (inclusion of OF, a nondigestible carbohydrate). These additions, both moving formulas closer to HM, provided specific benefits in infants, including reduction in fecal loss of fatty acids (specifically palmitate) and calcium, softer stool consistency, and increased bifidobacteria levels. Such improvements to infant formula should not induce parents to use formulas instead of breast-feeding, but will provide a more acceptable option if formula must be used.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors thank Carol Cooper, PhD, of Caudex Medical (funded by Wyeth Nutrition) for editorial support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.clinicaltrials.gov"><italic>www.clinicaltrials.gov</italic></ext-link> registration number: NCT01861600.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This study was sponsored by Wyeth Nutrition, a Nestl&#x000e9; business.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>M.Y., M.F., R.N., and J.L. are current employees of Nestl&#x000e9; Nutrition (M.Y., R.N.) and Wyeth Nutrition (M.F., J.L.).
