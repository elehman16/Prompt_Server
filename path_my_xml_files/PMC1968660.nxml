Thirty-eight patients initially received Trilostane of whom 19 subsequently received Aminoglutethimide; 34 patients initially had Aminoglutethimide and seven of these then received Trilostane. Both groups of patients were comparable in all respects. There was no difference in the objective response rate to either drug, Trilostane 11/38 = 29%, Aminoglutethimide 12/34 = 35%, nor in the average time to disease progression for the two drugs, Trilostane 64 weeks, Aminoglutethimide 68 weeks. Of the 26 patients who received both drugs, four showed a response to both suggesting no cross resistance. Side effects were seen to both drugs in approximately half of the patients, but were mainly gastro-intestinal with Trilostane and rash and drowsiness with Aminoglutethimide. There was no evidence of cross over patient susceptibility to side effects.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00202-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1210" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00202-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1211" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00202-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1212" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00202-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1213" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00202-0170.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1214" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00202-0171.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1215" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
