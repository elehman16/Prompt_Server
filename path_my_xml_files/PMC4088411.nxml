Upon removal, catheter tips were cultured using the roll-plate method. CRBSI was defined as isolation of the same species from peripheral blood and the catheter tip. Incidence rates of bacterial catheter colonization between the two treatments were compared using the Cochran&#x02013;Mantel&#x02013;Haenszel &#x003c7;<sup>2 </sup>test. To evaluate bacterial isolates for evidence of acquired 5-FU resistance, isolates cultured from catheter tips were exposed to 5-FU <italic>in vitro </italic>for a second time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of 960 subjects who were randomized, 817 completed the study. Four hundred and nineteen were randomized to the 5-FU group and 398 to the CH-SS group. The rate of colonization of 5-FU catheters was 2.9% (<italic>n </italic>= 12) compared with 5.3% (<italic>n </italic>= 21) in the CH-SS-coated catheters (relative reduction in colonization with 5-FU coating of 46%, <italic>P </italic>= 0.055). There were no statistically significant differences (5-FU vs CH-SS) in local site infections (1.4% vs 0.9%), CRBSI (0% vs 2.8%), and the rate of adverse events related to the study devices (3.4% vs 3.5%). There was no evidence for acquired resistance to 5-FU in clinical isolates exposed to the drug for a second time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The CVC coated with 5-FU is noninferior in its ability to prevent bacterial colonization of the catheter tip when compared with catheters coated with CH-SS.</p></sec></body></article>
