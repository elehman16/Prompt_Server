Currently, there is little evidence to support the belief that participation in care is possible for patients during the acute postoperative period. Previous work indicates that there is very little opportunity for patients to participate in care in the acute context. Patients require both capability, in terms of having the required knowledge and understanding of how they can be involved in their care, and the opportunity, facilitated by clinicians, to engage in their acute postoperative care. This cluster randomised crossover trial aims to test whether a multimedia intervention improves patient participation in the acute postoperative context, as determined by pain intensity and recovery outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A total of 240 patients admitted for primary total knee replacement surgery will be invited to participate in a cluster randomised, crossover trial and concurrent process evaluation in at least two wards at a major non-profit private hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Patients admitted to the intervention ward will receive the multimedia intervention daily from Day 1 to Day 5 (or day of discharge, if prior). The intervention will be delivered by nurses via an iPad&#x02122;, comprising information on the goals of care for each day following surgery. Patients admitted to the control ward will receive usual care as determined by care pathways currently in use across the organization. The primary endpoint is the &#x0201c;worst pain experienced in the past 24&#x000a0;h&#x0201d; on Day 3 following TKR surgery. Pain intensity will be measured using the numerical rating scale. Secondary outcomes are interference of pain on activities of daily living, length of stay in hospital, function and pain following TKR surgery, overall satisfaction with hospitalisation, postoperative complications and hospital readmission.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of interventions that provide knowledge and opportunity for patient participation during postoperative in-hospital care in actually increasing participation, and the impact of participation on patient outcomes. The results of this study will also provide data about the barriers and enablers to participation in the acute care context.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.anzctr.org.au/default.aspx">ACTRN12614000340639</ext-link> Trial Registration date 31/03/2014.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Patient participation</kwd><kwd>Patient involvement</kwd><kwd>Patient experience</kwd><kwd>Patient satisfaction</kwd><kwd>Acute care</kwd><kwd>Cluster randomised crossover trial</kwd><kwd>Multimedia intervention</kwd><kwd>Health service evaluation</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001778</institution-id><institution>Deakin University (AU)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APA Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDonall</surname><given-names>Jo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Active participation of patients in their care is important for ensuring safe and high quality healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Factors known to impact on patients&#x02019; capability and opportunity to participate in healthcare include both patient and nurse-related factors. Patient-related factors that impact on their ability to participate in healthcare include acceptance of the new patient role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], medical knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], level of confidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], knowledge related to condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], acuity of illness, and comorbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. For nurses, acceptance and promotion of patient participation is influenced by issues such as the desire to maintain control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the acuity of patients&#x02019; illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and available time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>In Australia, total knee replacement (TKR) surgery is an increasingly common treatment for patients with osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. TKR surgery is performed to reduce knee pain, improve function and to improve quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In 2013, 48,502 knee replacements were undertaken nationally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. This represents an increase of 2.7&#x000a0;% compared to numbers reported in 2011. The majority of TKR surgeries in 2012 (76.9&#x000a0;%) were in private hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Of these, 21.5&#x000a0;% (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10,435) were performed in Victoria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. TKR surgery is a relatively common and successful procedure, but also considered one of the most painful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] postoperatively.</p><p>In order for patients to achieve maximum benefit from TKR surgery they must commence early mobilisation of the knee joint to maximise range of movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Adequate pain management is fundamental to achieve early mobilisation and meet postoperative goals of recovery. High levels of postoperative pain intensity are linked to reduced knee mobility and prolonged recovery times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Poorly controlled pain postoperatively has also been associated with the development of ongoing chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>The complexity of the acute postoperative environment and severity of symptoms after TKR surgery may limit patients&#x02019; participation in their care, leading to variability in the quality of pain management they receive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and subsequently, their ability to meet postoperative recovery goals. Pain is a subjective experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and in order for nurses to understand patients&#x02019; level of pain and provide appropriate interventions, patients need to be involved and actively participate in the control of their pain management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Variability in the quality of postoperative pain management in the context of joint replacement surgery can have significant consequences for patients, including poor overall recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], reduced physical functioning, increased length of stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and an unsatisfactory patient experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>To date, the majority of studies examining patient participation in their care have focused on patient participation in medical treatment decisions and self-management associated with chronic life-long illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Patient participation in meeting treatment goals of care during acute episodic illness is poorly understood and requires further exploration. The current study addresses this gap by using an intervention designed to facilitate patient participation in achieving adequate pain management and therefore meet the goals of recovery in the immediate postoperative period after TKR surgery. A nurse-led, multimedia animation intervention will be implemented immediately after surgery in order to increase both the capability of (through information) and opportunity for (through interaction with nurses) patients to participate in their goals of care after TKR surgery.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims of the study</title><p>The purpose of this research is to design, implement and evaluate a nurse-led multimedia education intervention to improve postoperative outcomes for patients post TKR and explore the relationships between patient participation, patient experience and patient satisfaction with care.</p><p>The overall aim of this study is to test whether a nurse-led, multimedia intervention, designed to provide knowledge and opportunity for patients to participate in their acute postoperative recovery after surgery, improves their recovery.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A cluster randomised, crossover trial and simultaneous process evaluation will be undertaken using mixed-methods for data collection and analysis. In this study, each cluster refers to a hospital ward (1, 2 or 3) and the cohort refers to the group of patients admitted to the ward during a specified period of time. Two clusters, or wards, will receive both the intervention and control (usual care) conditions in separate time periods, and, in sequences that are randomised to the two wards. The third ward will act as an &#x0201c;overflow&#x0201d; ward for patients who are consented on the study but are unable to be admitted, when the wards are full, to either of the two orthopaedic wards that received randomized sequences of conditions. This third ward will receive the control condition only as we are unable to guarantee that this ward will contain 20 to 30 consented patients in a period and so assigning the intervention to this ward would have been wasteful (in terms of sample size allocation). The trial can be described as a cluster randomised crossover design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] with two clusters and an added control cluster. The two crossover wards will be randomised to sequences of conditions to ensure that at least one ward receives the intervention and the other ward receives the control in each period.

Suitable patients will be approached by the researcher who will invite them to read a study information sheet. Those interested in participation will be provided with a Participant Information and Consent Form and the baseline questionnaire.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Multimedia goals of care intervention</title><p>The multimedia program was developed specifically for TKR patients by Enlighten Health&#x000ae;, a medical multimedia production company specialising in validated content for patient and clinical education. The multimedia intervention is presented in a format that combines text, sound, graphics and animation to provide information to patients in relation to postoperative recovery and goals of care for each day, up to 5&#x000a0;days following a TKR.</p><p>The multimedia program intervention, is designed to be both nurse-led, where the nurse assists the patient to navigate through the program, and patient self-directed; it is delivered to patients as a stand-alone program package on an iPad&#x02122;. The intervention is designed with tailored information about the expected postoperative recovery on each day from Day one (1) to Day five (5) (or day of discharge) after TKR surgery. Embedded throughout the program is the importance of adequate pain management in order to achieve daily goals of recovery. The aim of the intervention is to facilitate an interaction between patients and their nurse each postoperative day about the specific goals and plans of care for each day of recovery after TKR surgery. The three main goals of recovery for patients after TKR surgery are: 1) to manage pain, 2) promote mobility of the knee joint to improve function and 3) avoid complications such as thromboembolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention application procedure</title><p>Daily, until discharge from the ward, following nursing handover and after patients&#x02019; morning meal (approximately 0900&#x000a0;h), the nurse allocated to care for a patient enrolled in the study reminds the patient to view the corresponding day&#x02019;s goals of care package on the iPad&#x02122;. The iPad&#x02122; is secured to the patient&#x02019;s bedside to allow easy access to the program any time of the day or night and in addition, patients&#x02019; relatives can also view the presentation. It is anticipated that after viewing the goals of care animation, patients together with the nurse will discuss the patient&#x02019;s goals for the day.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control &#x02013; usual care</title><p>The control condition, received by a cohort of patients admitted to a ward over a particular time period, consists of usual care based on the clinical pathways currently in use across the organisation for patients after TKR surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Research setting</title><p>Data will be collected in three acute inpatient orthopaedic wards of a major, private, metropolitan hospital in Melbourne.

Alleviation of pain is a fundamental obligation of healthcare providers, yet clinical studies continue to show that current practices to alleviate pain are unsatisfactory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Poor pain management is associated with serious physiological and psychological sequelae that compromise recovery and negatively affect morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Suboptimal treatment of acute postoperative pain is also strongly associated with the development of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Risk factors for developing chronic post-surgical pain include unrelieved acute pain, persistent severe pain, inappropriate use of analgesics following surgery, as well as patients&#x02019; pain-related beliefs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Patient participation in pain treatment decisions can positively influence their postoperative pain experience and lessen risk of progression to chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] however studies show that patients have little opportunities to participation in pain management decisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Primary endpoint</title><p>The primary endpoint for the assessment of patient experience is the &#x0201c;worst pain experienced in the past 24&#x000a0;h&#x0201d; on Day 3 following TKR surgery. Worst pain will be measured using the 0&#x02013;10 NRS where 0 equates to &#x0201c;No pain&#x0201d; and 10 equates to &#x0201c;Worst possible pain&#x0201d;. Patients will be asked to choose a whole number from 0 to 10 that best describes their worst pain experienced in the previous 24&#x000a0;h.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>In this study, the null hypothesis (H<sub>o</sub>) associated with the primary objective is that no difference exists between patients in the intervention group and the control group in terms of worst pain score on Day 3 post TKR surgery. NRS pain intensity scores will be analysed via the fitting of a linear mixed model with random effects for clusters, cohorts within clusters, and, patients within cohorts, and, fixed effects for the conditions. The F-test, conducted at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level, will be used to compare the average pain scores for the two conditions (intervention versus control).</p><p>The number of clusters is essentially fixed (i.e. two or possibly three wards) but the number of periods, or cohorts per ward, (2, 3 or 4) and the number of patients in each cohort (24 or 30) was selected in order to achieve 80&#x000a0;% power when there are at least two wards and when the difference (delta) between the average pain scores for the two conditions is 1.65 and at least 70&#x000a0;% power when delta is 1.5. Preliminary (unpublished) data indicate that pain scores decline by 1 to 1.5 units from day 3 to day 4 post TKR surgery and so a delta of 1.5 to 1.65 at 3&#x000a0;days is a similar but enhanced improvement.</p><p>Pilot data results also indicated a between-patient (i.e. within-cohort) standard deviation equal to 2 (i.e. between-patient variance component, VP, equals 4) and a grand mean equal to 7. The between-ward variance component (VW) and between-cohorts variance component (VC) were assumed to be equal to 0.025 (this was based on unpublished data for two wards assessed in the same time period).</p><p>As the NRS pain intensity score is a bounded discrete outcome score, the power of the F-test was calculated by simulation. Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) observations were generated by adding normal random variables sampled from three distributions (corresponding to the three sources of variation and their specified variance components) to the conjectured fixed effect means and then rounding the result to the nearest whole number in the range of 0&#x02013;10. In this way, the bounded and discrete nature of the NRS scores was accounted for in analyses of variance (ANOVA) designed for continuous scale variables. For each scenario (combinations of delta, variance components, cohort sizes and ranges of period effects) 10,000 simulations of each &#x0201c;study&#x0201d; were performed and the type II error rate (&#x003b2;) was calculated. The ANOVA directive and programming language in the GenStat statistical system (Release 14.2) were used to perform the simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Results of the simulations when period effects are assumed to be equally spaced are shown in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>. When the range of the period effects decreases, the power increases. With two wards, the effect difference that would be detectable with 80&#x000a0;% power, when the period effects are in the range from -1 to +1, VW, VC and VP are 0.025, 0.025 and 4 respectively AND when the cohort size is 24, is delta&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.80, and when the cohort size is 30, delta reduces to 1.65.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Power and sample size calculations (based on two wards and four periods)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Range of period effects</th><th>Delta</th><th>VW</th><th>VC</th><th>VP</th><th>NP</th><th>Power</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>&#x02212;1.5, 1.5</td><td char="." align="char">1.50</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>24</td><td char="." align="char">0.651</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02212;1.0, 1.0</td><td char="." align="char">1.50</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>24</td><td char="." align="char">0.670</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02212;0.75, 0.75</td><td char="." align="char">1.50</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>24</td><td char="." align="char">0.680</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02212;1.5, 1.5</td><td char="." align="char">1.50</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>30</td><td char="." align="char">0.714</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02212;1.0, 1.0</td><td char="." align="char">1.50</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>30</td><td char="." align="char">0.741</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02212;0.75, 0.75</td><td char="." align="char">1.50</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>30</td><td char="." align="char">0.744</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02212;1.0, 1.0</td><td char="." align="char">1.80</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>24</td><td char="." align="char">0.797</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02212;1.0, 1.0</td><td char="." align="char">1.65</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">0.025</td><td char="." align="char">4.0</td><td>30</td><td char="." align="char">0.803</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Footnote: Power and sample size calculations were calculated for the F test (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) for a difference between the intervention and control groups in Day-3 worst pain. Delta is the absolute value of the difference in the mean pain scores. Components of variance in Day-3 pain scores are fixed as follows: between wards (VW&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025), between cohorts of patients within the same ward (VC&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.025) and between patients within a cohort within a ward (VP&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.0). NP is the number of patients in a cohort. The power (1-&#x003b2;) is the probability that the null hypothesis, of no difference in the mean Day-3 worst pain scores between the control and intervention groups, is rejected when the true, but unknown, difference is delta, the components of variance are as given, there are two wards and four cohorts per ward managed contemporaneously in four time periods, and the F-test is conducted at the 5&#x000a0;% significance level (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05).

Our previous work in relation to patient participation in acute care has shown very low levels of patient involvement in care. In order to understand the complexities of facilitating patient participation in recovery after surgery, interventions to improve the capability of patients to participate need to be developed and evaluated. Evidence of the effectiveness of interventions that influence patient participation, on patient outcomes in the acute postoperative context, is not available. The outcomes of this research will inform the vital aspects of patient involvement in care processes and importantly provide evidence for the effectiveness of participation in improving patient outcomes after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>APSOQ-R, American pain society&#x02019;s patient outcome questionnaire; CPS, control preference scale; NRS, numerical rating scale; OKS, Oxford knee score; PAM, patient activation measure; TKR, total knee replacement</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Norman Beischer Medical Research Foundation.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>No funding was obtained for this study.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data and materials available on request to corresponding author.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors read and approved the final version of this manuscript.
