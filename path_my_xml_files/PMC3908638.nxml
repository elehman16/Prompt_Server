The sweating is initiated even by mild emotional arousal; even the thought about embarrassment suffices to induce a strong sweating response. It has been documented that thoracic sympathectomy (blocking of the sympathetic system) results in immediate resolution of symptoms [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>However, it is not clear to what extent this surgical intervention has an effect on one's further emotional functioning, given the fact that the sympathetic nervous system plays a major role in the experience and expression of emotions. In particular, &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; emotions (e.g., anger, fright, joy) are accompanied by increased sympathetic activation. Although the role of the sympathetic nervous system in sadness and crying is less clear, it has been shown that the innervation of the lacrimal gland is also under the influence of sympathetic system nerves. More specifically, it has been documented that the sympathetic nervous system plays a direct and significant role in the process of crying (initiating and modulating tear secretion) [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], not only modulating blood flow to the gland. Ding <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] showed that lacrimal glands (in rats and mice) are stimulated by &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>- and &#x003b2;-adrenergic pathways. It has further been demonstrated that in Sj&#x000f6;gren's syndrome, with the characteristic decrease in secretion, the tear production and crying can be compromised due to impaired neural control [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. On the other hand, Dartt [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] presented evidence strongly supporting the predominance of parasympathetic innervation in human lacrimal glands, but this author also emphasizes the important role of the &#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic pathway in crying regulation.</p><p>Crying is a frequent and typical form of human emotional behaviour, which may serve both intra-individual (e.g., catharsis; physiological recovery) and inter-individual (communication of one's feeling state) functions. It can be elicited by a variety of factors, in particular pain, loss, conflicts and perceived inadequacy, but also empathy or sympathy, and by positive emotions and tender feelings.</p><p>In has also been demonstrated that the sequelae of crying and sympathetic/parasympathetic systems&#x02019; tone play an important role in self-regulatory mechanisms [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Rottenberg <italic>et al</italic>. evaluated the connection of tearful crying and autonomic nervous system activity represented by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), an index of the vagal (parasympathetic) control of heart rate that is associated with emotion regulatory capacity. They observed an RSA increase after tearful crying in non-depressed individuals, consistent with a homeostatic function for crying, whereas in depressed subjects crying did not result in an increased RSA. This suggests that the physiological self-regulatory mechanism invoked by crying is compromised in depression [<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In that context, it seems obvious to control the emotional status of the participants involved in any study on crying.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Aim</title><p>The aim of the present study was the prospective evaluation of the impact of thoracic sympathectomy on crying tendency in primary hyperhidrosis patients versus healthy age- and sex- matched controls. This raises the question whether thoracic sympathectomy may have effects on the experience and expression of emotions and in particular crying. Since the entire sympathetic system can be involved in physical arousal, it may be hypothesized that thoracic sympathectomy can influence the overall sympathetic tone and, additionally, the tendency to cry.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0003"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="S20004"><title>Study participants</title><p>Eighty-six consecutive patients qualified for thoracoscopic sympathectomy due to primary hyperhidrosis and facial blushing took part in the study.</p><p>Primary hyperhidrosis diagnosis was obtained with the gravimetric method, described previously by Hund <italic>et al</italic>.

In brief, a pre-measured tissue is given to the patient, who wipes his/her hands with it for 1 min. The weight of the tissue is recorded then again and a net result is obtained.

It is a minimally invasive procedure performed through two small incisions in the thoracic cavity. The idea of the procedure is to disrupt the thoracic trunk at a specific level: in this case above the T3 ganglion (for hyperhidrosis). The procedure usually takes about 60 min bilaterally. The hospitalization is short term, in most cases not longer than 24&#x02013;48 h [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].

In the group of female patients, sympathectomy resulted in an increased number of crying episodes, though the subjective tendency to cry was diminished. In men, the subjective tendency to cry was unchanged and did not differ significantly from the data obtained from the control group.</p><p>It can be hypothesised that the successful operation resulted in improved mood and therefore the number of crying episodes should be lower [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast, in our study, the number of crying episodes increased after surgery. The emotional status, as expected, affected the number of crying episodes but not the overall tendency to cry. Moreover, both the number of crying episodes and overall tendency to cry were both prior to and after surgery significantly lower than the levels of those variables observed in the control group.</p><p>It can be explained by the increase of parasympathetic tone in lacrimal glands after surgery and, further, the increase of crying due to the lack of compensatory effect of the sympathetic system against the parasympathetic one, which is in agreement with the findings of Dartt [<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>This lacrimal glands are innervated by the autonomic nervous system, with the predominance of the parasympathetic [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the sympathetic nervous system plays a direct and significant role in initiating and modulating tear secretion, not only influencing the blood flow to the gland [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Tears are shed for many reasons, in situations characterized by loss, conflicts, and perceived inadequacy [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, there is a seeming association with the experience of happy situations, sentimental reactions [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and tender feelings [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. As mentioned above, crying can best be conceptualized as an attachment behaviour, serving to signal distress and to obtain caregiving and emotional support [<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Bekker and Vingerhoets [<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] introduced a model for systematic investigations in crying. In this model, the following factors are distinguished: (a) a baseline threshold for shedding tears; (b) the amount of exposure to cry-eliciting stimulation; (c) appraisal processes and capacity to regulate emotional impulses; and (d) social factors that may encourage or prevent the shedding of tears. Those variables have been investigated in our study.</p><p>It can also be hypothesised that the lower level of tendency to cry and less frequent crying episodes prior to surgery observed in the female participants of our study may be associated with permanently increased sympathetic tone. Thus, the physiological capacity of the sympathetic system would be permanently overloaded and there would be no more capacity for crying reactions.</p><p>On the other hand, it is also possible that long-term struggle with chronic disease increases the hardiness of the patients and makes them less susceptible to stress-inducing situations and therefore they are less prone to crying.</p><p>As mentioned above, the subjective tendency to cry was unchanged in men and did not differ significantly from the data obtained from the control group. This finding support the perspective of separate evaluation of crying in different genders. The number of crying episodes was decreased after surgery to the level observed in the control group. These results are most likely associated with the improved emotional status of the patients, together with increased quality of life and decreased life-burden caused by the symptoms of the disease.</p><p>It is also worth noting that the patients treated with ETS did not find that the surgery influenced their crying. It is even more interesting in the context of the above-mentioned results.</p><p>This study has several drawback that should be considered when evaluating the results. First, after the division into genders the numbers of participants may be considered small, though the consistency of the structure of the results (quantified as the ratio of standard deviation to mean) is satisfactory. Second, this is strictly an observational longitudinal study, as no randomization was performed. It can be proposed that randomization between ETS and some other form of treatment of hyperhidrosis (such as Botox or iontophoresis) might provide an interesting insight into the problem as the latter does not destroy the sympathetic system while it also provides at least a temporary decrease of the intensity of the symptoms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"
