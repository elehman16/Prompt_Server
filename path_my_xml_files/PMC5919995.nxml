It regulates diverse CNS functions including learning, memory, sedation, and sleep and is a validated pharmacological target (Olsen and Sieghart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). While a variety of GABA-A agonist drugs have been approved, attempts to develop GABA-A antagonists have been hindered by their propensity to induce seizures. Indeed, pentylenetetrazol, a GABA-A antagonist, is commonly used as an experimental CNS convulsant (Adeoluwa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par6">GABA-A receptors are ionotropic heteropentameric assemblies derived from a family of 19 members (6&#x003b1;, 3&#x003b2;, 3&#x003b3;, &#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, &#x003b8;, &#x003c0;, 3&#x003c1;), with 20 distinct configurations described (Olsen and Sieghart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2008</xref>). Their functional characteristics vary depending on receptor subtype and localization within the brain and within the neuron. For example, extrasynaptic &#x003b1;5 subunit-containing GABA-A receptors have a well-established role in the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory, and represent an attractive target for memory-enhancing drugs with antagonizing properties (Mohler and Rudolph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2017</xref>). By contrast, activation of &#x003b1;1 subunit-containing GABA-A receptors, which are more dispersed and most often located within the synapse, induces sedation and sleep (Mohler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>). The GABA system is also involved in sleep regulation (Saper et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2010</xref>; Scammell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2017</xref>). Most sedative/hypnotics used for insomnia target the GABA-A receptor (Winsky-Sommerer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2009</xref>), and activation of GABA-A receptors in the posterior hypothalamus promotes sleep and contributes to both homeostatic and circadian sleep regulation (Volgin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par7">In addition to GABA, endogenous 3&#x003b1;,5&#x003b1;- and 3&#x003b1;,5&#x003b2;-reduced metabolites of progesterone such as allopregnanolone (3&#x003b1;-hydroxy-5&#x003b1;-pregnane-20-one) and THDOC (3&#x003b1;,5&#x003b1;-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone), commonly referred to as neurosteroids, act as strong positive allosteric modulators of the GABA-mediated activation of both synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA-A receptors (Majewska et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1986</xref>), thus enhancing both phasic and tonic inhibition. Allopregnanolone is a potent anesthetic and induces an inhibitory GABAergic tone in the CNS that alters the sleep/wake cycle and impairs memory and learning. Inhibition of the effects of neurosteroids on the GABA-A receptor holds promise as a therapeutic approach to revere GABAergic-mediated inhibition of CNS function without the analeptic effects associated with GABA-A receptor antagonists (Johansson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>).&#x000a0;GR3027 is a novel investigational drug that has been shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to selectively antagonize the positive modulation of &#x003b1;1- and &#x003b1;5-subunit-containing GABA-A receptors by neurosteroids, i.e., potentially influencing both phasic and tonic inhibition, without antagonizing the effects of GABA and in vivo to restore spatial learning and motor coordination in two animal models of hepatic encephalopathy (Johansson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>; Johansson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2016</xref>). In the present studies, we have examined its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in humans during single and multiple ascending dose (SAD and MAD) studies in healthy adults as well as its ability to enter the CNS and exhibit GABA-A receptor-modulating steroid antagonist properties in the context of an allopregnanolone challenge using maximal saccadic eye velocity (SEV) and sedation/somnolence as pharmacodynamic markers.</p><p id="Par8">Saccadic eye velocity is used to assess the effects of GABA-A receptor agonists such as allopregnanolone or benzodiazepines (Ball et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1991</xref>; Timby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>). The saccade is the fast movement of the eye when the gaze is shifted to a new peripheral visual stimulus. When a new visual target is presented, the gaze, after a latency period, moves towards the new target (Carpenter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>). The maximal speed reached during the saccade, i.e., the SEV, is dependent on the angle between the targets, is regulated by the activity of the GABA-A receptor, and is not under conscious control (Ball et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1991</xref>). SEV is, therefore, a sensitive and quantifiable measure of GABA-A receptor modulation by compounds like allopregnanolone or benzodiazepines (Ball et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1991</xref>; Carpenter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2000</xref>; Moller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; Timby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>). A GABA-A-mediated decrease in SEV, for example by allopregnanolone, is generally accompanied by increased sedation/somnolence (Timby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2006</xref>; van Broekhoven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par9">The present studies demonstrate that GR3027, a novel oral GABA-A receptor-modulating steroid antagonist, enters the brain and inhibits the effect of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone in humans at doses which are well within the range that exhibits excellent tolerability and pharmacokinetics. The studies build on prior work exploring the ability of isoallopregnanolone (an endogenous neurosteroid antagonist) to antagonize the effects of allopregnanolone on SEV and sedation in animals and humans (Backstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2005</xref>; Bengtsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">The first in human GR3027 SAD study (part 1 of EudraCT 2015-004911-19) and the 5-day MAD study (EudraCT 2016-003651-30) were prospective, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled and designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic characteristics of single and multiple ascending oral doses of GR3027 in healthy male volunteers.

AEs were generally mild and neither SAEs nor dose-limiting toxicity was observed up to the highest doses administered to healthy adult males in the single (200&#x000a0;mg) or multiple (100&#x000a0;mg every 12&#x000a0;h for 5&#x000a0;days) ascending dose protocols. At all doses studied, GR3027 exhibited linear PK, i.e., both <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and systemic exposure assessed as AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> (SAD) or AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub> (steady-state in MAD) were linearly related to oral dose. During steady-state dosing, accumulation ratios were dose dependent and ranged from 1.3 to 1.6.</p><p id="Par55">Importantly, the results of the challenge study further indicate that GR3027 enters the brain and antagonizes the effects of allopregnanolone at the GABA-A receptor. By prespecified analysis, GR3027 at 30&#x000a0;mg, but not 3&#x000a0;mg, significantly inhibited the effects of allopregnanolone on SEV, whereas neither doses had a significant effect on sedation. However, based on post hoc analyses restricted to just those subjects who exhibited an allopregnanolone-induced change in SEV or self-rated sedation and to just the time interval during which these effects were observed, orally administered GR3027 produced apparent dose-dependent inhibition of the effects of allopregnanolone. SEV was significantly inhibited by 30&#x000a0;mg GR3027 with an intermediate, but non-significant, inhibition at 3&#x000a0;mg. GR3027 also significantly reversed allopregnanolone-induced sedation at both the 3 and 30&#x000a0;mg doses, again in apparent dose-dependent fashion.</p><p id="Par56">The prespecified analyses in the present study were based on prior studies of allopregnanolone administration to healthy adult females (Bengtsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Hedstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>; Timby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). While the effects of the allopregnanolone challenge observed in the present study in healthy males, including the maximal change in both SEV and sedation, are generally similar to those previously described in healthy adult females (Bengtsson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2015</xref>; Hedstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>; Moller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; Timby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>), interesting differences were observed. For example, only 50&#x02013;70% of the healthy adult male subjects exhibited sedation and/or SEV inhibition in the present study vs. over 90% of healthy adult females given the same milligram per kilogram dose of allopregnanolone (unpublished data). Moreover, among those males who did respond to allopregnanolone, the effect lasted for a shorter period of time, i.e., ~&#x02009;80&#x000a0;min for both SEV and sedation, vs. 120 to more than 180&#x000a0;min in females given similar doses (Hedstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>; Moller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; Timby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>). Although decreased sensitivity to allopregnanolone-induced changes in SEV has been observed in overweight females (Hedstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>), response among males to allopregnanolone in the present study appeared unrelated to either BMI or serum allopregnanolone levels.</p><p id="Par57">We are aware of one prior study (van Broekhoven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>) in which both men and women received i.v. allopregnanolone that suggested the presence of gender-related differences. At the highest dose (0.045&#x000a0;mg/kg), males exhibited a smaller SEV response than females while no gender difference in SEV response was reported at lower doses. By contrast, males exhibited more sedation than females in response to low doses of allopregnanolone, but also seemed to recover more quickly than females. In the von Broekhoven study (van Broekhoven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2007</xref>), serum allopregnanolone concentrations increased significantly more in males vs. females. These findings in aggregate suggest that while the overall response to an allopregnanolone challenge is similar among healthy adult males and females, there are likely subtle gender-related differences in allopregnanolone uptake and/or disposition and/or GABA-A receptor sensitivity to allopregnanolone that account for the differences in the response to allopregnanolone exhibited by males vs. females (Backstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2013</xref>; Hedstrom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>; Timby et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2016</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">The favorable safety and pharmacokinetic findings as well as the results of the allopregnanolone challenge study suggest that GR3027 represents a promising new treatment for human disorders attributable to the CNS effects of neurosteroids. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a neurological disorder associated with cirrhosis and portal-systemic shunting in which elevated brain levels of allopregnanolone have been reported (Ahboucha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Ahboucha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>), is one example. The manifestations of HE comprise a wide spectrum that ranges from subtly impaired covert neuropsychiatric abnormalities detectable only by standardized testing to clinically overt abnormalities that include altered motor function, sleep disturbances with changes in the sleep-wake cycle, daytime drowsiness, slurred speech, inappropriate behaviour, impaired memory impairment, shortened attention span, altered mental status with disorientation, coma, and even death (Bajaj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>; Montagnese et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>; Vilstrup et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2014</xref>). Indeed, GR3027 has shown promise in two different animal models of HE, including rats with portacaval shunts and rats with chronic hyperammonemia, both of which are associated with increased brain concentrations of neurosteroids (Ahboucha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Cauli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2009</xref>). In both animal models, GR3027 restored motor coordination, spatial learning, and spatial memory and partially restored the abnormal circadian rhythm in portacaval shunt rats (Johansson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par59">The apparently greater effect of GR3027 on reversing allopregnanolone&#x02019;s effect on sedation vs. SEV in the present study in adult males is an interesting finding reminiscent of prior findings in the portacaval shunt rat model of HE (Johansson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>), in which a lower subcutaneous dose of GR3027 restored motor coordination compared to the higher dose needed to restore learning in the radial maze. One potential explanation for this differing dose-dependency is that different areas of the brain with differing GABA-A receptor subtypes are responsible for different neurological functions, i.e., SEV is specifically controlled by GABA-A receptors in the superior colliculus and in cerebellum (Hikosaka and Wurtz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1983</xref>; Kojima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>), while spatial learning is mainly modulated in the hippocampus (Moser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2017</xref>). It is also possible that uptake and/or disposal of allopregnanolone or GR3027 differs among differing brain areas (Bixo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1997</xref>; Johansson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>; Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1995</xref>).</p><p id="Par60">The findings of the challenge study extend the earlier findings in animal models. While the CNS concentrations of allopregnanolone resulting from the i.v. challenge cannot be directly measured, currently available data suggest that they are pathophysiologically relevant to those in human disease states and that GR3027 antagonizes the effects of allopregnanolone at such concentrations. Serum allopregnanolone concentrations measured in adult males 10&#x000a0;min after injection averaged ~&#x02009;80&#x000a0;nM, considerably higher than concentrations of 6&#x02013;20&#x000a0;nmol/kg in the brain of cirrhotic patients who died in hepatic coma (Ahboucha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Ahboucha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>). Moreover, animal studies indicate that the concentration vs. time profile for GR3027 (unpublished data) and allopregnanolone (Johansson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>) is very similar in brain and plasma. The results imply that GR3027 administered at doses as low as 30&#x000a0;mg, well within the range that is well tolerated in adult males, can reverse the effects of neurosteroids even at concentrations higher than those described in HE patients. Importantly, GR3027 by itself had no effect on either SEV or sedation. This is consistent with in vitro findings and its mechanism of action whereby it would be expected to selectively reverse only neurosteroid-mediated modulation of GABA-A receptors.</p><p id="Par61">Several recent observations also implicate neurosteroid-induced allosteric activation of CNS GABA-A receptors in the excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) associated with disorders such as idiopathic hypersomnia (Billiard and Sonka <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>). These include the identification of a population of GABAergic neurons in the ventral lateral hypothalamus that help mediate human wakefulness (Venner et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2016</xref>), the identification of a putative GABA-A agonist in the CSF of patients with primary hypersomnia (Rye et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2012</xref>), and the clinical observation that the GABA-A antagonist flumazenil can promote wakefulness in patients with EDS (Trotti et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2016</xref>). Indeed, the clinical manifestations of HE and hypersomnolence disorders exhibit similarities, and HE has been considered a sleepiness disorder (Montagnese et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par62">In summary, these findings show that GR3027 administered orally to humans antagonizes the effects of the neurosteroid allopregnanolone at the GABA-A receptor in the brain at doses which are well tolerated and associated with linear pharmacokinetics. This suggests that GR3027 may also be able to normalize GABAergic neurotransmission and represents a promising new therapeutic for treatment of HE, disorders associated with hypersomnolence or other disorders attributable to neurosteroid-mediated allosteric over-activation of GABA-A receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
