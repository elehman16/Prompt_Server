However, existing mu-opioid antagonists have had limited success as anti-addiction treatments. GSK1521498 is a selective and potent mu-opioid antagonist being developed for the treatment of overeating and substance addictions. In this study, 28 healthy participants were administered single doses of GSK1521498 20&#x02009;mg, ethanol 0.5&#x02009;g/kg body weight, or both in combination, in a double blind placebo controlled four-way crossover design. The primary objective was to determine the risk of significant adverse pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions. The effects of GSK1521498 on hedonic and consummatory responses to alcohol and the attentional processing of alcohol-related stimuli, and their modulation by the <italic>OPRM1</italic> A118G polymorphism were also explored. GSK1521498 20&#x02009;mg was well tolerated alone and in combination with ethanol. There were mild transient effects of GSK1521498 on alertness and mood that were greater when it was combined with ethanol. These effects were not of clinical significance. There were no effects of GSK1521498 on reaction time, hedonic or consummatory responses. These findings provide encouraging safety and PK data to support continued development of GSK1521498 for the treatment of alcohol addiction.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>mu-opioid receptor</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>pharmacodynamics</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd><italic>OPRM1</italic></kwd><kwd>pharmacogenetics</kwd><kwd>alcohol</kwd><kwd>addiction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The development of drug addiction is characterized by the transition from hedonic drug taking under voluntary control, to compulsive and habitual consumption despite the negative consequences, with an increased motivation to consume and an inability to control consumption,<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> This transition is marked by critical neuroadaptations in key nodes of the dopamine reward circuitry such as the nucleus accumbens.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system is a key modulator of this circuitry and has important inhibitory effects on accumbens dopamine via GABAergic projections from the ventral tegmental area (VTA).<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Alcohol produces its effect by enhancing dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens by disinhibiting the VTA.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Its effects are modulated by the <italic>OPRM1</italic> A118G polymorphism of the MOR<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and carriage of the G allele has been associated with the risk of addiction in some reports.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In alcohol dependence, the opioid system becomes dysregulated and MOR levels increase.

In addition the PK, safety and tolerability of GSK1521498 20&#x02009;mg separately and in combination with ethanol were investigated. In exploratory analyses, the effects of GSK1521498 on hedonic and consummatory aspects of alcohol consumption and on attentional and perceptual bias to alcohol-related stimuli were examined.</p><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-eight healthy participants aged 21&#x02013;55 years and within 20% of normal weight for their height and body build were recruited into the study. All subjects had to have a history of regular alcohol consumption, defined as an average weekly intake of up to 14 drinks/week for men and 7 drinks/week for women, within the previous 6 months. Participants were excluded if they had a current or chronic history of liver disease, neurological disorders, previous or current psychiatric history, a past history of DSM-IV alcohol dependence or abuse, or if they were trying to quit alcohol. A total of 28 subjects participated in parts 1 (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;4) and 2 (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;28). The four participants from part 1 also participated in part 2. The study was approved by the Integreview Ethical Review Board, Texas. It was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline and conducted at the PPD Phase 1 Clinic in Texas, United States (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> identifier: NCT01366573).

Part 2 used a randomized, double blind, four-period, crossover design (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">2</xref>). The study was double blind only with respect to GSK1521498 as it was not possible to completely blind subjects to the taste and mouthfeel of alcohol. Alcohol was administered in a beverage containing 0.5&#x02009;g/kg ethanol mixed with orange juice to a total volume of 200&#x02009;mL. In the non-alcohol condition, a plain orange juice beverage was provided, matched for color and volume with the alcoholic beverage. Subjects were randomized to receive each of the following treatments: (A) oral placebo matching GSK1521498 followed 4&#x02009;hours later by orange juice; (B) oral placebo followed 4&#x02009;hours later by alcoholic beverage; (C) oral GSK1521498 20&#x02009;mg followed 4&#x02009;hours later by orange juice; (D) oral GSK1521498 20&#x02009;mg followed 4&#x02009;hours later by alcoholic beverage.

Samples were centrifuged in a refrigerated centrifuge (&#x0223c;4&#x000b0;C) at 1,500<italic>g</italic> or 3,000&#x02009;rpm for 10&#x02009;minutes. The resultant plasma was transferred to appropriately labeled 1.8&#x02009;mL (GSK1521498) or 3.6&#x02009;mL (ethanol) polypropylene tubes and stored at approximately &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C (or colder) until transferred in the frozen state to Aptuit Laboratories, Verona, Italy (GSK1521498) or PPD, Richmond VA (ethanol). All study samples were received in acceptable condition.</p><p>Plasma ethanol analysis was performed under the management of Worldwide Bioanalysis, Drug Metabolism and PKs, GlaxoSmithKline. Plasma ethanol concentrations were determined by PPD, Inc. (Richmond, Virginia) using a validated method (PPD Method GC 89 Version 1.011,2,3). Ethanol and its internal standard, n-propanol, were extracted from 100&#x02009;&#x000b5;L human plasma and analyzed via heated headspace gas chromatography with flame ionization detector. The assay was validated over the ethanol concentration range of 20.0&#x02013;1000&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/mL in human potassium oxalate/sodium fluoride plasma. Quality controls for run acceptance were prepared and analyzed with each batch of samples against separately prepared calibration standards to assess the day-to-day performance of the assay. For the analysis to be acceptable, no more than one-third of the quality control results were to deviate from the nominal concentration by more than 15%, with at least one quality control result acceptable at each concentration.</p><p>Plasma GSK1521498 concentrations were determined by Aptuit. GSK1521498 was extracted from human plasma by protein precipitation using acetonitrile containing [13C6]-GSK1521498 as an internal standard. Extracts were analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS using a TurboIonspray&#x02122; interface with positive ion multiple reaction monitoring. This method was validated according to departmental standard operating procedures (SOPs) over the range 0.1&#x02013;100&#x02009;ng/mL and the lower limit of quantification (LLQ) was 0.1&#x02009;ng/mL using a 50-L aliquot of human plasma. Calibration data were deemed acceptable if the back-calculated concentration did not deviate from the actual by more than 15% (20% at LLQ) and if no more than 25% of the calibration standards were rejected or lost for any other reason. A calibration standard was omitted from the regression if the back-calculated concentration deviated from actual by more than 15% (20% at LLQ). Individual QC results were deemed acceptable if the calculated concentration deviated by no more than 15% from the actual concentration. The analytical run was approved if no more than one-third of the QC results exceeded the acceptable limit and at least 50% of the results at each concentration were within the acceptable limit.</p><p>PK parameters were determined from the plasma concentration-time data for GSK1521498 and ethanol. PK analysis of plasma GSK1521498 and ethanol concentration-time data were conducted using non-compartmental Model 200 (for extravascular administration) in WinNonlin version 5.2 (Pharsight Corporation, Mountain View, CA). Actual elapsed time from dosing was used to estimate all individual plasma PK parameters for evaluable subjects. The following PK parameters were estimated:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>The maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>), the first time to reach C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>), and absorption lag time (t<sub>lag</sub>) were the actual observed values.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The terminal plasma elimination rate-constant (&#x003bb;z) was estimated from log-linear regression analysis of the terminal phase of the plasma concentration-time profile. The number of points included in the terminal phase were selected by WinNonlin, and then confirmed and changed, if necessary, by visual inspection of semi-log plots of the plasma concentration-time profiles. At least three data points in the terminal elimination phase were used for each participant for the estimation of &#x003bb;z. The associated apparent terminal elimination half-life (t&#x000bd;) was calculated as t&#x000bd;&#x02009;=&#x02009;ln2/&#x003bb;z.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the last quantifiable time point (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;last)</sub>), from time 0 to 12&#x02009;h (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;12)</sub>), and from time 0 to 24&#x02009;h (AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub>) were calculated by a combination of linear (for increasing concentrations) and logarithmic (for decreasing concentrations) trapezoidal methods.

GSK1521498 plus ethanol was considered the test treatment. For the first analysis assessing the interaction of ethanol on GSK1521498 PK, GSK152498 alone was considered the reference treatment. For the second analysis assessing the interaction of GSK1521498 on ethanol PK, ethanol alone was considered the reference treatment. For both analyses point estimates and associated 90% CIs were constructed for the difference between the test and reference treatments. These were back-transformed to obtain point estimates and 90% CIs for the ratios of test to reference treatments and the magnitude of the interaction effects of ethanol and GSK1521498 on each other.

Eighteen (64%) were male and 23 (82%) were Caucasian (see Table S1). Twenty-two completed all study periods. Two subjects withdrew consent before completing the study, and four subjects were withdrawn (see below). All 28 subjects were included in the safety and tolerability analyses and 25 who had at least one PK sample were included in the PK analysis.</p><sec><title>Safety and Tolerability</title><sec><title>Adverse events</title><p>GSK1521498 20&#x02009;mg was well tolerated when given alone and in combination with ethanol (see Tables<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">1</xref> and S3). The most frequently reported AEs that were judged to be possibly drug-related were nausea, dizziness, fatigue headache, and abnormalities of tandem walking. A lower incidence of AEs was reported with GSK151498 20&#x02009;mg alone (22%) compared to GSK1521498 plus ethanol (30%) and placebo plus ethanol (44%). Nausea was the most frequent AE (4&#x02013;25%) across treatment groups. Gastrointestinal AEs (nausea and vomiting) appeared slightly higher following GSK1521498 administration (either alone or with ethanol) than with placebo or ethanol alone. Gait and coordination disturbances were reported after ethanol; the incidence was similar when administered with placebo (4&#x02013;8%) or GSK1521498 (4&#x02013;9%). All AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Co-administration did not appear to have a major effect on tolerability compared with each agent alone. No SAEs were reported during the study. Two subjects were withdrawn after the third treatment period owing to AEs. One developed headache and wheezing (but no other features of hypersensitivity) after GSK1521498. The other developed premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) prior to receiving any treatment.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Summary of On-Therapy

antagonist and a potential new treatment for alcohol and other addictions. In previous trials in human, it has demonstrated a good safety and tolerability profile.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In this study, we investigated its safety, tolerability, PD, and PK when administered with ethanol. The selected dose of 20&#x02009;mg is a clinically relevant one as it associated with an exposure following a single dose that is equivalent to 10&#x02009;mg at steady-state dosing and is predicted to achieve greater than 90% receptor occupancy.<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>GSK1521498 was well tolerated at this dose when administered on its own and in combination with ethanol. Adverse effects were mild or moderate in severity with nausea being the most common (up to 13% of subjects). Fewer adverse effects were reported with GSK1521498 alone (4&#x02013;9%) than with the combination (4&#x02013;13%) or with ethanol alone (4&#x02013;16%). Co-administration of GSK1521498 with ethanol did not appear to substantially affect its tolerability. GSK1521498 was not associated with abnormalities of laboratory tests; vital signs or ECG measures either alone or in combination with ethanol. Minor effects were seen on neurological assessments with ethanol, which were not unexpected, and these were not affected by GSK1521498. In terms of behavioral effects, GSK1521498 produced statistically significant but mild transient effects on the VAS alertness and contentedness subscales and the POMS-B total mood score. These effects were enhanced when GSK1521498 was co-administered with ethanol. However, the effects were small and not clinically significant and consistent with findings in previous studies with this agent<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and these effects disappear early in treatment.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> There were no changes seen on any of the self-report measures of mood&#x02014;BDI-II, BAI, or HADS. As ethanol is known to slow reaction times and a similar effect has been seen with initial administration of GSK1521498,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> a particular concern was a possible additive effect of both agents on this measure. However, while we found that ethanol did indeed affect reaction time on the PoA tasks, GSK1521498 did not and any effects of the combination were driven by the effects of ethanol.</p><p>On the exploratory PD measures that were used to examine effects on hedonic and consummatory aspects of alcohol consumption we did not find any effect of GSK1521498 either alone or in combination with ethanol. The effects of ethanol were not always as expected, for example, consumption of orange juice with ethanol was slower than orange juice alone and ethanol decreased the hedonic preference for alcohol. This may relate to the formulation of ethanol used (Everclear) which was a preparation specifically chosen for standardization of dosing and very likely different from most subjects' personally preferred alcoholic beverage. On the measure of attentional bias to alcohol-related stimuli, neither ethanol nor GSK1521498, alone or in combination affected the attentional bias to alcohol-related stimuli. These results require a cautious interpretation given the ethanol formulation used, the single dosing regimen of GSK1521498 and the study population (healthy social drinkers) for whom the motivational properties of alcohol cues may have been low. In relation to the last point, it should be noted that the effects of GSK1521498 on attentional bias to food-related stimuli were seen in obese binge eaters for whom the food cues had higher motivational value.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></p><p>The PK parameters of GSK1521498 in this study were in keeping with those from previous studies with this drug<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and there was no evidence of a PK interaction with ethanol (or vice versa).</p><p>The PGx analyses were limited by the small sample size (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) of Caucasian subjects with only three G-carriers with available phenotype data. Interestingly, G-carriers showed enhanced sedative response to ethanol and GSK152498. While these results are very preliminary and not seen on related measures of sedation, they suggest that PGx considerations are very important in the future development of this drug. This is particularly relevant for targeted treatment and dose optimization; especially given the data suggesting that the A118G polymorphism may mediate the effects of alcohol,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> risk of dependence,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> treatment effects of naltrexone,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and the preliminary weight effects seen in the recent phase 2 trial of GSK1521498 in obese binge eaters.<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>In summary, GSK1521498 was generally well tolerated and had a good safety profile at the dose of 20&#x02009;mg. There was no evidence of a PK or unexpected PD effect of GSK1521498 administered alone or in combination with ethanol 0.5&#x02009;g/kg. There were transient effects on alertness and mood that were greater when combined with ethanol. While it is not possible to definitively rule out a small PD interaction but if present, this study indicates that it is small. Overall these findings are encouraging for the further progression of the drug for the treatment of alcohol addiction.</p></sec><sec><title>Declaration of Conflicting Interests</title><p>The following authors are employed by and hold shares in GSK: D.W., K.S., L.H., L.W., S.M., C.D., K.
