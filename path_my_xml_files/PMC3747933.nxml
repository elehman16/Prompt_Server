Nonnutritive sweeteners (NNS) are food additives that provide a sweet taste to food but have few, if any, calories. Therefore, the use of NNS has become a popular approach to help reduce energy intake and glycemic load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Currently, seven NNS (sucralose, saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame potassium, neotame, stevia, and Luo han guo extract) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and are widely used in thousands of food products.</p><p>Although it has been proposed that NNS do not affect glycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), data from several recent studies suggest that NNS are not physiologically inert. First, it has been demonstrated that the gastrointestinal tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) can detect sugars through taste receptors and transduction mechanisms that are similar to those indentified in taste cells in the mouth. Second, NNS-induced activation of gut sweet taste receptors in isolated duodenal L cells and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells triggers the secretion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), respectively. Third, data from studies conducted in animal models demonstrate that NNS interact with sweet taste receptors expressed in enteroendocrine cells to increase both active and passive intestinal glucose absorption by upregulating the expression of sodium-dependent glucose transporter isoform 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and increasing the translocation of GLUT2 to the apical membrane of intestinal epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>The relevance of the findings from studies conducted in cell systems and rodent models to human physiology is not clear because the NNS data obtained from studies conducted in people often fail to replicate the metabolic outcomes observed in vitro and in animal models (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The results from most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), but not all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), studies conducted in people have found that NNS do not affect plasma glucose, insulin, or GLP-1. However, these studies did not exclude people who regularly consumed NNS, which could have chronic effects on glucose metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) that would blunt any acute effects of sucralose intake.</p><p>The primary purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that sucralose ingestion alters the glycemic and hormonal responses to glucose ingestion in obese subjects who are not regular users of NNS. We specifically studied obese people because NNS are often promoted to help decrease calorie intake and facilitate weight management in this population.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Seventeen obese subjects (BMI 41.0 &#x000b1; 1.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, age 35.1 &#x000b1; 1.0 years, 15 female and 2 male, 13 African American and 4 Caucasian), who were not markedly insulin resistant based on homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score &#x02264;2.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), participated in the study. Potential subjects were interviewed with a questionnaire used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>) that inquired about <italic>1</italic>) the type of sweetener used for coffee, tea, and other drinks; <italic>2</italic>) current intake of diet beverages (including soda, juice, ice tea, and flavor water), <italic>3</italic>) current intake of yogurt, pudding, gelatin, or other snacks foods sweetened with NNS; and <italic>3</italic>) current use of gums containing NNS. For each type of product, potential participants were asked whether they had used it in the past month and, if so, on how many days per week and how many servings per day. Subjects who reported consuming more than one can of diet beverage or one spoonful of NNS a week (or its equivalent from foods) were excluded. In addition, those who smoked cigarettes in the last six months; were pregnant or breastfeeding; had a history of malabsorptive syndromes, bariatric surgery, or inflammatory intestinal disease; or were taking any medication that might affect glucose metabolism were excluded. This study was approved by the institutional review board at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and each subject gave informed written consent before participation.</p><p>Subjects were studied on two separate occasions, &#x0223c;7 days apart, in a crossover design. For each study, subjects were admitted in the morning to the Clinical Research Unit at Washington University School of Medicine at 0700 h after subjects fasted overnight (12 h) at home. A catheter was placed in a hand vein and heated in a warming box (55&#x000b0;C) to obtain arterialized venous samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Blood samples were obtained to assess plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and active GLP-1 concentrations at 20, 15, 10, 6, and 2 min before and at 10, 20, 30, 40, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 240, and 300 min after ingesting 75 g glucose. In randomized order, subjects drank 60 mL of 2 mmol/L sucralose (i.e., 48 mg sucralose) or an equivalent volume of distilled water 10 min before glucose ingestion. This concentration of sucralose was used because it is the effective concentration needed to stimulate GLP-1 secretion in human intestinal cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and it matches the sweetness of a typical diet soda; i.e., it approximates the amount of sucralose in a standard 12-oz can of diet soda if it is all sweetened with sucralose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Laboratory assessments</title><sec id="s3"><title>Biochemical measurements.</title><p>Plasma glucose was measured immediately after collection by using an automated glucose analyzer (YSI 2300 STAT plus; Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Spring, OH).

Plasma active GLP-1 and GIP were measured by using commercially available immunoassay kits from Meso Scale Discovery (Gaithersburg, MD) and Millipore, respectively. Plasma C-peptide was measured by using a solid-phase two-site chemiluminescent immunometric assay (Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics, Los Angeles, CA), plasma insulin concentrations were determined by using a two-site immunoenzymatic assay (DxI 800; Beckman Instruments, Chaska, MN), and plasma glucagon was measured by a direct, double-antibody radioimmunoassay (Millipore).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Calculations</title><sec id="s5"><title>Metabolic response to glucose ingestion.</title><p>The incremental areas under the curve (AUCs) above baseline concentrations for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, GIP, and GLP-1 were calculated by using the trapezoid method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Insulin sensitivity and clearance.</title><p>The insulin sensitivity index [S<sub>I</sub>: dL &#x022c5; kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x022c5; min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>/(pmol/L)] was determined from a minimal model of the glucose concentration as a function of the insulin concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).

This model provides an estimate of the total amount of insulin secreted in response to plasma glucose as a function of time (i.e., total ISR in pmol/min) and partitions this total response into a dynamic component (ISR<sub>dynamic</sub>), which represents the rapid release of a readily releasable pool of insulin secretory granules in response to the rate of increasing plasma glucose concentration, and a static component (ISR<sub>static</sub>), which represents the slower release of a reserve pool of insulin secretory granules in response to the ambient plasma glucose concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28)</xref>.

The peak increase plasma glucose, C-peptide, and insulin concentrations and total insulin AUC after an oral glucose load were greater when subjects consumed sucralose than when they consumed water before glucose ingestion. In addition, insulin clearance from plasma was slower after sucralose than after water ingestion. These data suggest that sucralose ingestion is not physiologically inert but affects the glycemic response to an oral glucose load and potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in obese people.</p><p>The finding that glucose-induced glucagon suppression was the same after both sucralose and water ingestion makes it unlikely that glucagon was responsible for the differences between conditions. The mechanisms responsible for the sucralose effect on plasma glucose after an oral glucose load are not clear but must involve an alteration in the rate of glucose absorption, disposal, or endogenous production. Data from previous studies conducted in animal models showed that sucralose augments glucose absorption by increasing intestinal glucose transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Our results support this notion because sucralose increased the early peak in plasma glucose but did not affect the indices of &#x003b2;-cell sensitivity (&#x003a6;<sub>total</sub>, &#x003a6;<sub>dynamic</sub>, and &#x003a6;<sub>static</sub>) to plasma glucose.</p><p>We found that S<sub>I</sub> decreased after sucralose ingestion, suggesting that sucralose caused insulin resistance. However, the minimal model used to calculate S<sub>I</sub> from a modified OGTT is unable to determine whether the decrease in S<sub>I</sub> was caused by insulin resistance in a specific organ (e.g., liver or skeletal muscle) or multiple organs. Additional studies that involve the use of glucose tracers to quantify the effect of sucralose on insulin-mediated suppression of endogenous glucose production and insulin-stimulated muscle glucose uptake are needed to further explore our findings.</p><p>Sucralose ingestion did not affect the GLP-1 response to a glucose load in our subjects, which is consistent with the data reported in previous studies conducted in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). This finding suggests that the observed increase in the ISR observed in our subjects was mediated by a GLP-1&#x02013;independent mechanism. There was a trend suggesting that GIP contributed to the potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and a confirmatory study is needed. In contrast, the data from previous studies found that the oral ingestion of a NNS before a glucose load augmented GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) but did not affect GIP secretion. However, in those studies total GLP-1&#x02014;not the biologically active form of GLP-1&#x02014;was measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Although it is possible that the discrepancy between GLP-1 findings of those and our study is the result of this methodological difference, we think it is unlikely because active and total GLP-1 are highly correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). A second methodological difference is that in those studies a diet cola sweetened with both sucralose and acesulfame potassium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) was used, so it is unclear whether the enhanced glucose-stimulated GLP-1 response was mediated by acesulfame potassium, a synergistic effect of both sweeteners, or other ingredients contained in the carbonated drinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Additional studies that examine the metabolic effects of different NNS and potential interactions with other dietary ingredients are needed.</p><p>We found a modest reduction in insulin clearance after sucralose was ingested. This finding suggests that intestinal sweet taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), which are activated by NNS, are involved in regulating insulin metabolism. This observation also raises the possibility that sweet taste receptors contribute to the unexplained reduction in insulin clearance observed after an oral, but not intravenous, glucose load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>A series of studies conducted in human subjects have reported that sucralose does not affect the glycemic or hormonal responses to intraduodenal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) or oral administration of glucose or other carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) (rev. in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The reason(s) for the discrepancy between findings may be related to study subject selection. To increase sample homogeneity, we only included subjects who were obese, were insulin sensitive based on a homeostasis model assessment score &#x02264;2.6, and were not regular users of NNS. By decreasing variability, it is likely that our study had a greater statistical power than previous studies to detect a sucralose effect. In addition, most subjects in previous studies were Caucasian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), whereas most subjects in our study were African American. We believe this study is the first to evaluate the acute effects of sucralose in subjects who are not regular users of NNS. Data from studies conducted in animal models have shown that chronic inclusion of NNS in the diet upregulates the expression of sodium-dependent glucose transporter isoform 1, which in turn increases the initial rate of Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and increases glycemic responses after an oral glucose tolerance test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that regular users of NNS would have a higher glycemic response after an oral glucose tolerance test on the control day than irregular users and that the acute effects of sucralose intake would be blunted because differences between water and sucralose conditions would be smaller in regular than in irregular users of NNS.</p><p>In conclusion, the results from our study demonstrate that sucralose affects the glycemic and hormonal responses to an oral glucose load in obese people who do not normally consume NNS. These findings support the notion that sucralose is not metabolically inert but has physiologic effects.
