It derives its name from the ubiquitous presence in nature and quinone structure, which is similar to that of vitamin K.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] It is a fat-soluble compound which forms an important link in the electron transport system of mitochondria.</p><p>It is known to play a crucial role in the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and cellular respiration. It exists in two molecular forms, ubiquinone, the oxidized form, and ubiquinole, the reduced form, which are the basis for its antioxidant properties. Hence, Co-Q10 also functions as an intercellular antioxidant.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>True deficiency states are rare but often present with severe health consequences. Numerous disease processes which are linked to low levels of Co-Q10 can benefit from Co-Q10 supplementation including cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's disease, muscular dystrophy, breast and other cancers, diabetes mellitus, male infertility, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), asthma, thyroid disorders, and periodontal disease.</p><p>Co-Q10 has been the topic of research interest since 1970s, which experienced a series of trails depicting its anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and immune modulatory activities. But there is scarcity of literature regarding the anti gingivitis effects of Co-Q10. Hence, the present study was designed with the aim to evaluate anti-gingivitis effect of Coenzyme Q-10 on plaque induced gingivitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients (16 female and 14 male) were recruited from the Outpatient Department of Periodontics and Implantology; Institute of Dental Sciences, Bareilly, after obtaining ethical clearance from the ethical committee. Systemically, healthy individuals with a minimum of 20 teeth present were enrolled in the study. The enrolled subjects had bleeding index (Mullerman and son), Plaque index (Silness and loe), and gingival index (loe and silness) scores of more than 2.0. Pregnant or lactating women, subjects with any systemic disease, and those who were using anti inflammatory drugs or antibiotics for the past six months were excluded from the clinical trial. Patients were informed about the study and written consent was obtained.</p><p>Coenzyme Q &#x02013; 10 preparation<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn1">*</xref> [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>f] which was utilized had an active ingredient of 20% Co-Q10 Cyclodextrin Complex (Hydro &#x02013; Q &#x02013; Sorb). The split mouth study design was randomized with four treatment options. Option A: scaling only; Option B: Co&#x02013;Q10 along with scaling; Option C: Co&#x02013;Q10 application only; Option D: no treatment. Subjects were given a demonstration for the topical application of Co&#x02013;Q10, and were then instructed for night application with a cotton roll stick. Eating, spitting, and drinking were restricted for 45 min, after application. Subjects were followed for a period of 28 days. Plaque, gingival and bleeding index was recorded at 0, 7<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, 21<sup>st</sup>, and 28<sup>th</sup> day.

Our study has shown significant decrease in plaque, bleeding, and gingival scores, which is consistent with the earlier studies done by Wilkinson <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] and Mcree <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Similarly, a split mouth trail conducted by Hanioka demonstrated improved periodontal scores along with gingival scores when Co-Q10 was applied alone or as an adjunct to scaling and root planing .[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] Clinical trials on human have revealed a relation between oral administration of Co-Q10 and improved gingival health and immune response. Our study showed similar results when Co-Q10 was solitary used or when used as an adjunct to scaling and root planing , although the present study was restricted only to plaque induced gingivitis and bleeding. The slight reduction or persistence of gingival inflammation of the teeth adjacent to the various treatment options could be credited to the carry cross effect of split mouth design. A study was conducted by Figuero (2006) to evaluate potential oxidant/antioxidant interactions of nicotine with antioxidant Coenzyme Q10 in subjects with periodontitis suggesting that the catabolic effects of nicotine could be reversed by the addition of antioxidants such as CoQ10.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>In a clinical trial of Co-Q10, systemic administration on patients of AIDS related complex, T4/T8 ratio was increased, and they were symptom free for duration of four years. Also when Co- Q10 was given to healthy individuals, a significant increase in T4/T8 ratio was observed.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The improved clinical parameters in our study could also possibly be credited by improvement in immunity in combating periodontal insult.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present study shows promising results with the application of Coenzyme-Q10 solitary used and also as an adjunct to scaling and root planing for the treatment of plaque induced gingivitis; thus, opening new treatment options by strengthening the host side of the disease interaction. Further, long term trials are desired to comment on the application of Co-Q10 in periodontal diseases, in routine supportive periodontal therapy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Special thanks to Dr. Subhash Gupta, Pennsylvania (U.S.A), for providing the sample of Coenzyme-Q10.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>Shows the clinical product avaliable</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ernster</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Dallner</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Biochemical, physiological and medical aspects of ubiquinone function</article-title><source>Biochim Biophys Acta</source><year>1995</year><volume>1271</volume><fpage>195</fpage><lpage>204</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7599208</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Littarru</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Ho</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Folkers</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuzell</surname><given-names>WC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Deficiency of coenzyme Q10 in gingival tissue from patients with periodontal disease</article-title><source>Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A</source><year>1971</year><volume>68</volume><fpage>2332</fpage><lpage>5</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">5289867</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Littarru</surname><given-names>GP</given-names></name><name><surname>Folkers</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Study of CoQ1o-Enzymes in Gingiva from Patients with Periodontal Disease and Evidence for a Deficiency of Coenzyme Q10</article-title><source>Proc Natl Acad Sci</source><year>1974</year><volume>71</volume><fpage>1456</fpage><lpage>60</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4151519</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Matsumura</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Saji</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Folkers</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Evidence for enhanced treatment of periodontal disease by therapy with coenzyme Q</article-title><source>Int J Vitam Nutr Res</source><year>1973</year><volume>43</volume><fpage>537</fpage><lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">4588762</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schmelzer</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Lindner</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Rimbach</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Niklowitz</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Menke</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>D&#x000f6;ring</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functions of coenzyme Q 10 in inflammation and gene expression</article-title><source>Biofactors</source><year>2008</year><volume>32</volume><fpage>179</fpage><lpage>83</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19096114</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wilkinson</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Folkers</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>&#x0201c;Bioenergetics in clinical medicine.
