In this phase IIb clinical trial, 258 patients with type 2 diabetes completed a 12-week protocol with 50, 100, or 150&#x02009;mg of MSDC-0160 (an mTOT modulator), 45&#x02009;mg pioglitazone HCl (a PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist), or a placebo. The two active treatments lowered fasting glucose levels to the same extent. The decreases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) observed with the two higher doses of MSDC-0160 were not different from those associated with pioglitazone. By contrast, fluid retention as evidenced by reduction in hematocrit, red blood cells, and total hemoglobin was 50% less in the MSDC-0160&#x02013;treated groups. There was also a smaller increase in high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin with MSDC-0160 than with pioglitazone (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), suggesting that MSDC-0160 produces less expansion of white adipose tissue. Thus, mTOT modulators may have glucose-lowering effects similar to those of pioglitazone but without the adverse effects associated with PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Diabetes remains undertreated throughout the developed and developing worlds, and its incidence continues to grow, contributing significantly to rising health-care costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> It is generally accepted that reducing insulin resistance, and thereby increasing insulin sensitivity, would be an ideal way to treat this disease, given that insulin resistance is a key factor in the early pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> However, only three insulin sensitizers have ever been approved for clinical use, and two of these have been removed from the market or have had their clinical use severely restricted because of various safety concerns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> The third one, pioglitazone, although clearly different from the others, has seen its clinical use curtailed because of its side effects, which include weight gain and volume expansion, and concerns about congestive heart failure and bladder cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> We have suggested that this field has been held back because of the singular focus on the hypothesis that insulin sensitizers must activate peroxisome proliferator&#x02013;activated receptor-&#x003b3; (PPAR-&#x003b3;).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> Recently, we showed that insulin sensitivity can be achieved through PPAR-&#x003b3;-independent mechanisms<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> and provided evidence that such PPAR-independent effects may involve control of oxidative metabolism through modulation of a mitochondrial target that regulates metabolism of pyruvate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Compounds that work primarily through this mechanism, mitochondrial target of thiazolidinediones (mTOT), should be able to produce insulin-sensitizing pharmacology without the side effects associated with agents that are PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists.</p><p>The prototype mTOT modulator we have examined is MSDC-0160 (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></bold>).

No safety issues of concern were uncovered in this trial. The primary efficacy evaluation was the change in fasting plasma glucose level from baseline to end point, relative to the placebo group (<bold>Supplementary Table S3 online</bold>). There was a significant reduction in plasma glucose levels in the MSDC-0160 100-mg group (least-squares mean difference of &#x02212;18.4&#x02009;mg/dl; <italic>P</italic> = 0.0057), the MSDC-0160 150-mg group (least-squares mean difference of &#x02212;28.9&#x02009;mg/dl; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), and the pioglitazone group (least-squares mean difference of &#x02212;31&#x02009;mg/dl; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). The data from this study were then used to compare the relative effects of the active treatments in the patients who completed the 12-week study per protocol.</p><p>The characteristics of patients completing the 12-week trial per protocol are shown in <bold><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref></bold>. There were no differences in the baseline parameters across the five treatment groups. Approximately 80% of the patients were on stable metformin treatment and remained on it throughout the trial. The rest of the patients (~20%) were not receiving antidiabetes medications. The trial population had an average starting glycated hemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) of ~8%, average fasting plasma glucose of ~170&#x02009;mg/dl, and average time since diagnosis of ~6 years. Both genders were represented, and the average age of the cohort was ~55 years.</p><p><bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold> shows the time course of change in HbA<sub>1c</sub> over the duration of the trial. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref></bold> shows the time course of the average HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels during the double-blind treatment in the five groups of patients, and <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref></bold> shows the placebo-adjusted end point (least-squares mean change from baseline with SE bars) for the active groups at 12 weeks. As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref></bold>, patients in the placebo group demonstrated a progressive worsening of glucose control despite the fact that 79% of them were continuing their current regimens of metformin treatment. There was an improvement in glucose control in all the active treatment groups relative to the placebo group. Treatment with the two highest doses of MSDC-0160 produced reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> that were not different from those obtained with 45&#x02009;mg pioglitazone HCl (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref></bold>).</p><p>Although MSDC-0160 produced reductions in the levels of circulating glucose similar to those produced by pioglitazone, no dose level of MSDC-0160 was able to produce a decrease in the concentration of total hemoglobin (an index of volume dilution) similar to those produced by pioglitazone (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold>). The time course of the pioglitazone-induced reduction in total circulating hemoglobin is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref></bold>, and the relative effects of the treatments on placebo-adjusted changes at the 12-week end point are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref></bold>. The data show that at no point was MSDC-0160 able to produce the same reduction in total hemoglobin that pioglitazone did. As expected, these data mirror the changes in total red blood cells and hematocrit in the corresponding samples (<bold>Supplementary Figure S2</bold> online). The presence of edema was systematically evaluated during the course of the study, using a scale of 0 to 4+. Edema was noted in 11.4% of the patients in the placebo group; in 11.8, 13.0, and 5.7% of the MSDC-0160 50-, 100-, and 150-mg groups; respectively; and in 8.5% of the pioglitazone group. The edema was mostly rated as mild (1 or 2); however, in two patients receiving MSDC-0160 and one receiving pioglitazone the edema was rated as 3, and in another patient receiving MSDC-0160 it was rated as 4 (<bold>Supplementary Table S4</bold> online). Peripheral edema was reported as an adverse event in three subjects: one in the MSDC-0160 100-mg group and two in the MSDC-0160 150-mg group. All the cases were mild and resolved while on treatment with no specific action taken. All three subjects completed the 12-week study.</p><p>There were also differences between the effects of MSDC-0160 and pioglitazone with respect to changes in high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold>). The time courses of the effects of each of the five treatments on the change from baseline in HMW adiponectin at 2 and 12 weeks are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref></bold>. The indexes of volume expansion show clear differences between the increases in this parameter caused by MSDC-0160 and those caused by pioglitazone. The statistical evaluation of these changes at the 12-week end point is shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref></bold>. Although MSDC-0160 treatment caused significant increases in HMW adiponectin, no dose of this compound was able to produce the same magnitude of increase as that with pioglitazone treatment. Importantly, these differences between treatment effects occurred under conditions in which glucose was being lowered to the same extent in the two experimental groups.</p><p>The effects on total body weight are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref></bold>,<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">b</xref></bold>. The placebo-treated group tended to lose body weight over the 12-week duration of the study, whereas all the treatment groups tended to show increases in body weight. The statistics for the changes in body weight at the 12-week treatment end point are shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref></bold>. Although the increases in body weight in the MSDC-0160 treatment groups tended to be smaller than those in the pioglitazone treatment group, there was no significant difference between the 150-mg MSDC-0160 group and the pioglitazone reference group with respect to this parameter. However, given the differences in the levels of white adipose marker adiponectin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold>), the weight gain associated with the treatments may not be identical in nature. In support of this hypothesis, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref></bold>,<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">d</xref></bold> shows that the trend toward increase in waist circumference seen in the pioglitazone comparator group is absent in the MSDC-0160-treated groups.</p><p>Pioglitazone is known to have positive effects on cholesterol metabolism, which might partly explain its positive impact on cardiovascular outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Although there are clear differences in this respect between the PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists approved for clinical use,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup> it is possible that some aspect of PPAR-&#x003b3; agonism might contribute to this action, and that compounds designed for less interaction with PPAR-&#x003b3; might not share this action. Hence, we performed an analysis of the changes in lipoprotein particles during the treatment protocol across the various groups to determine where a compound without significant activation of PPAR-&#x003b3; might share the positive effects of pioglitazone in this respect. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref></bold> shows the differences in size distribution in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol subfractions (small, medium, and large) at the 12-week end-point time relative to pretreatment. In comparison to placebo, treatment with either compound tended to reduce the number of the small particles and shift toward a distribution of larger particles. A similar change occurred in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref></bold>). This resulted in an increase in the average sizes of both high-density lipoprotein and LDL particles (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref></bold>). In contrast to their effects on high-density lipoprotein, the treatments reduced the sizes of the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) subfractions (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref></bold>). In general, the effects of MSDC-0160 were similar to those of pioglitazone, except that the magnitude of the changes in LDL and VLDL were smaller. This is consistent with the finding that treatment with pioglitazone produces a significant decrease in circulating triglycerides, an effect that did not occur with MSDC-0160 treatment (<bold>Supplementary Figure S3</bold> online).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrates that MSDC-0160, a prototype mTOT modulator with little ability to bind to or activate PPAR-&#x003b3;, is able to lower glucose to the same extent as the PPAR-&#x003b3; agonist pioglitazone over 12 weeks of treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes. Importantly, at the exposure levels required for lowering glucose to this extent, there was a markedly lower effect of volume dilution as detected by a reduction in circulating total hemoglobin and blood cells (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold> as compared with <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref></bold>). However, little edema was seen in any of the groups, and the potential for differences vs. pioglitazone in this respect requires investigation in larger trials of longer duration.</p><p>Also, a comparison of these treatment groups shows that the ability to lower glucose can be decoupled from the extent of elevation of HMW adiponectin (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref></bold> as compared with <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref></bold>). This is important, given that it is often believed that an increase in white adipose tissue is a necessary sign to show that an insulin sensitizer is exerting appropriate effects by moving lipids out of the peripheral tissues and into white adipose tissue. The hypothesis generally posited for insulin-sensitizing pharmacology predicts that at least some of the PPAR-&#x003b3;-driven side effects would have to occur, especially the expansion of white adipose tissue, in order to increase insulin sensitivity. The current results, however, argue to the contrary and support the need for continued evaluation of molecules designed in line with the newer hypothesis, i.e., that the mitochondrial metabolic modulation should be maintained at the expense of activation of PPAR-&#x003b3;.</p><p>We recently identified the mitochondrial target of insulin sensitizers as a well-conserved, but previously unrecognized, protein complex (mTOT) in the inner mitochondrial membrane, both in islets and in peripheral tissues.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Key proteins in this complex form a recognition site for entry of pyruvate into the mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> This regulatory machinery is therefore at the crossroads of the control of oxidative metabolism.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> Although the need for further elucidation remains, it is not difficult to imagine how metabolic redox signals&#x02014;regulated by the change in the way pyruvate is handled by the mitochondria&#x02014;coordinate cellular responses that regulate many cellular functions from cell cycle/differentiation to insulin sensitivity. This study is important because the clinical results show that compounds that focus on this mechanism of action, mTOT modulation, are able to achieve significant lowering of glucose without the liabilities&#x02014;side effects&#x02014;associated with PPAR-&#x003b3; agonists. Consequently, modulation of mTOT might provide a way forward to treat type 2 diabetes.</p><p>Henry <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> recently reviewed the current understanding of insulin sensitization. There is now consensus that the first three insulin sensitizers that were approved and gained market experience were not identical. Pioglitazone (the only one of the three that remains on the market) clearly proved to have advantages in the long run, yet the side effects and concerns related to PPAR-&#x003b3; agonism have limited its use. It had previously been suggested that it may be reasonable to explore other ways to increase insulin sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref></sup> The current observations support the need for further exploration of the potential of mTOT-modulating molecules. This study suggests that mTOT modulators will share the useful pharmacology of pioglitazone, including positive effects on lipoprotein metabolism (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></bold>) that are thought to be important in its protective effects on cardiovascular outcomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p><p>Our 12-week study demonstrates that mTOT modulation can deliver comparable efficacy without the liabilities of PPAR-&#x003b3; agonism that are typically observed in studies of this duration. Longer-term studies are needed to further define the potential of this new approach to treating insulin resistance and to determine whether there will be significant benefits to the use of this compound or other mTOT-modulating molecules in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Preliminary studies.</bold> Phase I and bioequivalence trials (MSDC-C001, MSDC-C002, and MSDC-005) to establish dosing were conducted in normal volunteers at the Jasper Clinic (Kalamazoo, MI) after approval by the local institutional review board.
