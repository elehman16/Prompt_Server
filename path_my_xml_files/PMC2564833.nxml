The endoscope was advanced in the WLE mode and caecal intubation was confirmed by identification of the appendiceal orifice and ileocaecal valve. No biopsies were taken during insertion of the endoscope. All procedures were performed by three experienced colonoscopists (&#x0003e;2500 colonoscopies).</p><p>Upon reaching the caecum, the level of bowel preparation was determined: good (100% visible mucosa), moderate (90&#x02013;100%) or poor (&#x0003c;90%). On introduction of the endoscope efforts were made to optimally clean the bowel by rinsing and suctioning. Poor bowel preparation was an exclusion criterion, as well as endoscopically active disease in at least one colonic segment.</p><p>During withdrawal of the colonoscope, each colonic segment was inspected twice: once with AFI and once with WLE. The hepatic and splenic flexures separated the colonic segments; in case of indistinct flexures a biopsy was taken for reference during the second inspection. Patients were randomly allocated for inspection with AFI or WLE first in all segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gut-57-08-1083-f02">fig 2</xref>). One hundred opaque sealed envelopes contained notes with &#x0201c;AFI&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;WLE&#x0201d; written on them (1:1) for randomisation. At the moment of caecal intubation, a research fellow opened a randomly chosen envelope for allocation. The endoscopists were instructed to have equal inspection times for AFI and WLE. In a random sample of 10 patients inspection times were measured for both AFI and WLE, strictly excluding time for rinsing, taking pictures and taking biopsies. Suspicious lesions detected during the first inspection were sampled immediately after detection. During the second inspection, only additionally detected suspicious lesions were sampled. Finally, four quadrant random biopsies were taken every 10 cm of colon. For each lesion, the detection technique (WLE or AFI), size (estimated by a biopsy forceps), Paris classification, and location (part of colon and distance from the anus) were noted.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> Furthermore, AFI colour (green, ambiguous or purple) was scored as well as the Kudo classification by NBI and magnification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref></p><fig id="gut-57-08-1083-f02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Study design and flow chart of patients who gave informed consent during the study.

We have demonstrated that ETMI is feasible for colonic use, provided that the colon is properly prepared and not actively inflamed. Insufficient bowel preparation and active inflammation interrupt tissue autofluorescence, resulting in discoloration on AFI and resembling neoplasia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> Active inflammation is an exclusion criterion for surveillance in any ulcerative colitis patient, since histopathological distinction between inflammation and neoplasia can be extremely difficult or even impossible in this situation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref> Disrupted autofluorescence due to residual faeces may explain why patients allocated to AFI inspection first were less often judged to have good colon preparation as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="gut-57-08-1083-t01">table 1</xref> (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.069). However, insufficient bowel preparation does not uniquely preclude scrutinising the colon during AFI, but this is true for WLE as well. When becoming accustomed to AFI during the study period, the percentage colon preparation judged as good increased from 22% to 75% (early <italic>v</italic> late procedures; p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.017) among patients allocated to AFI first.</p><p>The present study demonstrated a neoplasia miss-rate of 50% for WLE compared to a miss-rate of 0% for AFI (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.036). Although all missed neoplastic lesions were considered ALMs and have been treated by endoscopic mucosal resection, repeat colonoscopy within 1 year confirmed the presence of neoplasia in these patients. Debate still exists about whether ALMs should prompt colectomy or can safely be removed by endoscopic resection.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref> An important consideration is whether ALMs are located within or proximal to the extent of inflamed colon. All included patients had pancolitis and therefore hold a higher risk for cancer development, even if neoplasia was considered as an ALM. Since only intraepithelial neoplasias have been found in our study, the value of AFI for the detection of early invasive cancers could not be evaluated.</p><p>We found a high prevalence of neoplasia in our study population, probably caused by the tertiary referral function of our institution, selection of patients with pancolitis, and inclusion of patients with a history of neoplasia without colectomy. This high prevalence at our institution has been demonstrated before in a study comparing standard WLE and NBI, revealing a neoplasia miss-rate of 42% for WLE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> The even higher miss-rate for high resolution WLE in the present study suggests that AFI may correctly visualise a significant part of neoplasia, which remains invisible for WLE. Despite appropriate powering of the present study, however, the relatively small sample size prompts confirmation of these results in larger trials.</p><p>In a retrospective study, standard colonoscopy missed 39% of all neoplasia which was only detected by additional random biopsies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> The authors included neoplasia detected by random biopsies in the denominator for measuring sensitivity and no additional imaging techniques were used, as opposed to our study. The neoplasia miss-rate for high resolution WLE in our study was 50%, only missing lesions that were subsequently visualised by AFI. Random biopsies did not add neoplasia in any of these cases. Among patients examined with AFI first and WLE second, two random biopsies revealed neoplasia, which may be analysed as neoplasia missed by both AFI and WLE. When including positive random biopsies, the neoplasia miss-rate of AFI was 17% (2/12), which is still lower than current practice. Two remarks must be made concerning those random biopsies revealing &#x0201c;invisible&#x0201d; neoplasia. First, the positive biopsies were both derived from one patient in whom AFI already demonstrated three &#x0201c;visible&#x0201d; neoplastic lesions. Second, one out of two biopsies was taken in an AFI purple region and one was taken adjacent to a neoplasia visualised by AFI. The presence of neoplasia in biopsies taken adjacent to visible neoplasia merely reflects the nature of dysplasia associated lesions or masses instead of missed neoplasia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> Therefore, we conclude that random biopsies did not add relevant neoplasia.</p><p>The need for random biopsies in addition to the use of advanced imaging techniques has been questioned several times.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> Random biopsies have a low yield of neoplasia when used next to CE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> Also, in the present study the diagnostic yield of random biopsies was low, only finding neoplasia in 0.1% of biopsies. Random biopsies increase examination time and pathology costs, may distract the endoscopist from scrutinising the colon and have a risk of bleeding. The fact that all neoplasia in this study was coloured purple on AFI and that random biopsies did not detect neoplasia in additional patients, underlines the question whether these biopsies should be taken if AFI reveals a colon with the normal &#x0201c;green&#x0201d; appearance.</p><p>The high yield of neoplasia with AFI must be weighed against the results of CE in previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> In our experience, the use of AFI is easier and more convenient for both patients and endoscopists. Only pressing a button instead of applying dyes to the mucosa will provide enhanced imaging, thereby saving time. We experienced AFI to have a lower resolution compared to high-resolution WLE, although it served well as a red flag technique. The need for high resolution might be questioned in the circumstance where AFI correctly visualised all neoplasia by colouring purple. The results of the present study support the use of AFI, but the small sample size and expert setting prompt larger trials comparing AFI and CE in general practice to provide practical recommendations.</p><p>Although AFI has demonstrated a high rate of false positive findings in Barrett&#x02019;s oesophagus, the present study showed that there was no difference in false positive rate among AFI or WLE in ulcerative colitis surveillance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> As known from previous research, active inflammation colours purple during AFI.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> The present study demonstrated purple coloration of chronic inflammation as well, which was the main cause of false positive finding for AFI, whereas hyperplastic-like mucosal change (HPC) was the most notable false positive finding for WLE. These HPCs might be similar to the lesions described before in Crohn&#x02019;s disease, in which an association was shown between the prevalence of HPC and concomitant neoplasia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> We could not demonstrate a correlation between HPC and neoplasia in our study (results not shown), although prospective evaluation and molecular analysis of these lesions might be an interesting subject for future studies.</p><p>Confocal endomicroscopy has recently proven to be a good candidate to reduce false positive biopsies and to increase the effectiveness of surveillance, although this technique requires expensive equipment and special training.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> In the present study the Kudo classification with NBI had an unsatisfactory specificity and sensitivity of 81% and 75%, figures which are comparable to a recent report on pit pattern analysis with CE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> On the contrary, all neoplasias were coloured purple on AFI. Therefore, the sensitivity of NBI could be improved by adding the information about AFI colour in the rule for defining a positive test result. All AFI green lesions and all AFI ambiguous lesions with Kudo type I&#x02013;II on NBI revealed non-neoplastic histology, suggesting that those lesions can safely be left in situ. Prospective studies should validate this finding, which might lead to a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 77%.</p><p>Instead of Kudo pit pattern analysis with NBI, the vascular intensity pattern has also been used for differentiation of lesions in the non-inflamed colon.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref> In a recent study by East <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> the accuracy of the Kudo classification was comparable to the vascular intensity pattern in the non-inflamed colon. However, the value of vascular pattern analysis in patients with ulcerative colitis is still unknown.</p><p>In summary, ETMI appears a feasible option for colonoscopic surveillance of patients with ulcerative colitis, although additional studies are imperative. In the present trial AFI reduced the neoplasia miss-rate to 0% and made random biopsies superfluous. For the endoscopic classification of lesions, NBI had a sensitivity of only 75% but the additional information about colour obtained by AFI increased the sensitivity to 100%. Larger studies in a non-expert setting are needed to confirm these results, as well as comparative trials with chromoendoscopy and confocal endomicroscopy in order to demonstrate which technique performs better and is more convenient for the detection and classification of neoplasia.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The ETMI prototype endoscopy equipment was provided by Olympus, Tokyo, Japan.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> FJC van den Broek is supported by an unrestricted educational grant from Olympus, Hamburg, Germany.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> None.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> The study was approved by the medical ethical committee of our institution on 16 February 2005.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Itzkowitz</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Harpaz</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>Diagnosis and management of dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</article-title> <source>Gastroenterology</source> <year>2004</year>;<volume>126</volume>:<fpage>1634</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>48</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15168373</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eaden</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Abrams</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayberry</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>The risk of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis: a meta-analysis.</article-title> <source>Gut</source> <year>2001</year>;<volume>48</volume>:<fpage>526</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>35</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11247898</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><label>3</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Mpofu</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>  <article-title>Strategies for detecting colon cancer and/or dysplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</article-title> <source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source> <year>2006</year>;<issue>(2)</issue>:<fpage>CD000279</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16625534</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b4"><label>4</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Itzkowitz</surname><given-names>SH</given-names></name><name><surname>Present</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>Consensus conference: Colorectal cancer screening and surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease.</article-title> <source>Inflamm Bowel Dis</source> <year>2005</year>;<volume>11</volume>:<fpage>314</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>21</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15735438</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b5"><label>5</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Eaden</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayberry</surname><given-names>JF</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>Guidelines for screening and surveillance of asymptomatic colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</article-title> <source>Gut</source> <year>2002</year>;<volume>51</volume><issue>(Suppl 5)</issue>:<fpage>V10</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>V12</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12221032</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b6"><label>6</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Labianca</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Beretta</surname><given-names>GD</given-names></name><name><surname>Mosconi</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>  <article-title>Colorectal cancer: screening.</article-title> <source>Ann Oncol</source> <year>2005</year>;<volume>16</volume><issue>(Suppl 2)</issue>:<fpage>ii127</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>ii132</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15958442</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b7"><label>7</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ransohoff</surname><given-names>DF</given-names></name><name><surname>Riddell</surname><given-names>RH</given-names></name><name><surname>Levin</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>Ulcerative colitis and colonic cancer.
