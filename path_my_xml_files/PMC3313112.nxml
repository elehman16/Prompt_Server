Healthy male participants (n = 12) aged 18&#x02013;35 rested for one hour while energy expenditure (EE), respiratory exchange ratio (RER), heart rate (HR), and blood pressure (B) were assessed in a fasted state. Subsequently, participants orally ingested either supplement or placebo. Immediately following supplement administration, participants rested for another hour while EE, RER, HP, and BP were recorded. Thereafter, participants performed a maximal exercise test on a treadmill and then endured another hour of EE, RER, HR, and BP measurement.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>VPX Meltdown<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, increased REE significantly more than placebo at 45 minutes (2,079 &#x000b1; 373 vs. 1,847 &#x000b1; 340 kcal/day; p = 0.003) and 60 minutes (2,153 &#x000b1; 403 vs. 1877 &#x000b1; 314 kcal/day; p = 0.025) post-ingestion. Furthermore, REE 60 minutes post-exercise (two to three hours following supplement administration) was higher in the Meltdown<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>group (2,179 &#x000b1; 386 vs. 1,913 &#x000b1; 400; p = 0.1440). Moreover, over the course of the three hour evaluation period, area under the curve assessment demonstrated that EE was significantly increased with VPX Meltdown<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>compared to placebo (area: 9,925 &#x000b1; 1,331 vs. 8,951 &#x000b1; 2,961; p = 0.043) while RER was significantly less than placebo (area: 5.55 &#x000b1; 0.61 vs. 5.89 &#x000b1; 0.44; p = 0.002) following ingestion. HR and BP were not significantly affected prior to exercise with either supplement (p &#x0003e; 0.05) and the exercise-induced increases observed in HR and BP that decreased into recovery were not different between supplements (p &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data suggest that VPX Meltdown<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>enhances EE and fat oxidation more than placebo for several hours after ingestion in fully rested and post-exercise states without any adverse hemodynamic responses.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was funded by Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. dba VPX/Redline.</p></sec></back></article>
