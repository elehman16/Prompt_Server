However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires verification studies.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Pathologists were randomized to interpret one of four sets of breast biopsy cases during two phases, separated by &#x02265;9 months, using glass slides or digital format (sixty cases per set, one slide per case, <italic>n</italic> = 240 cases). Accuracy was assessed by comparing interpretations to a consensus reference standard. Intraobserver reproducibility was assessed by comparing the agreement of interpretations on the same cases between two phases.

Accuracy was slightly higher using glass compared to digital format and varied by category: invasive carcinoma, 96% versus 93% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04); ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS), 84% versus 79% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01); atypia, 48% versus 43% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08); and benign without atypia, 87% versus 82% (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). There was a small decrease in intraobserver agreement when the format changed compared to when glass slides were used in both phases (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08). Predictive values for confirmation by a reference panel using glass versus digital were: invasive carcinoma, 98% and 97% (not significant [NS]); DCIS, 70% and 57% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007); atypia, 38% and 28% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002); and benign without atypia, 97% and 96% (NS).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this large randomized study, digital format interpretations were similar to glass slide interpretations of benign and invasive cancer cases. However, cases in the middle of the spectrum, where more inherent variability exists, may be more problematic in digital format.

Each case included standardized data on the woman's age at biopsy, breast density, and biopsy type. We oversampled cases with atypia (atypical ductal hyperplasia [ADH] and ADH in a papilloma) and ductal carcinoma <italic>in situ</italic> (DCIS), biopsies from women aged 40&#x02013;49 years, and cases from women with dense breasts. Nearly half of the 240 cases were from women aged 40&#x02013;49 years (<italic>n</italic> = 118); the remainder were from women aged 50&#x02013;59 years (<italic>n</italic> = 67), 60&#x02013;69 years (<italic>n</italic> = 29), and &#x0003e;70 years (<italic>n</italic> = 26). Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System breast density categories assessed on the previous mammography included almost entirely fat (<italic>n</italic> = 13), scattered fibroglandular densities (<italic>n</italic> = 105), heterogeneously dense (<italic>n</italic> = 97), and extremely dense (<italic>n</italic> = 25).[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Cases were from both core needle (<italic>n</italic> = 138) and excisional (<italic>n</italic> = 102) biopsies. The 240 cases were randomly assigned to one of four test sets, with stratification to achieve balance for these factors.</p><p>Each glass slide was scanned using an iScan Coreo Au<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> digital slide scanner in 40&#x000d7; high-resolution mode. A technician and an experienced breast pathologist reviewed each digital image, rescanning as needed to obtain the highest quality. A custom online digital slide viewer was built using HD View SL, Microsoft's open source Silverlight gigapixel image viewer. The viewer, like popular online mapping applications and industry-sponsored WSI viewers, allowed pathologists to pan the image and zoom (up to 40&#x000d7; actual scanned magnification with additional digital magnification for a final maximum magnification of 60&#x000d7;). Additional tools were available for measuring lesion size and counting mitotic figures.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Determination of reference standard</title><p>Three experienced breast pathologists developed a reference interpretation by consensus agreement for each case in glass format using standardized diagnostic categories.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The case distribution, defined by glass slide reference categories, was: benign without atypia (30%), atypia (30%), DCIS (30%), and invasive carcinoma (10%).

All interpretations were performed by pathologists using their own microscopes and computers. After at least 9 months, the pathologists were invited to interpret cases in Phase II. The pathologists were again randomly assigned to interpretive format in Phase II, with stratification based on Phase I format and clinical expertise [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Appendix 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram for pathologist randomization [see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Appendix 1</xref> for further details on recruitment and randomization]</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPI-8-12-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Appendix 1a</label><caption><p>Pathologist recruitment and randomization for Phase I</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPI-8-12-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Appendix 1b</label><caption><p>Phase II detailed flow diagram for pathologist randomization</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPI-8-12-g003"/></fig><p>The pathologists interpreted the same cases in both phases; however, the cases were randomly ordered for each participant and also for each phase.

Tests for agreement rates and confidence intervals (CIs) accounted for both within- and between-participant variability by employing variance estimates of the form (var [ratep] + [avg (ratep) &#x000d7; (1 &#x02013; avg (ratep))]/nc)/np, where avg (ratep) is the average rate among pathologists, var (ratep) is the sample variance among pathologists, nc is the number of cases interpreted by each pathologist, and np is the number of pathologists. Effects of pathologist characteristics (e.g., expertise, digital experience) and case characteristics (e.g., patient age, biopsy type) on accuracy were examined. Results of the 6-point Likert scales for confidence and difficulty ratings were simplified to a binary variable of 1, 2, 3 versus 4, 5, 6.</p><p>When rate comparisons involved more than one factor or more than two levels for a single factor, we used logistic regression models of agreement rates with a robust variance estimator to account for the lack of independence between interpretations by the same pathologist.</p><p>We used logistic regression to examine if the effect on accuracy of glass versus digital format remained after adjusting for pathologist characteristics. Adjusting for case-level characteristics was unnecessary, as pathologists interpreted the same cases, eliminating the potential for case-level characteristics to confound the glass versus digital comparison.</p><p>We evaluated whether a learning curve existed as pathologists became more experienced using the digital format during this study. In this analysis, the average pathologist-level accuracy was estimated separately for each of the six consecutive subsets of ten cases in a pathologist's sequence of cases. We used logistic regression with an ordered covariate with values one to six indicating interpretive sequence (i.e., group of ten cases) to determine if there was an increasing trend.</p><p>To assess reproducibility, pathologists&#x02019; interpretations in Phase II were compared with their interpretations of the same cases in Phase I. Agreement rates and CIs were based on logit models utilizing a robust estimator of the variance to account for correlation of case interpretations from the same pathologist. Differences in reproducibility (agreement rates) were calculated when using glass slides in both phases, when using digital format in both phases, and when the format changed between phases (e.g., using glass slides in one phase and digital in the other). Hypothesis tests were based on Wald tests of logit model coefficients distinguishing between interpretations made on different combinations of diagnostic formats.</p><p>We calculated the probability that an initial biopsy interpretation in clinical practice using the digital format would be confirmed by the reference diagnosis (i.e., the predictive value). We used previously described techniques[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] combining the Phase I data with the prevalence of diagnostic outcomes in U.S. women 50&#x02013;59 years old who received breast biopsies after screening.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>esults</sc></title><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Characteristics of participating pathologists</title><p>Of responding pathologists, 252 (65%) were eligible and agreed to participate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Appendix 1</xref>].

Our study highlights the many challenges we face as we move into the digital era in the design and analyses of quality assessment studies. In our study, predictive value estimates were nearly identical regardless of interpretive format at the extremes of the diagnostic spectrum (e.g., invasive cancer and benign tissue), suggesting digital WSI could be employed for the primary diagnosis for these extreme categories. However, the more challenging (and less common) atypia and DCIS diagnostic categories in the middle of the spectrum have lower reproducibility and accuracy in the digital interpretive format. It should be noted that reproducibility and accuracy are also lower for atypia and DCIS when using glass slides, but the effect is amplified using digital WSI. As the field of digital pathology moves forward, attention to inclusion of the full spectrum of cases in validation studies will be important.</p><p>While our study followed the digital imaging validation guidelines recommended by the College of American Pathologists,[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] our design also exceeded their recommendations in a few notable ways. Our study design included randomly allocating pathologists to interpretive format, using a random selection process for identifying cases, including a Phase I glass to Phase II glass reproducibility study arm as a benchmark, and employing a 9-month wash-out period between phases to reduce recall bias when assessing reproducibility. We also compared pathologists&#x02019; accuracy using a carefully defined expert consensus reference standard. Finally, the investigators have no associations with manufacturers of digital WSI instruments or viewing platforms except that one commercial manufacturer provided use of a scanner to digitally archive the glass slides.</p><p>It is possible that the slightly lower accuracy with digital WSI imaging that we noted can be corrected with experience. Among pathologists reporting prior experience using digital WSI, we noted a nonsignificant trend for higher accuracy of digital interpretations than for pathologists who reported no experience with WSI, even after accounting for the effects of other pathologist-level characteristics. However, participating pathologists had limited experience with the digital format as it is not currently approved for primary diagnostic use in the U.S. by the FDA. It may be too early to address whether experience with the digital format results in improved diagnostic accuracy.</p><p>In the digital format, pathologists were more likely to deem a case challenging and spent more time interpreting cases compared to pathologists using glass slides &#x02013; circumstantial evidence suggesting that experience with the technology may be an issue. Technological improvements to image acquisition and standardized display systems, coupled with physician education and experience using digital WSI, may reduce performance gaps between the formats. While no learning curve was noted in performance during this study, gaining experience requires time, and sixty cases without an educational intervention may be inadequate. The absence of a learning curve has been noted by others,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] though an improvement in accuracy after completing an educational intervention was reported in one study.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Many areas of pathology are challenging and might benefit from digital technology. Pathologists are understandably concerned about the high level of difficulty of breast pathology[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and the high risk for medical malpractice when a cancer diagnosis is a possibility.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Pathologists are also likely to desire a second opinion to improve clinical care on breast cases more often than being required by existing laboratory policies.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Digital technology could, therefore, be an important tool to facilitate second opinions on these challenging cases.</p><p>Pathologists interpret differently using traditional glass slide microscopy versus digital WSI format. Behind the microscope, small finger movements reposition the slide, and eye saccades scan the microscopic field; the remainder of the head and body are stationary. Digital viewing requires larger hand movements to pan and zoom and greater head and eye movements to scan all areas of the image. In addition, for pathologists wearing corrective lenses, particularly bifocals or variable focus lenses, constant corrections are needed to maintain focus. Implementation studies in Sweden suggest job-specific ergonomics may be improved by incorporating the digital format.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-14"><title>Special considerations in designing quality assessment studies</title><p>Technologic improvements in design and image quality are occurring quickly in this field. Going forward, proposed technical performance parameters and regulation of digital imaging have been outlined by the FDA and discussed by others.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] One potential limitation to this study is that each pathologist completed the histology evaluation remotely using their own microscope and computer, with no standardization. We do not have information on their workstation and monitor specifications or internet and bandwidth capabilities. The scanner we used is no longer commercially available, and scanner technology is rapidly updating. However, the digital whole slide images were acquired using a 40&#x000d7; objective lens and research staff carefully reviewed the digital scan image of each slide to avoid errors introduced during digital scanning and to assure quality.</p><p>In a randomized study design such as ours, other limiting factors apply equally to both glass and digital formats. For example, our study included one slide per case, assessment of performance in a testing situation instead of actual clinical setting, and a higher proportion of benign proliferative, atypia, and DCIS cases than usual clinical practice, as well as a relatively small number of invasive cancer cases. While these can be considered limitations, these limiting factors were equally present in the digital and the glass format testing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-15"><title>Implications</title><p>Digital imaging technology has revolutionized medicine and is an important emerging adjunct to traditional light microscopy that might greatly aid the practice of pathology. We noted that diagnoses of invasive breast carcinoma are highly reproducible using both glass and digital formats. However, clinical practice includes a broad spectrum of cases, including those in the middle diagnostic categories, and these cases are often more challenging to diagnose even in the traditional glass slide format. As noted in this study, the more challenging high-risk and preinvasive lesions (atypia and DCIS) may have lower predictive value using a digital format compared with a glass slide format. We encourage future studies evaluating the effect(s) of the digital format on patient outcomes to include the full spectrum of cases and consider the randomized design features presented in our study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-16"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (R01CA140560, R01CA172343, K05CA104699, U01CA86082, U01CA70013) and the NCI-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (HHSN261201100031C).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-17" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The collection of cancer and vital status data was supported in part by several state public health departments and cancer registries throughout the U.S. For a full description of these sources, please see: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.breastscreening.cancer.gov/work/acknowledgement.html">http://www.breastscreening.cancer.gov/work/acknowledgement.html</ext-link>.
