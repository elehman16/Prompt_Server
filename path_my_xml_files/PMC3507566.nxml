Excess body weight is associated with increased incidence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). To date, bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment to achieve weight loss in obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study is a nonrandomized but controlled, prospective, interventional trial on the effect of bariatric surgery on mortality and morbidity compared with conventional obesity treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). We recently reported that bariatric surgery was associated with a decreased incidence of cardiovascular events in the overall SOS study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In individuals with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery results in sustained weight loss and also reduces blood glucose values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The American Diabetes Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), International Diabetes Federation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) recommend bariatric surgery for adults with type 2 diabetes and BMI &#x02265;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, especially for those whose diabetes is difficult to control with a lifestyle and pharmacological approach. However, data on the long-term benefits of bariatric surgery on hard end points in individuals with type 2 diabetes are not available. Whether the metabolic improvement results in a reduced number of cardiovascular events in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes remains to be determined. Therefore, the aim of the present report was to examine the effect of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular events in SOS study participants with type 2 diabetes at baseline.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>The SOS study has been previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In brief, the SOS study is a prospective, nonrandomized, controlled interventional trial on the effect of bariatric surgery on mortality and morbidity compared with conventional obesity treatment. A total of 4,047 obese individuals were enrolled from 1 September 1987 to 31 January 2001. Among these subjects, 2,010 underwent bariatric surgery, and a contemporaneously matched control group of 2,037 individuals was created using 18 matching variables. Written informed consent has been obtained by all study participants. All clinical investigations have been conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. Seven local ethics review boards approved SOS study protocol. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both study groups. Inclusion criteria were between 37 and 60 years of age and BMI &#x02265;34 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for men and &#x02265;38 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for women. The exclusion criteria were earlier surgery for gastric or duodenal ulcer, earlier bariatric surgery, gastric ulcer during the past 6 months, ongoing malignancy, active malignancy during the past 5 years, myocardial infarction during the past 6 months, bulimic eating pattern, drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric or cooperative problems contraindicating bariatric surgery, and other contraindicating conditions (such as chronic glucocorticoid or anti-inflammatory treatment) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Subjects with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, or myocardial infarction and stroke &#x0003e;6 months before recruitment were not excluded. Participants were examined at matching, at baseline, and after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20 years. Biochemical parameters were measured at the matching and baseline examinations and at 2-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year follow-up. Fasting blood samples were obtained in the morning after an overnight fast as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Type 2 diabetes was defined as fasting blood glucose &#x02265;6.1 mmol/L (when using fasting plasma glucose, the cutoff values are &#x02265;7.0 mmol/L or 126 mg/dL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) and/or self-reported therapy with glucose-lowering medications at baseline.</p><p>The current report is based on 607 subjects with type 2 diabetes at baseline: 345 subjects underwent bariatric surgery (227 vertical-banded gastroplasty, 61 gastric banding, and 57 gastric bypass), and 262 subjects in the control group received the standard obesity and diabetes treatment at their centers of registration.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Study end points</title><p>The end points analyzed in the current report were fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke, whichever came first) as well as myocardial infarction and cerebral stroke analyzed separately. These end points, which were predefined in the original study protocol from 1987 for the total SOS study population, are analyzed here in the SOS participants with type 2 diabetes at baseline. The following ICD-9/ICD-10 codes were used: myocardial infarction, 410<bold>/</bold>I21, I22; intracerebral bleeding, 431<bold>/</bold>I61; cerebral artery occlusion, 433, 434<bold>/</bold>I63, I65, and I66; and acute but nondefined stroke in terms of bleeding or occlusion, 436<bold>/</bold>I64. Angina pectoris, claudication, transitory ischemic attack, and subarachnoid hemorrhage were not included in the analyses. Information about the end points was obtained by cross-checking social security numbers from the SOS database with the Swedish National Patient Register, the Cause of Death Register, and the Register of the Total Population. The information in the health registries was completed until 31 December 2009.

A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used to compare categorical variables.</p><p>Time of progression to end points was compared between the surgery and control groups with Kaplan-Meier estimates of cumulative incidence rates. Survival distributions in the two treatment groups were compared using a log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models based on baseline data were also used to evaluate time to cardiovascular event.

In obese subjects with type 2 diabetes, bariatric surgery was associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events, and the beneficial effect of the surgical treatment was also present after adjustment for baseline parameters. When analyzed separately, bariatric surgery was associated with a reduced incidence of myocardial infarction, but no effect was observed on stroke incidence. We have recently shown bariatric surgery in the overall SOS study cohort was associated with reduced incidence of cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction or stroke when analyzed separately; however, the effect size on stroke was modest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The absence of an effect on stroke incidence in subjects with type 2 diabetes at baseline could be explained by low statistical power given that only 15% (only those with type 2 diabetes at baseline) of the overall SOS study participants were included.</p><p>Several metabolic variables (blood glucose, circulating lipids, and blood pressure) were markedly improved in the surgery group. These data are in line with previous reports on the metabolic changes after bariatric surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, this is the first study to demonstrate that the beneficial effects of bariatric surgery on cardiovascular risk factors are also followed by reduced risk of myocardial infarction in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The NNT shows that 16 individuals with type 2 diabetes need to be operated to prevent one myocardial infarction over a period of 15 years. In the surgery group, no difference in the incidence of myocardial infarction was observed across the three different surgical procedures; however, our study was not statistically powered to detect such difference.</p><p>Interestingly, in our study, bariatric surgery was associated with a reduction of myocardial infarction incidence in diabetic individuals with BMI below the median (40.6 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). This result corroborates the guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), International Diabetes Federation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), and other organizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) in which bariatric surgery is considered as a therapeutic option in diabetic subjects with BMI &#x0003c;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Furthermore, the risk factor&#x02013;treatment interaction analysis showed that the effect of surgery on myocardial infarction was greater in participants with higher total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, possibly suggesting that, in obese diabetic individuals, those with dyslipidemia should be prioritized. Moreover, in the previously reported analyses on the overall SOS study cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), baseline fasting insulin levels rather than BMI predicted the surgery treatment benefit on cardiovascular event. Taken together, these results suggest that to maximize the benefits, metabolic parameters should be used to select obese patients for surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of the current report is that the SOS study intervention was not randomized for ethical reasons due to high postoperative mortality in the 1980s. Another limitation of our study is that we performed a post hoc analysis, selecting only individuals with type 2 diabetes at baseline. However, myocardial infarction and stroke were predefined secondary end points for the overall SOS population in the original study protocol. Ideally, longitudinal, randomized, controlled trials (e.g., obese diabetic individuals selected by circulating triglyceride levels) should be performed to confirm these results. However, a long follow-up is needed to document effects on hard cardiovascular end points, and confirmatory data are not likely to be available for many years.</p><p>In conclusion, this is the first prospective study showing that bariatric surgery is associated with reduced incidence of myocardial infarction in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes. It also provides support for the recommendations of the international guidelines regarding bariatric surgery in obese individuals with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec>
