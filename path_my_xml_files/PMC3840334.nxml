The majority of patients with dementia live in their own homes with their caregivers, usually their spouses, who bear the responsibility of caregiving.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> Caring for family members with dementia has long been considered as the most stressful type of family caregiving, predisposing caregivers to mental and physical illnesses and increasing their risk for death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> Previously an under-researched area, the needs of patients with AD have received more attention in recent years, with studies documenting their need for information about their illness, for help to cope with their disabilities, for social recognition and support and for a decent quality of life with meaningful social contact and activities.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> Patients&#x02019; unmet needs can result in mood and behavioural problems, safety issues, social isolation and increased risk for nursing home placement and death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref> Meta-analyses and systematic reviews of the numerous clinical trials assessing the efficacy of psychosocial interventions for caregivers have shown a significant effect of interventions on reducing caregivers&#x02019; psychological morbidity and reduce patients&#x02019; neuropsychiatric symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5 R6 R7 R8 R9">5&#x02013;9</xref> Studies examining the effect of psychosocial intervention on patients&#x02019; mortality and nursing home placement are scarce and the results are inconsistent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Studies that included psychosocial interventions for the patients are limited, providing anecdotal evidence for positive effects of interventions on patients&#x02019; cognitive function, psychological morbidity and time to nursing home placement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Today, thanks to the remarkable advances in diagnosing dementia, patients can be diagnosed at an early stage when their relatively intact autonomy and insight enable them to convey their needs and actively participate in intervention programmes. The rapidly growing number of people with AD in the coming years, a considerable proportion of them diagnosed in the early stages, presents a pressing need to develop and validate intervention programmes that focus on the needs of patients with mild dementia and their caregivers and involve both parties in the intervention.</p><p>It was hypothesised that the Danish Alzheimer Intervention Study (DAISY), a multifaceted and semitailored intervention programme offered to patients with AD and their primary caregivers during the first year after the diagnosis, could have a long-term effect in preventing the emergence of depressive symptoms, improving quality of life for the patients and the caregivers, stabilising the patients&#x02019; cognitive function and delaying nursing home placement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref> The results of the 12-month follow-up were published in <italic>BMJ</italic> in 2012, showing no significant difference in outcomes between the DAISY and the control groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> However, the significant level corrected for multiple testing (p=0.0005) was subsequently criticised for being too conservative, given that an alternative correction method could have given another conclusion.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> Before adjustment for multiple testing was carried out, the data analysis of the results at the 12-month follow-up had shown statistical significance in one primary patient outcome (Cornell Depression Scale score, p=0.0103) and one secondary patient outcome (proxy-rated quality of life QoL-AD, p=0.0013) in favour of the DAISY group.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> Therefore, a 36-month follow-up was subsequently carried out to follow the evolution of these outcomes. This paper reports the results of this follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Detailed description of the study rationale, methods, design, randomisation and sample size has been published.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref></p><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>DAISY was a large multicentre, rater-blinded, 1-year randomised controlled trial of the efficacy of intensive psychosocial intervention for patients with mild AD and their caregivers. It was an exploratory randomised clinical trial with multiple primary and secondary outcomes.</p><sec id="s2a1"><title>Participants</title><p>The patients were recruited from five Danish districts. One designated memory clinic in each district recruited the patients for the trial. Each recruiting centre had one study co-ordinator and one physician who assessed the patients for eligibility. Patients were referred from local memory clinics as well as private practice in psychiatry, neurology, geriatrics and family medicine. If referred from private practice, dementia diagnosis was confirmed by specialists in the recruiting memory clinic.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were (1) home-living patients diagnosed within the past 12&#x02005;months with AD, mixed AD with vascular component or Lewy body dementia; (2) 50&#x02005;years of age or older; (3) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &#x02265;20<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> and (4) having one participating primary caregiver. The primary caregiver was defined as the main person responsible for the informal care of the patient with minimum weekly contact. All patients met DSM-IV criteria for dementia,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref> NINCDS-ADRDA criteria for probable AD<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref> or McKeith criteria for Lewy body dementia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref> Patients with mixed AD were those with probable AD and minor vascular changes on cranial CT that could contribute to their symptoms.</p><p>Patients with severe somatic or psychiatric comorbidities (including impaired hearing or vision) that would significantly impair their compliance with the DAISY programme were excluded. Patients who had already been involved in other intervention programmes were also excluded. Patient&#x02013;caregiver dyads were randomised to the DAISY group, in which they were provided with intensive psychosocial interventions and follow-up support at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months; or to the control group, in which they were only provided with follow-up support at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months. The study was subsequently extended and the patients and their caregivers were asked to give a separate consent to an additional follow-up at 36&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Intervention</title><p>A multifaceted and semitailored psychosocial intervention programme described in details in our previous reports<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> was designed to provide counselling, information and support to patients with mild dementia and their caregivers in the intervention group. The study co-ordinator in each centre, an experienced nurse specialising in caring for patients with dementia and having received special training in counselling for the study (constructivist approach),<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref> implemented the intervention within the first month after inclusion in the trial. Consisting of five key components, the intervention focused on positive resources, intact function, retained skills and feasible activities for the patients: (1) the study co-ordinator provided seven individual counselling sessions tailored to the needs of the patients and their caregivers: two for the patient alone, two for the caregiver alone, two for the patient&#x02013;caregiver dyad and one with the dyad together with their family network (optional); (2) the study co-ordinator provided outreach telephone counselling 5&#x02013;8 times with 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;week intervals to maintain regular contact and follow-up on the individual counselling sessions; (3) using log books, the patients and their caregivers independently kept track of the thoughts and daily issues that they wanted to discuss at the counselling sessions; (4) experts in the field of dementia were invited to teach five standard courses as group intervention with separate courses for patients and caregivers to provide general information about dementia and forum for discussion, sharing information and support and (5) patients and caregivers were provided with information folders produced especially for the purpose of the study about dementia causes, diagnosis and treatment, legal issues and resources for social support. The intervention programme lasted 8&#x02013;12 months. Full compliance was defined as adherence with the major components of the intervention programme: patients who participated with their caregivers in at least three counselling sessions (not including the optional network session) and in at least three teaching course sessions.</p><p>The patients in both the intervention and the control groups were followed up at 3, 6, 12 and 36&#x02005;months. Attempts were made to provide similar treatment for both intervention and control participants in all respects other than the add-on DAISY. At each follow-up visit, participants in both groups were interviewed about their current symptoms and daily-life issues, and informed about available support programme (if any) in their local communities. Both groups were free to participate in such support programmes during the study and participation in these support activities was registered for both groups. Identified special needs led to referral to local care facilities when available and relevant.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Outcomes</title></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Primary outcomes for the patients</title><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Global cognitive function: The patient's global cognitive function was assessed using MMSE.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref> The sum of scores ranges from 0 to 30.

The local study coordinator carried out the baseline assessment prior to randomisation at the local study centre. Independent raters blind to group assignment carried out follow-up assessments at 6, 12 and 36&#x02005;months during home visits. The raters were neither involved in the intervention programme nor employed in the same institutions as the study co-ordinators. The efficiency of concealment was checked through questionnaires administered to the raters at the end of each follow-up visit.

With linear models on the full data of up to four observations per dyad, we compared the difference in development of the primary and secondary outcomes between randomisation groups during the follow-up period, using generalised estimating equations to account for repeated measurements; the inclusion of a categorical centre indicator variable account for possible clustering by treating centre. To adjust for possible bias because of differential death and dropout from the study between the intervention and control groups, the assessments at the various follow-up times were weighted by the inverse of an estimate of the probability of staying in the study, a method explained in the seminal paper by Dufouil <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref> These probabilities were estimated from the data in logistic regression models for death and dropout with the dyads&#x02019; characteristics and the observed primary outcomes from previous visits as covariates. Only the expected scores and inferences for the 36-month follow-up were reported. Differences in mortality and nursing home placement rates between the two groups were evaluated by HR from a Cox regression model.

The disease-specific QoL-AD is probably more sensitive to measure the effect of psychological interventions than general EQ-VAS.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref> At the 36-month follow-up, these positive effects were no longer present. Between 12 and 36&#x02005;months of follow-up, there was significant decline in patients&#x02019; cognition, quality of life and ADL. During this time period, there was no continuing intervention or support. Initially, the study was intended to end at the 12-month follow-up. However, we received additional funding to carry out follow-up at 36&#x02005;months. The timing and duration of DAISY could have missed a period of significant decline when intervention could have been more beneficial. Possibly, the positive trends observed at the 12-month follow-up could have been maintained or enhanced had the intervention continued for an additional 2&#x02005;years. Evidence from the very limited literature seems to support the hypothesis that the positive effects of psychosocial interventions could be lost without continuous reinforcement. There are few randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of psychosocial intervention that specifically targets community-dwelling patients with dementia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Most trials had short follow-up period, usually 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months. One trial showed that a 3-month programme of intensive physical exercise for the patients combined with teaching caregivers strategies to manage patients&#x02019; behavioural problems improved the patients&#x02019; physical functioning and depressive symptoms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> At 24-month follow-up, the improvement in physical functioning was still significant, but the improvement of depressive symptoms was no longer present.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref> In contrast, another trial with 8-year follow-up reported delayed nursing home placement for patients by providing a multicomponent interventions for the caregivers and patients; the 10-day intervention programme was followed by continuous support over the telephone, weekly for the first year and yearly thereafter for the next 7&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref></p><p>In our study, there are some possible explanations for the non-significant positive effects found at the 12-month follow-up concerning patients&#x02019; depressive symptoms and quality of life and the disappearance of these effects at the 36-month follow-up. First, it could be a floor effect. Our patients had minimal depressive symptoms and relatively high scores of QoL-AD at baseline. A randomised controlled trial using support group intervention for community-dwelling patients with mild AD and their caregivers showed that patients who experienced improvement in their depressive symptoms had significantly more depressive symptoms at baseline and a higher level of distress.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> Second, there was no need assessment at baseline. Probably, participants with more symptoms and at greater need should have received the full intensive intervention programme and regular support follow-up was sufficient for those who had minimal symptoms and needs at baseline. Third, the control group also received some intervention that is much better than the usual practice in Denmark.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">31</xref> They had regular follow-ups when they could speak about emerging psychosocial and health problems, receive information about available resources, and get referred to relevant health professionals if needed. It is noteworthy that despite the marked decline in patients&#x02019; global cognitive function, quality of life and ADL between 12 and 36&#x02005;months of follow-ups, participants in both groups had minimal changes in mean Cornell Depression Scale scores as compared to the baseline. This could be an indication that the regular follow-ups offered in this study were sufficient enough to produce a long-term effect in preventing the conversion into clinical depression for the patients. Fourth, as aforementioned, the intervention should probably continue longitudinally following the clinical progression in these patients to show long-term positive effects. The study did not find any long-term effect on DAISY on the caregiver outcomes. Previous studies have shown positive responses to interventions from caregivers with high levels of depression and anxiety at baseline.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> For this mostly asymptomatic group of caregivers in our study, perhaps follow-up at regular intervals provided enough information and support to prevent the emergence of depressive symptoms and maintain good life quality.</p><p>It is not known why patients in the intervention group had higher mortality than those in the control group. This increased mortality was unlikely to be caused by the intervention, as the nature of the intervention programme did not subject the patients to any health risk. Using the data from Statistics Denmark (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dst.dk">http://www.dst.dk</ext-link>), the incidence of death for the age-matched general population over the same time period was found to be similar to that of the DAISY group. The control group, however, had lower incidence of death compared with the general population. At baseline, the quality of life of the patients in the intervention group was rated as poorer than that of the control group, both by the patients themselves and by their caregivers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013003584TB1">table 1</xref>). Although not statistically significant, there were small socioeconomic and clinical differences that could be responsible for the higher mortality rate in the intervention groups. More patients in the intervention group lived alone (4% difference), rented their house (7% difference), had more comorbidities (4.4% difference) and were diagnosed with mixed AD and vascular dementia (4.2% difference, <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2013003584TB1">table 1</xref>). Whether these differences could contribute to the higher mortality in the intervention group is uncertain. It is known that older people living alone have higher mortality than those living with others.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">32</xref> Currently, there is insufficient evidence in the literature concerning the effect of psychosocial intervention on patient mortality, as studies looking at this effect are scarce.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></p><p>The same patient characteristics in the DAISY group stated above could also explain the lack of effect concerning nursing home placement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">34</xref> Additionally, continuous intervention and follow-up between 12 and 36&#x02005;months could have been needed to produce a positive long-term effect on nursing home placement. Randomised controlled trials that reported positive long-term effect of psychosocial intervention on patients&#x02019; nursing home placement provided continuous support and counselling over the phone for 8&#x02013;9&#x02005;years.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R35">35</xref> In contrast, intervention lasting 2&#x02005;years but without continuous follow-up and support showed no long-term effect on nursing home placement.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref></p><p>Although this study found no long-term effect of DAISY, a qualitative study linked to this randomised controlled trial showed that 80% of patients and 94% of caregivers in the intervention group found the intervention overall beneficial. Patients felt that their self-esteem was improved and they could better manage their daily life and social relations. Caregivers felt that they were more confident and competent to cope with the challenges of caring for relatives with AD. After the intervention, patients and caregivers looked for support groups to join permanently and caregivers sought continued counselling.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">36</xref> In contrast to randomised clinical trials about pharmacological interventions, we did not carry out DAISY to justify the reason for providing psychosocial intervention for patients with dementia and their caregivers, whose need for information, counselling and support cannot be denied. What we can conclude from this study is that since we could not show positive effects in the quantitative analyses, we should not offer psychosocial intervention indiscriminately to all patients with very mild dementia and their caregivers, but we should probably assess their needs and offer intervention only to those who need it. Regular follow-up is therefore important to identify the arising needs that require intervention. Probably, the type, dose and intensity, and duration of early intervention should be more tailored to match the needs of patients and their caregivers at baseline to maximise benefit, economise resources and avoid unnecessary intervention burden. The intervention programme should perhaps be designed in such a way that patients and caregivers with greater needs at baseline receive more intensive interventions that cater to their specific needs, those with lesser needs receive a basic intervention programme of lower intensity and those with minimal or no needs receive no intervention at all. To obtain long-term effect, early intervention should probably have a longitudinal and fluid course that follows the disease progression, being continuously modified according to the needs that arise. These are the questions to be answered in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e253" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003584.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e254" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003584.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank 128 volunteers who acted as raters and assistants from the 68 municipalities and five counties and the following project co-ordinators and physicians in the five participating centres for their contributions to patient recruitment, intervention and data collection: Ribe County: Esbjerg Hospital, Department of Psychiatry (Anna Marie Hansen, Johanne Christensen, J&#x000f8;rgen Jensen).
