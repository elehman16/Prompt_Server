The condition can be treated using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) that act by irreversibly blocking the H<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase responsible for acid secretion. Vonoprazan is a K<sup>+</sup> competitive channel inhibitor, which reversibly and potently inhibits gastric acid secretion. However, long-term data on vonoprazan use are limited. The aim of the VISION trial is to investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of vonoprazan in comparison with the PPI lansoprazole. This randomized, multicenter, 5-year, open-label study has a planned recruitment of 195 participants (2:1 allocation vonoprazan:lansoprazole) from 33 sites in Japan. The study comprises an 8-week &#x0201c;healing&#x0201d; phase (vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg p.o.) and a 260-week &#x0201c;maintenance&#x0201d; phase (vonoprazan 10 mg or lansoprazole 15 mg). Safety populations in both phases are defined as participants who receive at least one dose of the study or control drug in the healing and maintenance phases, respectively. The full analysis set in both phases is defined as participants who are randomized and receive at least one dose of the study or control drug in the healing and maintenance phases, respectively. The primary endpoint of the study is the histopathological evaluation of gastric mucosa for the presence of neoplastic alteration of gastric mucosal epithelial cells. Secondary efficacy endpoints include endoscopic EE recurrence rate and EE healing rate, and secondary safety endpoints include incidence of adverse events (coded using MedDRA terminology) and endoscopic evaluation of malignant changes in the gastric mucosa. Patient recruitment started in March 2016 and is now complete. The estimated study completion date is February 2022.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>erosive esophagitis</kwd><kwd>gastric mucosa</kwd><kwd>lansoprazole</kwd><kwd>long-term safety</kwd><kwd>vonoprazan</kwd><kwd>K+ competitive channel inhibitor</kwd><kwd>neoplasia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Erosive esophagitis (EE) is a condition in which gastroesophageal reflux causes esophageal mucosal breaks (damage), defined as an area of slough or erythema with a discrete lined demarcation between it and adjacent mucosa.<xref rid="b1-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> It occurs as a consequence of gastric acid reflux, resulting from relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), reduced esophageal clearance function (eg, esophageal motility), and impaired esophageal mucosal defense mechanisms.<xref rid="b3-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Increased exposure to gastric acid correlates with the severity of EE.<xref rid="b4-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The prevalence of EE in Japan, which has been increasing since the 1990s, is approximately 10%.

Patients with endoscopically confirmed healed EE at Week 4 or 8 in the healing phase will be eligible to enter the maintenance phase, wherein vonoprazan 10 mg or lansoprazole 15 mg OD will be administered for up to 260 weeks. If the starting dose within the maintenance phase is considered suboptimal, it may be increased to vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg OD. Any patient not benefitting from treatment at the end of the healing phase (Week 8) will complete the study without entering the maintenance phase. Full details of patient eligibility criteria are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-ceg-11-051">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Patients will be randomized through allocation of the study drug or control drug via a web registration system. Patients will make a maximum number of 18 visits to the clinic; at Weeks 0 and 4 during the healing phase (Week 8 for subjects with no endoscopic healing of EE at Week 4 in the healing phase) and, then, 12-weekly visits in the maintenance phase up to Week 108, followed by 24-weekly visits up to Week 228, and a final visit at Week 260.

Approval from the Ethical Review Boards will be sought from each of the different study sites, and informed, written consent will be obtained from all study participants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint of the study is histopathological evaluation of the gastric mucosa &#x02013; specifically, assessing biopsy samples for the presence or absence of neoplastic alteration of epithelial cells and hyperplasia of gastric mucosal epithelial cells, including parietal cells, enterochromaffin-like cells, G cells, and foveolar cells. Other histopathological signs include foveolar hyperplasia, endocrine cell proliferation in the body mucosa, and G-cell hyperplasia in the antral mucosa. Secondary efficacy endpoints are endoscopic EE recurrence rate and EE healing rate, whereas secondary safety endpoints include the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and endoscopic findings showing the presence or absence of fundic gland polyp, hyperplasic polyp, cobblestone mucosa, multiple white and flat elevated lesions, and black spots. Furthermore, safety endpoints include histological evaluation of gastritis using the Sydney classification,<xref rid="b20-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> that is, mononuclear infiltration, neutrophilic infiltration, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia, and <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection.</p><p>Additional assessments to be carried out during the study period include: serum gastrin level; pepsinogen I and II levels and ratios; serum chromogranin A level; laboratory test results; Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus; and esophageal hiatal hernia.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>Patient demographics, medical history, and prior drug treatment will be recorded at Week 0. Physical examination, vital signs, and laboratory tests will be conducted at all visits during the healing and maintenance phases, as will recording of concomitant drugs and comorbid disorders. Fasting levels of serum gastrin, pepsinogen I and II, and serum chromogranin A levels will be measured at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 during the healing phase, and at Weeks 12, 24, 48, 108, 156, 204, and 260 in the maintenance phase, except for serum gastrin which will be measured at Weeks 12 and 260 only. Endoscopy will be conducted at Weeks 0, 4, and 8 during the healing phase, and at Weeks 48, 108, 156, 204, and 260 in the maintenance phase. Histopathology of gastric mucosa and histological evaluation of gastritis will be undertaken centrally by two pathologists specializing in gastrointestinal histopathology at Week 0; these investigations will then be re-evaluated at Weeks 48, 108, 156, 204, and 260 in the maintenance phase. An <italic>H. pylori</italic> urea breath test will also be conducted at Week 0 (after initial endoscopy), as well as CYP2C19 genotype testing.</p><p>At each study visit, investigators shall pay attention to the presence of AEs, especially diarrhea, gastrointestinal infections, bone fracture, and pneumonia. AEs will be graded according to severity, with mild defined as an event that is transient and easily tolerated by the subject, moderate as an event that interrupts the subject&#x02019;s usual activities, and severe as an event that causes considerable interference with the subject&#x02019;s usual activities.</p><p>Medication compliance will be assessed by the investigator at each visit, with drug taking classified as &#x02265;90%, 70&#x02013;89%, &#x02265;50&#x02013;69%, and &#x0003c;50% of the prescribed dose.

It is estimated that this will allow data collection from 100, 50, and 30 participants in the first, third, and fifth years, respectively. The safety populations in the healing and maintenance phases are defined as participants who receive at least one dose of the study or control drug in the healing and maintenance phases, respectively. The full analysis set (FAS) are defined as participants who are randomized and receive at least one dose of the study or control drug in the healing and maintenance phases, respectively. The FAS healing and maintenance populations will be used to assess the secondary endpoints of EE healing rate at the end of the healing phase and endoscopic EE recurrence rate, respectively, and will be calculated using point estimate and a two-sided 95% confidence interval. The safety maintenance population will be used to assess primary and secondary endpoints, gastric mucosa histopathology and endoscopic findings, with histological evaluation as per Sydney classification,<xref rid="b19-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> respectively, by calculating the proportion of participants with an event; the incidence of gastric polyp (secondary endpoint) will also be calculated.

As the incidence of EE is increasing in Japanese populations,<xref rid="b5-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> additional studies are required to understand the long-term safety of the drugs used to treat this condition. Therefore, doses of both vonoprazan and lansoprazole used in the study are equivalent to those routinely prescribed to promote short-term mucosal healing (vonoprazan 20 mg and lansoprazole 30 mg) in the &#x0201c;healing&#x0201d; phase, and longer-term prevention of acid reflux (vonoprazan 10 mg and lansoprazole 15 mg) in the &#x0201c;maintenance&#x0201d; phase of the protocol.</p><p>The primary endpoint of gastric mucosal histopathology was chosen because long-term use of PPIs is associated with increased risk of gastric mucosal hyperplasia,<xref rid="b11-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> which can be identified using histopathologic methods. As vonoprazan is more potent than other PPIs, safety concerns regarding long-term acid suppression are, therefore, greater.<xref rid="b18-ceg-11-051" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The main strength of the study is the recruitment of patients for an extended period (&#x0003e;5 years). This will permit long-term safety and efficacy of vonoprazan to be assessed in a single cohort of patients. The main limitation of the study is that there is likely to be a reduction in the number of patients from whom data can be collected over the long course of the study. In particular, the invasive nature of the endoscopy required to assess morphology of the gastric mucosa may discourage some patients from long-term participation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study is funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
