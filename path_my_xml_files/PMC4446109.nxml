Behavioral weight control programs produce clinically meaningful weight losses, however outcomes have high variability and maintenance continues to be a problem. The current study is an NIH-funded randomized clinical trial testing a novel approach, Acceptance-Based Behavioral Intervention (ABBI), that combines techniques from standard behavioral treatment (SBT) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). We test this approach among individuals reporting high internal disinhibition who typically respond poorly to standard interventions and appear to benefit from ACT components.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The ABBI study targets recruitment of 160 overweight or obese adults (BMI of 25&#x02013;50) who report that they overeat in response to negative emotional states. These individuals are randomly assigned to either (1) ABBI or (2) SBT. Both interventions involve weekly meetings for 22 sessions, bi-weekly for 6 sessions, and then monthly for 3 sessions and both receive the same calorie intake target (1200&#x02013;1800, depending on starting weight), exercise goal (work up to 250&#x000a0;min per week), and self-monitoring skills training. SBT incorporates current best practice interventions for addressing problematic thoughts and emotions, sometimes called &#x0201c;change&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; strategies. ABBI uses acceptance-based techniques based on ACT. Full assessments occur at baseline, 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months. Weight loss from baseline to 18&#x000a0;months is the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ABBI study is unique in its focus on integrating acceptance-based techniques into a SBT intervention and targeting a group of individuals with problems with emotional overeating who might experience particular benefit from this novel approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01461421">NCT01461421</ext-link> (registered October 25, 2011)</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Weight loss</kwd><kwd>Disinhibition</kwd><kwd>Acceptance</kwd><kwd>Mindfulness</kwd><kwd>Emotional eating</kwd><kwd>Acceptance and commitment therapy</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale</title><p>Overweight and obesity are significant public health problems in the United States affecting nearly 70&#x000a0;% of American adults (Ogden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2014</xref>). Obesity-related medical conditions including coronary heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, degenerative joint disease, and hypertension, are estimated to cost $147 billion per year (Finkelstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2009</xref>), and are associated with the death of an estimated 365,000 Americans each year (Finkelstein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2004</xref>).</p><p>Behavioral weight loss programs are recommended as the treatment of choice for overweight and obese individuals. Current behavioral weight loss programs consistently produce weight losses of about 8&#x000a0;kg at 6-months and significant health improvements (MacLean et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). However, despite ongoing treatment contact, many patients achieve their maximum weight loss by 6&#x000a0;months and then gradually regain weight over the remainder of the program (Loveman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>). In addition, there is considerable variability in outcomes, with some patients achieving much better weight losses than others (MacLean et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2015</xref>). Novel approaches to the behavioral treatment of obesity are needed to address these limitations.</p><p>In recent years, obesity researchers have focused on improving the diet and exercise components of behavioral weight loss programs and studied topics such as the dose of exercise needed or the macronutrient composition of the diet (Wing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>; Wadden et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1988</xref>; Jakicic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1982</xref>). There has been much less attention to the approaches used to deal with emotional overeating. In fact, current behavioral weight loss treatment programs include only 2&#x02013;3 sessions introducing cognitive restructuring and providing psycho-education regarding emotional eating and stress management (Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2002</xref>). The approach taken in most existing programs is to teach participants to &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;change&#x0201d; their negative thoughts and emotions through distraction, thought stopping, and refocusing strategies.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that such control strategies may actually make it more difficult for obese individuals to cope with food cravings and lead to greater consumption of craved foods (Forman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007a</xref>; Hoffman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>). The adverse effect of &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; strategies is particularly apparent in those who report a high susceptibility to food cues (Forman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007b</xref>).</p><p>A new generation of cognitive-behavioral techniques (&#x0201c;Third Wave&#x0201d;), that includes Acceptance and Commitment Therapy [ACT; (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1999</xref>)], has shifted the focus from changing internal thoughts and feelings to accepting thoughts and feelings to thereby promote engaging in behavior that is consistent with personal values and life goals (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>; Ost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>). In ACT, the emphasis is placed on increasing awareness and engaging in valued behavior even when unwanted thoughts and feelings are present. Increasing acceptance and reducing excessive attempts to change or control thoughts and feelings has been shown to predict reductions in binge eating, (Telch et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2001</xref>) alcohol abuse, (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1997</xref>) and smoking (Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>).</p><p>Several recent studies have evaluated the benefits of incorporating ACT approaches into weight control programs. In an initial study evaluating ACT for weight maintenance, 84 overweight individuals who had lost weight within the past 2&#x000a0;years were randomly assigned to a wait list control group or a 1&#x000a0;day mindfulness and acceptance-based workshop targeting obesity-related stigma and psychological distress (Lillis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>). The primary outcome was weight maintenance over the subsequent three months; Participants in the ACT group lost 1.6&#x000a0;% of their body weight over the three month follow-up, whereas the control group gained .3&#x000a0;% (medium effect; d&#x02009;=&#x02009;.63). Changes in acceptance of negative thoughts and feelings were each shown to mediate the effect of the intervention on weight loss outcomes (Gifford &#x00026; Lillis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>; Lillis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>).</p><p>Forman and colleagues conducted a 12-week open trial, which served as the first test of a combined standard behavioral&#x02009;+&#x02009;ACT intervention (Forman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2009</xref>). Results showed 4.5&#x000a0;% weight loss post-treatment and 6.6&#x000a0;% at 6-month follow-up for intent-to-treat, and 6.6&#x000a0;% and 9.6&#x000a0;% respectively for completers (64&#x000a0;%). Based on these positive outcomes, the authors then conducted a randomized trial comparing the combined treatment (referred to as acceptance-based behavioral treatment, or ABT) to SBT (Forman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2014</xref>). Both groups produced significant weight loss and the overall weight losses did not differ between groups. However a post-hoc analysis suggested that when administered by experts, weight loss was significantly higher in ABT than SBT at post-treatment (13.2&#x000a0;% v. 7.5&#x000a0;%) and 6-month follow-up (10.9&#x000a0;% vs. 4.8&#x000a0;%). In addition, the ABT approach was found to be particularly effective in participants who reported high levels of emotional eating and disinhibition at post treatment (12.6&#x000a0;% vs 8.2&#x000a0;% and 12.3&#x000a0;% vs. 10.4&#x000a0;% respectively) and 6-month follow-up (10.5&#x000a0;% vs 6.0&#x000a0;%; 8.3&#x000a0;% vs. 6.3&#x000a0;%).</p><p>Internal disinhibition, or the tendency to overeat or lose control of eating in response to negative cognitive or emotional cues is typically assessed using the disinhibition subscale of the Eating Inventory (Stunkard &#x00026; Messick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1985</xref>). This subscale includes two factors: internal disinhibition which is the tendency to eat in response to negative cognitive or emotional cues, and external disinhibition which is the tendency to eat in response to environmental cues (Niemeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>). In recent studies, external disinhibiton did not predict weight loss outcomes, but higher baseline levels of internal disinhibition (Niemeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>) and a smaller decrease in internal disinhibiton early in weight loss treatment (Butryn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>) predicted poorer weight loss outcomes. Since ACT emphasizes acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions, rather than trying to change or control them, programs which incorporate ACT components may be particularly effective with this subgroup.</p><p>Niemeier and colleagues (Niemeier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>) conducted an uncontrolled pilot study of a combined SBT&#x02009;+&#x02009;ACT intervention (referred to as ABBI) with 21 overweight or obese men and women who were selected based on their self-reported tendency to experience internal disinhibition. Participants lost an average of 12.0&#x000a0;kg after 6&#x000a0;months of treatment and maintained that weight loss during an untreated follow-up period of three months. Additionally, greater decreases in avoidance of weight-related negative thoughts and feelings were associated with greater weight loss. Both these weight losses, which compare favorably with the standard weight loss literature, and the results from the trial by Forman et al. suggest that ACT approaches may be particularly effective for this subgroup. However, to date, there has never been a trial comparing a weight loss program based solely on standard behavioral strategies with a program that combines SBT plus ACT in the treatment of overweight or obese participants who report high internal disinhibition.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Specific Aims</title><p>The primary aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing standard behavioral weight loss treatment (SBT) with a program which combines standard behavioral weight loss components with acceptance-based strategies from ACT (which we have called Acceptance Based Behavioral Intervention or ABBI) in the treatment of overweight and obese individuals who report high internal disinhibition. We proposed a total of 160 participants who were overweight or obese and scored high on internal disinhibition.</p><p>The primary hypothesis is that participants in the ABBI program will achieve better weight losses at 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months than participants in SBT.</p><p>Secondary hypotheses are: (1) Participants in ABBI will experience greater improvements in acceptance of weight related negative thoughts and emotions and distress tolerance at 3 and 9&#x000a0;months than participants in SBT. (2) If the primary and secondary hypothesis #1 are confirmed, we will examine the extent to which the temporally precedent changes in acceptance of weight related negative thoughts and emotions and distress tolerance mediate subsequent differences in weight loss between the two groups.</p><p>Additional measures are included to examine the impact of the interventions on weight-related behaviors (diet and exercise) and psychosocial outcomes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study Design</title><p>The current study is a randomized controlled trial. Primary eligibility criteria are having a BMI between 25 and 50 and reporting high internal disinhibition.

Both interventions involve face-to-face group meetings weekly for 6&#x000a0;months, bi-weekly for 3&#x000a0;months, and then once per month for the final 3&#x000a0;months. Full assessments occur at baseline, 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months.

For individuals who reach the weight loss goal, maintenance is emphasized. Later lessons include relapse prevention, dealing with motivation erosion, improving the quality of the diet through approaches such as volumetrics, and adding novelty to the physical activity regimen.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Components that differ in ABBI vs SBT</title><p>The SBT intervention addresses negative thoughts and emotions in three sessions during the first 22&#x000a0;weeks and reviews core skills during the reduced contact phases. To address thoughts that may impede weight loss, participants are taught to recognize a negative thought, stop it, and replace it with a positive thought. Different types of negative thoughts (rationalizations, dichotomous thinking, etc.) are described and participants practice positive ways of reframing them. To reduce stress and change eating in response to emotions, relaxation techniques are presented and distraction and increased participation in pleasurable (non-eating) activities are encouraged. This approach is sometimes described as &#x0201c;change-focused&#x0201d; because modifying negative thoughts and emotions is assumed to thereby change associated maladaptive behaviors.</p><p>In contrast, the ABBI intervention teaches acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based techniques to address negative thoughts, emotions, and food cravings (Hayes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2012</xref>; Lillis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2014</xref>). These techniques are taught individually (each of 3 components is taught in 2 sessions for a total of 6 sessions) and then integrated into the treatment overall. Experiential methods are utilized, where participants are presented key metaphors and engage in activities designed to illustrate key points.</p><p>Acceptance strategies are introduced by demonstrating through experiential exercises that efforts to control or avoid internal experiences have not been successful and are actually linked with unsuccessful weight control behaviors. For example, emotional eating is discussed as a way to reduce stress or sadness in the short-term, at the expense of more stress and sadness, reduced health, and possibly increased weight over the medium to long-term. Efforts to control unwanted feelings right now can often create more negative feelings and behavioral outcomes later. This is referred to as the cost of avoidance, or non-acceptance, of emotions. Alternatively, mindful acceptance is taught in relation to unwanted emotions and food cravings. A variety of exercises are used to expose participants to unwanted physiological and emotional states (through guided imagery and the presentation of desired foods), and then distress tolerance skills, such as urge surfing, are taught in vivo with unwanted emotions or cravings present.</p><p>Mindfulness techniques help participants increase awareness of their thoughts and feelings. One particular form of mindfulness emphasized in ABBI is cognitive defusion, which aims to help participants distance themselves from unhelpful thoughts without trying to change or get rid of them. The primary goal of defusion work is to de-couple problematic thoughts from unhealthy behavior. Participants are taught many strategies that include increased awareness of thoughts through meditation, thought labeling (e.g., &#x0201c;self-sabotaging&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;judgment&#x0201d;), guided imagery (e.g., imaging thoughts as leaves on a stream), thought exposure (repeating a problematic thought over and over), and metaphor (e.g., imagining your mind as a &#x0201c;bad motivational speaker&#x0201d;).</p><p>Values work helps participants identify how weight-related behaviors fit with their core values. In this context, weight influencing behaviors are seen as supporting a broader picture of desired life actions that includes possibly being active, nourishing your body, setting a good example for family members, and increasing longevity to spend more time with loved ones. Goals support values by providing tangible markers along the way, such as losing 10 lb or exercising 5 times this week, however the goals are not presumed to have any meaning or importance outside the context of stated values. The connection of weight-influencing behaviors to core values is repeatedly emphasized and presumed to sustain motivation to persist over time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Treatment Fidelity</title><p>Detailed patient and counselor manuals are used for all group sessions and all treatment staff are required to carefully read and review these manuals prior to session. Weekly supervision sessions are conducted with current interventionists and led by a co-investigator. In addition, all treatment sessions are audio-taped and a random set of 20&#x000a0;% are coded based on a standardized treatment fidelity rating form that was designed to (1) assure that core treatment elements were presented, and, (2) detect contamination of distinct intervention methods (e.g., acceptance strategies being used in the SBT condition).</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Sample Size Considerations</title><p>The primary outcome of the current study is weight loss over the 18&#x000a0;months in ABBI versus SBT, As we expect the variability in weight changes between individuals to be the largest at the 18-month assessment (and thus, result in larger standard deviations around mean weight losses at that time point), we conducted our power analyses to detect differences in weight loss between ABBI and SBT at Month 18. Power analyses were completed using linear mixed effects models (similar to the proposed main model) on 10,000 simulated datasets (simulations based on data from our previous pilot work). The proposed sample of 160 (n per group of 80) has 89&#x000a0;% power for the primary model to detect differences over time of 2.4&#x000a0;kg at 6&#x000a0;months, 3.0&#x000a0;kg at 12&#x000a0;months, and 3.6&#x000a0;kg at 18&#x000a0;months (the power for follow-up analyses detecting between-group differences each individual time point was found to be 93&#x000a0;% at 6&#x000a0;months, 85&#x000a0;% at 12&#x000a0;months, and 83&#x000a0;% at 18&#x000a0;months).

We will further assess whether participants in the ABBI group, compared to participants in the SBT group, have better adherence to the program (assessed by session attendance) and larger changes in caloric intake/physical activity through use of generalized linear mixed models. Finally, if these between-group differences are confirmed, we will examine the extent to which changes in acceptance variables mediate differences in weight loss between the two study arms. Specifically, we will determine whether changes in acceptance from baseline to 3, 9, and 12&#x000a0;months mediate differences in weight loss between the ABBI and SBT groups at 6, 12, and 18&#x000a0;months, respectively, using a multivariate mediation model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Assessment of Safety</title><p>The current protocol is approved by The Miriam Hospital Institutional Review Board (TMH IRB).

The physical activity recommendation is for moderate-intensity activities with only gradual increases in the amount of physical activity.</p><p>A detailed safety monitoring plan, including oversight from two external safety officers experienced with large weight management trials, has been created for the current study.
