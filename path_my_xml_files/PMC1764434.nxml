<bold>Background:</bold> Chloroquine (CQ) is a drug that has been widely used for over 40 years for the treatment and prevention of malaria. It is cheap, safe, and, except in areas where resistant malaria parasites exist, effective. However, the spread of resistant malaria parasites in most malarial regions of the world has meant that this drug, and many others, can no longer be relied upon to control disease. New drug candidates are therefore needed, and ideally should be cheap to produce as well as safe and effective. Some research groups are working on potential drug candidates from the aminoquinoline family of compounds, which includes chloroquine. One candidate, AQ-13 (aminoquinoline-13) has already been studied in animal and in vitro experiments, and seemed to be a good candidate for further testing in humans. Therefore, as the first stage in evaluating AQ-13 further, this group of researchers carried out a Phase I trial in healthy humans. The researchers specifically wanted to compare how often people given AQ-13, as compared to those given CQ, had side effects, and to find out how AQ-13 is handled in the body (i.e., how quickly the compound is taken into the bloodstream, gets broken down, and how it affects normal body functions). These sorts of studies do not tell researchers anything about the efficacy of the drug in treating malaria, but the results are absolutely essential before trials can be done that do test efficacy in people with malaria. 126 healthy volunteers were recruited into the study, and each received capsules containing a different dosage of either AQ-13 or CQ. Side effects data were collected for four weeks after the drugs were given.</p><p>
<bold>What this trial shows:</bold> The most common side effects experienced by volunteers in the trial were headache, light-headedness, dizziness, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Overall, the frequencies of such events were roughly similar among people receiving AQ-13 and those receiving CQ, but due to the small numbers of participants in the trial, it is not possible to say whether any observed differences in frequency of side effects between the two groups are meaningful or not. The data collected in this trial also showed that both AQ-13 and CQ were absorbed into the bloodstream in a similar way, but AQ-13 was absorbed more slowly than CQ. On ECG testing, both compounds increased the QT interval (part of the heart's electrical cycle, and used as a measure of heart function), particularly at high dosage levels, and volunteers given CQ experienced a greater increase in QT interval than those receiving AQ-13. No volunteers experienced any symptoms related to heart function. The researchers concluded that on the basis of these data, AQ-13 could proceed to further trials to evaluate the drug's efficacy in treating clinical malaria.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> The trial was appropriately designed as a randomized controlled Phase I study, allowing the researchers to assess safety and physiological outcomes after giving AQ-13 as compared to an existing and widely used drug, CQ. A key limitation inherent to such studies is the small number of participants studied. This means that the study cannot prove that AQ-13 is safe, or even as safe as CQ, but rather simply that the findings do not raise immediate safety concerns.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> Data from animal experiments suggest that AQ-13 could potentially be a safe and effective antimalarial compound. The results reported here provide crucial safety data from the first study known to this research group that evaluates the effects of AQ-13 in humans.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Mzayek F, Deng H, Mather FJ, Wasilevich EC, Liu H, et al.

Subsequently, we have shown that these AQs are as safe as CQ in mice and monkeys (Cogswell, et al., unpublished data), and are active in two monkey models of human malaria (<named-content content-type="genus-species">P. cynomolgi</named-content> in rhesus monkeys [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], which is a model of <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. vivax</named-content> infection in humans, and CQ-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> in squirrel monkeys [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which is a model of human CQ-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> infection). The next step was to conduct a Phase I randomized clinical trial (RCT) to determine the safety and the pharmacokinetic behavior of the lead compound, AQ-13, in healthy volunteers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0020006-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pctr-0020006-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Phase 1 Randomized Clinical Trial of AQ-13 in Comparison with CQ</title><p>Designed as a series of double-blind RCTs at incremental oral doses of 10, 100, 300, 600, and 1,500 mg, with a 700 mg adjustment dose after 600 mg to ensure similar bioavailability for AQ-13 and CQ at the 1,500/1,750 mg dose (based on the area under the curve, AUC<sub>&#x003c4;</sub>, in h &#x000d7; &#x003bc;M, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0020006-g003">Figure 3</xref>). *AQ-13 dosages: 700 + 700 + 350 mg on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively; CQ dosages: 600 + 600 + 300 mg on days 1, 2, and 3, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0020006.g001"/></fig><fig id="pctr-0020006-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Structures of AQ-13, CQ, and Their Metabolites</title><p>Two-dimensional structures are presented.

Based on these criteria, three AQs (AQ-13, AQ-21, and AQ-34) each could have been the initial lead compound. However, AQ-34, which has an isopropyl side chain, was dropped from consideration because the chiral center on its side chain resulted in two enantiomers. Because an additional (optical) purification would have been required to separate those enantiomers, the cost of pure AQ-34 would have been greater than that of AQ-13 or AQ-21. In addition, further studies would have been required to compare the activities and toxicities of the two enantiomers. Between AQ-13 and AQ-21 (which have linear propyl and ethyl side chains), AQ-13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0020006-g002">Figure 2</xref>) was chosen as the lead compound because it was more active in monkey models of human malaria (Cogswell, et al., unpublished data).</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Preclinical Studies of AQ-13 in Comparison with CQ</title><p>After AQ-13 had been selected as the initial lead compound, preclinical studies were performed to examine its toxicology and pharmacokinetics in animals in comparison with CQ [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].

The rationale of that application was that an AQ active against CQ-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> that was as safe and economical as CQ would be a major advance: because the few drugs effective against CQ-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> are too expensive for use by the impoverished residents of malaria-endemic countries [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], because malaria parasites are already developing resistance to the expensive antimalarials now in use [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and because there are unresolved concerns about the safety of the antimalarials now used to treat CQ-resistant <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Based on this information, the Phase I clinical trial reported here was performed as a series of RCTs to determine whether there were significant differences in toxicity (safety) or pharmacokinetics between AQ-13 and CQ in human volunteers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy volunteers from 21 to 45 years of age were invited to participate in these studies.

AQ-13 was produced as the dihydrochloride, trihydrate salt under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions by Starks Associates (Buffalo, New York, United States) and CQ as the phosphate salt by Sanofi-Winthrop (New York, New York, United States). Using this GMP material, University Pharmaceuticals (Baltimore, Maryland, United States) and SRI International (Menlo Park, California, United States) produced color-coded capsules containing equal molar doses of AQ-13 and CQ.

A noncompartmental model with extravascular input was chosen because it required fewer assumptions and because it better described the blood-concentration data [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Partial areas under the curve (partial AUCs) were calculated using the linear trapezoidal method up to the last blood concentration; total AUCs were then estimated by adding the extrapolated AUC from the last measurement to infinity [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Because the near-horizontal terminal slopes of the concentration&#x02013;time data made the estimates of the extrapolated part of the area under the curve less reliable, oral clearance (Cl/F) was calculated from the formula (Cl/F = dose/AUC<sub>obs</sub>), where AUC<sub>obs</sub> is the partial AUC based on the empirically observed data (for 4 wk). The multiple-dose model for the 1,500/1,750 mg therapeutic doses was derived using the nonparametric superposition method [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. MRT was estimated using the statistical moments approach: (MRT = AUMC/AUC), where AUMC is the area under the first-moment concentration-time curve. Renal clearance (Cl<sub>r</sub>) was estimated from the means of the renal clearances for the three 24-h urine samples collected on days 1&#x02013;3 after dosing, using the formula (Cl<sub>r</sub> = X/pAUC) where X is the amount of the compound excreted in the urine, and pAUC is the partial blood AUC for the day of the urine sample.

Second, current expectations of the FDA and the public are markedly different today from the 1940s when CQ was first approved for clinical use [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

In terms of the upcoming Phase II studies of AQ-13 in Mali (West Africa), it is helpful that 37% (46/126) of the participants in Phase I were African or African American. The participation of these Africans and African Americans makes it less likely that the Phase II studies in Africa will identify new frequent AEs with AQ-13.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Adverse Events</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>AEs during the GCRC inpatient stay.</title><p>Headache, lightheadedness, and GI tract AEs were reported most frequently; they occurred at similar frequencies with AQ-13 and CQ, and are known side effects of CQ [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

However, the similar t<sub>1/2</sub> values and MRTs of AQ-72 and AQ-13 are inconsistent with the lower Cl<sub>r</sub> of AQ-72; these findings suggest that another pathway, such as metabolism of AQ-72 to AQ-73 by the CYP450 system, may account for this difference. The greater urinary excretion of AQ-13 and CQ than their more water-soluble metabolites (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020006-t004">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020006-t005">5</xref>) [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] is consistent with the active transport of CQ, and possibly AQ-13, by organic cation transporters such as organic cation transporter-like 2 (ORCTL2) [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

The results reported here confirm those observations, and establish the dose (blood-level)-related nature of QTc prolongation by CQ. At the 600 mg dose, CQ prolonged the mean QTc interval by 15 ms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pctr-0020006-t006">Table 6</xref>).

This discrepancy could be due to the known increased vulnerability of women to drug-induced QTc interval prolongation [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], which caused this effect to appear in them at doses lower than in men; alternatively, this could be a chance finding because of the small sample sizes involved. These results establish that AQ-13, like CQ, prolongs the QTc interval in humans and that CQ produces greater QTc prolongation than AQ-13. However, the significance of these observations is unclear because no arrhythmias or other cardiac AEs were observed in any participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Generalizability</title><p>The results reported here suggest that the AEs of AQ-13 may be no different from those of CQ, that higher doses of AQ-13 than CQ may be necessary to produce similar blood levels and AUCs, and that AQ-13 may produce less QT prolongation than CQ in humans. However, given the small numbers and nonrepresentative selection of study participants, the extent to which these results are generalizable is unclear.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>The results reported here are consistent with the hypotheses underlying the objectives of these studies. First, the similar AEs observed with AQ-13 and CQ are consistent with the hypothesis that AQs with structures similar to CQ should be similarly safe in humans. Second, they demonstrate that AQ-13, an AQ analogous to CQ, has similar linear pharmacokinetics in human volunteers, despite the fact that it requires a larger dose to achieve equivalent drug exposure because of a more rapid clearance. These results are also consistent with the preclinical studies, which suggested that the AEs of AQ-13 and CQ would be similar and that a dose adjustment would be necessary for AQ-13 because of its more rapid clearance [<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020006-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Because this Phase I study has demonstrated the safety of AQ-13 doses up to 1,750 mg, the next logical study (after examining the effects of a fatty meal on the absorption of AQ-13) is a dose-finding efficacy (Phase 2) study in humans with uncomplicated <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content> malaria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(65 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(32 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd003"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S1</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the Abstract into Arabic by Fawaz Mzayek</p><p>(27 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd004"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S2</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd004.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the Abstract into Chinese by Haiyan Deng</p><p>(88 KB PDF)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd005"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S3</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the Abstract into French by Ousmane Koita and Fawaz Mzayek</p><p>(28 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd006"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S4</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the Abstract into German by Christiane Hadi</p><p>(32 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd007"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S5</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd007.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the Abstract into Japanese by Kaori and Hitosi Tanaka</p><p>(85 KB PDF)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd008"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S6</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd008.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the Abstract into Russian by Maya Begalieva</p><p>(31 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020006-sd009"><label>Alternative Language Abstract S7</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020006.sd009.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p> Translation of the Abstract into Spanish by Juan Lertora</p><p>(22 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge and thank the volunteers who participated in this study for their contributions.

<bold>Author Contributions</bold> Biostatistical issues, including randomization, study design, and power calculations were directed wholly or in part by FM and FJM. FM and ECW assisted with volunteer recruitment and coordination and data management. Determinations of drug concentrations in blood and urine were performed by HD using an HPLC assay she developed for this purpose. Identification of the structures of AQ-13 and CQ metabolites was performed by HL. Volunteer screening, enrollment, and examination during the inpatient studies and outpatient follow-ups were performed by a number of physicians, with major contributions from CH, DHC, and HAM. Review of ECGs and Holter recordings for screening and drug toxicity were performed by two cardiologists, BHM for the 600, 700 and 1,500/1,750 mg doses, and ANT for the 10, 100 and 300 mg doses. Holter recording analyses were performed by FM. Expertise in clinical trials based on the HIV experience and on human study participant issues was provided by DMM. Pharmacokinetic calculations using the WinNonlin software were performed by FM with the aid of AWD. Expertise in clinical pharmacokinetics was provided by JJLL. General oversight was provided by the principal investigator, DJK.</p></fn><fn id="n101" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
