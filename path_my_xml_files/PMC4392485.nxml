Open posterior preperitoneal approach gives results far superior to those of the anterior approach. Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair is an evolving technique associated with advantages of a minimally invasive approach. The present work aimed at comparing these three approaches for repair of recurrent inguinal hernia regarding complications and early recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS:</title><p>A total of 180 patients were divided randomly into three equal groups: A, B, and C. Group A patients were subjected to open posterior preperitoneal approach , those of group B were subjected to transinguinal anterior tension-free repair and group C patients were subjected to TAPP. The primary end point was recurrence and the secondary end points were time off from work, postoperative pain, scrotal swelling, and wound infections.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS:</title><p>The mean hospital stay, the mean time to return to work and the mean time off from work were less in group C then A and B. Chronic postoperative pain was observed in eight patients in group A (13.33%), in 18 patients in group B (30%) and six patients in group C (10%). The overall complication rate was 19.7% in both groups A and C and 34.36% in group B.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSION:</title><p>In recurrent inguinal hernia, the laparoscopic and open posterior approaches are equally effective in term of operative outcome. The open preperitoneal hernia repair is inexpensive, has a low recurrence rate. Postoperative recovery is short and postoperative pain is minimal. This approach gives results far superior to those of the commonly used anterior approach. However, while laparoscopic hernia repair requires a lengthy learning curve and is difficult to learn and perform, it has advantages of less post-operative pain, early recovery with minimal hospital stay, low post-operative complications and recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ACTRN12613001050741</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Open preperitoneal</kwd><kwd>recurrent hernia</kwd><kwd>TAPP</kwd><kwd>transinguinal approach</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inguinal herniorrhaphy remains one of the most common general surgical operations, with approximately 15% performed for recurrence and there is little available evidence on the optimal management of recurrent inguinal hernia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The repair of the resulting recurrent hernia is a daunting task because of already weakened tissues and obscured and distorted anatomy and therefore failure rate of these repairs using an open anterior approach may reach as high as 36%.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In 1988, Nyhus stated that the evolution of the posterior preperitoneal approach for recurrent inguinal hernia repair made it the procedure of choice for the management of all recurrent groin hernias.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In previous published data, the author reported that posterior preperitoneal approach gives results far superior to those of the commonly used anterior approach.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) inguinal hernia repair is an evolving technique associated with the well-known advantages of a minimally invasive approach.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] A recent study stated that for the treatment of recurrent inguinal hernias, the first choice should be given to the laparoscopic method, especially for young, physically active, non-obese patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Some researchers advised that greater efforts should be undertaken to make laparoscopic repair easier, safer, and less expensive.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The present work aimed at comparing three approaches in repair of recurrent inguinal hernia: anterior inguinal approach, open properitoneal repair and transabdominal pro-peritoneal repair regarding complications and early recurrence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Materials</title><p>Patients in this study were divided randomly into three main groups: A, B, and C.

The preperitoneal space was cleaved with blunt dissection, exposing the myopectineal orifice. The cord was explored and the hernias were reduced. A 15 &#x000d7;15 cm<sup>2</sup> polypropylene mesh with a slit was inserted in the preperitoneal space and fixed with non-absorbable sutures to pubic tubercle and Cooper's ligament.

</p><p>The hernia defect was inspected. The properitoneal space was dissected from lateral to medial at the level of the retroinguinal (Bogros') space, with parietalization of the spermatic cord posteriorly and outwards. The dissection was continued medially toward the retropubic space, extending behind the symphysis pubis and iliopubic tract, exposing the pectineal ligament. The peritoneum forming the hernia sac was pulled in, separating it from the cord structures. A 15 &#x000d7; 10 cm<sup>2</sup> sheet of polypropylene mesh was placed so as to cover the Hesselbach's triangle, the indirect space, and the femoral ring areas. The mesh was fixed using an endoscopic multifire hernia stapler (Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson), beginning at the pubic tubercle and proceeding laterally. The peritoneum is tightly closed using 3/0 running vicryl suture. The trocars are removed under direct vision, and the peritoneum is deflated. The fascia at the two 10/12 mm port site is closed using 2-0 Prolene sutures.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>End Points</title><p>The primary end point of the study was the recurrence of the hernia, defined as a clinically detectable characteristic swelling in the groin and diagnosed by two authors.

Regarding the postoperative pain, we considered the Visual Analog Scale pain score, prosthesis awareness and return to normal physical activity.

It would be technically simple to perform and easy to learn, would have a low rate of complications and recurrence, and would require only a short period of convalescence.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] However, the most effective method in any given patient is not clearly defined and consequently surgery for recurrent inguinal hernia after mesh repair is usually a difficult operation due to the disadvantage of re-operating through dense fibrotic scar tissue around the mesh with the risk of testicular damage and a large number of local hematoma.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>To avoid the disadvantage of re-operating through scar tissue and dense fibrotic scar tissue around the mesh, the open posterior preperitoneal mesh repair was popularized by Nyhus[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] as a good alternative for recurrent inguinal hernias. In previous study, Saber and co-workers <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> reported that open preperitoneal hernia repair offers many advantages over the transinguinal repair for recurrent hernia. This approach gives results far superior to those of the commonly used anterior approach. Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) procedure generally is accepted for the repair of primary and recurrent hernias that follow conventional transinguinal repair.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, we found that the time of hospital stay and sick leaves and accordingly the time off from work all were reduced in patients with open posterior preperitoneal approach and TAPP compared with the anterior approach and the difference was statistically significant. Many studies of same interest reported less hospital stay and rapid return to physical activity.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Chronic postoperative pain is strongly related to two main patient-related factors; age and body mass index or three surgery &#x000be; related factors such as surgery for recurrence with anterior approach, operations performed in specialist hernia centers, and finally the experience of the surgeon.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The total laparoscopic preperitoneal (TAPP) and then the open preperitoneal approach in the present study significantly reduced the final chronic pain score per patient in comparison with the anterior transinguinal approach and our data came in concordance with studies of same interest.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>],<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,[12 ]</sup></p><p>There are many studies traced patient age in relation to occurrence chronic pain and found that the risk of chronic pain decreased with increasing age.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Our data regarding this point came in concordance with these reports.

This study showed that TAPP improved clinical outcomes compared with OHR.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</p><p>Testicular dysfunction, atrophy and necrosis as a result of ischemic orchitis is a well-known complication after anterior inguinal hernia repair with 1% occurrence following primary herniorrhaphy and 5% in recurrent cases[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] but in open preperitoneal repair, the procedure is safe as it effectively eliminates testicular complications.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Laparoscopic repair seems favorable in terms of better preservation of testicular functions. A significant decrease in testicular volume and less improvement in blood flow is seen after open repair where there is significant reduction in serum testosterone, follicle stimulating (FSH), and leutinizing (LH) hormones level.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</p><p>Testicular ischemia and necrosis are thought to be due to acute thrombosis of the pampiniform venous plexus rather than arterial injury, as there is collateral arterial flow to the testis from the inferior epigastric, vesical, prostatic, and scrotal arteries.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] Testicular atrophy is thought to be more common after open procedures particularly recurrent inguinal hernias due to greater manipulation of the spermatic cord beyond the pubic tubercle and during dissection of the distal hernia sac.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] According to these finding, we found that no testicular atrophy was seen in patients of both groups A and C but seen in two patients of group B (4.25%) due to operating within the fibrotic field with tissue reaction around the mesh.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In recurrent inguinal hernia, the laparoscopic and open posterior approaches are equally effective in term of operative outcome.

However, while laparoscopic hernia repair requires a lengthy learning curve and is difficult to learn and perform, it has advantages of less post-operative pain, early recovery with minimal hospital stay, low post-operative complications, and recurrence.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Saber</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ellabban</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Gad</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Elsayem</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Open preperitoneal versus anterior approach for recurrent inguinal hernia: A randomized study</article-title><source>BMC Surg</source><year>2012</year><volume>12</volume><fpage>22</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23110701</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Campanelli</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Pettinari</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Nicolosi</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>Cavalli</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Avesani</surname><given-names>EC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Inguinal hernia recurrence: Classification and approach</article-title><source>Hernia</source><year>2006</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>159</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16404490</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prins</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Koning</surname><given-names>GG</given-names></name><name><surname>Keus</surname><given-names>EF</given-names></name><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>PW</given-names></name><name><surname>Mollen</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name><name><surname>Akkersdijk</surname><given-names>WL</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial for anterior inguinal hernia repair: Transrectus sheath preperitoneal mesh repair compared to transinguinal preperitoneal procedure</article-title><source>Trials</source><year>2013</year><volume>3</volume><fpage>14:65</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Nyhus</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pollak</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Bombeck</surname><given-names>CT</given-names></name><name><surname>Donahue</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The preperitoneal approach and prosthetic buttress repair for recurrent hernia.
