However, deep carious lesions create conditions mandating endodontic treatment. It is indeed tedious to perform endodontic treatment in deciduous teeth due to complex root canal morphology, proximity of the developing successors superadded to difficulties related to behavior management in children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The successful outcome of endodontic treatment depends on through disinfection. Based on this concept, the ultimate goal of endodontic therapy is to eliminate or remarkably minimize the microbes and their toxic products from the root canal before obturation.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However the complex morphology of root canal system, invasion of microbes into the dentinal tubules, and formation of smear layer during instrumentation are the major obstacles in achieving complete cleaning and shaping of the root canals.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>The role of mechanical instrumentation alone in removing microbes from the root canals has been investigated in many studies, and majority of them have found a significant reduction in the microbial count with an increasing preparation size and irrigation[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, Peter and Wesselink[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] found that more than 35% of root canal walls remained untouched even by modern rotary Ni-Ti instrumentation techniques.</p><p>Adequate cleaning of the root canal system in deciduous teeth involves both the chemical and mechanical methods to avoid the overzealous and undesired removal of dentin. Mechanical instrumentation establishes a specific cavity form, creating easy access for the instruments and irrigating solutions into the root canal space. Irrigating solutions are mandated to eradicate the microorganisms, and a variety of chemicals have been used for this purpose over a period of time. The ideal irrigant kills the bacteria, dissolves necrotic tissue, lubricates the canal, removes the smear layer, and does not irritate healthy tissues.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Irrigants currently being advocated during cleaning and shaping in day-to-day clinical practice can be divided as antibacterial and decalcifying agents or their combinations. They include sodium hypochlorite; chlorhexidine; ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA); and a mixture of tetracycline, an acid, and a detergent. However, there is no unique irrigant that fulfills the properties of an ideal irrigant for deciduous or permanent dentition. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is the most commonly used endodontic irrigating solution in dilutions ranging from 0.5% to 5.25%. Advantages of NaOCl include its ability to dissolve organic substances in the root canal system and its affordability. However, its major disadvantages are cytotoxicity when accidently injected into periradicular tissues, foul smell and taste, ability to bleach clothes, and ability to corrode metal object.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Literature has documented various plant extracts having antimicrobial and therapeutic properties which can serve the purpose of endodontic irrigation. Morinda Citrifolia, commonly known as noni which is a tree in the coffee family, Rubiaceae. <italic>M. Citrifolia</italic> Juice (MCJ) has a broad range of therapeutic effects including antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antitumor, anthelmintic, analgesic, hypotensive, anti-inflammatory, and immune enhancing effects.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial reduction in deciduous molars using MCJ as irrigating solution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized comparative study conducted in patients who presented for routine endodontic therapy in the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry.

</p><p>The selected tooth samples were randomly divided into two groups of 30 for irrigation. Group I-1% NaOCl and Group II-MCJ. The desired concentration of irrigants was achieved by diluting them with distilled water.</p><p>Before starting the study, minimum inhibitory concentration of MCJ was performed using the broth dilution method.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent from legal guardian, local anesthesia was administered and the offending tooth was isolated using rubber dam. The endodontic field was swabbed using povidone-iodine for 3 min to eliminate surface contaminants and then washed with sterile saline solution, following which 5% sodium thiosulfate solution was used to inactivate the iodine tincture so that its remnants would not affect the process of microbial sampling.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Access opening was made using a round bur in high speed, de-roofing was done and coronal pulp removed. The canals were located and pulp tissue was extirpated from root canals using Barbed Broach following which the working length was established by the Ingle's radiographic method. Samples were collected from the palatal canal in the maxillary molars and distal canal in mandibular molars. The contents of the canal were absorbed into sterile paper points at the most apical extent of the canal for 60 s; the saturated paper points were deposited into 10 ml of thioglycollate broth for anaerobic culture.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] This preoperative sample (S1) was taken to confirm the presence of bacteria in the root canal system. The samples were labeled and transported to the microbiology laboratory within 15 min.</p><p>Chemico-mechanical preparation was done using stainless steel H&#x02013; files till size 30/35 followed by irrigation with 3 ml of one of the irrigants. Following cleaning, shaping, and irrigation, postoperative samples (S2) were collected following the same protocol as that for preoperative sample and transported to microbiology laboratory within 15 min.</p><p>For both the groups after final irrigation with normal saline, the canals were dried with absorbent paper points and obturated with zinc oxide eugenol by means of hand pluggers to push the paste just short of the apex. The coronal space was filled with Type II GIC cement.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Microbiological processing</title><p>The pre- and post-operative samples (paper points) placed in 10 ml of thioglycollate broth was vortexed in a vortex mixer (Eltek VM 301) for 1 min.

Serial dilution was carried out as follows.</p><p>A volume of 1 ml of transport medium containing sample was transferred to the vial containing 9 ml of sterile peptone water bringing in 10<sup>&#x02212;'2</sup> dilution. Then, 1 ml from this vial was transferred to the next vial containing 9 ml of sterile peptone water to make it a 10<sup>&#x02212;'3</sup> dilution. This procedure was continued in similar way up to 10<sup>&#x02212;'5</sup> dilution.</p><p>The blood agar plates were inoculated with 0.1 ml of undiluted sample (10 dilution) as well as each of the four dilutions with the help of sterile spreaders. For anaerobic samples, nutrient agar plates were kept in GasPak jar and incubated for up to 48 h. The growth was observed in each medium after respective incubation. The colonies were counted next day using microbial colony counter (HiMedia).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the collected group-wise data were entered and computed by statistical software SPSS version 16.

It has a broad antibacterial spectrum possessing even the ability to inactivate endotoxin and unlike other irrigants, it is effective at dissolving tissue and removing the organic component of the smear layer.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In day-to-day dental practice, it is used in dilutions ranging from 0.5% to 5.25%. Sirtes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] found the capacity of a1% NaOCl at 45&#x000b0;C to dissolve human dental pulps equal to that of a 5.25% solution at 20&#x000b0;C. Whereas, Zou <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found that temperature, time and concentration all contribute to the penetration of sodium hypochlorite into dentinal tubules. It is evident from the recent available facts that there is no justification for using NaOCl at concentrations higher than 1% as this achieves the desirable clinical effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Taking all these proved properties into consideration it was decided to use 1% NaOCl as a standard control group.</p><p>However, everything has its advantages and disadvantages. Although NaOCl has a wide spectrum of useful properties it has disadvantages too, including its caustic nature, tissue damage risks if NaOCl is expressed under pressure into the periodontal ligament space and also reduction in flexural strength of dentin.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Hence, there is always a quest for an alternative effective and easily available irrigant that fulfills all the criteria with minimal possible side effects.</p><p>Literature has shown that certain natural plant extracts have antimicrobial and therapeutic effects suggesting its possibility be used as an endodontic irrigant.</p><p><italic>M. Citrifolia</italic>, commonly known as Noni is a member of the coffee family, Rubiaceae having a broad range of therapeutic effects, including analgesic, hypotensive, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antitumor, antihelmintic, anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing effects. Antibacterial effect of MCJ is mainly attributed to the compounds L-asperuloside and alizarin.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Using MCJ as an endodontic irrigant might be advantageous because of its biocompatible, antioxidant, and nontoxic nature.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Considering the above-mentioned advantages, it was decided to use MCJ as the test group.</p><p>In this study, the minimum inhibitory concentration of MCJ on <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> growth <italic>in vitro</italic> was established to be a 7% solution. Thereafter, a 7% solution of MCJ diluted in distilled water was used in comparison with 1%NaOCl.</p><p>The tooth surface was disinfected using 5% povidone-iodine &#x02013; a simple effective method proven to be efficacious and widely used.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Grossman <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] advocated the use of sterile paper points for obtaining the root canal samples and advocated that 1&#x02013;10 microorganisms are optimum for obtaining growth through culture procedures. Whereas, Molander <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] pointed out the propagation of microorganisms throughout the entire root canals of deciduous teeth, including the lumen, accessory canals, and dentinal tubules; apical delta, apical foramen and periapical biofilm. Considering both these aspects, microbial samples were collected from the most difficult area to be cleaned, that is, the apical third of the canal absorbent paper points were used for collection of microbiological samples as it collects bacteria present only inside the canal and not from the dentinal tubules or deeper areas, thus reducing the chances of variability in quantity and type of microbial isolation from the root canal system.</p><p>In the current study, both the groups showed statistically significant reduction in the bacterial population on intragroup comparison, that is, preoperative mean CFU/ml counts Vs postoperative mean CFU/ml counts in each group using paired sample <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. Thus, it can be stated that a significant lower mean CFU counts at postoperative phase implies that both the study materials were potent in bacterial reduction. However, when overall mean cfu/ml between Group I and II was calculated using independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>] no significant difference in mean CFU per ml pre- and post-operative was obtained (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). The results are in accordance with Murray <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who demonstrated that efficacy of MCJ was similar to NaOCl in conjunction with EDTA Pandranki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] who assessed antimicrobial efficacy of the two Morinda species at different concentration against endodontic microorganisms following agar well-diffusion assay founded a statistically significant difference in the antimicrobial efficacy of <italic>M. citrifolia</italic> and <italic>Morinda tinctoria</italic> at different concentrations as compared to 3% NaOCl.</p><p>None of the protocols tested in this study showed 100% reduction of the microbes from root canal system.
