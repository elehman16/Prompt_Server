<bold>Background:</bold> Infertility is a stressful event that can give rise to psychological difficulties. Now, a wide range of psychosocial interventions for infertile couples has been developed.</p><p>
<bold>Objective: </bold>Purpose of this study was to determine the effect of group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to reduce stress, anxiety and depression of women undergoing assisted reproductive therapy (ART).</p><p>
<bold>Materials and Methods:</bold> This study was an experimental study (before and after study with control group) on infertile women who were referring to Gynecological clinics of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences to receive ART. 31 women who had criteria to enter the study were randomly divided into experimental group (n=15) and control group (n=16). The participants in the experimental group received 1 hour and 30 minute weekly session&#x02019;s group therapy in 15 week as intervention. For gathering data, depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS) normalized Persian version and Ahvaz Hardiness Test (AHT) were used to assess psychological distress and psychological hardiness in pre-posttest. </p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> There were significant differences in mean score of infertile psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and stress in experimental group pretest with posttest. Furthermore, the results indicated that there were significant differences between hardiness in two groups. The experimental group had higher scores in hardiness than control group (p=0.001).</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion:</bold> It seems to be, that group therapy interventions, specially, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be useful and applicable to women who receiving ART.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd><italic>Assisted reproductive therapy</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Cognitive behavioral therapy</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Mental health</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Iranian women</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Hardiness</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility is failure to conceive after 1 year of regular unprotected intercourse (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Demographers tend to define infertility as childlessness in a population of women of reproductive age, while the epidemiological definition is based on &#x02018;trying for&#x02019; or &#x02018;time to&#x02019; a pregnancy, generally in a population of women exposed to the risk of conception (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). </p><p>Gurunath, Pandian, Anderson and Bhattacharya in their research results that &#x0201c;Based on these estimates and on the current world population, 72.4 million women are currently infertile; of these, 40.5 million are currently seeking infertility medical care&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In Iran the prevalence of Infertility among during years was indicted the increasing trend. For example Safarinejad research revealed that &#x0201c;the primary infertility increased significantly from 2.6 to 4.3 to 5.5% for the 1985-1989, 1990-1994 and 1995-2000 marriage cohorts. The prevalence of secondary infertility was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.4-5.1)&#x0201d;. In general, the studies indicated that the prevalence of infertility was raised in the Southern counties than in the Northern countries (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Infertility is a stressful event that can give rise to psychological difficulties. (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) Increases feelings of anxiety, guilt, somatization and depression (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>The women who suffer infertility experienced high level of depression, low self-esteem and sexual problems. Even though, the women who under treatment of infertility, when they faced the fail of treatment, the all of hope of recovery was despair immediately (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). These psychological distresses can suffer the ouples. The infertility can be negative impact on self-esteem, the image of their femininity or musicality, and social relationship with the others on couples (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). </p><p>Also depressive and anxiety disorders were highly prevalent among women who visited an assisted reproduction unit (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Hardiness is defined as a constellation of attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral tendencies that consist of three components: commitment, control, and challenge (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Hardiness is a constellation of personality characteristics that serves as a resistance resource, when encountering stressful situations. Three basic components comprise hardiness: challenge, which is the perception of change as normal and natural, as well as an opportunity for personal growth; commitment, which is a sense of purpose or meaningfulness in one&#x02019;s life and a strong involvement in directing one&#x02019;s life course; and control, which is the belief that one is capable of impacting one&#x02019;s life circumstances (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Many evidences suggest that hardiness positively influences perceptions of stressful life events. In addition, hardiness has a beneficial relationship to self-ratings of physical health and physical symptoms, as well as to depression, anxiety and mental health (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). So far, a wide range of psychosocial interventions for infertile couples has been developed. The suggestion program, which is based on behavioral therapy, cognitive restructuring, emotional self-care, and group support, found to be efficacious in the treatment of the emotional aspects of infertility (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The goal of this study was to compare the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy on the mental health and hardiness among infertile women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>
<bold>Participants</bold>
</p><p>The research method of this project was experiment study (before and after with control group) on 800 infertile women who were referring to Gynecological Clinics of Jahrom University of Medical Sciences to receive ART. The research was implemented by randomized controlled clinical trial. Sampling was from 70 women referred to clinic. All of the participants who had 2-7 years unknown infertility history with no somatic and psychiatric diseases, were Jahrom residents, between 20-35 years of age, and interested to participate in regular group meetings were selected for research. Some of participants announced that they had not time or interest to participating in research. Also, some of them were not proper to participating in study.</p><p>After unification, and selection, only 31 women cooperated to enter the research, which randomly divided into two groups of experimental and control groups. The experiment group (16 women) received 15 sessions of 1 hour and 30 minute weekly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) by group therapy in 4 months. The details of sampling process were indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><p>The contents of sessions were stress management, negative thought blocking techniques, relaxation therapy and biofeedback, as a behavioral experiments and cognitive approach components entitle cognitive restructuring (It involves recognizing distorted or negative thinking and learning to replace it with more realistic), positive thoughts or beliefs, communication and problem-solving techniques to facilitate expression of emotions and needs and resolution of the infertility crisis, and improving the couple's sexual relationship.</p><p>

<bold>Measurement</bold>
</p><p>For gathering data the DASS test was used. This test was the short-form Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21), which served as the reference standard. The DASS-21 is a 21-item instrument designed to measure the 3 negative affective states of depression, anxiety, and stress. </p><p>In this research, researchers applied the cutoff scores suggested by Lovibond and Lovi-bond. They were reported that &#x0201c;the psychometric properties of the DASS have been extensively evaluated, and there is evidence for the convergent and discriminative validity of data obtained with the instrument&#x0201d; (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). For measuring level of hardiness Ahvaz Hardiness Inventory with 27 questionnaires in 4 point (never to always), were used. Ahvaz hardiness scale is a self-report paper-pencil questionnaire, which is 27 items for measuring personality hardiness. Subjects have one of four options: "never," "rarely," "sometimes", "often&#x0201d;, scoring values are 0, 1, 2, 3, and score range of 0-81. Obtaining a high score on this questionnaire indicate that the person is in psychological hardiness. Cronbach's alpha coefficient has demonstrated for the total hardiness measure for the commitment (0.84), female (0.85), and male (0.84), similar internal consistency coefficients are seen with other samples (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). </p><p>
<bold>Statistical analysis</bold>
</p><p>After collecting data in two groups, descriptive statistics used to evaluate distribution of data and analytical statistics such as student t-test for differences between pretest-posttest in two groups and paired t-test for differences pretest-posttest in each groups using SPSS 18 software. The p-value was determined for research (p&#x0003c;0.5). </p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The process of selection of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ijrm-10-483-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The age range of samples were 20-25 years (9.67%), 26-31 years (77.42%) and 31-35 years (12.95%). 9.67% of them were employed and the other were housewives (90.33%). 12.91% had a bachelor's degree, 70.96% of them graduate from high school and 16.13% of others had primary to medium school education. </p><p>Results showed that there was significant differences between DASS test in level of stress (p=0.000), anxiety (p=0.001) and depression (0.007) in treatment group pretest with posttest.

Upon termination of psychotherapy, a reduction of depressive symptoms in patients was greater after 6 months. Psychotherapy accompanying IVF treatment yielded similar conception success rates to psychological interventions administered to patients not in specific medical care (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>This study confirms our results about effectively of CBT to decrease psychological distress and usefulness of this program on infertile mental health and coping with stressful life events. Other reports have also demonstrated that psychiatric and counseling interventions (behavioral, cognitive, psychotherapy) actively changes in marital communication and in communication in different social arenas.
