Aprosthesis that covers and is partially supported by natural teeth, natural tooth roots and or dental implant is called also overlay denture, overlay prosthesis, and superimposed prosthesis.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Overdentures supported by implants were the development of well-researched implant systems, providing a predictable success rate that made such restoration feasible. Recently, new one-piece implant design has been fabricated and consequently the implant surgical technique has been changed into one-stage technique with its benefits for the patients and either immediate or progressive loading protocols were used for prosthetic appliances.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>It is conceivable that implant materials, which are chosen because of their &#x0201c;friendliness&#x0201d; to tissue cells, offer particularly favorable grounds for bacterial adhesion and availability of &#x0201c;cell-friendly&#x0201d; surfaces for microbial colonization. Adhesion-mediated infections developing on implanted biomaterials respond poorly to antimicrobial treatment and often require that the device be removed.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Dental implants, however, can be designed in such a way that the surfaces on which bacterial colonization occurs may be reached from the exterior. Thus, in contrast to internal implants, there is a possibility for control of bacterial colonization on exposed surfaces and a potential for treatment of infectious conditions of peri-implant tissues.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>In a study, it was found that the microflora associated with stable osseointegrated implants serving successfully as abutments for overdentures was investigated, and 50% of the organisms cultured were facultatively anaerobic <italic>cocci, Staphylococci</italic>, and the rest were facultatively anaerobic rods. Repeated microbiological and clinical data were collected along 5 years after implantation. No significant time trends were noted. Separate samples taken within the same patient from different sites showed a similar composition of the microflora.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>The role of microorganisms in the development of peri-implant pathology has also been investigated in animals. Differences in the presence of putative periodontal pathogens on titanium implants and teeth were determined in animals in experimental gingivitis and in peri-implantitis/periodontitis situation. Similar colonization patterns were seen on implants and teeth.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Ten completely edentulous male patients with age ranged from 50 to 60 years were selected from the outpatient clinic, Prosthodontics Department, Faculty of Dentistry October 6 University. Consent forms were signed by all patients selected for this work before the treatment.
