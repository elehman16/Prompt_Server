The rate of cesarean section in our country is three times more than the global standard. As one of the responsibilities of the nurse is patient's advocacy, s/he should support them. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-warmed intravenous fluids on prevention of hypothermia during general anesthesia in cesarean section.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Sixty-two women undergoing elective cesarean section by general anesthesia were randomly allocated in two groups of intervention and control.

This phenomenon is one of the postoperative outcomes that can be caused by heat loss due to exposure to cold weather, thermoregulation mechanism disorders and, consequently, vasodilatation and loss of muscle tone as a result of anesthetics or local anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Core body temperature ranges from 36.5&#x000b0;C to 37.5&#x000b0;C.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Body temperature reduction and, consequently, chills lead to an increase in heart rate, and catecholamine release, vasoconstriction, lower circulation, and metabolic acidosis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>There are numerous risk factors in relation with development of intraoperative hypothermia, including aging, female gender, depth of anesthesia, type of surgery, length of anesthesia, operating room (OR) temperature, patient's low weight, and history of chronic diseases and cool fluids&#x02019; infusion.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Postoperative chills can be unpleasant and distressful, cause complications for the patients, and may lead to worsening of their postoperative pain, such that some patients indicate it as their worst hospitalization experience. Prevalence of postoperative chills has been reported to be about 40%.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This rate has been reported as 6.3-66% for the patients receiving general anesthesia and as an average of 56.7%,[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] ranging from 40% to 60%, for the patients receiving spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Prevention of hypothermia is an absolute way of preventing the postoperative chills in response to hyperthermia.</p><p>Intraoperative hypothermia can be reduced by the methods which reduce skin heat emission to the environment because of a cold OR, surgery incision evaporation, and by prevention of intravenous infusion of cold fluids. Other non-medical methods employed in various studies include warming and humidifying the air way,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] warming the skin through warm covers,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] application of patient warming system through water circulation and forced air warming system,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and infusion of warm fluids.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Among the above-mentioned strategies to prevent hypothermia, warming intravenous fluids to preserve patient's body temperature in the OR can be conveniently applied, as intravenous warm fluids are available in all ORs in Iran.</p><p>One of the surgeries performed at a high rate is cesarean section (CS).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Exposure of these patients to anesthesia for CS leads to more temperature reduction because of the effect of anesthetics on vascular and body thermoregulation mechanisms, abdominal vast incisions, and wetting surgical covers with blood and amniotic fluid. Various studies reported controversial results in relation to application of non-medical methods in the prevention of hypothermia among the mothers undergoing CS.</p><p>Chung <italic>et al</italic>. (2012) in their study on the effect of warming of patients and infusion of pre-warmed fluids in CS on the prevention of hypothermia and postoperative chills showed that core temperature was higher in the study groups (infusion of warm fluids and forced air warming system) compared to the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.004). Incidence of chills was also lower in the study groups compared to the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.035). They concluded that forced air warming system and infusion of pre-warmed intravenous fluids prevented patients&#x02019; postoperative chills.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>On the contrary, Butwick <italic>et al</italic>. (2007) in a study on 30 healthy mothers who had undergone elective CS with spinal anesthesia divided into two groups of compressed air and conventional OR air conditioning showed that core temperature changes were similar in the two groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.8), and concluded that application of forced air warming system could not prevent hypothermia among the women who had undergone CS.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>As patients&#x02019; support is one of the main duties of nurses, anesthesia nurses are responsible for this important issue.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] It is essential to find preventive strategies for intraoperative hypothermia in mothers undergoing CS. Therefore, this study aimed to apply an appropriate, cost-effective, complication-free and available method of warming intravenous fluids to prevent hypothermia during CS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 62 mothers selected as candidates for elective CS under general anesthesia in Shahid Beheshti hospital in Kashan from February to September 2010. The subjects were selected through purposive sampling, and the selection was based on the inclusion criteria. From 84 mothers who assessed for eligibility, 22 mothers excluded because of not meeting inclusion criteria (<italic>n</italic> = 16) or declined to participate (<italic>n</italic> = 8). The subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 62) were randomly assigned to study (receiving pre-warmed fluid, <italic>n</italic> = 31) and control (receiving room temperature fluid, <italic>n</italic> = 31) groups. Firstly, the goal and method of study were explained to the eligible subjects and written consents were obtained from them for ethical considerations.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were: Termination of pregnancy in 37-42 weeks of gestational age; undergoing surgery with general anesthesia; having a tracheal tube; surgery length less than 1 h; not receiving corticosteroids, non-steroidal sedatives, Mg sulfate, or anti-hypertension drugs; and lack of endocrine disorders, vascular diseases, pregnancy hypertension, fever, amniotic bag rupture, polyhydramnios, and oligohydramnios. The exclusion criteria were: Having received intraoperative blood transfusion, surgery length more than 1 h, receiving medications other than conventional medication, intraoperative hypotension due to any reason leading to infusion of more fluid than calculated, or therapeutic program changes.</p><p>The candidate mothers for CS received infusion of warmed Ringer's lactate at 37&#x000b0;C (kept in Bon Marry serological water bath for up to 24 h before surgery) in the study group and Ringer's lactate at room temperature (25.5&#x000b0;C) in the control group through angiocatheter No. 16, immediately after arrival at the OR and lying on the surgical bed. OR temperature and humidity were measured and recorded using tympanic infrared thermometer (beurer medical FT55, ULM, Germany) and humidity meter (TFA Dostman/Wertheim, Germany. OR temperature and humidity were identical in both study and control groups. The required amount of fluids was calculated based on length of fasting time, maintenance fluid, amount of bleeding and urine output, and length of surgery. Anesthesia device used for both the groups was Dragger Fabious (Moislinger Allee 53-55, Germany). After they were monitored and administered primary fluids, the subjects underwent pre-operative care. After pre-oxygenation, anesthesia was induced by administering Na thiopental (5 ml/kg), and succinylcoline (1 mg/kg) was administered to facilitate intubation. Anesthesia was continued by administering isoflurane at alveolar concentration of 0.6%, a mixture of oxygen 50% and nitrous oxide 50%, and with atracurium (0.2 mg/kg) continuing the muscle relaxation. After fetal delivery, the subjects received Fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg). Oxytocin (20 units/L) was infused to preserve the tone of uterus. BP, pulse, and arterial O<sub>2</sub> saturation of the subjects were measured and recorded using Saadat Monitoring device (Alborz-B model made in Iran) before and after the induction of anesthesia. Patients&#x02019; core temperature was measured and recorded using tympanic infrared thermometer at the tympana before and at 15-min intervals after the induction of anesthesia (a total of five times). After surgery, the effect of relaxants was neutralized by administering atropine (0.02 mg/kg) and neostigmine (0.04 mg/kg).</p><p>Data collection tool contained a questionnaire to record patients&#x02019; demographic information, a checklist for recording medications during anesthesia, and a checklist of the recorded intraoperative parameters. Validity of the information recording form was confirmed by content validity through references and guides of university professors. Reliability of the measurement tools was obtained by careful measurement and confirmation of their calibration and sensitivity. The devices were calibrated, while their specificity and sensitivity had been determined by the manufacturing company and the medical technologist engineer in the related hospital. The research coworkers filling the forms of data record and the subjects were blinded to the study to increase the validity of the data. After the data were collected, they were analyzed by <italic>t</italic>-test, Mann&#x02013;Whitney U test, Chi-square test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measurements through SPSS version 16.
