Basic life support training of school students is an international priority. The aim of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of a real-time training software (Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) compared to a standard instructor-based feedback for chest compressions acquisition in secondary school students. After an interactive frontal lesson about basic life support and high quality chest compressions, 144 students were randomized to two types of chest compressions training: 1) using Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (QCPR group&#x02013; 72 students) for real-time feedback during chest compressions with the guide of an instructor who considered software data for students&#x02019; correction 2) based on standard instructor-based feedback (SF group&#x02013; 72 students). Both groups had a minimum of a 2-minute chest compressions training session. Students were required to reach a minimum technical skill level before the evaluation. We evaluated all students at 7 days from the training with a 2-minute chest compressions session. The primary outcome was the compression score, which is an overall measure of chest compressions quality calculated by the software expressed as percentage. 125 students were present at the evaluation session (60 from QCPR group and 65 from SF group). Students in QCPR group had a significantly higher compression score (median 90%, IQR 81.9&#x02013;96.0) compared to SF group (median 67%, IQR 27.7&#x02013;87.5), p = 0.0003. Students in QCPR group performed significantly higher percentage of fully released chest compressions (71% [IQR 24.5&#x02013;99.0] vs 24% [IQR 2.5&#x02013;88.2]; p = 0.005) and better chest compression rate (117.5/min [IQR 106&#x02013;123.5] vs 125/min [115&#x02013;135.2]; p = 0.001). In secondary school students, a training for chest compressions based on a real-time feedback software (Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) guided by an instructor is superior to instructor-based feedback training in terms of chest compression technical skill acquisition.</p><p><bold>Trial Registration</bold>: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/ACTRN12616000383460">ACTRN12616000383460</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="1"/><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>High-quality chest compressions are pivotal to improve survival from cardiac arrest. A growing body of evidence highlights the association between quality of resuscitation manoeuvres and patients&#x02019; outcome. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Adequate rate, depth, recoil and hands position constitute what international guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] define high-quality chest compressions and when applied to cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) they are associated with improved survival rates in the settings of both in-hospital and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Indeed, adequate rate and depth have been associated with better blood flow and oxygen delivery to the heart and brain and with an increased rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and neurologically intact survival-to-hospital discharge. Incomplete chest recoil has been associated with reduced venous return to the heart and consequently reduced mean arterial pressure and coronary and cerebral perfusion pressures [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Recently, a number of real-time automated feedback devices have been introduced in order to enhance both training and performance of CPR [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. They generally provide a feedback based on direct assessment of current parameters of CPR and their real-time visualization through a software interface. Trainees may therefore read the current CPR parameters and eventually adopt corrective measure to promote a better agreement with guidelines recommendations. When applied in learning strategies involving different healthcare professionals and students, these devices improved CPR acquisition, retention and adherence to parameters recommended by guidelines. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] There is a widespread recognition of the importance of including basic life support&#x02014;defibrillation (BLS-D) manoeuvres in the school curriculum. This policy has been endorsed by different scientific societies including the European Resuscitation Council (ERC) along with governmental authorities. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Studies investigating BLS education among children and teenagers reported encouraging results. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, the best method for CPR education has not been established.

To our knowledge, no data are available about its use as part of CPR training among lay school students. The aim of this randomized trial was to assess the effectiveness of a training with Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for the acquisition and retention of chest compression technical skill compared to a standard instructor-based training among secondary school students.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We obtained the approval from the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital Paolo Giaccone, Palermo, Italy (Comitato Etico Palermo 1; approval number: 2/2016). We also obtained written informed consent from parents or legal representative of minor participants or directly from participants if over 18 years of age. We prospectively registered the trial in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN 12616000383460). We performed this randomized study (allocation ratio 1:1) at the Secondary School &#x0201c;Liceo Scientifico Statale Stanislao Cannizzaro&#x0201d;, in Palermo, Italy. All study phases were performed from January to May 2016. The School Direction Committee approved the protocol of the study and provided information to students and their families before the trial starting date. We planned to exclude students who refused to join the trial for any reason. The trial consisted of three phases: 1) interactive frontal lesson on BLS-D and high quality chest compressions; randomization into two groups: QCPR group and Standard Feedback from instructor (SF) group; 2) training on chest compressions according the randomization group; 3) final evaluation.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Phase 1</title><p>In the first phase, a trained instructor performed a 30-minute interactive frontal lesson about cardiac arrest and BLS-D to all participating students. The instructor demonstrated the BLS-D sequence, including recognition of cardiac arrest, call for help, early high-quality CPR. The instructor emphasised characteristics of high-quality chest-compressions, namely adequate compression rate, depth, recoil and hands position according to the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines 2015. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The instructor performing the interactive frontal lesson was blinded to group allocation of each student and he did not participate in the following trial phases. During this phase, an investigator, who did not join the frontal lesson, assigned an identification code to each present participant and performed the randomization. At the end of the lesson, participants were randomized in two parallel groups: 1. QCPR group and 2. SF group.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Phase 2</title><p>At the beginning of the second phase, participants of both groups familiarised with the equipment/devices used for their training. Two instructors were involved in this phase, one for all students of each group. Students randomized in QCPR group received training by the instructor on chest compressions using a mannequin connected to a personal computer running specific software proving real-time electronic feedback about CPR quality. They were taught on the use of QCPR software, interpretation of real-time data and the parameters they should reach. Firstly, students of both groups started to practice until they reached a minimum sufficient technical skill to perform a 2-minute training session according to the instructor in charge. Secondly, the QCPR group performed a 2-minute training session taking into account the real-time data of the software trying to correct themselves to reach the high-quality targets. The SF group received feedback on their practice during the 2-minute training session according to instructor&#x02019;s opinion. Thirdly, at the end of the session, all participants received a feedback on their performance: in the QCPR group the feedback was based on results from the software whereas in the SF group on the instructor&#x02019;s judgment. Participants could repeat the 2-minute training session if they did not reach a certain level of ability, namely 60% of compression score in the QCPR group according to the software or a positive overall judgment from the instructor. Compression score is a balanced overall parameter of chest compression quality calculated by the software (see <italic>Equipment and devices</italic>). The value of 60% for compression score was decided by consensus among investigators as the acceptable minimum overall quality level of technical skill after training for students. This decision took into account information from manufacturer and investigators&#x02019; experience and personal data.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Phase 3</title><p>Seven days later, all the students who participated in the Phase 2 of the trial were asked to repeat a 2-minute chest compression session without feedback neither from the software nor from the instructor. All the sessions were analysed and registered with Resusci Annie Wireless SkillReporter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. An instructor, blinded to the randomization group, who did not participate in previous phases, judged students&#x02019; performance giving a dichotomous overall judgment. The instructor was not able to see real-time data from the software during the session. Students who did not attempt all the trial phases were excluded from the study. Instructors taking part in this trial did the standard training provided by the Italian Resuscitation Council.

The software used was Resusci Anne Wireless SkillReporter<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, which is the personal computer version of Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. The software is able to measure all the relevant aspects of CPR. Since our study focused on chest compressions, we used the software in the <italic>compression only</italic> mode and considered only the available parameters related to chest compressions. The software was able to evaluate/measure hand position, compression rate, compression depth and chest release. For these parameters, we set the target measures according to European Resuscitation Council guidelines 2015. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The software is able to give real-time feedback on the performance proving a user-friendly graphics and colour code. At the end of a session, the software is also able to calculate an overall parameter, called compression score, which takes into account all the others, ranging from 0 to 100%. Moreover, single parameters are summarised in final overall values. More detailed information on software scoring could be retrieved in the manufacturer&#x02019;s website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cdn.laerdal.com/downloads/f3943/Att_2_to_00021778.pdf">http://cdn.laerdal.com/downloads/f3943/Att_2_to_00021778.pdf</ext-link>). All the mannequins contained hook inside the chest needing a 30-kg strength to create a 5-cm depression.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Sample size calculation and statistical analysis</title><p>We estimated that, with a sample size of 118, the study would have a 90% power to detect a minimum difference of 15% points in compression score at 7 days from the training between the two groups (with &#x003b1; = 5%). We expected a standard deviation (SD) of 25% points. This analysis came from a pilot study we performed one year before testing the Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software for chest compressions acquisition in a similar population (unpublished data). The sample size was increased by 10% for non-parametric tests use (when appropriate). A further 10% was added for balancing drop out/lost of follow-up students, according to our experience. We analysed variables distribution with the D&#x02019;Agostino-Pearson test and checked the plot distribution of the data for detection of skewness. Homoscedasticity was tested by the F-test. We calculated and reported mean and SD for variables with a normal distribution. In case of normality, a Student&#x02019;s t-test was adopted. We expressed variables without a normal distribution as median and interquartile ranges (IQR, 25<sup>th</sup>&#x02013; 75<sup>th</sup>) and comparisons were performed with Mann-Whitney U-test. Mann-Whitney U and the test statistic Z (corrected for ties) were reported as a measure for differences between groups. A frequency table was constructed and the chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test were used for comparisons of proportions. A two-tailed p &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was performed using MedCalc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for Windows, version 9.5.0.0 (MedCalc<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Software, Mariakerke, Belgium). We adopted the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines for this trial (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0169591.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>).

All classes at fourth and fifth year of study course were available for the enrolment according to School Direction decision. An appropriate number of classes were enrolled to match the sample size considering a mean value of 20 students per class. At the end of the lesson in phase 1, after assigning unique identification codes to participants, an investigator generated the randomization list using an on-line, random sequence generator.

The primary outcome of the study was an overall measure of chest compression quality provided by the software. Although the gold-standard for the certification of the CPR technical skill acquisition is the instructor&#x02019;s judgment, we decided to use compression score as primary outcome since it provided a quantitative and sensitive assessment of parameters corresponding to high-quality chest compressions, namely compression rate, depth, recoil and hand position during its performance. When considering chest compression parameters separately, students in QCPR group showed better chest recoil and compression rate. We did not observe difference in depth and hand position. We may argue that the observed difference in compression score should be attributed mainly in the difference in chest recoil and, to a minor extent, in compression rate. Chest recoil may be difficult to be taught and recognised during chest compressions performance. Our data suggest that feedback from the software may improve the acquisition of the ability to perform chest compressions with adequate recoil.</p><p>Although our trial investigated the effect of Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in secondary school students, it should be noted that participants followed a training program consisting on an interactive frontal lesson led by instructors who also led the familiarization with the devices, helped the interpretation of real-time results and discussed with each student the final software report during the training phase. We cannot exclude a different effect with the use of the same feedback system without the support of an instructor since the effect of the instructor and feedback system could not be disentangled due the specific trial design. Notably, we decided to evaluate the chest compressions performance at 7 days in order to avoid the previously reported <italic>boosting effect</italic>, which may occur soon after an educational intervention, leading to dilution of the effect.

[<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] A number of feedback devices have been developed, ranging in complexity from metronomes providing real-time information of chest compression rate during training or actual resuscitation to more sophisticated devices which provide a feedback on all parameters of high-quality CPR and report a final score resulting from a balanced analysis of each parameter and its deviation from a pre-set value. A systematic review of studies investigating the usefulness of CPR feedback/prompt device during training and CPR performance supported the use of these devices in order to improve CPR skill acquisition and retention. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Another systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the use of audiovisual feedback devices by healthcare professionals both in real-life CPR settings and in mannequin-based scenarios. [<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] In both real-life and simulated scenarios, these devices improved adherence to guidelines recommendation of resuscitation attempts. However, there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of these devices to improve patients&#x02019; outcomes.

[<xref rid="pone.0169591.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] After a 5-minute instructor-based training on CPR with an emphasis of which parameters constitutes high-quality chest compressions, participants were invited to perform a 2-minute session of hands-only CPR. Notably in this study performance of 81 lay people without prior experience of CPR training was compared to that of a group of 74 healthcare professionals. Investigators did not observe a statistically significant difference of chest compressions performance between lay participants and healthcare professionals when they considered rate, depth, chest wall recoil and hand position, supporting the feasibility and efficacy of a short training of hands-only CPR supported by real-time feedback involving lay people. To our knowledge, our study is the first randomized trial investigating the effect of Laerdal QCPR<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> for chest compression training in secondary school students.</p><p>In our trial, the proportion of students performing inadequate chest compressions according to the instructor&#x02019;s overall dichotomous judgement during the assessment was not significantly different between groups. The instructor judged students&#x02019; performance evaluating chest compressions characteristics globally for the whole 2-minute period. It may be hypothesized that the software may be more sensible than instructor to see minor deviation from high quality characteristics of chest compressions and/or more able to balance adequateness of the manoeuvres in relation to time.</p><p>Our study has limitations. Firstly, we assessed the effect of our intervention only at 7 days without further follow-up. We cannot exclude different effect size of intervention at a longer follow-up. Another limitation may be the 2-minute length of training in both groups. It may be argued that longer training sessions would have led to a different effect. We decided to adopt a 2-minute training session in order to complete the second trial phase in a reasonable timeframe within the same day for all students involving the same instructor for each group. However, the training duration was identical in both groups and we did not observe a statistically significant difference in the proportion of students needing further training in both groups. The training session of the SF group was performed by an instructor who was not blind to the group assignment and this may potentially introduce a bias. Due to the design of the trial, this was unavoidable. However, the instructor was an official Italian Resuscitation Council instructor whose responsibility consists also in recognizing the effectiveness of the manoeuvres in a standardized fashion. We aimed to recreate the standard training usually used for students to have a &#x0201c;real-setting&#x0201d; comparison to the QCPR group.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the use of a real-time feedback for chest compression only not including other CPR manoeuvres (e.g. ventilation). It should be noted that guidelines highlight the option of chest compression only CPR for lay people since this may increase the willingness to perform CPR by bystanders and early institution of high-quality chest compressions may represent the single intervention with a major role in the overall patient outcome.
