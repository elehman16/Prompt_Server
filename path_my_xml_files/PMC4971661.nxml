Skin fibrosis is a significant international health problem with an estimated incidence of greater than 100 million people affected per year worldwide with few effective treatment options available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, skin fibrosis is a significant socioeconomic burden due to the functional, aesthetic, and psychosocial impacts on patients&#x02019; lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A consumer survey of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) reported that over 50&#x000a0;% of survey respondents considered treatment with laser and light therapy to improve scar appearance and skin discoloration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In 2014, members of the ASDS performed more than 2.7 million procedures using lasers, lights, and energy-based devices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Lasers and light-based devices have gained increased attention and their use has expanded amongst dermatologists and patients alike due to minimal downtime associated with phototherapy procedures and convenient at-home use of many devices.</p><p>Many of the currently available treatments for skin fibrosis have certain pitfalls and limitations. For example, immunosuppressive agents such as systemic corticosteroids may lead to serious systemic side effects. Anti-fibrotic agents such as intralesional steroids, 5-fluorouracil, and bleomycin are invasive, painful, and have associated skin and systemic effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Ultraviolet (UVA/UVA1) and UVB/narrowband UVB phototherapy generate UV-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage that is associated with skin cancer and/or photoaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Recently published clinical observations indicate that red light (600 to 700&#x000a0;nm) in combination with other modalities such as photosensitizers in combined red light photodynamic therapy can lessen skin fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Red light has a penetration depth of up to 4&#x000a0;mm, which allows it to reach the entirety of the dermis where skin fibrosis occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These findings make red light a promising treatment modality that is noninvasive, unlikely to cause systemic side effects, and does not generate pro-carcinogenic DNA damage as may occur in UV light treatment.</p><p>Preliminary in vitro data generated by our research group suggests that red light may function as a stand-alone treatment for skin fibrosis, eliminating the side effects of chemical photosensitizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, commercially available light-emitting diode-red light (LED-RL) units exist and are already Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared for other dermatological uses (such as for improvement of rhytides and acne) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Thus, clinical translation for the use of LED-RL phototherapy in skin fibrosis could occur relatively quickly following demonstration of its safety and efficacy. Developing LED-RL phototherapy as a treatment modality would represent an important advance in therapy for scarring conditions, without the side effects associated with current treatment options.</p><p>To our knowledge, no prior clinical trials have been performed to determine the safety of high-fluence (dose) LED-RL phototherapy. High-fluence LED-RL phototherapy is phototherapy with fluence &#x0003e;160&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> per treatment session. The goal of this study is to establish the safety of LED-RL fluences from 160&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> up to 640&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> in healthy subjects, and to help facilitate future phase II efficacy studies of high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy as an innovative, safe, and efficacious treatment modality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Hypothesis</title><p>High-fluence LED-RL phototherapy is safe on human skin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>This study will end if the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) is identified or if the predefined study endpoint of 640&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> is reached.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and subject population</title><p>This is a single-blind, dose escalation, randomized controlled, phase I study to evaluate the safety of high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy on human skin. The maximum recommended starting dose (MRSD) of 160&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> is based upon previously published maximum doses of LED-RL phototherapy used in clinical studies that demonstrated clinical safety with no adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The study endpoint of 640&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> was chosen due to feasibility, as this dose corresponds to 2&#x000a0;hours of LED-RL phototherapy, and we anticipate decreased subject compliance with LED-RL exposures longer than 2&#x000a0;hours in duration. Additionally in prior studies, the 640&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> dose demonstrated increased anti-fibrotic properties in vitro compared to lower doses of LED-RL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The protocol for dose escalation requires subjects to be enrolled sequentially in groups of five (three subjects randomized to LED-RL phototherapy and two subjects randomized to mock therapy). As this is a single-blind study, subjects will be blinded to the procedure (LED-RL phototherapy or mock therapy).</p><p>Subjects in group 1 randomized to LED-RL phototherapy will receive the MSRD of 160&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>. The LED-RL dose will be escalated in subsequent groups using the classical method for dose escalation as described by Spilker: starting with dose (X) increased by an equal amount (in this instance: X&#x02009;=&#x02009;160&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 2X&#x02009;=&#x02009;320&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>, 3X&#x02009;=&#x02009;480&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>, and 4X&#x02009;=&#x02009;640&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Common expected procedural side effects are mild and are expected to last less than 24&#x000a0;hours, which include warmth, redness (erythema), and swelling (edema). The MTD is defined as the dose level below the dose producing unacceptable but reversible toxicity and is considered to be the upper limit of subject tolerance. Unacceptable but reversible toxicities (adverse events) for this study include: second-degree or higher skin burning or blistering, erythema lasting more than 24&#x000a0;hours, severe swelling, pain, ulceration, change in sensation, and/or muscle weakness. If one or more subject experiences any of these adverse events, then this is the dose one above the MTD, and we will not proceed with this dose or escalate the dose.</p><p>After either an MTD has been established, or the study endpoint of 640&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> has been achieved, an additional 27 LED-RL phototherapy subjects (for a total of 30) and 18 mock therapy subjects (for a total of 20) (determined randomly) will be enrolled to satisfy Hanley&#x02019;s Rule of Three, such that it can be concluded with 95&#x000a0;% confidence that fewer than 1 person in 10 will experience an adverse event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Of the larger cohort, the study will be stopped if adverse events determined to be device-related equal or exceed 30&#x000a0;%. Each subject will receive a total of nine LED-RL phototherapy or mock therapy procedures, three times per week for three consecutive weeks. The phototherapy regimen of three procedures per week is a standard phototherapy protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Each subject will receive a US$50 check for completion of 1&#x000a0;week (total of US$150 for completion of entire study), and subjects will receive a prorated amount in the event of withdrawal from study.</p><p>This study has a sample size of up to 65 subjects.

This study may provide important safety information on high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy (160&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup> up to 640&#x000a0;J/cm<sup>2</sup>) and help facilitate future phase II studies to evaluate the efficacy of high-fluence LED-RL as a potential noninvasive, safe, portable, at-home therapy for treatment of skin fibrosis. In addition, future phase II clinical trials may reference this study to determine an optimal dose of LED-RL phototherapy for treatment of skin fibrosis.</p><p>There may be several potential limitations of this study, which may be encountered at the Sacramento VA Medical Center, Mather, CA, USA. There may be bias towards the male sex in a veteran population, with women representing only 9&#x000a0;% of veterans nationwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Men have more skin collagen and thicker skin in comparison to women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and thus may require higher doses of LED-RL to produce an adverse event. Thus, the MTD of LED-RL phototherapy may differ between men and women. In addition, there may be bias in age toward middle-aged and elderly subjects recruited within the veteran population. Since increased age is associated with reduced skin collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], the penetration of LED-RL may be affected, and the total dose that results in an adverse event may vary amongst different age groups. Consequently, the MTD obtained from this study may only be representative for the sampled age groups. Furthermore, there is bias in ethnicity toward Caucasians within the veteran population, with the minority of veterans nationwide being represented by approximately 12&#x000a0;% African Americans, 7&#x000a0;% Hispanics, and 4&#x000a0;% other ethnicities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The research team will attempt to minimize bias by approaching and recruiting subjects of any sex, age, and ethnicity.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first phase I clinical trial investigating high-fluence LED-RL on human skin. Therefore, we are conducting a single-site clinical trial. This phase I study was designed with consultation from the Clinical and Translational Science Center (CTSC) Biostatistics and Bioethical services. Randomization and recruitment of a variety of subjects will help minimize bias. Limited data exists pertaining to LED-RL safety and effect in different Fitzpatrick skin types or pigmentation. Post-phase I trial statistical analysis will determine differential safety of LED-RL associated with race and ethnicity and examine to see whether this should be further pursued using more subjects with greater power in a future study, or dose stratification based upon pigmentation. Future multicenter phase I studies stratifying race and ethnicity can be done to determine whether different skin types have different MTDs.</p><p>Future phase II studies may evaluate the efficacy of high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy as a potential treatment modality for skin fibrosis based upon the safety information obtained from this study. Following successful demonstration of the safety of high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy on human skin, our research group may pursue a phase II split-scar study to evaluate the efficacy of high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy. Successful demonstration of the efficacy of high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy for treatment of skin fibrosis has the potential to benefit many individuals worldwide, as high-fluence LED-RL phototherapy may lack the side effects that are associated with currently available treatment options.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Study status</title><p>This study began enrolling subjects in January 2016 at the Sacramento VA Medical Center, Mather, CA, USA.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ASDS, American Society for Dermatologic Surgery; IRB, Institutional Review Board; LED-RL, light-emitting diode-red light; MSRD, maximum recommended starting dose; MTD, maximum tolerated dose; UV, ultraviolet; VA, Veterans Affairs</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec17"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1518_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT checklist.
