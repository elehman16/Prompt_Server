The
indications include investigation for intestinal bleeding, changes in the bowel habits
and colorectal cancer screening.</p><p>In the colonoscopy the success depends on the quality of the bowel preparation that aims
to empty the colon of all fecal material, permitting adequate visualization of the
mucosal surface. The preparation of the colon is considered an appropriate factor
directly associated to the correct diagnostic, lower chance of complications, low cost
and patients complaints.</p><p>The preference is oral preparation - except for the suspected bowel obstruction and
temporary ileostomy - for its simplicity and better efficacy compared to enemas
requiring introduction of tubes or rectal probes. It is different, according to the type
and dose of laxative, the volume of fluid to be ingested and the diet. More recent
studies have observed other parameters, like taste, electrolyte supplementation,
administration times and doses division.<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>The ideal preparation should cleanse the colon quickly without causing histological
changes in the mucosa, be at low cost and free or with minimal side effects, such as
abdominal discomfort and electrolyte changes. Depending on the drug used, the
anterograde preparation induces peristalsis and intestinal spasms responsible for
symptoms, such as cramping and bloating, and induces watery diarrhea with electrolyte
losses (thirst, dizziness, asthenia, postural hypotension) and anal discomfort. The
preparation intolerance (nausea and vomiting) is usually associated with the volume of
fluid consumed and the taste.</p><p>The ideal laxative should be on reduced volume, palatable, with minimal side effects and
low cost. No laxative includes all criteria, and so there are many colon preparations to
be administered according to the clinical situation. Recent consensus have demonstrated
the efficacy and safety of different formulations, including polyethylene glycol, but
this one with the administration disadvantage to drink at four liters<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>. Lactulose is a laxative described for
medical treatment of hepatic encephalopathy in patients with cirrhosis, as well as
constipation. Its use in bowel preparation for colonoscopy is considered effective with
similar results when compared to manitol<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>In a recent review, a list with several medications and different forms of bowel
preparation can be appreciated<sup>1.</sup> Drugs such as sodium phosphate, polyethylene
glycol and sodium picosulfate magnesium citrate underwent several randomized studies in
order to verify the effectiveness and tolerance. No study compared polyethylene glycol
and lactulose.</p><p>Polyethylene glycol (Muvinlax &#x000ae; or Nulytely &#x000ae;) is a non-absorbable
solution electrolytic and does not induce mucus secretion of electrolytes or reduce
significant exchange of fluid in colonic lumen. It has been shown to be nontoxic and can
be ingested in large quantities without dangerous effects<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. It&#x000b4;s use is
relatively safe in patients with renal failure, with cirrhosis or congestive heart
failure<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The main disadvantage
is the need of drinking a lot of liquids (four liters). Although it is effective, it is
associated with intolerance in up to 15% of patients. Recent studies with low dose (two
liters) when associated with bisacodyl and magnesium citrate have shown better
tolerance<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. The usual dosage is
240 ml of the product diluted in water (as manufacturers' orientations) every ten
minutes until clear liquid goes out through the anus at maximum intake of four liters.
It is recommended not to eat solid food before ingestion of the solution. The dose by
nasogastric probe is 20 to 30 ml per minute (1.2-1.8 l/h)<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>.</p><p>Lactulose (Duphalac &#x000ae;) is a disaccharide, semi-synthetic derivative of lactose.
It is absorbed and undergoes bacterial action, which causes fermentation, acidifying the
environment and causing acceleration of intestinal transit by stimulating
motility<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. Another consequence
of acidification is increased osmotic pressure within the lumen of the colon,
proportional to the dose<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>. Regarding
dosage, 120 ml is diluted with juice or clear water to make 1000 ml swallowing all
volume within 1 h<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>.</p><p>Use of lactulose for colon preparation in doses of 10% and 50% showed similar efficacy
compared to 10% mannitol<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In a study
of 2000 consecutive patients, the lactulose with above way of administration showed
efficacy good in 84.8%, fair in 9.2% and poor in 5.9% of cases. The preparation
intolerance (inability to drink all the solution) was observed in 3.3% of patients. So,
studies to evaluate the efficacy, tolerance and cost comparing polyethyleneglycol and
lactulose in the colon preparation may contribute to the routine of patients undergoing
colonoscopies.</p><p>The objective of this study was to performed a prospective double-blind study, comparing
the above two types of solutions for bowel preparation analyzing tolerance, symptoms,
complications and efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted at Hospital Santa Casa de Curitiba, Brazil from January 2011 to
January 2012. After the review and approval of the institution's Research Ethics
Committee, 200 patients were selected from the Brazilian National Health System referred
to elective colonoscopy performed in Endoscopy Service of Santa Casa de
Miseric&#x000f3;rdia de Curitiba. They were informed about the bowel preparation based on
lactulose or polyethylene glycol. To each patient randomly selected was given a box
containing one of the two preparations, double-blindly done. The product label was
covered and the patients received specific instructions for preparation without the
presence of the researchers. Each box was labeled with a number and recorded on a record
that was held closed by the researchers, who only opened the envelope in case of any
problem related to the preparation and statistical evaluation at the end of the study.
Patients considered eligible for the study signed an informed consent. They had free
will to choose or not to enter the trial. Patients who did not wanted to be enrolled
received the usual preparation.</p><p>As inclusion criteria, the patient was considered eligible when had clinical conditions
to oral bowel preparation. Exclusion criteria were patients with ileostomy, with prior
colonic resection, with excluded colonic segment, suspected of bowel obstruction,
severely ill, unable to oral intake, aged below 13 years old, weighing less than 50 kg,
pregnant and those who refuse to participate in the study.</p><p>Two evaluations were performed, one at least three days before the colonoscopy and the
other on the day of the study. The first evaluation, consisted of a questionnaire to
collect data, in which questions about the reason for the examination, digestive
symptoms, morbid history and current health status were formulated and maintained
closed. The second evaluation, consisted of questions related to bowel preparation, also
maintained closed. The colonoscopy was performed in the usual way. The findings during
colonoscopy and the quality of the preparation were recorded with standardized scale
based on visual estimation of fecal residues observed during the exam (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Figure 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1</label><caption><p>Scale of quality for bowel preparation</p></caption><table frame="void" rules="all"><thead><tr style="background-color:#cc8d7b"><th align="left" style="border-right:hidden" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Scale</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Quality of bowel preparation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="background-color:#f3e4dc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Excellent</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Small amount of clear liquid or more than 95% of mucosa visualization</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#e3c0b3"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Good</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Large volume of clear liquid covering 5 to 25% of the mucosa, but with

Sixty percent of patients had comorbidities, being hypertension the most prevalent; 10%
of those receiving lactulona and 4% who received polyethylene glycol failed to complete
the preparation; 50% considered the taste of the preparation "bad, but tolerable" -
mainly those receiving lactulona. The most common subjective symptoms after preparation
was nausea, especially after lactulona. During the exam, most users of lactulona had
"mild" discomfort, and those using polyethylene glycol felt discomfort as "tolerable".
The quality of the preparation according to the scale of Aronchick was "good" in 75%,
regardless of the preparation used. Thus, polyethylene glycol showed better tolerance
when compared to lactulona, with no difference in quality of the preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 2</xref>).</p><fig id="f01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2</label><caption><p>Subjective symptoms of preparations</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="abcd-27-01-0009-g01"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The bowel preparation for colonoscopy is vital for good visualization of the mucosa of
the evaluated segments. This procedure must be performed in appropriate way, with low
discomfort for patients and high accuracy. The anterograde (oral) administration is more
frequently used, and may induce strong peristalsis, cramping, bloating, diarrhea, among
others symptoms. The preparation intolerance is common and is usually associated with
the volume of fluid consumed and the taste of the solution.</p><p>No laxative has all the characteristics of an ideal medication (low volume, palatable,
with minimal side effects and low cost).</p><p>Among the more frequently used preparations are polyethylene glycol, lactulose,
mannitol, with their specific advantages and disadvantages. It becomes necessary,
therefore, a detailed analysis of each solution trying to use the best in the various
clinical situations that the doctors are faced.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Lactulona was considered less tolerable by the patients in bowel preparation compared to
polyethylene glycol; both have the same quality in the preparation for the exam.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Financial source: none</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>Conflicts of interest: none</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Church</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Enhancing the quality of colonoscopy: the importance of bowel
