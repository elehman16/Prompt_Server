Patients with chronic kidney, liver or cardiac disease, malignancy, epilepsy, tuberculosis, immunodeficiency and those on chronic medications that might interfere with thyroid hormone or Vitamin D metabolism were excluded. Pregnant women and those who received Vitamin D and calcium supplementation in the last 6 months were also excluded. Patients started on levothyroxine supplementation at diagnosis were asked to continue levothyroxine. The patients were subjected to high-resolution ultrasonography (HRUSG) by a single operator blinded to the study design, using Toshiba Xario XG machine (Model number: SSA680A, Japan) with high-frequency transducer of 7.5&#x02013;12 MHz. Thyroiditis was defined and graded as per the classification suggested by Raber <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] AITD was defined as patients having serum TPO-Ab titer greater than the upper limit of normal for our laboratory (&#x0003e;34 kIU/L) and/or HRUSG evidence of thyroiditis. The study protocol was explained to the patients and those who gave informed written consent were included in the study. The study duration was from February 2013 to May 2015.

Height (to &#x000b1; 0.1 cm) was measured in all the individuals using a Charder HM200PW wall-mounted stadiometer (calibrated using a 36&#x0201d; calibration rod [Perspective Enterprise, Portage, Michigan, USA]), and body weight (to &#x000b1;100 g) measured using an electronic calibrated scale (Tanita, Japan, Model-HA521, Lot number-860525). Blood samples were collected; serum separated and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for estimation of free tetraiodothyronine (fT<sub>4</sub>), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), calcium, phosphate, and 25(OH) D. Fresh plasma extracted from the collected samples was transferred to the laboratory using cold chain for immediate estimation of intact parathyroid hormone (i-PTH).</p><p>Serum 25(OH) D was estimated using radioimmunoassay (Diasorin, Stillwater, MN, USA; analytical sensitivity 9.98 nmol/L; range 12.48&#x02013;249.6 nmol/L; intra- and inter-assay coefficient of variation [CV] 4.5% and 11.3%, respectively). Estimation of fT<sub>4</sub>, TSH, TPO-Ab, and i-PTH were performed using chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Immulite-1000, Gwynedd, UK). Analytical sensitivity, range, intra- and inter-assay CV for the respective analytes were as follows: fT<sub>4</sub>:3.60 pmol/L (range 3.86&#x02013;77.22 pmol/L), CV 4.1&#x02013;9.8% and 5.2&#x02013;12.1%, respectively; TSH: 0.004 mIU/L (range: 0.004&#x02013;75 mIU/L), CV 4.5&#x02013;13.8 and 8&#x02013;17.5%, respectively; TPO-Ab: 7 kIU/L, range up to 1000 kIU/L, CV 3.5&#x02013;5.6% and 7.8&#x02013;10.5%, respectively; iPTH: 2 ng/L, CV 3.6&#x02013;6% and 5.6&#x02013;11.2%, respectively. Serum calcium and phosphate were estimated in all patients using clinical chemistry analyzer (Daytona, serial number-58260536, Furuno Electric, Nishnomeya, Japan).</p><p>The included patients were divided into two groups by a computer-generated randomization table, Group-1 (treatment group): AITD receiving Vitamin D supplementation, cholecalciferol 60,000 U (D-Rise sachets, USV, Mumbai, India) once weekly for 8 weeks along with tablet 1250 mg of calcium carbonate/day equivalent to elemental calcium 500 mg (Shelcal-500, Elder, Mumbai, India) and Group-2 (control group): AITD patients receiving tablet 1250 mg of calcium carbonate/day, for 8 weeks. This was an open-labeled RCT. The trial is registered with the Clinical Trial Registry of India at ctri.nic.in (CTRI/2015/04/005713). Subgroup analysis was performed by dividing AITD patients into two groups, Group-A: Patients having initial serum TSH &#x02264; 10 mIU/L, and Group-B: Patients having initial serum TSH &#x0003e; 10 mIU/L.</p><p>Patients were followed up in the endocrine clinic monthly for the study duration. They were enquired about drug compliance, side effects, underwent examination, empty sachets and vials were collected, and fresh set of drugs issued. Patients were contacted telephonically/messaging services weekly to ensure compliance. Blood sampling was repeated after 3 months follow-up for all the biochemical parameters evaluated at baseline.

The study protocol and flow of patients have been elaborated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. At least, 3-month follow-up data were available from 100 patients, which were analyzed. Sixty-eight AITD patients had baseline serum TSH &#x02264; 10 mIU/L (Group-A) and the remaining 32 patients had baseline serum TSH &#x0003e; 10 mIU/L (Group-B). None of the patients in Group-A were on levothyroxine supplementation. Of the 32 patients in Group-B, 12 had already initiated levothyroxine supplementation at the time of inclusion. Levothyroxine supplementation was initiated in the remaining 20 patients after inclusion into the study and randomization. Ninety-three percentage patients (93/100) in this study had Vitamin D insufficiency (25[OH] D &#x0003c; 75 nmol/L). Vitamin D deficiency (25[OH] D &#x0003c;50 nmol/L) was observed in 74% patients. All included patients had TPO-Ab titer &#x0003e;34 kIU/L. TPO-Ab titers were highest among AITD patients in the lowest 25(OH)D quartile that approached statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.084) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].

This is the first study to demonstrate that Vitamin D supplementation in therapeutic doses is associated with a significant reduction in TPO-Ab titers in patients with AITD. Subgroup analysis revealed that the quantum of reduction in TPO-Ab titers (with regards to baseline) in treatment versus control groups was significant only in patients with baseline serum TSH &#x02264; 10 mIU/L. This may be explained by a more advanced disease state in patients with baseline TSH &#x0003e; 10 mIU/L. Hence, Vitamin D supplementation in newly diagnosed AITD patients may be most beneficial in patients with early AITD (TSH &#x02264; 10 mIU/L). It must, however, be recalled that patients in Group-B (TSH &#x0003e; 10 mIU/L) but not Group-A received levothyroxine supplementation, which may also have some impact on TPO-Ab titers.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the open-labeled design of RCT, lack of use of placebo, short follow-up, and assessment of outcomes based on TPO-Ab titers. However, as of today, serum TPO-Ab titers are perhaps the best measures of thyroid autoimmunity in AITD. Reduction in TPO-Ab titers in patients with TSH &#x02264; 10 mIU/L (who did not receive levothyroxine) underpins the role of Vitamin D in bringing about this reduction. This study highlights the need for further long-term interventions with Vitamin D to evaluate if this reduction in TPO-Ab titers translates into reduced progression of subclinical to overt primary hypothyroidism or in inducing remission of hypothyroidism as evidenced by stoppage/reduction of dose of levothyroxine, which would be a more clinically relevant outcome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>To conclude, Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency is significantly more common among AITD patients in Eastern India. Vitamin D supplementation in these patients is associated with a beneficial effect on autoimmunity as evidence by a significant reduction in circulating TPO-Ab titers.</p><sec
