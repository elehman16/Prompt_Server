rehabilitation including tasks of cognitive training on performance of everyday activities
in elderly people with early-stage Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease. [Subjects and Methods] Forty-three
elderly people (15 men, 28 women) with a diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease who had a
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 18 or above were randomly assigned to two
groups: the cognitive rehabilitation group (experimental) and control group. This study
used a randomized controlled trial design. Cognitive rehabilitation is consisted of 8
sessions, each lasting 60 minutes (individual 30&#x02005;min, group 30&#x02005;min). The eight weekly
individual sessions of cognitive rehabilitation were performed consisting of an
individualized intervention focusing on a personally meaningful goal. The eight weekly
group sessions involved practicing time-and-place orientation, matching faces and names,
and learning memory and sustaining attention. [Results] Significant improvements were
observed in rating of occupation performance and satisfaction, Quality of Life in
Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (QOL-AD), and the orientation subscale of the MMSE in the experimental
group, whereas participants in the control group did not show any significant difference
in any tests between before and after the intervention. [Conclusion] Cognitive
rehabilitation including tasks of cognitive training is an effective intervention for
improving performance and satisfaction with respect to activities of daily living and
specific cognitive functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Alzheimer</kwd><kwd>Cognitive rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Early dementia is a condition that allows engaging in independent living, maintaining

early dementia include memory loss and changes in personality and orientation regarding date

resulting in a decline in quality of life, and these become the primary reason for
institutionalization<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If given an adequate environment and support and sufficient time, elderly people with

(CR) is an individualized approach to help people with dementia and their families, and
health professionals who identify their individual goals and practice strategies focused on
them<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. CR may help people with dementia

information<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Several learning techniques
and strategies such as spaced retrieval, dual cognitive support, and procedural memory

Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The focus of
cognitive rehabilitation is on decreasing functional disability and maximizing social
participation and engagement in activities of daily living (ADL)<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Cognitive training (CT), on the other hand, generally involves practice of standardized
tasks designed to improve specific cognitive function (i.e., memory, problem solving,

CR, an evidence-based study on the use of CR is necessary. In addition, there are no studies
investigating the efficacy of CR programs conducted in conjunction with already proven
cognitive training. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether a CR
program including tasks of CT improve performance of everyday activities in real life in
elderly people with dementia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty-three participants who had been diagnosed with possible AD or probable AD were

condition. Participants were randomly assigned to either the CR group (n=22) or the control
group (CG) (n=21). The participants in the CR group participated in 8 sessions, each lasting
60 minutes (individual 30&#x02005;min, group 30&#x02005;min), a day per week for 8 weeks. The participants
in the control group received an active control intervention involving unstructured
conversation and questioning with the examiner as well as watching health-related videos.
The participants in the control group participated in 8 sessions, each lasting 1 hour, each
week.</p><p>All assessments were administered before and after the intervention and by blinded
assessors. The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM), Modified Barthel Index
(MBI), Quality of Life in Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (QOL-AD), MMSE orientation subscale, and
Lowenstein Occupational Therapy Cognitive Assessment-Geriatric (LOTCA-G) memory subscale
were completed before and after the intervention.</p><p>The individual sessions for the CR approach involved an individualized intervention
focusing on a personally meaningful goal (e.g., maintaining attention when cooking, learning
to use a cellular phone, remembering the names of people) indicated by COPM. The individual
sessions consisted of practical strategies and aids, compensation strategies (e.g., using a
memory notebook), and the techniques for stress management to improve performance and
functioning in relation to goals. The group sessions of CR involved some tasks of cognitive
training. The group sessions focused on practicing time-and-place orientation through
paper-and-pencil tasks provided by a researcher and use of a calendar and personal memory
notebook or cellular phone at the start of each session. The group sessions also involved
matching faces and names and learning memory (e.g., writing words related to a specific
topic) and sustaining attention (e.g., writing numbers matched to a figure) through
paper-and-pencil tasks provided by a researcher.</p><p>Statistical comparison of all assessments in each group was performed with the paired
t-test. The significant differences before and after the intervention between the groups
were examined using the independent t-test. The SPSS version 21.0 software (SPSS, IBM Corp.,

training is an effective intervention for elderly people with early-stage AD. The results of
this study showed more positive effects on occupation performance and satisfaction, qualify
of life, and orientation in the CR group than in the CG. This results support the assumption
that CR would be an effective intervention for elderly people with early-stage AD.</p><p>The scores of COPM performance and satisfaction ratings showed significant improvements in
the CR group compared with the CG, revealing a therapeutic effect of CR in performing
occupation. This result is valuable in that the performance ability in a real life setting
of elderly people with dementia, which can be considered as the core of CR, was improved.
The results also were consistent with the study by Clare et al.<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, who reported a strong correlation between performance and
satisfaction. Therefore, CR can have a positive impact on satisfaction as well as
performance ability of activities as a result of training practical skills focusing on an
individual goal. Therefore, CR not only improves performance by practicing practical skills
focused on individualized goals of elderly people with dementia but also serves as a
beneficial treatment that can improve performance satisfaction.</p><p>No significant difference was observed in MBI scores before and after the intervention in
both groups. This is probably because it is difficult to sensitively reflect change of
performance owing to the great distance between the ratings of MBI.</p><p>The quality of life in elderly people with dementia is reduced due to physical, cognitive,
and emotional symptoms<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
finding in the present study indicated that the CR approach may be an effective intervention
to improve the quality of life in elderly people with early dementia. This supports the
results of the previous studies on the effect of CR<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In particular, improvement was seen in the interpersonal
relationship category, which is thought to have come from regular interactions with the
researcher and other elderly people during the intervention.</p><p>The participants in the CR group showed significant improvement in orientation after the
intervention. This result is consistent with other studies demonstrating the efficacy of CT
in which repetitive exercise was performed targeting specific cognitive domains<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The improvement in orientation was most likely related to the repetitive training with
paper-and-pencil task, use of the calendar, and personal memory notebook or cellular phone
during the intervention. Although there was no significant difference in the LOTCA-G memory
subscale between before and after the intervention in the CR group, their performance was
improved. But participants in the CG had worse performance on the LOTCA-G memory subscale
after the invention compared with before the intervention. Memory difficulties are an
outstanding feature of AD and are typically one of the main problems experienced by people
with early-stage AD<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, the above
finding suggests that CR programs specifically have to involve the memory training to
maintain the current level of function of memory in people with AD.</p><p>The limitation of this study is that the effect of the CR group was not compared with
another group, such as one performing CT alone. Therefore, CR might not be the best therapy
method for the improvement of cognitive function in elder people with early-stage AD.
However, this study has worth as evidence-based literature supporting the efficacy of CR
including tasks of cognitive training in early-stage AD.</p><p>Further research into the effects of the CR approach on elderly people with early-stage AD
will be necessary to compare with other treatment methods<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, various measurement methods will need to be used to assess
not just a cognitive function test but also performance of activities in the real-life
setting.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">American Psychiatric
