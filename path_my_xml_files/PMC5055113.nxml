In December 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Namzaric&#x02122;, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination (FDC) of memantine extended-release (ER) and donepezil for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. The FDC capsule is bioequivalent to the coadministered individual drugs, and its bioavailability is similar when taken fasting, with food, or sprinkled onto applesauce. The combination of memantine and ChEIs in moderate-to-severe AD provides additional benefits to ChEI monotherapy across multiple domains and may delay the time to nursing home admission. A dedicated study of memantine ER compared to placebo in patients on a stable dose of a ChEI found statistically significant benefits on cognition and global status but not functioning. Treatment with memantine ER and donepezil is generally well tolerated, although higher doses of ChEIs are associated with more serious adverse events such as vomiting, syncope, and weight loss. Potential advantages of the FDC include a simpler treatment regimen, reduction in pill burden, and the ability to sprinkle the capsule onto soft foods. Patients who may benefit from the FDC include those with significant dysphagia, a history of poor compliance, or limited caregiver interaction. However, available evidence that these advantages would increase treatment adherence and persistence is conflicting, meaning that the added cost of switching patients from generic options to an FDC may not always be justified.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease</kwd><kwd>cholinesterase inhibitor</kwd><kwd>donepezil</kwd><kwd>fixed-dose combination</kwd><kwd>memantine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) is the most common major neurocognitive disorder and affects an estimated 11% of people aged 65 years and older and 32% of people aged 85 years and older in the United States.<xref rid="b1-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> An estimated 46.8 million people worldwide in 2015 were living with dementia, and this number is projected to almost double every 20 years to reach 131.5 million in 2050.<xref rid="b2-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The estimated total cost of AD in the United States in 2010 after accounting for care purchased in the marketplace (nursing home care, Medicare spending, out-of-pocket spending, and formal home care) and informal care provided by caregivers was between $159 billion and $215 billion.<xref rid="b3-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Treatment of AD consists of symptomatic therapies as no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs have been shown to prevent, delay, or halt the progression of disease. In the early stages of AD, cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) such as donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine are often used. Memantine, an <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is indicated for use in patients with moderate-to-severe AD.</p><p>The combination of a ChEI and memantine is currently the standard of care in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD. Several pooled analyses demonstrate that combination therapy results in significant benefits in cognition and global clinical status beyond that of ChEI monotherapy, although the clinical relevance of these benefits has been called into question.<xref rid="b4-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The recent European Federation of Neurological Societies panel on dementia ultimately recommended the use of combination therapy over ChEI monotherapy.<xref rid="b9-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The recommendation was considered weak with respect to activities of daily living, cognitive functioning, and global clinical impression, but strong with respect to behavior.</p><p>In June 2010, a once-daily extended-release (ER) memantine capsule was approved by the FDA, offering a more convenient regimen compared to twice-daily memantine immediate-release (IR) tablets.<xref rid="b10-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In December 2014, the FDA approved a once-daily fixed-dose combination (FDC) of memantine ER and donepezil (Namzaric&#x02122;, Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in patients already stabilized on memantine and donepezil.<xref rid="b11-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In July 2016, the FDA expanded the label to include its use in patients stabilized only on donepezil. This paper will review the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of the FDC, clinical efficacy data of combination therapy, safety and tolerability data, economic studies, and data on treatment adherence in AD.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacodynamics and biochemical rationale for combination therapy</title><p>Pathologically, AD is characterized by extracellular plaques composed of amyloid-&#x003b2; and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Aberrant processing of amyloid precursor protein leads to plaque formation. When the microtubule-associated protein tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, it loses its ability to stabilize microtubules, resulting in impaired axonal transport. The deposition of these proteins and the accompanying inflammatory response results in neuronal cell death, synaptic dysfunction, and decreased neurotransmission.<xref rid="b12-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Dysfunction in cholinergic neurons in the basal and rostral forebrain results in early cognitive impairments in AD.<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> ChEIs, like donepezil, act by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine. Cholinesterase inhibition results in greater amounts of acetylcholine, which appears to improve cognition by enhancing cholinergic transmission.</p><p>As one of the major neurotransmitters involved in excitatory pathways, glutamate plays an important role in cortical and hippocampal pathways via the NMDA receptor. NMDA receptor activation allows an influx of calcium ions into the postsynaptic neuron, triggering pathways important in synaptic plasticity.<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, it is thought that overactivation of NMDA receptors may lead to neurodegeneration and loss of synaptic function via chronic &#x0201c;excitotoxicity&#x0201d;.<xref rid="b14-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Memantine, by acting as an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist with moderate binding affinity, prevents the pathologic influx of calcium ions while allowing physiologic signals important for learning and memory processes. The interplay between cholinergic and glutamatergic pathways is complex, but it appears that excessive activation of glutamate receptors leads to degeneration of cholinergic cells in AD.<xref rid="b13-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Combined use of ChEI and memantine displays synergistic effects on spatial memory in mouse models of AD.<xref rid="b15-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics</title><p>One important step in the approval of the FDC was to establish its bioequivalence to coadministered memantine ER and donepezil. A Phase I open-label crossover study was performed in healthy men and women aged 18&#x02013;45 years.<xref rid="b17-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> For memantine, coadministration resulted in a time to maximum plasma concentration of 14 vs 24 hours when administered as an FDC. The difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.27). The two formulations were also bioequivalent based on nonsignificant differences in maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (area under the curve, AUC).</p><p>A second Phase I study determined whether the bioavailability of the FDC capsule was affected by food intake and whether the FDC capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce was bioequivalent to the intact FDC capsule.<xref rid="b17-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the three-period crossover study, bioequivalence was seen with the FDC capsule while fasting vs after a high-fat meal as well as between the intact FDC capsule while fasting and the capsule contents sprinkled on applesauce.</p><p>A previous open-label study in healthy men and women aged 18&#x02013;35 years assessed the interaction between memantine IR and donepezil.<xref rid="b18-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In this study, the absorption of memantine or donepezil was not significantly affected during coadministration when compared with individual administration. The mean percent maximum inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity in red blood cells was also not significantly different with donepezil alone vs donepezil combined with a single dose of memantine (77.8% vs 81.1%, respectively). While donepezil is metabolized primarily by CYP450, memantine does not appear to significantly interact with these enzymes.</p><p>By itself, memantine has a half-life of approximately 70 hours at steady state, which is achieved after 2 weeks of therapy.<xref rid="b19-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> When compared with 10 mg twice-daily memantine IR, 28 mg once-daily memantine ER reportedly displays a 48% higher <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and 33% higher AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub>.<xref rid="b19-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Memantine displays linear pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range and is excreted mostly unchanged in urine.</p><p>Donepezil displays linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range of 1&#x02013;10 mg, has an elimination half-life of about 70 hours, and reaches a steady state within 15 days.<xref rid="b19-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Donepezil is excreted in the urine intact and extensively metabolized to four major and several other minor metabolites by the CYP450 enzymes 2D6 and 3A4.</p></sec><sec><title>Dosing</title><p>The FDC capsules originally were approved for two strengths, either a combination of 28 mg memantine ER and 10 mg donepezil or 14 mg memantine ER and 10 mg of donepezil (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-10-3267">Table 1</xref>).<xref rid="b19-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> On the basis of the package insert, the 28/10 mg FDC can be used in patients who are stabilized on the combination of memantine (10 mg twice daily or 28 mg ER once daily) and donepezil 10 mg. Patients with severe renal impairment stabilized on a combination of memantine (5 mg twice daily or 14 mg ER once daily) and donepezil 10 mg can be switched to the 14/10 mg FDC. In July 2016, the FDA approved an expanded label for the FDC. Patients stabilized on donepezil 10 mg/d can now start directly with a 7 mg memantine ER and 10 mg donepezil capsule. This dosage can be increased weekly in 7 mg increments of memantine ER first to the 14/10 mg tablet, then to the 21/10 mg tablet, and finally to the 28/10 mg tablet.</p><p>Donepezil is FDA approved for the treatment of mild, moderate, and severe AD. A dose range of 5&#x02013;10 mg once daily is indicated for mild-to-moderate AD and may be administered as 5 or 10 mg tablets or orally disintegrating tablets. In patients with moderate-to-severe AD, approved formulations include the 10 mg tablet, 10 mg orally disintegrated tablet, and a 23 mg tablet. Memantine is available in two forms, either immediate or ER. The IR version comes in either 5 or 10 mg tablets or a 2 mg/mL oral solution. The recommended effective dose is 20 mg/d, taken as a 10 mg tablet twice daily. The memantine ER capsule is started at a dose of 7 mg once daily and titrated to a maintenance dose of 28 mg once daily.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy</title><sec><title>MEM-MD-50</title><p>The FDA did not require any additional efficacy studies prior to the approval of the FDC. Only one efficacy trial was previously reviewed during the approval process for memantine ER. This study, entitled MEM-MD-50, was a 24-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing memantine ER 28 mg once daily to placebo in community-dwelling participants with moderate-to-severe AD receiving a stable dose of a ChEI (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-dddt-10-3267">Table 2</xref>).<xref rid="b21-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This study was conducted in four countries (the United States, Argentina, Chile, and Mexico), and enrolled patients with a baseline Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score 3&#x02013;14 who were on a stable dose of either galantamine, rivastigmine, or donepezil for at least 3 months. The primary efficacy measures were change from baseline in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) total score and the Clinician&#x02019;s Interview-Based Impression of Change Plus Caregiver Input (CIBIC-plus) score at week 24. The SIB is a 40-item, 100-point scale that measures cognition and is commonly used in clinical trials involving patients with moderate-to-severe AD because it is composed of simple one-step commands.<xref rid="b22-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Higher scores indicate less impairment. The CIBIC-plus utilizes a seven-point scale to assess a patient&#x02019;s global functioning, ranging from one (marked improvement) to seven (marked worsening). A score of 4 indicates no change. Secondary outcomes included the 19-item Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living Inventory (ADCS-ADL-19), a 19-item scale composed of a subset of questions from a 42-item inventory that assesses functional ability based on activities such as eating, bathing, making conversation, and use of a telephone. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), a scale assessing behavioral disturbances, and the Verbal Fluency Test (VFT), a task where patients name as many animals as they can in 60 seconds, were also included as secondary measures. Of the 677 patients randomized to receive placebo (n=335) or memantine ER (n=342), 81.2% and 79.8% of participants completed the trial, respectively. Almost 70% of participants were Hispanic. The treatment groups had been on ChEI therapy for an average duration ranging from 14.2 to 17.5 months with either donepezil, galantamine, or rivastigmine.</p><p>At week 24, memantine ER showed significant differences from placebo on both primary endpoints. Memantine ER was associated with a mean improvement of 2.7 points from baseline on the SIB compared with slight improvement with placebo (0.3 points, least squares mean difference [LSMD] =2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.0, 4.2). At week 24, mean scores on the CIBIC-plus were 3.8 for memantine ER and 4.1 for placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.008). While there was no significant difference on the ADCS-ADL-19, memantine ER showed significant improvements on the NPI (LSMD =&#x02212;2.7, 95% CI =&#x02212;4.5, &#x02212;0.8) and the VFT (LSMD =0.5, 95% CI =0.2, 0.9) compared with placebo. In a subgroup of donepezil-treated patients, a significant difference favoring memantine ER was seen on the SIB (LSMD of 3.2, <italic>P</italic>=0.001), NPI (<italic>P</italic>=0.009), and VFT (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) but not the ADCS-ADL-19 (LSMD =0.1, <italic>P</italic>=0.894) or CIBIC-plus (LSMD =0.2, <italic>P</italic>=0.165).<xref rid="b23-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The FDA also analyzed intercountry differences.<xref rid="b23-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While the mean baseline SIB scores were similar across the four countries, the mean differences from baseline on the SIB with memantine compared to placebo were more pronounced in the three foreign countries (3.3, 1.5, 3.03) when compared with the United States (0.81). Treatment with memantine in the United States was associated with a slight worsening in total SIB score (&#x02212;0.12) compared with improvements on the SIB in the other countries (3.53, 5.02, 2.87). However, in the United States, treatment with memantine (n=89) was still advantageous compared with placebo (n=83) on the SIB (&#x02212;0.12 vs &#x02212;0.93, respectively). Treatment differences among the countries persisted after correcting for differences in demographics and baseline characteristics. The treatment effect on the CIBIC-plus was similar across the different countries.

It was also required that the participant&#x02019;s prescribing clinician was considering a change in treatment at the time. Primary outcome measures included scores on the sMMSE (higher scores indicate better cognitive function) and the caregiver-rated Bristol Activities of Daily Living Scale (BADLS, higher scores indicate greater impairment). While an initial sample size of 800 was planned, the planned size was readjusted to 430 based on statistical reanalysis. However, difficulties with recruitment led to a final sample of 295 participants. The probability of withdrawal was significantly less in patients assigned to continue donepezil treatment compared to discontinuing donepezil treatment (0.51, 95% CI =0.36, 0.72). The dropout rate was fairly high among all groups, with 20/72 in the discontinue donepezil add placebo group, 27/74 in the discontinue donepezil add memantine group, 34/73 in the continue donepezil add placebo group, and 38/72 in the continue donepezil add memantine group remaining at the study&#x02019;s endpoint of 52 weeks. Patients assigned to continue donepezil vs those who discontinued donepezil had significantly higher scores on the sMMSE (1.9 points, 95% CI =1.3, 2.5) and significantly lower scores on the BADLS (3.0 points, 95% CI =1.8, 4.3) after 52 weeks. Patients assigned to receive memantine vs placebo showed significantly higher sMMSE scores (LSMD =1.2, 95% CI =0.6, 1.8) and lower BADLS scores (LSMD =1.5, 95% CI =0.3, 2.8). These values were smaller than prespecified minimum clinically important differences for the sMMSE (1.4 points) and BADLS (3.5 points).

However, the hazard ratios were nonproportional (<italic>P</italic>=0.01) since the effect of discontinuing donepezil changed over time. An analysis that was not prespecified showed that significantly more patients during the first year were admitted to nursing homes in the group that discontinued donepezil and added either placebo or memantine compared to the group that continued donepezil and added either memantine or placebo (hazard ratio =2.09, 95% CI =1.29, 3.39). The difference in probability of nursing home placement with discontinuing donepezil vs continuing donepezil was 0.17 (37% vs 20%, respectively) corresponding to an NNT of 5.88 patients for 12 months to prevent one nursing home placement. No significant difference was seen in nursing home placement with combination memantine and donepezil therapy compared to donepezil therapy alone. One important limitation of this study was that no information was collected about AD therapy use after the 52 week double-blind period, meaning that the patient&#x02019;s clinician could reinstitute any combination of drug therapy during the subsequent 3-year follow-up period after the initial 52-week endpoint.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Combination therapy in long-term observational trials</title><p>Support for the combination of memantine and donepezil has also been provided by long-term observational controlled studies (LTOCs).<xref rid="b43-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Given that long-term RCTs are difficult to perform, LTOCs provide additional clinical efficacy data in a real-life setting involving patients with multiple comorbidities and varying levels of treatment adherence.</p><p>In a study involving 382 participants with a mean follow-up period of 30 months and mean treatment duration of 22.5 months, patients receiving memantine and ChEI therapy showed lower rates of deterioration on measures of cognition (Information-Memory-Concentration subscale of the Blessed Dementia Scale) and function (Weintraub ADL Scale) compared to ChEI monotherapy.<xref rid="b44-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> The effect sizes for combination vs ChEI monotherapy after 4 years were 0.49 on the cognitive scale (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 0.73 on the functional scale (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).

Disease progression was modeled for a period of 3 years based on predictive equations using changes in SIB, NPI, and ADCS-ADL-19 scores. A monthly cost of $282.82 for the memantine ER/ChEI combination, $26.96 for ChEI monotherapy, and $21.36 for antipsychotics was used. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for patients and caregivers, total direct and societal costs, and incremental direct and total cost per QALY gained. At the end of the 3-year simulation, treatment with memantine ER and ChEI was associated with a savings of $18,355 compared with ChEI monotherapy when factoring in total direct costs and cost associated with caregiver time. Memantine ER and ChEI therapy also resulted in an additional 0.12 QALYs for patients and caregivers combined. Patients receiving the combination spent an average of 4 months longer living in the community. This delay in entering institutional care was the major driving force for cost savings with combination therapy. Patients receiving the combination therapy also spent less time in the severe stages of AD (3.64 vs 5.94 months for ChEI monotherapy over the 3-year period).</p><p>Multiple economic analyses have been performed with combination memantine IR and ChEI compared to ChEI monotherapy.<xref rid="b55-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b57-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> Using data from MEM-MD-02, therapy with memantine and donepezil vs donepezil alone reduced total lifetime costs of formal and informal services by $242.<xref rid="b55-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> The smaller savings compared with the previous study mentioned is possibly due to different assumptions of time in institutional facilities.

The efficacy data of this trial along with pharmacokinetic data from two Phase I trials resulted in the approval of an FDC of memantine ER and donepezil in 2014. The European Medicines Agency has ruled against approval of both memantine ER and a combination of memantine 20 mg IR and donepezil 10 mg.</p><p>When patients are initiated on combination therapy for AD, treatment options include the FDC of memantine ER and donepezil, individual memantine ER and donepezil, or individual memantine IR and donepezil (both available in generic forms). One can also combine the ChEIs rivastigmine or galantamine with memantine ER or IR. The primary advantages of using the higher cost FDC compared to generic versions are a simplified treatment regimen (once-daily capsule) and ability to sprinkle the capsule on applesauce. These two factors may increase treatment adherence, treatment persistence, and reduce caregiver burden. Greater persistence with treatment does appear to be an important factor in slowing the rate of cognitive, functional, and global clinical decline. In an LTOC involving 641 patients with AD (baseline mean MMSE of 19.5) and a mean follow-up time of 3 years (range 0.8&#x02013;13.4 years), patients with a higher persistency index (defined as total years of drug use divided by total years of disease symptoms) showed significantly slower rates of decline on cognitive, functional, and global measures.<xref rid="b58-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> These effects were cumulative over time. Thus, if the FDC could increase treatment persistence, the added cost may be justified from both an economic perspective (eg, reducing admission to nursing homes) and a social perspective (eg, reducing caregiver burden and increasing patient quality of life).</p><p>With regard to the effect of simplifying treatment regimen on treatment adherence, in a meta-analysis of nine studies involving an FDC in the treatment of tuberculosis, hypertension, HIV disease, and diabetes, the use of an FDC resulted in a 26% decrease in the risk of noncompliance compared with free-drug components (relative risk =0.74, 95% CI 0.69&#x02013;0.80).<xref rid="b59-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> In another study of FDC delivery of aspirin, statin, and two blood pressure-lowering agents vs usual care, the FDC group showed significantly improved adherence (86% vs 65%, relative risk of being adherent =1.33, 95% CI =1.26&#x02013;1.41).<xref rid="b60-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></p><p>The evidence regarding the effect of simplifying treatment regimens on patient adherence and persistence with AD therapy is mixed.

This study, which was performed prior to the approval of the rivastigmine patch, found that rivastigmine had the lowest rate of treatment persistence, which may be related to its twice-daily dosing compared to the once-daily galantamine ER and donepezil. A significant difference between duration of treatment was seen between galantamine ER and rivastigmine (292.5 vs 272.1 days, respectively; <italic>P</italic>=0.0265).

Other methods include using orally disintegrating tablets or oral solutions. A generic orally disintegrating tablet is available for donepezil but not memantine. Memantine IR does come in an oral solution, but this is fairly expensive.</p><p>The economic analysis showing that the FDC ultimately results in cost savings over ChEI monotherapy despite a higher cost of therapy is reassuring. The major cost savings benefits appear to come from delaying institutionalization.

The patent exclusivity period for memantine IR tablets expired in July 2015, meaning that generic memantine IR is now available in the US. In 2014, Forest Pharmaceuticals planned to discontinue memantine IR tablets and only produce memantine ER, which retains patent exclusivity until 2029. An antitrust lawsuit was subsequently filed by the State of New York. The primary argument made was that if the IR version were discontinued, patients would be required to switch to the ER version. This may have dissuaded manufacturers from developing the generic IR tablets since most patients would have already been on a stable dose of the ER capsules for several months. If generic IR versions were to then become available in 2015, patients would have had to switch twice between 2014 and 2015, first to the ER capsules and then back to the generic IR tablets. The courts ruled in favor of the State, citing that the discontinuation of IR tablets violates parts of the Sherman antitrust act.<xref rid="b80-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">80</xref> In August 2015, a generic version of memantine IR tablets was approved by the FDA.<xref rid="b81-dddt-10-3267" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> While the <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> are 48% and 33% higher, respectively, for 28 mg memantine ER compared to 20 mg/d memantine IR, the clinical impact of these pharmacokinetic properties is not known since it has not been studied in clinical trials. Thus, 20 mg/d memantine IR given as 10 mg tablets twice daily and the 28 mg memantine ER component of the FDC are considered equivalent.</p><p>Overall, the evidence suggests that combination therapy with memantine and donepezil does provide significant advantages across multiple domains compared with ChEI monotherapy. Patients who may particularly benefit from an FDC of memantine ER and donepezil include those with significant dysphagia, a history of nonadherence, and limited caregiver interaction. However, there does not appear to be compelling, high-quality evidence that an FDC would substantially improve clinical outcomes over lower cost regimens, such as generic donepezil and memantine IR. Whether or not the added cost of the FDC is justified will likely be made on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosures</bold></p><p>GT Grossberg serves as a consultant/speaker for Acadia, Accera, Actavis/Allergan, Avanir, Baxter, Daiichi Sankyo, Forest, GE, Genentech, Lundbeck, Novartis, Otsuka, Roche, and Takeda.
