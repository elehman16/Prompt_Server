DOMS reduced the PPT (at baseline 5.9 &#x000b1; 0.4 kg/cm<sup>2</sup>) by a maximum of 1.5 &#x000b1; 1.4 kg/cm<sup>2</sup> (-24%) at 48 hours (p &#x0003c; 0.001). This correlated with the decrease in MIVF (r = -0.48, p = 0.033). Whereas subjective pain was an indicator of the early 48 hours, the PPT was still present after 72 hours (r = 0.48, p = 0.036).

Mechanically-induced microtraumata, i.e. grade 1 muscle strain injuries, result in the perception of muscle soreness associated with pain and weakness [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The symptomology should be restricted to dull pain and discomfort, manifesting itself usually 6 to 12 hours and peaking 48 to 72 hours post-exercise [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Often, people go to bed with mild discomfort and wake up the next morning with severe pain [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Longer lasting impairment and muscular dysfunction may be a consequence of DOMS [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Generally accepted epidemiologic data regarding its incidence and prevalence is missing.</p><p>The physiological basis of muscle contraction and damage draws upon the relationship between force, speed and tension in a muscle fibre. Constant velocity lengthening produces a complex tension record, leading to a continued increase in tension throughout a given movement [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Beyond the plateau of the length tension curve, stretching the muscle works non-uniformly, elongating the weakest sarcomeres first, which are those with the smallest number of crossbridges [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. As a consequence, disturbances of the cross-striated band pattern of the sarcomere can be observed. Biopsies taken after repetitive eccentric muscle actions have revealed broadening, streaming, and at times, total disruption of Z-discs [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Eccentric exercise led to a dramatic change in the arrangement of the t-tubule network and the disposition of the triads, which is thought to be a primary reason for disorders of the membrane systems involved in excitation-contraction coupling failure [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Microscopic disruptions are also thought to lead to other damaged cell membranes and, therefore, a loss of intracellular calcium homeostasis [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several inflammatory processes are initiated, which in turn lead to fiber damage and cell death [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Exercise induced muscle damage (EIMD) is variable in severity in muscles with different architecture, and is exacerbated by inflammation after the initial injury [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Still, the debate about why this pathophysiologic response mediates pain remains controversial. There is no doubt that excessive exercise, triggered by frequency or load, can be painful [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there is no consensus regarding the origin of pain. From a clinical point of view, this understanding is crucial in order to choose adequate preventive and rehabilitative concepts.</p><p>Whereas some researchers suggest e.g. muscular fascia to cause pain [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], others showed the presence of cutaneous allodynia [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Whilst muscular fascia would just need to induce local nociceptors (peripheral sensitivity), it is also conceivable that both observations are the result of an increased spinal sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, the breakdown products of the impaired muscle tissue excites nociceptors. Specifically, the transient receptor potential channels of the vanilloid type TRPV1 and acid sensing ion channels ASICs have been suggested to play a central role in the processing of the stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In combination with an augmented mechanical response in muscle thin-fibre sensory receptors [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], these neurophysiological observations could be related to muscle tenderness and soreness.</p><p>Pain is initiated through the activation of nociceptors by noxious thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There are two classes of nociceptors, myelinated A&#x003b4; fibres that mediate acute, well-localized &#x0201c;first&#x0201d; or fast pain, and unmyelinated C fibres mediating poorly localised, &#x0201c;second&#x0201d; or slow pain [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Whereas C-fibres develop mechanical sensitivity only in the setting of injury [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], A&#x003b4; nociceptors also respond to chemical and thermal as well as mechanical stimuli. A nociceptor response is primarily linked to the occurrence of a tissue injury, and can be considered at least partially as the result of modification of the extracellular milieu by intracellular contents released from injured cells, such as protons, potassium ions or ATP [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. On the muscular cellular level, almost half of the muscle fibres present low threshold mechanosensitive units (LTM, on A&#x003b4; fibres) which respond to weak stimuli such as deformation of the muscle tissue and fascia [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. They have been implicated as the primary afferents transmitting signals to or maintaining sensitization of wide dynamic range neurons [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] which are likely involved in deep, spread and referral pain. Muscle nociception is supposed to involve high-threshold mechanosensitive receptors (HTM, on C and A&#x003b4;-fibres). Their membrane may be equipped with transient receptor potential channels that seem to play pivotal roles in the processing of the stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Other candidates of mechanotransducers include members of the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel (DEG/ENaC) families, involving above mentioned ASCIs [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Hoheisel et al. showed that the activation of these HTM units is pressure dependent and requires a certain pressure threshold to be exceeded [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The receptors are supposed to be first hyper-sensitized by chemical mediators like bradykinin and prostaglandin-2, and secondly to be activated by the increased interstitial pressure caused by the development of intramuscular swelling due to DOMS-related oedema [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Once activated, the pain signal is transduced by the activation of a variety of voltage-gated ion channels, with the critical role of sodium and potassium channels to convey the signal to the dorsal horn [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The signal is mediated to the CNS, place of the sensory, emotional and affective assessment, leading to enhanced processing of nociceptive messages [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. In persistent pain, it is assumed that the mechanism of peripheral sensitisation results in alteration in the properties of peripheral nerves. This second phase of pain results from inflammation-associated changes in the chemical environment of the nerve fibres [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. An important role has been contributed to the nerve growth factor NGF, producing hypersensitivity to heat and mechanical stimuli via two temporally distinct mechanisms. First, the sensitivity of the nociceptor is changed, as target proteins functionally potentiate at the peripheral nociceptor terminal; most notably TRPV1, leading to a rapid change in cellular and behavioural heat sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to this first response, NGF promotes increased expression of pro-nociceptive proteins in the nucleus of the nociceptor (for review [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). Together, these changes in gene expression enhance excitability of the nociceptor and amplify the neurogenic inflammatory response.</p><p>To investigate different mechanical pain thresholds, standardised methods of quantitative mechanical sensory testing have been established [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], allowing to distinguish cutaneous perception (A-beta fibres assessed with thin filaments) from superficial (LTM-evoked, A-delta fibre mediated hyperalgesia to pinprick stimuli) or deep tissue nociception (HTM evoked, C- and A-delta fibre mediated pain to pressure). The present study has been designed to test the hypothesis if the HTM units represent the primarily involved nociceptor in DOMS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>A single-centre, randomised study at the Sports Campus, Goethe-University Frankfurt to investigate mechanical pain and detection thresholds of the non-dominant biceps brachii muscle following DOMS in healthy adults.

Participants signed a written informed consent to participate in the study, which has been approved by the Ethics Committee FB05 of the Goethe University of Frankfurt, Germany (reference 2015&#x02013;157) and is in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki (Version Fortaleza 2012).

All participants were seated at a preacher&#x02019;s bench (multi muscle machine m3, Diagnos<sup>+</sup>,Schnell Trainingsger&#x000e4;te GmbH, Peutenhausen, Germany), with the hand in supination and with the upper arm, wrist, and shoulder fixed in a way allowing to perform standardised, isolated and controlled biceps curls. Following a standardised warm-up exercise for 3 minutes, i.e. eccentric and concentric movements of the arm without loads, individual one repetition maximum (1 RM; i.e., the maximum weight lifted with one concentric contraction), was determined for the elbow flexors within a maximum of five trials by loading the dumbbell with free weights in 0.5 kg increments. Participants were encouraged verbally to elicit their maximal effort. Ninety percent of the concentric 1 RM was then used to provoke DOMS through eccentric contractions. For this, the dumbbell was lifted by the experimenter, until the participant&#x02019;s elbow was flexed approximately 120&#x000b0;, and the participant then had to lower the weight eccentrically over a time span of 5 seconds, controlled by a typical metronome, until the elbow was extended (~0&#x02013;5&#x000b0;). Participants completed a maximum of 6 sets, each comprising 5 repetitions and 2 minutes resting time between sets.

A comprehensive summary of the mechanical measures of the somatosensory system has been described elsewhere [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Testing was performed at five equidistant points, perpendicular to the individuals&#x02019; belly of the biceps brachii muscle. On a thought line between the tuberositas radii and the coracoid prominence, seven sections were determined by using a tape measure and dividing the belly into seven sections. The beginning of the first (tendon) and the end of the last section (insertion) were not considered being muscle points. Distance between points was according to individual anthropometrical characteristics. Points were marked with a waterproof and skin tolerant pen to ensure the same spots of measurement during the study, as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

The results are in line with previous investigations, showing a similar increase in pain and loss of function in the subsequent 48 hours following exercise [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In contrast to previous studies, we implemented different mechanical pain thresholds, to differentiate the origin of perceived pain. Thus, we were able to demonstrate that the PPT was the only mechanical pain measurement that correlated significantly with the perceived participative muscle pain intensity. The PPT showed the largest effect regarding the quantification of pain. All results together consolidate the hypothesis of an intramuscular pain origin.</p><p>In view of our results, the decrease in PPT of approximately 24% supports the idea that muscular HTM receptors play a primary role in the induction of pain. The proportion of HTM receptors is increased in type IV (non myelinated nerve fibres) when compared to type III (myelinated) fibres [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. A high mechanical threshold (e.g. strong pressure) is required to evoke a receptor potential [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In contrast, LTM units respond to any form of innocuous muscle sensations. Several conditions have been shown to increase the mechanical sensitivity of the HTM nociceptors. First, the spread of endogenous substances (bradykinin, nerve growth factor NGF, TNF-&#x003b1; and others) following mechanical tissue damage [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. This increase is maximised when substances act in concert [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Second, a subpopulation of nociceptors can be sensitised and activated during muscle work under ischemic conditions [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Third, inflammation causes receptors to become more susceptible to weak stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Strong or long-lasting inflammation is supposed to alter the proportion of HTM receptors towards LTM units, indicating a lowered mechanical threshold in inflamed muscle.</p><p>We could demonstrate that a decrease in PPT (i.e. facilitated elicitation of pressure pain) strongly correlates with a reduced perceived pain intensity. This is astounding, as many studies thought PPT and VAS express the same characteristics of pain in DOMS. However, a decrease in PPT strongly correlates with reduced maximum isometric voluntary force. One possible conclusion from these observations is that the typical discomfort as described in DOMS [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] is more likely evoked in low threshold mechanosensitive units as a response to weak stimuli such as deformation of the muscle tissue and fascia [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This assumption could not be confirmed from our results, as there is no correlation between the maximum change in MPT and the respective change in pain intensity, indicating that a reduced mechanical pain threshold (addressing such LTMs) does not necessarily increase the pain intensity. The PPT in contrast addresses other mechanism of muscle nociception, i.e. high-threshold mechanosensitive receptors, which is more likely to be linked with muscular dysfunction. From an athlete&#x02019;s point of view, this differentiation may be crucial. In daily routine, athletes complain more often about muscular dysfunction and interruption of training or competition, than about general discomfort. The differentiation between superficial and deep pain may thus substantially change the therapeutic strategy. DOMS is classically considered a self-limiting condition that usually requires no treatment [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Still, the role of inflammation -a major factor sensitising HTMs- has been postulated being responsible for further EIMD [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Whereas subjective pain is an indicator of the early 48 hours, the PPT is still present after 72 hours, which is in line with concepts in EIMD prevention, proposing that the timing of DOMS disappearance occurs prior to complete structural and functional recoveries according to the eccentric and stretch-shortening cycle [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The sensory and affective descriptors of DOMS; as assessed in this study, also match the proposed concept of pathophysiology. One could hypothesise from the data, that the first 24 hours are dominated by heavy, sharp discomfort (which would correspond to an activation of A&#x003b4;-afferents), whereas the upcoming hours carry dull and diffuse pain (i.e. afferent C-fibres; [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]). DOMS has for long been considered a protective mechanism that already disappears too early. Our data suggest that PPT could be the better diagnostic marker to assess the potential risk of severe EIMD.</p><p>The stimuli arising from muscle causing pain are normally projected to spinal neurons of ascending nociceptive pathways to sites in the brain stem and thalamus, e.g. the spinothalamic tract [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. In addition, the activation of a complex neuronal networks in the dorsal horn contributes to the development of secondary hyperalgesia, i.e. lamina I cells which respond to noxious mechanical or thermal stimuli and lamina IV-V cells receiving polysynaptic nociceptive input from muscle receptors as well as other tissues. These multireceptive neurons (wide dynamic range neurons, WDR) combine input from A&#x003b4; and C fibres and can respond to both, low-threshold superficial stimuli and high-threshold noxious stimuli [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. WDR neurons react to noxious stimuli with a graded increase in discharge [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p><p>Our results suggest that the spinal multireceptive network modifying and spreading the stimuli in the sense of secondary hyperalgesia (see above) are of subsidiary importance. The MPT was reduced over time by approximately 10%. This is a probable correlate of the combined input from low- and high-threshold noxious stimuli to the spinal horn neurons. The lack of remarkable effects on the MDT makes major excitation of other sensory pathways via spinal pathways less probable. The lack of cutaneous allodynia suggests that DOMS is not a strong enough stimulus to elicit &#x02018;central sensitization&#x02019;, i.e. an increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system. The absolute lack of between-group effects, i.e. the sequence of threshold measures implies that pain arising from HTM receptors is primarily projected to brain sites where pain is perceived.</p><p>However, other recent research assumes a contribution of C-tactile fibres to cutaneous allodynia in participants with experimentally induced DOMS at the lower leg [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Authors suppose that vibration caused cutaneous allodynia as intradermal anaesthesia abolished this effect. This is not in contrast with our data, showing some minor effects on cutaneous A&#x003b2; fibres (MDT). This is in accordance with Nagi and Mahns who showed the intensity of allodynia to be 1.7 &#x000b1; 0.2 cm VAS, which is of minor clinical relevance. At this point it remains unclear whether segmental irritation or anaesthesia may induce mechanism of segmental inhibition to the muscular pain perceived in DOMS. However, a shortcoming of this study is that authors did not investigate the impact of cutaneous anaesthesia on muscular PPT. Thus, mechanical hyperalgesia can be regarded a fortiori the cardinal symptom in DOMS [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>].</p><p>We are aware that gender differences could potentially influence the findings in sensory studies [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In the present investigation, we did not find differences concerning the outcomes indicating the onset of DOMS. We could show that the PPT had a significantly greater decrease in women, as did force in men. Thus, it might be possible that the sensory and functional response to the experimental model might slightly differ. This could potentially influence the primary outcome when PPT or MIVF are chosen. However these observations need to be carefully interpreted due to the small sample size and further research is necessary for verification.</p><p>A limitation of our investigation might be that we did not use the full range of the sensory assessment tools as provided by the German Research Network on Neuropathic Pain [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, Queme et al. clearly identified DOMS to influence mechanical but not thermal sensitivity [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Thus, in our opinion our methods are appropriate to assess the most relevant mechanical thresholds in DOMS.</p><p>The current model applies experiments and measures at the biceps brachii as previous studies could demonstrate its principle role in DOMS. Several factors could influence this model. In regard to the eccentric exercise, the magnitude of contraction-induced EIMD can be influenced by multiple variables, such as fibre length [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], fibre type distribution [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], peak force [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], average force [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], work during the stretch [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], or strain defined as the relative change in length [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. As these factors vary among muscles, assumptions made in this study should be primarily limited to the biceps muscle.</p><p>In addition, we are aware that the brachialis muscle is systematically involved with the biceps brachii, and we cannot fully rule out contributing factors in the generation and cure of DOMS. Therefore it could have provided additional valuable data, if e.g. we would have assessed not only the long but also the short head of the biceps muscle. Finally, the role of DOMS-related edema can be a possible contributing factor, however we did not assess intra-muscle pressure or muscle swelling.</p><p>In this study we did not assess molecular adaptations on the level of the HTMs and potential inflammatory factors triggering adaptations (e.g. NGF, as well as bradykinin, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-6, or BDNF). To better understand the sensitisation of HTMs, further functional studies should be encouraged to assess these associations. However, these studies will most likely require transgenic animal models to demonstrate cause and effect.</p><p>Finally, our study does not answer the question whether treatments addressing the HTMs would be beneficial in the prevention of further damage. Reducing the degree of inflammation and the amount of cytokines irritating the muscular tissue could shorten the period needed to recovery. However, one should also be aware of the potentially delayed structuro-functional recovery when attenuating the inflammatory process [<xref rid="pone.0185463.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0185463.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. To this point, it could not yet be determined if pain therapy desensitizing the HTM units, i.e. preferentially local deep intramuscular techniques or anti-inflammatory approaches, are beneficial (e.g. enhanced healing) or harmful (e.g. increased risk of EIMD) for the athlete.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec023"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The sensitization of HTM receptors in the muscle seems to be a primary mechanism in the facilitation of DOMS. The PPT is a reliable method to adequately determine the degree of pain. Other spinal or central mechanisms of pain are of subsidiary importance, but could still contribute to the appearance of prolonged states of DOMS. The PPT rather than pain intensity might thus present a potential marker to assess the risk of overloading to early (at a stage of incomplete regeneration) after EIMD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec024"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0185463.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Outcome measures.</title><p>Indicates the measures at baseline with no significant differences between groups, and following 24, 48 and 72 hours after the induction of DOMS.
