<bold>Background and study aims:</bold> It has been postulated that the endoscopic ablation of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus can lead to complete eradication of the disease. This study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic eradication therapy for Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus and the rates of recurrence of intestinal metaplasia.</p><p>
<bold>Patients and methods:</bold> As part of an initial randomized controlled trial, patients with nondysplastic or low grade dysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus underwent mucosal ablation. Following ablation, the patients had annual surveillance endoscopies. Recurrence was defined as the presence of intestinal metaplasia after initial complete eradication had been achieved.</p><p>
<bold>Results:</bold> A total of 28 patients with Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus were followed for a mean of 6.4 years after ablation therapy. At baseline, the majority of the patients had nondysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus (79&#x0200a;%). Initial complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia was achieved at a mean of 4.1 months. During long-term follow-up, initial recurrence of intestinal metaplasia was seen in 14 of the 28 of patients (50&#x0200a;%) at a mean of 40 months, and further maintenance ablation therapy was applied. At the final follow-up, 36&#x0200a;% of the patients had complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia, 18&#x0200a;% of the patients had intestinal metaplasia, and 21&#x0200a;% had died of unrelated causes; invasive esophageal adenocarcinoma had developed in 1 patient.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions:</bold> The long-term results of this study demonstrate a recurrence rate of 50&#x0200a;% after complete eradication of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus with endoscopic eradication therapy. In addition, re-recurrence (in 36&#x0200a;%), even after further maintenance endoscopic eradication therapy, and deaths unrelated to the disease (21&#x0200a;%) occurred. Complete remission of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus appears to be a difficult goal to achieve. These results call into question the role of ablation in patients with low risk Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Barrett's esophagus is defined as replacement of the normal squamous epithelium of the tubular esophagus by intestinal metaplasia in a region proximal to the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) <xref rid="JR153-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.

The recent use of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in this patient population has yielded encouraging short-term results. However, data for the long-term results of the treatment of nondysplastic and low grade dysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus are limited. Furthermore, the rate of re-recurrence of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus after continued maintenance ablation therapy has not been reported.</p><p>We previously conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing the short-term efficacy of argon plasma coagulation (APC) and that of multipolar electrocoagulation (MPEC) in patients with Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus.

None of the patients had complete recurrence of the original Barrett&#x02019;s segment. All recurrences were in the distal esophagus; endoscopically, they appeared as small islands/tongues of columnar mucosa above the GEJ with intestinal metaplasia on biopsy specimens.

Given the possibility of the progression of nondysplastic and low grade dysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus, it has been postulated that endoscopic therapy of these lesions could lead to complete eradication of the disease with the prevention of neoplastic progression. In fact, several short-term studies of patients with nondysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus have shown promising eradication rates with the use of RFA, APC, and MPEC.</p><p>Results of this study, which included long-term follow-up of patients from a previously conducted randomized control trial comparing APC and MPEC, showed that 50&#x0200a;% of patients had recurrence of intestinal metaplasia at 40 months. Nearly half of these patients with recurrence underwent further endoscopic eradication therapy, with 71&#x0200a;% of the patients again achieving CE-IM at a mean of 53 months; on average, 1 session of maintenance ablation was required every 3 to 4 years. However, 30&#x0200a;% of the patients in remission developed a second recurrence of intestinal metaplasia at a mean of 88 months. Persistent intestinal metaplasia was noted in 5 patients at a mean follow-up of 6.4 years, and EAC was diagnosed in 1 patient.</p><p>Some of the earlier published studies also reported eradication and recurrence rates of nondysplastic and low grade dysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus in patients undergoing APC and MPEC ablation therapy. An observational study with a long-term follow-up of 10 years of 139 patients who underwent endoscopic eradication therapy with MPEC for nondysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus revealed that all patients achieved CE-IM after a mean of 2.8 ablation sessions. However, 5&#x0200a;% had a recurrence of intestinal metaplasia within 2 years of treatment <xref rid="JR153-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. Another prospective study included 21 patients treated with APC for nondysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus and followed for a mean of 30 months. Although all patients achieved CE-IM initially after completion of treatment, there was evidence of recurrence of intestinal metaplasia in 66&#x0200a;% of the patients after a mean of 15.5 months that required maintenance APC sessions. CE-IM was achieved in only 33&#x0200a;% of the patients at the end of final follow-up <xref rid="JR153-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. More recently, 59 patients with either nondysplastic or low grade dysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus were randomized either to receive APC treatment or to undergo surveillance without treatment. Complete endoscopic and histologic eradication was seen in 19&#x0200a;% of the patients in the treatment group and in 7&#x0200a;% in surveillance group after 7 years of follow-up <xref rid="JR153-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><p>Furthermore, 18&#x0200a;% of patients in this cohort had intestinal metaplasia in the cardia after ablation. This finding has been reported by other investigators as well, who observed intestinal metaplasia in the area of the GEJ after ablation. It is unclear if this finding can lead to dysplasia or adenocarcinoma in the esophagus <xref rid="JR153-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p><p>Since we started using APC and MPEC for ablation, endoscopic eradication therapy has undergone significant change in the last decade. RFA is the best-studied endoscopic eradication therapy that is currently available <xref rid="JR153-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. A prospective multicenter trial looking at the durability of RFA treatment in 50 patients with nondysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus showed that all patients achieved CE-IM in 1 year. A 5-year follow-up revealed recurrence of intestinal metaplasia in 8&#x0200a;% of the patients, who required further maintenance RFA sessions <xref rid="JR153-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>. However, other studies of RFA have reported recurrence rates of up to 33&#x0200a;% at 2-year follow-up <xref rid="JR153-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
<xref rid="JR153-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. Therefore, long-term follow-up of RFA requires continued surveillance endoscopies and maintenance endoscopic eradication therapy. </p><p>The strength of this study is the duration of follow-up after endoscopic eradication therapy, providing findings that contribute to the growing body of literature on long-term outcomes following such treatment. The study also has several limitations. Only a limited number of patients were followed long term, and therapy was performed at a single center. Another drawback is that ablation therapy with APC or MPEC was used, which is not currently offered in many centers and has been primarily replaced by RFA therapy. However, this should not be a major concern because the fundamental principles of endoscopic eradication therapy remain the same, and as long-term follow-up after RFA is becoming available, recurrences are being reported. One hypothesis concerning recurrence is that the recurrence of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus is linked to the persistence of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Patients were prescribed twice-daily proton pump inhibitors, but compliance was not checked and pH studies were not performed. Therefore, we do not have any idea whether ongoing reflux contributed to the recurrences. Perhaps better compliance with long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy could reduce the recurrence of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus. However, this issue must be explored in future trials.</p><p>In conclusion, although short-term benefits may be seen with ablation in patients with nondysplastic Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus, the long-term results of this study demonstrate a recurrence rate of 50&#x0200a;% after complete eradication of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus with endoscopic eradication therapy. In addition, re-recurrence (in 36&#x0200a;%), even after further maintenance endoscopic eradication therapy, is possible. Up to 30&#x0200a;% of patients require maintenance ablation sessions (approximately 1 ablation session every 3 to 4 years) to keep the disease in remission. Finally, deaths unrelated to the disease (21&#x0200a;%) can occur during follow up.&#x0200a;Complete remission of Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus appears to be a difficult goal to achieve. These results call into question the role of ablation therapy in patients with low risk Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="d31e220" fn-type="conflict"><p>
