It is featured with swelling, redness, itching, pain, breaks in skin, discomfort, and a burning sensation. There is a lack of convincing evidence supporting any single practice in the prevention or management of RISR.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Designs</title><p>This double-blinded randomised controlled trial aims to investigate the effects of a natural oil-based emulsion containing allantoin (as known as Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae;) versus aqueous cream in reducing RISR, improving pain, itching and quality of life in this patient group. One group will receive Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae;. Another group will receive aqueous cream. Outcome measures will be collected using patient self-administered questionnaire, interviewer administered questionnaire and clinician assessment at commencement of radiotherapy, weekly during radiotherapy, and four weeks after the completion of radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite advances of radiologic advances and supportive care, RISR are still not well managed. There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim. This paper presents the design of a double blind randomised controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; versus aqueous cream for managing in RISR in patients with cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ACTRN 12612000568819</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Radiotherapy remains an essential treatment for patients with cancer and is associated with a number of short term and long term side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. One of these side effects includes radiation-induced skin reactions (RISR), also known as radiation dermatitis, which affects up to 90&#x02009;% of cancer patients receiving radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Approximately, 85&#x02009;% of these patients experience a moderate-to-severe skin reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The reactions are the combined result of a decrease in functional stem cells, changes in the skin&#x02019;s endothelial cells, inflammation, and skin cell necrosis and death of the skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Radiation-induced skin reactions are often characterised by oedema, erythema, changes in pigmentation, fibrosis and ulceration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Signs and symptoms may include skin dryness, itching discomfort, pain, warmth, and burning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Radiation-induced skin reactions have an impact on pain and quality of life in this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and if severe, may necessitate changes to the patient&#x02019;s radiation schedule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, managing skin reactions is an important priority in caring for this patient group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>The development of RISR may begin immediately, with increasing toxicity occurring at 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;weeks, with effects accumulating across the course of treatment, and may persist up to 4&#x02009;weeks after treatment ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hypothesised risk factors influencing RISR reported in the literature are both intrinsic or extrinsic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The intrinsic factors are age, general health, ethnic origin, co-existing diseases, UV exposure, hormonal status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and genetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The extrinsic factors include the dose, volume, and number of fractions of radiation, radio-sensitizers, concurrent chemotherapy and the site of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Of these hypothesised factors, smoking status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and BMI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] are the major influencing factors supported by empirical data. A range of interventions are used for prophylaxis and management of these reactions. These interventions include (i) topical preparations (both steroidal and non-steroidal), (ii) dressings, (iii) systematic treatment such as amifostine, oral hydrolytic enzymes, pentoxifylline and zinc supplement, (iv) alternating modes of radiation delivery. The latest published systematic review including 39 trials before 2008 reported that only topical corticosteroid agents, among other interventions mentioned above, were found to significantly reduce the severity of some RISR, but not the levels of pain and itching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Further, it is not yet clear which corticosteroid is superior to other non-steroidal agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This systematic review, together with a number of other previous reviews concluded that the uses of these interventions are not yet supported by conclusive evidence and warrant further investigations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Current evidence indicates that there is a paucity of conclusive evidence which can inform health professionals on effective skin management of RISR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>A natural oil-based emulsion, as known as Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae;, is a Queensland owned product that comprises allantoin, purified water, sweet almond oil, olive oil, rice bran oil, emulsifying wax, milk protein, aloe vera, vitamin E, glycerol caprylate, piroctone alamine and guarsilk. Anecdotal reports by patients with RISR and radiation oncologists in a number of Australian cancer centres suggest that Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; may be effective in promoting healing, comfort, and pain relief. This product is being increasingly used in some other Australian cancer centres in for managing RISR, however there is not yet empirical evidence supporting this claim. This study aims to investigate the effects of Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; against aqueous cream (which is current standard of care) in patients with RISR.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective of the study</title><p>The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; against aqueous cream for managing RISR in patients with breast cancer/lung cancer and head and neck cancer receiving radical radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods and materials</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A double-blind randomised controlled trial design will be used in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Research questions</title><p>1.

Skindex-16 comprises three scales to assess patient emotion, symptoms and functioning. Item responses are standardized from 0 (no effect) to 100 (maximal effect). The scale demonstrated good psychometric properties: reliability at 72 hours (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.68-0.90) and internal consistency (Cronbach&#x02019;s Alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.76-0.86).

The time of interest of the original BPI is modified from &#x0201c;the past 24 hours&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;the past 7&#x02009;days&#x0201d; for the specific purpose of this study. The BPI has been selected as it is a brief and easy tool for the assessment of pain within both the clinical and research settings. It has been well validated in both the chronic pain and cancer settings. The scale of 0 to 10 is simple for patients to use and reflects common clinical assessment of pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Itching (self- administered by the patient)</title><p>Itching will be scored on a numeric analogue scale of 0&#x02013;10 in the treated skin (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no itching at all), (10&#x02009;=&#x02009;itching as bad as you can imagine).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment interruptions</title><p>Treatment interruptions due to severe skin reactions will be documented throughout the study (Yes/No).

Assuming that approximately 5&#x02009;% will be lost to follow-up; an additional 5 in each group will be required so the final sample will require 172 patients (86 per arm). All eligible patients will be approached consecutively. According to the local statistics of RBWH Cancer Care Services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], 746 patients receive radical radiotherapy for breast cancer, lung cancer and head and neck cancer over a twelve-month period. Thus, the sample size proposed is achievable over a period of seven months.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Eligible and consenting patients will be randomly allocated to the intervention group to receive Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae;, or the control group to receive aqueous cream.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence generation</title><p>Blocked randomisation will be performed, with a block size of six, by a computer generated random number list prepared by an investigator who has no clinical involvement in the trial.

Blinding will be accomplished by not disclosing to the research nurse, medical officers, radiation therapists, nurses or participants which preparation used for skin treatment for each of the participants.</p><p>Both topical preparations (Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; and aqueous cream) are white in colour, have similar consistency, and have no distinct odour. There are no other differentiating features. Both topical preparations will be provided and coded as Cream 1 or Cream 2 by the manufacturer in identical containers. The manufacturer will only disclose what Cream 1 and Cream 2 are at the completion of data collection. Subsequently, baseline data will be collected.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>During the first visit, the doctor or nurse will introduce the study to eligible patients.

At this time, the information sheet will be provided and informed consent will be obtained.</p><p>Any participant with known allergy to any ingredient of Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; or the aqeuous cream will receive a patch test to determine a potential reaction with either cream. The patch test entails application of a small amount of the Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; and the aqueous cream to two different sites distal to the irradiated area. This is reviewed after 24 hours for any reaction (a 24 hour timeframe was advised by literature and the RBWH Dermatology specialists). If after 24 hours, the patient is found to have a reaction to either cream, they will not be randomised onto the trial.</p><p>Patients allocated to Group one will receive Cream 1. Group two will receive Cream 2. Patients will be asked to start topical application of their allocated cream on the area of skin being irradiated at the onset of radiotherapy, twice a day or more as needed depending on the occurrence of RISR and pain, until the skin reaction subsides. The amount of cream dispensed to each patient will be recorded throughout treatment. If moist desquamation occurs, the topical preparation will be discontinued in the area of skin breakdown and dressings will be applied until the wound heals as per standard care. Patients will be asked to still continue with the topical preparation onto irradiated area that has no breakdown.

At baseline and weekly during treatment, data will be collected when patients are in the radiation oncology department. At completion of radiotherapy, patients will be given the diaries to complete at home at week 1, week 2 and week 3 post-treatment. The research nurse will contact the patient via telephone to remind them to complete the diaries. At week 4 post-treatment, all patients who have completed their treatments will return to the radiation oncology department for a routine medical review. At this time, they will be asked to complete the final questionnaire and have the severity of their skin reaction assessed by the research nurse.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Table of study measure</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Measures</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Administered by</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Baseline (i.e. Day &#x02212;7 to Day 0 of radiation treatment)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Weekly during treatment (i.e. Day 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 of radiation treatment)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Week 1, week 2 and week 3 post treatment (i.e. Day 5, 10, 15 post radiation treatment)</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>4&#x02009;weeks after radiation treatment Review appointment (Face to face)</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Personal factors (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Research nurse<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Radiotherapy factors (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Research nurse<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">CTCAE<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Research nurse<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Modified Brief Pain Inventory<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patient<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Itching<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Patient<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">*<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Skindex-16</td><td align="left">Patient</td><td align="left">*</td><td align="left">*</td><td align="left">*</td><td align="left">*</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Patient characteristics between arms will be compared using the chi-square test for discrete variables and the <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables.

There is a lack of efficacious interventions in managing RISR. While anecdotal evidence suggests that Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; may be effective in managing RISR, research is needed to substantiate this claim. This paper presents the design of a double blind randomised controlled trial that will evaluate the effects of Moogoo Udder Cream&#x000ae; versus aqueous cream for managing in RISR in patients with cancer.</p><sec><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>This study protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The products used in this trial will be provided by the manufacturer (Moogoo Skin Care) free of charge.
