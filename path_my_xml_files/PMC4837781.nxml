In its original form, it consisted of bilateral water-filled plastic chambers attached to an acrylic palatal appliance, and the patient's posterior teeth would occlude with these chambers. Later, this was modified to become a device that could be retained under the upper lip, whereas the fluid chambers could be positioned between maxillary and mandibular posterior teeth.</p><p>Most of the occlusal splints currently in use are either the hard or soft splints. Hard splints have an advantage of having an occluding surface that is hard enough that does not lose; it is fit and thereby lasts longer.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Soft splints are simple to fabricate and have a soft occlusal surface that can be easily adjusted to adequate contact pattern. Hard splints can sometimes cause significant occlusal changes, which is not acceptable.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Soft splints can aggravate bruxism,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] may be due to premature posterior contacts related to the fact that these splints cannot be balanced.</p><p>However, the hydrostatic occlusal splints have a flexible fluid layer that equalizes all bite forces by preventing tooth to tooth contact. It has a unique water system that immediately optimizes biomechanics, supports the jaw in a comfortable position, removes the teeth from dominance, placing bite and body in harmony, straightens the bite to maximize other structures, enables systemic function and balance, allows the body to naturally balance itself, and finds perfect occlusal balance after starting the treatment immediately.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>There are conflict of reports regarding the efficacy of different kinds of splints; it is difficult for clinicians to make evidence-based decisions regarding splint therapy because few randomized controlled clinical trials have compared different occlusal splint designs, including a &#x0201c;placebo&#x0201d; splint.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In this context, this study was carried out to study the efficacy of hard, liquid, and soft splints in the management of myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in the Department of Prosthodontics and Department of Oral Medicine and Radiology.

Occlusal splints that increase the occlusal vertical dimension beyond the freeway space cause an immediate adaptation to the new freeway space at an increased vertical dimension. Thus, an occlusal splint allows a muscle to function more efficiently during contact and be less active during postural functions. Hence, as the vertical dimension increases from the occlusal contact on the insertion of the occlusal splint, muscular effort decreases resulting in the relaxing of the muscles and hence, TMJ.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Acrylic resin interocclusal appliances have been used in dentistry for the management and treatment of TMDs.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Tsuga <italic>et al</italic>. (1989) had done a study on hard splints and found that it is ineffective in reducing muscle pain,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] which is in contrast with our study. In the present study, hard splints were more effective compared to soft and liquid splints, showing significant difference throughout the study period. In 1988, a study done by Harkins <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that soft splints had a reduction in facial myalgia.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] In our study, soft splints were effective, but when compared to liquid and hard splints it was less effective. For soft splints, the change was much more gradual from baseline to 7-day interval and was rhythmic thereafter. A study done by Nevarro <italic>et al</italic>. (1985) had concluded that soft splints are ineffective,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and in another study done by Okeson (1987) on nocturnal electromyogram comparison of hard and soft reported significantly less effect with soft splints,[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] but our study found that soft splints are effective in reducing the symptoms of myofascial pain although the time taken by them was slightly longer as compared to the hard and liquid splints.</p><p>Truelove <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) did a randomized trial in which they found that all the patients improved irrespective of splint design,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] which is in accordance with our study, where there was both subjective and objective reduction in pain. Davies and Gray (1997) did an investigation on the pattern of splint usage found no advantage of any particular pattern of splint use.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Whereas in our study, we had an advantage of liquid and hard splints when compared to soft splints. A study done by Pettengill <italic>et al</italic>. (1998) found no difference between hard and soft splints.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] However, in the current study, hard splint was more effective in comparison with the soft and liquid splints, though soft splints also showed a significant reduction in pain. Soft splints have been used as an interim appliance until acrylic-resin splints could be provided. These appliances have also been suggested as prognostic tool to evaluate whether an acrylic-resin splint would be advantageous. It has been postulated that the soft occlusal surface of soft splint may contribute to occlusal changes.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Liquid supported splints have been advocated for patients with TMDs. However, there are few trials that have evaluated efficacy and outcomes have been variable. Aqualizer&#x02122; works by allowing the muscles to automatically reposition the jaw. For relieving TMJ pain, restoring it is essential to restore this balance. Aqualizer&#x02122; is a new application of a basic physical law of nature called Pascal's law, which states that an enclosed fluid will apply equalized fluid pressure regardless of where the pressure is applied to the fluid. In other words, when a patient bites on the Aqualizer&#x02122;, the fluid within it distributes bite forces evenly across the bite, reducing TMJ pressure and pain, and hence ensuring relief.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Macedo and Mello (2002) evaluated the efficacy of the hydrostatic splint Aqualizer&#x02122;, microcurrent electrical nerve stimulation (MENS) and transcutaneous electrical neural stimulation (TENS) therapies in patients with TMD in acute situations and concluded that the MENS and the hydrostatic splint were more effective than TENS,[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] which is consistent with our study, where liquid supported splint was more effective compare to the soft splints.</p><p>Research on TMD recommended the evaluation of pain in the masticatory muscle through subjective pain and digital palpation. The Mod-SSI is more complete than Visual Analog Scale because it takes into consideration, pain frequency and duration along with its intensity.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]</p><p>Sample selection was based on a standardized and complete clinical examination based on the RDCs-TMD.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Although the present study supports the use of hard, soft, and liquid splints in the management of myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome, further research is necessary to investigate the most appropriate usage regime of different types of splints, the different design of splints and also the EMG activity following the splint usage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study advocates the use of occlusal splint therapy for the management of myofascial pain. It is simple, with fewer side effects, cost effective, noninvasive, and better patient compliance. The results showed that all three types, i.e. hard, soft, and liquid occlusal splints reduced the Mod-SSI scores and Digital Palpation scores thereby proving that the type of splint did not have an effect on the overall results among the three groups.
