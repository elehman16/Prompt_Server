Pain catastrophizing is a psychological construct shown to predict the development and trajectory of chronic pain and patient response to pain treatments. While effective treatment for pain catastrophizing typically includes eight-session groups of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a single-session targeted treatment class yielded promising results which, if replicated and extended, could prove to efficiently and cost-effectively reduce pain catastrophizing. In this trial, we seek to determine the comparative efficacy of this novel single-session pain catastrophizing class to an eight-session course of pain CBT and a single-session back pain health education class. We will also explore the psychosocial mechanisms and outcomes of pain catastrophizing treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this trial we will randomize 231 individuals with CLBP to one of three treatment arms: (1) pain-CBT (eight weekly 2-h group sessions with home exercises and readings); (2) a single 2-h pain catastrophizing class; or (3) a single 2-h back pain health education class (active control). For the primary outcome of pain catastrophizing, the trial is designed as a non-inferiority test between pain-CBT and the single-session pain catastrophizing class, and as a superiority test between the single-session pain catastrophizing class and the health education class. Team researchers masked to treatment assignment will assess outcomes up to six months post treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">If the single-session targeted pain catastrophizing class is found to be an effective treatment for patients with CLBP, this low cost and low burden treatment could dismantle many of the current barriers and burdens of effective pain care. Further, elucidation of the mechanisms of pain catastrophizing treatments will facilitate future research on the topic as well as further development and refinement of treatments.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03167086">NCT03167086</ext-link>.

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is cited as the most prevalent type of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and rates continue to rise despite increased utilization of treatments such as surgery and pharmacology. For instance, in North Carolina the prevalence of CLBP rose from 3.9% in 1992 to 10.2% in 2006, along with disability and healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Hoy et al. reported a low back pain one-year period prevalence of 38% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This demonstrates the growing need for effective interventions to prevent CLBP and better treat it once established. Multiple studies suggest that the greatest predictor for the development and progression of CLBP is pain catastrophizing (PC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PC is a cognitive-emotional response pattern involving negative expectation and appraisal about actual or anticipated pain and includes feelings of helplessness about pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Consistently across studies, PC is a primary predictor for the onset and worsening of CLBP, even among all surgical and clinical variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While PC is effectively treated with pain-cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), access to care may be limited by several barriers, including the need for physician referral, poor reimbursement or no insurance, co-payment costs, and time and costs associated with the 6&#x02013;10 group or individual pain-CBT treatment sessions. This study addresses the critical problem of poor access to PC treatment among patients with CLBP.</p><p id="Par6">A single-session targeted class was recently shown to reduce pain catastrophizing at four-week follow-up in a cohort of 57 mixed etiology chronic pain patients receiving treatment at a tertiary referral, multidisciplinary chronic pain clinic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The effectiveness of the class was found to be equivocal for patients with co-morbid anxiety and depression compared to those without these diagnoses. The results of this pilot study, while preliminary, are particularly promising because the intervention is efficiently delivered in a single 2-h class. If proven effective in a larger, randomized and controlled study, many of the barriers associated with traditional, multi-session pain-CBT would be eliminated for those seeking focal catastrophizing treatment.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Specific aims</title><p id="Par7">Our two specific aims and their corresponding hypotheses are outlined below.<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par8">To implement a comparative efficacy trial of a single-session pain psychology (SPP) class that targets PC with the standard of care, eight-session pain-CBT (8-CBT), and a single-session back pain health education class (Control).</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par9"><italic>Hypothesis 1a</italic> (Superiority): The SPP class will be superior to Control for Trait PC reduction.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par10"><italic>Hypothesis 1b</italic> (Assay sensitivity): 8-CBT will be superior to Control for Trait PC reduction.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par11"><italic>Hypothesis 1c</italic> (Non-inferiority): The SPP class will be non-inferior to 8-CBT for Trait PC reduction.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par12"><italic>Hypothesis 1d</italic> (Global improvement): The SPP class will be superior to Control and non-inferior to 8-CBT for longitudinal changes in PROMIS pain intensity and behavior, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13"><italic>Hypothesis 1e</italic> (Improvement in objective measurement of function): Reductions in PC in the SPP class is associated with improvements in objective physical function as measured by actigraphy.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>2.</label><p id="Par14">To characterize the mechanistic influence of Daily PC on future pain, function, and Trait PC.</p></list-item></list><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par15"><italic>Hypothesis 2a</italic> (Level-1 PC effect): Daily PC will predict same-day and next-day levels of pain and activity.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par16"><italic>Hypothesis 2b</italic> (SPP/CBT moderation of Level-1 PC lagged effect): The relationships between Daily PC and same-day and next-day pain and activity are reduced by SPP and CBT interventions compared to the health education class.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par17"><italic>Hypothesis 2c</italic> (Level-2 SPP effect): Daily PC mean changes (baseline to one-month post treatment) will predict mean change in pain, activity, sleep, and Trait PC in the SPP and 8-CBT groups at months 1&#x02013;3.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par18"><italic>Hypothesis 2d</italic> (Level-1 SPP/CBT skills use lagged effect): Previous-day and same-day use of SPP/CBT skills will predict next day improvement in Daily PC.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Overview</title><p id="Par19">We are conducting a randomized clinical trial in which individuals with CLBP are randomly assigned to eight-session CBT group, single-session pain psychology class, and a single-session back pain health education class (active control; &#x0201c;Control&#x0201d;) (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

Participants leave the class with the following tangibles: (1) their self-written personalized PC cessation plan; (2) an app with a 20-min guided relaxation response audio file; and (3) a printed copy of the SPP class content. Cohort effects are expected to be minimal due to the single-session nature of the class, the fact that the class content is highly structured and manualized, and because participant interaction is relatively minimal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Back health education</title><p id="Par31">The HE class will be delivered via a PowerPoint presentation to groups of participants in a single session lasting approximately 2 h. The HE class will provide the group with an overview of back pain, including common sources and red flag symptoms. Didactics will also cover topics including working with healthcare professionals, evaluating treatments and making informed treatment decisions, and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight through good nutrition and exercise. The back HE class serves to control for the non-specific effects of: (1) receiving a &#x0201c;treatment;&#x0201d; (2) participating in a research study; and (3) providing daily ratings for PC and pain.

For CBT, treatment fidelity checklists highlighting the essential components of each session were created based on those developed by Cherkin et al. (2014). A member of the research staff will be trained on the CBT manualized protocol and will assess treatment fidelity using session data and the fidelity checklist. He/she will analyze and rate a random sample of 20% of the recorded sessions for fidelity to the manualized CBT protocol. The study&#x02019;s principal investigators will review the ratings to confirm fidelity. A research team member will serve as fidelity rater for the SPP class. In structure and format, SPP is optimized for treatment fidelity because it has standardized content and standardized handouts and materials. The research coordinator will directly observe the first three SPP classes and up to three SPP classes at random to ensure treatment fidelity. In addition, the research coordinator will complete the fidelity sheets for the HE class. Fidelity is built into the HE class as well with the use of PowerPoint that makes the curriculum very structured and difficult to deviate from.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Measures</title><p id="Par35">The M.I.N.I.

In this trial, we will compare the effectiveness of a single-session PC class with that of CBT, which has been found to be effective for back pain but is not widely available. The study will also characterize how reduced variability in Daily PC and mean levels of Daily PC influence future Trait PC, thereby revealing the mechanisms that facilitate enduring changes in PC. Such critical knowledge will facilitate the development of interventions that specifically target the factors that facilitate positive cognitive and emotional neuroplasticity. Additional validation studies will be required before implementation in other patient populations.
