Early control of seizures can be associated with better developmental outcome but many of the epilepsies presenting in infancy are poorly responsive to antiepileptic medication. The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the effects of starvation on the body. Dietary fat is converted into ketones in the body and used as an energy source by the brain. The KD has been shown to be successful in controlling seizures in many observational studies, and in two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in older children. However, little evidence is available in the very young.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>An open-label RCT where eligible children (age 3 months to 2 years with epilepsy who have failed two antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)) undergo baseline assessment, including medical and seizure history. Participants then start an observation period (7 or 14 days) with documentation of seizure frequency. Randomisation will occur on day 8 or day 15 to receive the KD or a further AED; the allocated treatment will commence on day 15, with instruction and training. A second assessment (4 weeks after start of treatment) will include a clinical review and tolerability questionnaire (modified Hague Scale of Side Effects &#x02013; for those allocated to the KD group). Assessments will be repeated at 8 weeks after the start of treatment including biochemical investigations, after which, according to patient response, KD (diet group) or AED (standard AED group) will then be continued or changed. Those in the AED group who have failed to achieve seizure control at the 8-week assessment will then be offered KD outside the context of the trial. Those in the KD arm who fail to achieve seizure control will be changed to standard clinical management. All patients will be followed up for 12 months from randomisation for retention, seizure outcome, quality of life and neurodevelopmental status.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The slow rate of recruitment is an ongoing practical issue. There is a limitation to the number of eligible patients compared to what was predicted, mainly due to the nature of this patient group. After a substantial amendment to widen inclusion criteria and reduce the baseline period to 7 days for patients with a high seizure burden, the rate of recruitment steadily increased. A number of operational concerns regarding dietetic time were also highlighted impacting on the recruitment rate. However, the combination of a low dropout rate and the opening of further centres, the trial should successfully meet the final recruitment target. All nine centres are now recruiting and we hope to open further centres within the UK.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02205931">NCT02205931</ext-link>.

It is not a single condition &#x02013; there are many different underlying causes and, more accurately, they should be referred to as the epilepsies. Up to 65% of individuals with epilepsy will have seizures controlled with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or enter spontaneous remission in their lifetime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, this leaves 35% who will continue with seizures despite treatment. Standard first-line management of an individual presenting with epilepsy is antiepileptic medication, decided on the basis of the type of epilepsy. Although guidelines exist on which drug to use, management is still based on a &#x02018;trial and error&#x02019; approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. When the type of epilepsy or seizure is unclear, it can be difficult to optimise treatment at the outset.</p><p>The incidence of epilepsy is greatest in the first 2 years of life (56&#x02013;88/100,000 children/year), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] a population who remain most at risk for neurodevelopmental compromise in the longer term. Early control of seizures is associated with better developmental outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] but, unfortunately, many of the epilepsies presenting in infancy are associated with a poor prognosis for seizure control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Little evidence is available with regard to effective treatments and, even where seizure freedom is achieved, this is unlikely to be sustained long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This group of children place a large burden on health services, with a need for regular clinical review and ongoing medication, as well as clinical and therapy support. This is especially true for those who remain resistant to medication, this group being amongst the most costly for medical and care services long term. It is, therefore, imperative that all other treatment options are explored as early as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The epilepsies in this age group also remain poorly defined entities; very few can be classified into an epilepsy syndrome and diagnosis of underlying cause remains difficult. Over 50% of infants presenting with seizures will have infantile spasms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. This affects approximately 1 in 2000 infants. First-line treatment options (corticosteroids or vigabatrin) lead to seizure freedom in up to 70% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] but side effects limit their duration of use and relapse rates are substantial (40%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Further, those who fail these treatments are limited in their treatment options. Of the remaining types of epilepsy, the majority are resistant to medication. There is little evidence on which to base our decisions on specific AED use in this young age group. Epidemiological data have shown this group to be the least likely to achieve longer-term remission of up to 2 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet designed to mimic the effects of starvation on the body. The main energy intake is fat, which is converted to ketones in the body and used as an energy source. The classical KD is based on an intake of long-chain fat, usually in a ratio of 3 or 4 g of fat to 1 g of carbohydrate and protein. The medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) KD utilises MCT fat, which generates more ketones per calorie compared to long-chain fat, theoretically allowing greater dietary intake of carbohydrate. More liberal diets have also been utilised, including the Modified Atkins Diet and low-glycaemic-index treatment, which are high in fat, low in carbohydrate but with unlimited protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The KD has been shown to be successful in controlling seizures in many observational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, there is limited evidence examining efficacy against no change or alternative treatments from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The first RCT of the KD to demonstrate effectiveness in children aged 2&#x02013;16 years was published in 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this trial, 145 children aged 2&#x02013;16 years, who had failed at least two AEDs and had at least seven seizures weekly, were randomised to receive a KD, either immediately or after a 3-month delay with no additional treatment changes (the latter being the control group). After 3 months, the mean percentage of baseline seizures (on an intention-to-treat analysis) was significantly lower in the diet group (62%) than in controls (137%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). Twenty-eight (38%) of the diet group had greater than 50% seizure reduction, compared to four (6%) controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001). One further RCT of similar design and in the same age group has been reported demonstrating efficacy of the Modified Atkins Diet to a similar degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There has been no RCT assessing treatment with the KD in children under the age of 2 years.</p><p>Open-label, observational evidence indicates that the KD could be particularly effective in younger children. Open-label studies have suggested it to be an effective and well-tolerated treatment for infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. One study reported significant improvements in infantile spasms and fewer side effects when the diet was used as an alternative first-line therapy to adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of action of the KD is not yet known. Recent evidence suggests that medium-chain fatty acids, more specifically decanoic acid, may have a specific role in its antiepileptic effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These data raise the possibility that C10 alone has the ability to mimic aspects of the KD. Whether this has a role in a possibly enhanced action of the KD in infancy should be determined and the biochemical basis for effectiveness identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The KD is a high-resource treatment, requiring patient-specific calculation and regular input from a specialist paediatrician and dietitian, with close monitoring thereafter. It also requires diligence on the part of the families. It is also not without side effects. It is imperative that the effectiveness and safety of the KD in this very young age group is now studied in a well-designed clinical trial.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to assess the effectiveness of the KD compared to AEDs in the treatment of infants with epilepsy aged 3 months to 2 years of age who continue to have seizures despite previous trials of two AEDs. The secondary objectives are to determine tolerability of the KD relative to standard AEDs, adherence to treatment over time, the effect on quality of life and neurobehavioural progress. Further, we aim to estimate whether the presence of medium-chain fatty acids in the context of use of the KD is associated with seizure control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The project proposed is an open-label, randomised controlled, multicentre clinical trial of children aged 3 months to 2 years of age with epilepsy who have failed to respond to two or more pharmacological treatments (AED or corticosteroids), comparing KD to further AED treatment. The study will be conducted in two phases: first, we will carry out a pilot phase in two centres. If the pilot study recruits successfully, we will proceed to the full trial in a further seven centres. See Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for a schematic of the trial design.</p><p>Eligible children will be consented via their parents. They will undergo baseline assessment including medical and seizure history, neurological and anthropometric examination, administration of quality of life (Infant and Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]) and developmental (Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Questionnaire, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]) questionnaires and biochemical investigations. They will then start a 2-week observation period with documentation of seizure frequency. If the child is prone to particularly frequent seizures in excess of two per day, then a minimum baseline period of 1 week would be considered sufficient. Food diaries required for diet calculation will be returned by post from all enrolled infants 1 week (or sooner for those with an unstable clinical condition) into the observation period. Standardised seizure records will be kept during the observation period and throughout the trial. Randomisation will be conducted using an Internet randomisation system provided by Sealed Envelope&#x02122; (Sealed Envelope Ltd.). Randomisation will occur on day 8 or day 15 for participants to receive the KD or a further AED; the allocated treatment will commence following randomisation, with instruction and training.</p><p>The randomisation schedule will be independently generated and held by Sealed Envelope&#x02122;. Allocations will be released by email to the coordinating centres once the investigator or research nurse has entered eligible participant information into the web-based randomisation service. Participants will be allocated to either the KD or further AED arm using a simple, concealed, randomisation method. Randomisation will aim to achieve 92 in the KD group versus 68 participants in the further AED arm (see calculation in &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Sample size</xref>&#x02019; section). An Enrollment Log will be maintained to keep records of the screened and randomised patients at each site. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced and replacement numbers will not be issued. Whilst it will not be possible to blind participants to their treatment allocation, efforts will be made to minimise expectation bias by emphasising in the trial literature that the evidence supporting the KD for seizure control is currently limited.</p><p>A second assessment (4 weeks after start of treatment) will include clinical review and a tolerability questionnaire (modified Hague Scale of Side Effects &#x02013; see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Assessments will be repeated at 8 weeks after the start of treatment including clinical review, administration of the Infant and Toddler Quality of Life Questionnaire, the tolerability questionnaire, and biochemical investigations. After the 8-week assessment, according to patient&#x02019;s clinical response to treatment with regards seizure outcome and tolerability, the KD (diet group) or AED (standard AED group) will then be continued or changed. Those in the AED group who have failed to achieve seizure control at the 8-week assessment will then be offered the KD outside the context of the trial. Those on the KD who have failed to achieve seizure improvement at the 8-week assessment will continue with medical management, as per clinician decision. All participants will be followed up for 12 months following randomisation for retention, seizure outcome and neurodevelopmental status.

This gives a sample size of 61 in each group (122 in total). Accounting for a 10% dropout rate, gives 68 in each group (136 in total), and inflation for a therapist effect (dietitian) to one group, assuming nine centres, with an average cluster size of eight and an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.05, the inflation factor is 1.35, giving 92 in the KD group and 68 in the control group (160 in total). If dropout was 20%, this sample size would still have 86% power.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Treatment procedures</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Trial arm 1</title><p>Classical ketogenic diet (KD arm)</p><p>The experimental intervention will be an 8-week trial of KD therapy. A KD intervention manual will be created and provided to sites to ensure consistency of the KD implementation across centres. The manual includes basic instructions on how to calculate the classical KD and advice regarding diet implementation such as supplementation, tube feeding, breastfeeding, weaning and fine-tuning the diet. Children allocated to KD therapy will have their diets individually calculated by a paediatric dietitian with consideration of daily calorie requirements, adequate protein intake for growth and vitamin and mineral supplementation. All diets will be implemented according to a classical KD protocol, i.e. based on a ratio of fat to carbohydrate and protein that will usually be between 2:1 and 4:1. In order to achieve a state of ketosis, meal plans have to be accurately calculated for each child individually and recorded in the patient&#x02019;s medical notes. Breastfeeding can be continued on a KD, in combination with a ketogenic feed which will be given in a prescribed amount before each breastfeed. If breast milk is expressed, this can be mixed with the ketogenic feed to the correct macronutrient ratio. Infants on a KD can be weaned as per Department of Health guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], with advice given on how to adapt standard weaning foods by addition of extra fat.</p><p>Hospital stays will be determined by the clinical team at the treating centre, utilising the &#x02018;Trial Intervention Manual&#x02019;. A non-fasting initiation protocol will be used for all children. Parents or carers will attend a teaching session prior to diet commencement, including how to manage possible early side effects, such as excess ketosis and hypoglycaemia. Teaching of families in the KD arm will occur following randomisation and prior to starting the diet.</p><p>The KD to be implemented will be the classical KD, aiming for at least a 3:1 ratio (fat to carbohydrate and protein). This will be implemented according to a standard text [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Further, an initial workshop of dietitians will be led by Elizabeth Neal (co-principal investigator (PI)) in order to ensure consistency of implementation. Cross-site consistency of KD implementation will be monitored after the 8-week and 12-month visits by the dietetic assistant. Details to be monitored include the calculation of energy prescriptions, protein intake, teaching sessions, initiation regimes, supplementation and ketone levels. Monitoring Discrepancy Forms will be created and the Protocol Deviation Log completed, if appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Trial arm 2</title><p>Further antiepileptic drugs (AED arm)</p><p>The control intervention will be drug therapy with the most appropriate further AED for a particular child, depending on their presenting seizures, epilepsy syndrome and previous drugs used. This will be chosen by the expert clinician responsible for management of the participant&#x02019;s epilepsy. Paediatric neurologists will meet at an initial workshop to discuss clinical practice with the aim of forming the basis of a consensus protocol to ensure the consistency of AED treatments delivered. The list of agreed drugs that may be utilised are described in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. These are considered IMPs in this trial, irrespective of which arm of the trial the patient is randomised to. This is a pragmatic trial that uses authorised medicinal products for epilepsy within the European Economic Area (EEA). Although the majority of these IMPs are not licensed for paediatric use, or for use in this age group, they are used in routine care as part of established clinical practice. Patients who are prescribed products with no marketing authorisation (&#x02018;specials&#x02019;) for epilepsy or AEDs not listed in the below table will not be eligible for this trial. The KD is not classed as a medicinal product and is not included in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>. The dietetic assistant will monitor cross-site consistency of IMP prescription according to the protocol.</p><p>A discussion about diet and healthy eating will be also be undertaken with families of infants randomised to the AED arm at the randomisation visit. If the participant is already under local dietetic support, it should be ensured that this monitoring continues. If the participant does not have local dietetic support but this is deemed necessary by the ketogenic dietitian, an appropriate referral should be made by the clinician. Otherwise, a very brief discussion about general infant or toddler nutrition will be had, including details such as promotion of breastfeeding, age-appropriate texture progression for weaning, food groups and the important of iron-rich foods.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Analysis will be done by intention-to-treat. Baseline characteristics of participants in the control and intervention arms will be summarised. The primary outcome will be seizure count in the final 2 weeks of the intervention period and in the baseline assessment period. Data will be analysed using a Poisson mixed model to account for clustering by centre (synonymous with therapist). The randomised allocation will be entered into the model as a fixed effect as will an indicator of time point (baseline or end of study), whilst the centre will be included as a random effect. Analysis of secondary outcomes (those seizure free and responders) will be analysed using random-effects logistic models &#x02013; centre being the random effects and randomised group a fixed effect. The process outcomes relating to tolerability and medium-chain fatty acids in the KD group will be analysed using random-effects modelling.

Additionally, such fatty acid profiles will be studied, with regards to antiepileptic effect, in an established in vitro (hippocampal slice) model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We summarise here the protocol of an open-label RCT, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the KD in children with epilepsy under the age of 2 years who have failed two AEDs, compared to standard AED treatment. We hypothesise that the KD is more effective in reducing seizure frequency in infants (age 3 months to 2 years) with epilepsy who have failed to respond to two or more pharmacological agents (AED or corticosteroids) compared to conventional management with an AED.</p><p>There is genuine equipoise between the two treatment groups. There is little evidence on the effectiveness of treatments in children with epilepsy under 2 years of age, in particular comparative evidence. The most common seizure type to present in infancy is infantile spasms, for which there is evidence on first-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]; there is no RCT-derived evidence on which treatment to use should either steroids or vigabatrin fail. Further, there is little evidence in other seizure types or syndromes in this age group. There is, therefore, a need to determine whether KD treatment or standard drug treatment should be utilised early in the natural history of the condition. Information on the effectiveness of the KD in the treatment of younger children is limited to the results of open-label, non-randomised and non-prospective studies. Further, numbers are small, children are reported only at the severe end of the spectrum and, in some, the diet is trialled in preference to conventional antiepileptic medication known to be beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The results from the trial in the older children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], although still showing the diet to be effective, did not show this to the same degree as in the reported open studies. It is important to determine the place of the KD in this younger group of patients, both with regard to effectiveness and safety, considering the resource required and vulnerability of the group.</p><p>Some concern could be expressed about the duration of the trial at only 8 weeks to primary outcome; many studies utilise a 3-month assessment period, and the KD can take a while to introduce and fine tune. In the group of children to be assessed, namely children under the age of 2 years, many epilepsy syndromes are characterised by a high frequency of seizures. Further, many AEDs have a high rate of clearance in this age group. Indeed, a relatively high seizure frequency may preclude recruitment in view of the concern about a 2-week baseline. Our pilot data from previous trials and continuing work in our KD research clinics strongly suggest that seizure response to either the KD or usual AEDs is determined in the infant population by 4 weeks. Previous AED studies in this age group have also utilised a 1-day to 4-week titration period and a 4-day to 4-week stabilisation period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The balance is between the likely time required to determine failure of the AED and the time required to establish a child on the KD. Eight weeks allows a 4&#x02013;6 week titration for establishing the KD or an AED, with at least 2 weeks&#x02019; stability for seizure assessment.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trial Management Group</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Membership</title><p>The committee will be made up of the following:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Chief investigator</p></list-item><list-item><p>Trial manager</p></list-item><list-item><p>Principle investigators</p></list-item><list-item><p>Trial statisticians</p></list-item></list>
