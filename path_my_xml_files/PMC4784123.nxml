Some amount of sub-clinical gingivitis is always present in the oral cavity as soon as the first teeth erupts. Plaque bioflims are bio-aggregation of various bacterial colonies together on teeth, and it is the prime requisite to initiate gingivitis which if left unchecked can lead to periodontitis that is the loss of alveolar bone.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] All this will finally result in tooth mobility and tooth loss due to loss of surrounding soft and hard tissues. Thus, the foremost aim becomes to control the plaque buildup on teeth (anti-plaque effect) and control the soft tissue inflammation (anti-inflammatory).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine is a time tested and the gold standard for controlling the gingivitis and is widely used as a chemical plaque control aid for routine oral hygiene maintenance.
