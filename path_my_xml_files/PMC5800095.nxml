At 7.44 per 100,000 person years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the incidence of IPF is similar to subarachnoid haemorrhage, ovarian cancer, leukaemia or mesothelioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Current therapies are of limited efficacy and international guidelines only give them conditional support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Immunosuppressive therapy is no longer advised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and the initial claims of the beneficial effects of <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have not been substantiated when given as monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Warfarin reduced mortality in an open-label trial but not in a placebo-controlled trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Pirfenidone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and nintedanib [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] reduce the rate of decline in lung function, with suggestions of increased survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Shulgina et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] investigated the role of co-trimoxazole in patients with IPF (TIPAC trial). Co-trimoxazole 960&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 12&#x000a0;months was evaluated in 181 patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP), 166 of whom had IPF. Although there was no effect on forced vital capacity (FVC) (primary endpoint), co-trimoxazole was cost-effective in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis from a National Health Service (NHS) perspective in terms of incremental cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained. In a per-protocol (PP) analysis, the co-trimoxazole-treated group demonstrated significant reductions in mortality compared to placebo (3/53 versus 14/65, odds ratio 0.21, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.78, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02), had improvements in QALYs and reduced the need for oxygen therapy. The findings were similar when confined to participants with IPF and were not influenced by baseline immunosuppressive therapy. The results were even more striking when considering patients with impaired lung function. Amongst patients with an FVC&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;75% of predicted normal (% predicted) there was a close to significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.053) treatment effect.</p><p id="Par30">As the pathogenesis of IPF is unknown the potential mechanisms of action of co-trimoxazole are uncertain. Co-trimoxazole is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with bactericidal effects against respiratory pathogens and the role of infection in IPF is becoming more evident [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, it may have non-antimicrobial effects, targeting cellular processes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IPF. An evaluation of efficacy by a clinical trial that is adequately powered to detect clinically important differences on clinically relevant endpoints is required before this treatment can be considered in clinical practice.</p><p id="Par31">The Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation of Treating Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis with the Addition of Co-trimoxazole (EME-TIPAC) trial is designed to test the hypothesis that treating IPF patients with co-trimoxazole will increase the time to death (all causes), lung transplant or first non-elective hospital admission compared to standard care, as defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], in patients with moderate to severe disease (FVC&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;75% predicted). Secondary objectives are to compare the clinical efficacy of this intervention in terms of respiratory-related hospital admission, death, health-related quality of life, QALYs, cough score and quality of life, lung function and oxygen saturations. Secondary mechanistic aims are to investigate the effect on (1) the lung microbiota and other measures of infection, (2) markers of epithelial injury and (3) markers of neutrophil activity. An exploratory aim is to determine whether the mechanistic properties are related to clinical efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par32">The trial is a phase III, double-blind, parallel-group, 1 to 1 randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical superiority trial of orally administered co-trimoxazole versus placebo in patients with moderate to severe (FVC&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;75% predicted) IPF, with outcomes assessed over a median treatment period of 27 (range 12&#x02013;42) months. Participants receive co-trimoxazole or placebo until they meet a primary endpoint event, they withdraw consent, or the trial concludes. This trial is designed to align with routine care as much as possible and the trial visits are intended to coincide with routine clinical follow-up visits. Follow-up of assessment measures will continue for the duration of the trial for those participants stopping trial medication due to adverse events or patient choice.

The first patient was randomised on 15 May 2015. In total, 330 patients will be randomised into the trial. The trial has ethical approval from Surrey Borders Research Ethics Committee (reference 14/LO/1800) and is registered onto a clinical trial database (International Standard Randomised Controlled Trials Number 17464641). The Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust (NNUH) is the trial sponsor and has delegated responsibility for the overall management of the trial to the chief investigator and Norwich Clinical Trials Unit (NCTU), including the trial design, coordination, monitoring and analysis and reporting of results. A Trial Management Group (TMG) has been set up to assist with developing the design, co-ordination and strategic management of the trial.

Patients are considered to have IPF following a multidisciplinary team (MDT) consensus decision undertaken at a specialist centre (or MDT otherwise meeting the criteria of a specialist centre) following a review of an appropriate clinical history, characteristic features of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) on thoracic, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and/or UIP histology confirmed by surgical lung biopsy according to the latest international guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. There is no maximum time limit between the diagnosis of IPF and enrolment. Patients may receive orally administered prednisolone at a dose of up to 10&#x000a0;mg per day (in keeping with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]), anti-oxidant therapy, pirfenidone, nintedanib or other licensed medication for IPF. If taking licensed medication for IPF, patients should be on a stable treatment regimen for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the screening visit to ensure that baseline values are representative. Patients must also have a Medical Research Council (MRC) Dyspnoea Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] of greater than 1, with this being defined as &#x02018;Not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise&#x02019;, at screening in order to exclude asymptomatic patients.</p><p id="Par38">Patients with a FVC of more than 75%, as predicted based on the algorithm suggested by Crapo et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] are not recruited into the trial; this is intended to exclude patients with mild disease and, instead, to identify patients more likely to meet the primary endpoint (see &#x02018;<xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">Sample size</xref>&#x02019; section). Other reasons for exclusion include (1) a recognised significant co-existing respiratory disease, e.g. obstructive airways disease (defined as forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s (FEV<sub>1</sub>)/FVC&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]), (2) a significant medical, surgical or psychiatric condition that would affect subject safety or influence the trial outcome or (3) untreated folate or vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency, to ensure that no bone marrow or neurological adverse effects occur with folate therapy to vitamin B<sub>12</sub>-deficient individuals. Sulphonamides are recognised to increase the risk of haemolysis in individuals with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency although this risk remains low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The prevalence of G6PD deficiency is higher in men of African, Asian or Mediterranean descent and, therefore, patients in these demographics are screened for the condition and, if found to have G6PD deficiency, are excluded from the trial. Patients with a self-reported respiratory tract infection within 4&#x000a0;weeks of screening (defined as two or more of cough, sputum or breathlessness and requiring antimicrobial therapy) are not eligible due to the difficulty of obtaining reliable baseline lung function. Those patients receiving a short course of antibiotics (for any indication) within 4&#x000a0;weeks of screening or long-term prophylactic antibiotic treatment (defined as more than 1&#x000a0;month of therapy) within 3&#x000a0;months of screening are also ineligible as this may have an impact on lung microbiota. A risk of sudden death in patients treated with co-trimoxazole and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and is thought to be due to an increase in serum potassium due to an amiloride-like action of trimethoprim on sodium channels in the distal nephron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. For this reason, patients with a serum potassium greater than 5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L are excluded and patients with a baseline serum potassium of between 4.7 and 5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L, who are 66&#x000a0;years old or over and taking potassium-sparing diuretics (including ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers), are required to have an extra blood test to measure potassium 1&#x000a0;week after starting trial treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Identification, recruitment and randomisation</title><p id="Par39">The main method of patient identification is by review of ILD MDT meeting minutes or summaries, but is also via screening patient registries, hospital medical records and databases of research-interested patients. Potential recruits are being approached by local clinic teams and provided with a patient information sheet and given at least 24&#x000a0;h to read this prior to consent. Consent is taken by appropriately-trained clinicians or delegated members of staff. All patients are invited to provide additional consent to provide a sample of blood for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis; however, this is optional and patients can refuse whilst remaining eligible for the main trial.</p><p id="Par40">Following consent, patients meeting all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria (after review of their screening bloods) may be randomised without a subsequent visit. Randomisation is performed centrally according to a computer-generated randomisation code with the treatment group allocation sent to research pharmacists only.

This is dispensed 3-monthly for the first 6&#x000a0;months then 6-monthly and supplied in bottles providing 1&#x000a0;month&#x02019;s supply either by hospital pharmacy or via a courier. Participants are advised to store their medication below 25&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C but there will be no temperature monitoring after dispatch to the patient. Folic acid must be taken by participants whilst on the trial drug to reduce the risk of bone marrow depression associated with the long-term use of co-trimoxazole.</p><p id="Par42">The trial drug may be reduced to two tablets once a day three times a week plus 5&#x000a0;mg folic acid once a day three times a week if patients develop gastrointestinal adverse effects or rash, have grade 1 hyperkalaemia (serum potassium&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L and&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5.5&#x000a0;mmol/L) or any other adverse event that, in the opinion of the local investigator, requires a dose reduction. In such cases, the dosing interval is to ensure that the dosing is spread throughout the week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday or equivalent). Once a patient has had their dose reduced, no re-escalation will be permitted, even if the adverse event leading to the reduction resolves.</p><p id="Par43">Compliance to trial treatment in the form of returned tablet counts is being monitored as part of drug accountability at each visit.

All concomitant medication is being recorded at baseline and change in concomitant medication recorded at each visit. Patients are permitted to receive other medications (e.g. for other conditions), but non-permitted therapies include: amiodarone, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, D-penicillamine, colchicine, clozapine, methenamine, dapsone, gamma-interferon, cyclosporin, mercaptopurine, repaglinide, pyrimethamine, lamivudine, typhoid vaccination or unlicensed medication.

The aetiology for the majority of patients is unclear and there are limited treatment options. The EME-TIPAC trial should determine whether the addition of co-trimoxazole to current standard care improves patient-relevant outcomes in moderate and severe disease and should explore how co-trimoxazole may be working.</p><p id="Par66">There is much debate about the choice of primary endpoint for clinical trials of IPF. Our primary outcome of time to death (all causes), transplant or first non-elective hospital admission is clinically important. These endpoints have been recommended by the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation for phase 3 clinical trials in IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Many trials use surrogate markers of disease progression, most commonly lung function measures such as FVC. These have the advantage that they are inexpensive and relatively easy to determine, but are not reliable, validated or adequately robust [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Some researchers have claimed that the change in FVC should be used as an endpoint, claiming that a mortality endpoint requires unfeasibly large studies in mild to moderate IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The situation is, however, different when evaluating patients with severe disease. In a meta-analysis of placebo data of clinical trials of IPF, annual mortality in studies selecting mild-moderate patients was 8%, but in trials including moderate-severe patients it was 19% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], in keeping with the data from TIPAC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and the epidemiology of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The event rate of mortality and hospitalisations is even higher when selecting patients with severe disease (up to 16% in 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]). Our primary outcome also meets the European Medicine Agency criteria for composite endpoints, as hospitalisation is an important predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It can be easily and reliably assessed without patient involvement and is the least likely criterion to be influenced by withdrawal from the trial or unintentional or unavoidable unblinding of patients.</p><p id="Par67">We have chosen to evaluate health-related quality of life by a number of different tools. All of the questionnaires are short and easy to complete, as we are cognisant of research participant burden. We decided against using the St. George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire: although this has been used in a number of clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], it takes nearly 10&#x000a0;min, and participants find difficulty completing it unaided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">Co-trimoxazole may be exerting its effect by either antibiotic or non-antibiotic mechanisms. Infection is common in patients with IPF &#x02013; even amongst those not receiving immunosuppression. In a meta-analysis of patients allocated to placebo from clinical trials of patients with IPF, reported rates of pneumonia were 37.1 per 1000 patient years in studies not permitting immunosuppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] which is even higher than in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. More than one third of patients with IPF are colonised with pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] or <italic>Pneumocystis jirovecii</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], most of which are susceptible to co-trimoxazole. Two independent groups of researchers using 16S technology have shown that a heavy bacterial load [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and a lung microbiota profile enriched with <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus</italic> spp. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] predict poor outcomes in IPF. We have chosen to monitor an antibiotic effect by capturing routine microbiological data for all patients.</p><p id="Par69">Alternatively or additionally, co-trimoxazole may also have non-antimicrobial effects, particularly on neutrophil function. Sulphamethoxazole-related sulphonamides have effects on neutrophil chemotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and superoxide production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Co-trimoxazole or its individual components (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole) also inhibit neutrophil post-phagocytic, myeloperoxidase-mediated protein iodination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and neutrophil respiratory burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Oxidant stress has been implicated in alveolar epithelial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and epithelial-mesenchymal transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] in IPF, and IPF patients have increased concentrations of 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Moreover, neutrophils have an important role in causing oxidant stress in IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], and neutrophilic alveolitis features frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Furthermore, higher neutrophil counts in sputum are associated with worse lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and the percentage of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) neutrophils at diagnosis is an independent predictor of mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. We will be assessing disease-modifying effects of co-trimoxazole by assessing recognised prognostic biomarkers in the serum in all patients who will also undergo measurement of neutrophil elastase at the end of the trial.</p><p id="Par70">It is inevitable that many participants enrolled in this trial will be frail in view of their age and disease severity. For this reason we decided to keep the research burden to a minimum. The project has been designed so that the trial visits align with routine follow-up assessments for IPF patients, and the visit time points are sufficiently flexible to permit this. In addition (1) we have, for two of the visits, permitted safety blood tests to be undertaken in primary care and (2) have allowed adverse event assessments to be undertaken by phone.</p><p id="Par71">This trial will determine whether co-trimoxazole is efficacious in terms of reducing mortality and or hospitalisation and should also provide some insight into its mechanism of action. Should it be found to have beneficial effects due to its antibiotic activity, further studies may be undertaken using narrower-spectrum antibiotics. Alternatively, if its activity is due to non-antibiotic mechanisms, such as effects on neutrophil activity in IPF, further lines of research may be possible using drugs targeting these mechanisms but lacking antimicrobial activity, thereby obviating the collateral risks of disrupting gut flora and selecting resistance.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Protocol amendments</title><p id="Par72">We modified the protocol in February 2015 as we became aware of new data regarding the risks of hyperkalaemia with co-trimoxazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. We started to exclude participants with a serum potassium greater than 5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L and increase monitoring of participants with a baseline serum potassium of between 4.7 and 5.0&#x000a0;mmol/L who are 66&#x000a0;years old or over and taking potassium-sparing diuretics.</p><p id="Par73">We modified the protocol in May 2016 to widen recruitment criteria to make the trial more generalisable, taking in to account feedback from sites, the TMG and TSC. We removed a requirement for participants to be diagnosed within 2&#x000a0;years of entry into the trial. This exclusion criterion was originally included to prevent stable patients entering into the trial; however, the time of diagnosis was sometimes difficult to determine and also patients with stable disease are unlikely to have significantly reduced lung function (FVC). We increased the maximum FVC value from 70% predicted to 75% predicted as this permitted increased recruitment without reducing the anticipated event rate. We also permitted the 6-week and 9-month visits to be undertaken via the phone with local assessment of safety bloods in order to reduce the patient burden and increase acceptability.</p><p id="Par74">The protocol also included a bronchoscopy sub-study at a small number of selected sites, at which bronchoalveolar lavage fluid would be obtained from a sub-set of 50 participants at baseline and then at 3&#x000a0;months post commencement of trial treatment. However, following recommendations by the DMC and TSC, recruitment to the sub-study was suspended due to a lack of recruitment. As a result it has not been included in this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par81">
