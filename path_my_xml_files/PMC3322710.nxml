In a phase 2 clinical trial, once-weekly taspoglutide added to metformin lowered HbA<sub>1c</sub> by up to 1%, reduced body weight, and was generally well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The efficacy and safety of taspoglutide monotherapy as a first-line agent was investigated in a phase 3 trial in patients with early type 2 diabetes who were inadequately controlled with diet and exercise and naive to antihyperglycemic therapy.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>This 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (clinical trial reg. no. NCT00744926) was conducted at 53 centers internationally and in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. An institutional review/ethics board at each center approved the protocol, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>Eligible patients were adults (aged &#x02265;18 and &#x02264;80 years) with type 2 diabetes naive to antihyperglycemic therapy and uncontrolled with diet and exercise (HbA<sub>1c</sub> 6.5&#x02212;10%; BMI 25&#x02212;45 kg/m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had significant complications associated with type 2 diabetes, symptomatic gastrointestinal diseases, history of bariatric surgery, pancreatic disease, cardiac disease within the past 6 months, history of unstable hypertension, treatment with chronic corticosteroids within the past month, and treatment with weight-lowering agents within the past 12 weeks.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to subcutaneous taspoglutide 10 mg weekly, taspoglutide 20 mg weekly (after 10 mg weekly for the initial 4 weeks), or placebo. Patients were stratified by baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> (&#x0003c;8.0 or &#x02265;8.0%). If glycemic control deteriorated, additional antihyperglycemic rescue medication was prescribed and the patient could continue in the study.</p><p>The primary efficacy end point was absolute change from baseline in HbA<sub>1c</sub> after 24 weeks. Secondary efficacy end points included HbA<sub>1c</sub> response rates (&#x02264;6.5 and &#x02264;7%) and changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fructosamine, body weight, fasting proinsulin, fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, and homeostasis model assessment of &#x003b2;-cell function (HOMA-B). Exploratory end points are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1942/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>.</p><p>Safety assessments included adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and hypoglycemia.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Approximately 130 patients per treatment arm were needed to detect a difference from placebo in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of 0.6% between groups with a power of 90%, assuming an SD of change from baseline of 1.2. Primary efficacy analyses were conducted using intention-to-treat population. The primary end point was analyzed using ANCOVA with treatment, region, and baseline value of the end point as the covariate. Missing data were imputed using the last observation carried forward method. HbA<sub>1c</sub> was tested in each of the two active arms versus placebo using the two-sided 95% CI for treatment difference.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of 373 randomized patients, 368 received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one follow-up safety measurement, and 354 received at least one dose of study medication and had an evaluable baseline and at least one postbaseline measurement of HbA<sub>1c</sub> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1942/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>).

Since this time, Roche has worked on the root cause analysis and on the modified taspoglutide formulations with the input of Ipsen.
