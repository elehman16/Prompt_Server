During the final attack of asthma, 45% died without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> In the setting of a severe asthma attack, high &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use increases the risk of hypokalaemia<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> and QTc prolongation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> and it may cause direct cardiac toxicity aggravated by hypoxia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The risk of death may be greater with high-dose, poorly &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-selective, potent agonists with high intrinsic activity such as isoprenaline and fenoterol, which have been implicated in asthma mortality epidemics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> The association may also be noncausal, because high &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use may be a marker of severe asthma that is poorly responsive to bronchodilator therapy, and thereby a surrogate marker for mortality risk.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup>
</p><p>However, there are limited data on patterns of actual use of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist inhalers by patients during severe exacerbations and in particular life-threatening attacks that lead to hospital admission or death. Studies to date rely on the information from general practitioners (GPs), patient self-report or from the relatives or friends of patients who have died from asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> All of these may provide inaccurate estimates of actual medication use.</p><p>We recently undertook a 6-month randomised controlled trial (RCT) of combination budesonide/formoterol metered-dose inhaler (MDI) therapy when used as per the Single combination inhaler as Maintenance And Reliever Therapy (SMART) regimen or as a fixed-dose treatment with salbutamol MDI as reliever (Standard regimen).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> Data on the actual use of inhaled treatment were measured by electronic monitoring of MDI use. The SMART regimen reduced severe exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids and the number of episodes of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist overuse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> However, in both the treatment groups, in ~90% of occasions in which patients overused their &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist in excess of the level at which their management plan advised to seek medical review, no such review was obtained within the subsequent 48&#x02009;h.</p><p>To further investigate the patterns of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use in the setting of severe exacerbations, we undertook an exploratory analysis of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use in the 14 days leading up to presentation to hospital with a severe exacerbation. Our main hypotheses were that there would be extremely high &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use recorded in most patients regardless of randomised regimen, and that this would be associated with delay in obtaining medical review.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>An exploratory <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of data was undertaken from a 24-week multicentre, prospective, open-label, RCT of the SMART versus Standard regimens in asthma patients aged 16 to 65 years. Eligible patients had a physician&#x02019;s diagnosis of asthma, a current prescription for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and at least one asthma exacerbation in the preceding year. Patients who had high baseline reliever use were not excluded, and there was no step-down in maintenance inhaled treatment on entry into the study. Full details of the trial have been published.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> The Study Protocol is available at <ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrinz.ac.nz/uploads/mrinz/SMART_Protocol.pdf">http://www.mrinz.ac.nz/uploads/mrinz/SMART_Protocol.pdf</ext-link>, and see the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="xob1">Supplementary Material</xref> for further details.

One patient in the Standard group had one hospital attendance within the 7 days following the first attendance. In another patient randomised to Standard treatment who had two hospital attendances, there were no recorded reliever use data before either episode, owing to the use of nonstudy inhaled medication. Thus, electronic data for seven SMART and nine Standard group episodes were included in the analysis of medication use patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). There was no reported use of nonstudy inhaled asthma treatment in any of the other patients before the first hospital attendance. There was no data loss owing to inhaler loss or malfunction.

The use of salbutamol increased around 10 days before hospital attendance, before reducing to a lower level and then progressively increasing in the 5 days before hospital attendance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>For the maximum number of inhaler actuations in a 24-h period, the median(range) was 14(9 to 63) for budesonide/formoterol in the SMART group and 46(6 to 95) for salbutamol in the Standard group.

However, this is balanced by our use of electronic monitoring to provide data on actual patterns of medication use in the setting of severe asthma in real-world patients, which, to our knowledge, is unique.</p><p>Unlike previous similar analyses, which have relied on patient report,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> electronic monitoring provides accurate individual data on actual medication use in the setting of a severe exacerbation, and insight into patterns of behaviour in seeking medical review. We did not collect data on lung function outside of study visits, and thus we are unable to correlate the observed patterns of medication use with peak expiratory flow rates during severe exacerbations. We did not extend this analysis to include urgent GP or after-hours attendance, as this would have resulted in inclusion of some presentations of uncertain severity or clinical significance.</p><p>Entry to the study required patients to have had at least one asthma exacerbation in the preceding year and a current prescription for an inhaled corticosteroid. Although it is uncertain whether patterns of inhaler use and health-seeking behaviour before hospital attendance would differ between this group and other asthmatics with less severe asthma, recruitment of this population has the advantage of generating results relevant to those patients who are at a high risk of a future exacerbation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup>
</p><p>It is inherently difficult to make comparisons between formoterol and salbutamol in terms of levels of overuse, owing to their different pharmacological properties, including duration of bronchodilator action. In our study, we have used a 1:2 dose bioequivalence (6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g:200&#x02009;&#x003bc;g) for formoterol to salbutamol,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> on the basis of bronchodilator studies of repeat dosing in acute asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> The high-use thresholds were based on the dose limits of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use requiring medical review, as defined in the respective self-management plans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation of findings in relation to previously published work</title><p>For both regimens, the plots of average medication use show increasing reliever use from around 5 days preceding the hospital attendance, which is consistent with the self-reported reliever use data at the time of severe asthma exacerbations presented by Tattersfield <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> In our study, the individual data on medication use from the electronic monitoring provided greater detail of how patients vary their reliever therapy during worsening asthma. Patients randomised to SMART had patterns of use broadly consistent with this regimen, although it is probable that some were taking the budesonide/formoterol as a &#x02018;reliever&#x02019; only. In Standard regimen patients, three predominant patterns were observed, two were consistent with the Standard regimen, one of which was characterised by poor maintenance budesonide/formoterol adherence, and the third pattern was consistent with a salbutamol and/or budesonide/formoterol use only as a &#x02018;reliever&#x02019;.</p><p>We previously observed that patients randomised to the SMART regimen had fewer days of nonadherence with ICS in the form of budesonide/formoterol therapy compared with the Standard regimen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup> The present analysis indicates that differences in ICS nonadherence persist within the setting of a severe exacerbation of asthma. In the SMART group, two patients were nonadherent on one day each in the 2 weeks before presentation. One-third of the patients in the Standard group had repeated days on which they took no ICS therapy, despite concomitant extremely high salbutamol use. One patient did not take any ICS throughout the 2-week period despite up to 37 salbutamol actuations per day; another patient had a three-day period of non-ICS use despite up to 46 salbutamol actuations per day; and a third patient had eight days of no ICS use despite up to 30 salbutamol actuations on these days. We propose that these episodes of nonadherence with ICS therapy in the Standard regimen contribute to the progression of severe asthma leading to hospital presentation. It is likely that the SMART regimen prevented nonadherence to ICS therapy in patients poorly adherent to maintenance treatment, because these patients used their budesonide/formoterol inhaler &#x02018;as needed&#x02019; in response to symptoms, rather than as per the formal SMART regimen.</p><p>We were concerned that the higher intrinsic activity of formoterol compared with salbutamol could potentially lead to greater hypokalaemic and cardiovascular effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref></sup> However, patients in the SMART group did not have lower serum potassium levels, presumably because of the markedly lower doses of budesonide/formoterol taken compared with salbutamol. The observation that only one patient had a serum potassium level below the lower limit of the normal range, despite such high &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist doses, indicates that substantive tolerance to the systemic &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> effects occurs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> Unfortunately, too few patients had an electrocardiogram at presentation to hospital to investigate the relative effects on QTc interval.</p><p>Documentation in hospital medical records under-reported the extent of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist overuse leading up to the hospital presentation. This observation probably reflects both under-reporting by patients and the lack of recognition of the importance of accurate determination and documentation of this feature of the history by the attending medical staff. The clinical importance of this is illustrated by the three patients, each of whom used at least 95 salbutamol actuations in the 48&#x02009;h before attendance, and who were subsequently discharged from the ED on the day of their presentation. Our findings of very high doses of self-administered &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist, in the form of salbutamol or formoterol, are consistent with a prior study demonstrating high blood salbutamol concentrations in patients dying of asthma.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for future research, policy and practice</title><p>There was delay in obtaining medical review or initiating oral prednisone despite high &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist use above the predefined levels indicating the requirement for medical review and intervention in half of the patients. This is likely to be an underestimate of the frequency of delay in obtaining medical review and intervention in clinical practice, as the patients were closely followed up in the setting of the clinical trial with implementation of personalised asthma management plans, reinforced at regular clinic review. During periods of overuse, the opportunity exists for patients to seek medical review and receive appropriate medical intervention to reduce the risk of a life-threatening attack. The importance of this behaviour is underlined by the repeated findings from asthma mortality surveys, which showed that marked overuse of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist drugs and associated delay in seeking medical review are important factors contributing to a fatal outcome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1 bib2 bib3 bib4">1&#x02013;4</xref></sup> In the recent United Kingdom National Review of Asthma Deaths, 39% of patients had been prescribed more than 12 short-acting reliever inhalers in the year before death, and 4% of the patients had been prescribed more than 50 reliever inhalers. During the final attack of asthma, 45% died without seeking medical assistance or before emergency care could be provided.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup>
</p><p>Nonadherence to maintenance ICS therapy before hospital attendance was observed in the Standard group. The use of the SMART regimen reduced nonadherence with ICS therapy, which together with the increased self-administration of ICS therapy in the setting of worsening asthma is likely to be responsible for the reduction in severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids with its use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref></sup>
</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, many patients take very high doses of inhaled &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists for prolonged periods before presentation to hospital with severe asthma. During this period, the opportunity exists to seek medical review and appropriate medical intervention to reduce the risk of a life-threatening attack. The SMART regimen led to reduced nonadherence with ICS therapy, which together with the increased self-administration of ICS therapy in the setting of worsening asthma is likely to be responsible for the reduction in severe exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids with its use.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the study participants for their involvement in the study.
