This was a double&#x02010;blind, double&#x02010;dummy study. On Day 1, participants were randomized via an interactive automated system to receive placebo, ertugliflozin 5&#x02009;mg, or ertugliflozin 15&#x02009;mg (1:1:1) once daily, based on a computer&#x02010;generated randomization code, using the method of random permuted blocks. In Phase A, glycaemic rescue therapy with open&#x02010;label metformin was prescribed for participants who exceeded protocol&#x02010;specified glycaemic thresholds. Participants randomized to placebo who did not receive glycaemic rescue in Phase A were switched to blinded metformin in Phase B, beginning at the Week 26 visit. Participants rescued with open&#x02010;label metformin in Phase A continued to receive this in Phase B, in addition to the randomized treatment. Metformin dosing and titration was as follows: Weeks 26 and 27, 500&#x02009;mg metformin twice daily; Weeks 28 and 29, 1000&#x02009;mg metformin in the morning and 500&#x02009;mg in the evening; Week 30 onward, 1000&#x02009;mg metformin twice daily. To maintain blinding in Phase B, participants in the ertugliflozin groups received blinded metformin placebo in addition to continuing to receive ertugliflozin. Therefore, participants in the ertugliflozin groups received up to 52&#x02009;weeks of treatment with ertugliflozin, and those in the control (placebo/metformin) group received 26&#x02009;weeks of placebo, followed by 26&#x02009;weeks of metformin therapy. During Phase B, glycaemic rescue therapy with glimepiride was initiated in participants with FPG&#x02009;&#x0003e;11.1&#x02009;mmol/L (200&#x02009;mg/dL) or HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003e;8.0% (64&#x02009;mmol/mol). Participants who received glycaemic rescue remained in the study and continued to receive study medication in a blinded fashion, unless they met any of the discontinuation criteria.</p></sec><sec id="dom13251-sec-0009"><label>2.3</label><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary objective of the Phase B portion of the trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of ertugliflozin through Week 52.

Genital mycotic infections (GMIs), urinary tract infections (UTIs), symptomatic hypoglycaemia and hypovolaemia were prespecified &#x0201c;Tier 1 AEs.&#x0201d; AEs related to GMIs, UTIs and hypovolaemia were identified based on prespecified, sponsor&#x02010;generated, customized queries of preferred terms. Because of the mechanism of action of ertugliflozin, osmotic diuresis AEs were assessed in addition to hypovolaemia AEs. Tier 1 analysis of hypoglycaemia included the numbers and percentages of participants experiencing &#x02265;1 AE of symptomatic hypoglycaemia, regardless of biochemical documentation. The incidence of documented hypoglycaemia, defined as episodes with a glucose level&#x02009;&#x02264;3.9&#x02009;mmol/L (70&#x02009;mg/dL), with or without symptoms, was assessed. Severe hypoglycaemia, defined as episodes that required the assistance of a third party, was also evaluated.</p><p>Prespecified events were subject to adjudication by an external panel of independent physicians, with medical expertise relevant to the event type, who were blinded to participant treatment. These Clinical Adjudication Committees (CACs) evaluated cardiovascular events and all&#x02010;cause deaths, fractures, pancreatitis, renal and hepatic events. Potential cases of ketoacidosis were reviewed by an internal blinded case review committee.

SGLT2 inhibitors lower glucose independently of insulin and &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell function.<xref rid="dom13251-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, <xref rid="dom13251-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> Consequently, this mechanism may lend itself to durable HbA1c lowering in patients with T2DM. Ertugliflozin provided effective lowering of HbA1c, with mean reductions from baseline of approximately 1% at 1&#x02009;year. The durable HbA1c lowering from Week 26 through Week 52 is consistent with the &#x003b2;&#x02010;cell&#x02013;independent mechanism of action of SGLT2 inhibitors. Approximately one&#x02010;quarter of participants in the ertugliflozin groups had HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003c;7% at Week 52 on ertugliflozin monotherapy. The proportion of participants in the ertugliflozin groups with HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003c;6.5% at Week 52 was approximately half that observed in the placebo/metformin group. This may be explained, in part, by a lower mean HbA1c at baseline in the placebo/metformin group compared with the ertugliflozin groups, and the fact that participants in the placebo group who were not rescued through Week 26 probably had lower HbA1c values prior to initiating metformin in Phase B. Longer&#x02010;term glycaemic data will be available from other clinical studies in the programme (NCT01999218, NCT02033889, NCT01986881).</p><p>To minimize the length of time that participants with T2DM received no background therapy, the design of this study included a placebo&#x02010;switch paradigm. Participants initially randomized to placebo who had not required glycaemic rescue therapy were switched to blinded metformin at Week 26. The protocol used a rapid dose&#x02010;titration scheme and the median achieved dose of metformin in the Phase B portion of the study was 1790&#x02009;mg/d. Approximately two&#x02010;thirds of participants were receiving a final metformin dose of 2000&#x02009;mg/d. At the end of the study, participants who received ertugliflozin monotherapy achieved a change from baseline in HbA1c similar to that of those who received metformin, with means of &#x02212;1.0%, &#x02212;0.9% and &#x02212;1.0% in the placebo/metformin, ertugliflozin 5&#x02009;mg and ertugliflozin 15&#x02009;mg groups, respectively. The reduction with metformin is in line with prior studies in which the same dose was used.<xref rid="dom13251-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Although this study was not powered for a formal comparison of the efficacy of the 2 ertugliflozin doses, the results for the proportion of participants with HbA1c&#x02009;&#x0003c;7.0% at Week 26, along with the reductions from baseline in HbA1c and FPG, are suggestive of incremental glycaemic efficacy with the 15&#x02010;mg dose relative to the 5&#x02010;mg dose. The reduction in body weight at Week 26 in the ertugliflozin groups was maintained through Week 52, with no evidence of weight regain. Participants in the ertugliflozin groups had reductions from baseline in SBP of approximately 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;mm Hg. The reduction in body weight observed after initiation of metformin in the placebo group is similar to that reported in 2 recent active&#x02010;controlled studies of dapagliflozin vs metformin, in which reductions of 1.3 to 1.4&#x02009;kg were observed with metformin at 24&#x02009;weeks.<xref rid="dom13251-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> Similarly, in a head&#x02010;to&#x02010;head study of metformin vs dulaglutide, a 2.2&#x02009;kg weight loss was observed at 26&#x02009;weeks in patients who received metformin.<xref rid="dom13251-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>
</p><p>Ertugliflozin was generally well tolerated throughout the 52&#x02010;week treatment period in this study population. The overall incidences of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study medication were similar across treatment groups. The incidence of GMIs was higher in the ertugliflozin groups compared with the placebo/metformin group, but there was no increased incidence of UTI, symptomatic hypoglycaemia or hypovolaemia AEs. Similar to reports for other SGLT2 inhibitors, the majority of GMI events occurred early in the study.<xref rid="dom13251-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dom13251-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> There was no increase in AEs associated with osmotic diuresis.</p><p>Initial mean reductions in eGFR in the ertugliflozin groups at Week 6 were followed by mean increases, returning approximately to baseline values by Week 52. In the ertugliflozin groups, changes seen in magnesium, phosphate and haemoglobin at Week 26 remained stable through Week 52. The clinical relevance (if any) of such changes observed with SGLT2 inhibitors is presently unknown. Analysis of lipid parameters showed a greater increase in LDL&#x02010;C and HDL&#x02010;C levels in the ertugliflozin groups compared with the placebo/metformin group, although there was no increase in the LDL&#x02010;C:HDL&#x02010;C ratio. Data from the ongoing ertugliflozin cardiovascular outcome trial (VERTIS CV, NCT01986881) will provide information on the effect of ertugliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes.</p><p>Ertugliflozin, administered to adults with inadequately controlled T2DM despite diet and exercise, improved glycaemic control and reduced body weight and SBP. Both doses provided a clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in HbA1c that was maintained over 52&#x02009;weeks. There was no increase in the incidence of symptomatic hypoglycaemia, UTI or hypovolaemia AEs with ertugliflozin, but the incidence of GMIs was higher compared with placebo/metformin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="dom13251-supitem-0001"><caption><p>
