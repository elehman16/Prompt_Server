However, evidence of effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability for these types of intervention is currently limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par3">A 2-arm, parallel group, cluster-randomised feasibility trial to assess the acceptability of prompts to break up sedentary behaviour was conducted with office workers in a commercial bank (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x02009;21). Participants were assigned to an education only group (EG) or prompt and education group (PG). Both groups received education on reducing and breaking up sitting at work, and the PG also received hourly prompts, delivered by Microsoft Outlook over 10&#x000a0;weeks, reminding them to stand. Objective measurements of sedentary behaviour were made using activPAL monitors worn at three time points: baseline, in the last 2&#x000a0;weeks of the intervention period and 12&#x000a0;weeks after the intervention. Focus groups were conducted to explore the acceptability of the intervention and the motivations and barriers to changing sedentary behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par4">Randomly generated, customised prompts, delivered by Microsoft Outlook, with messages about breaking up sitting, proved to be a feasible and acceptable way of delivering prompts to office workers. Participants in both groups reduced their sitting, but changes were not maintained at follow-up. The education session seemed to increase outcome expectations of the benefits of changing sedentary behaviour and promote self-regulation of behaviour in some participants. However, low self-efficacy and a desire to conform to cultural norms were barriers to changing behaviour.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par5">Prompts delivered by Microsoft Outlook were a feasible, low-cost way of prompting office workers to break up their sedentary behaviour, although further research is needed to determine whether this has an additional impact on sedentary behaviour, to education alone.

This increased risk may be independent to the amount of physical activity an individual may perform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and evidence suggests that prolonged and uninterrupted sedentary events have a greater negative impact on health than SB accumulated in shorter events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">Working-age adults are increasingly employed in low-activity occupations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with office workers identified as one of the most sedentary occupational groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Office workers spend 65&#x02013;75% of their working day sitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] and make significantly fewer breaks in sedentary time during working hours than in leisure time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Targeting the SB of office workers has the potential to improve the health of individuals and positively impact presenteeism, absenteeism, and, ultimately, the economy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent expert statement suggested that desk-based office workers should attempt to accumulate 2&#x000a0;h a day standing/light activity during working hours, eventually progressing to 4&#x000a0;h daily and take regular breaks from sitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. However, a Cochrane Review noted that there was a lack of evidence from good quality studies of interventions that were effective at reducing SB in the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Providing office workers with sit-stand desks, facilitating continued use of a desk whilst standing, have demonstrated reductions in total sitting of approx. 60&#x02013;90&#x000a0;min a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, upgrading office furniture for an entire workforce may not be financially feasible, especially as the&#x000a0; long-term use and benefits to health of sit-stand desks is yet to be proven. Other studies have trialled one-to-one consultations with employees to initiate behaviour change, using tools such as mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], behaviour change counselling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and person-centred consultation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] to mixed effect. The cost implications of delivering such one-to-one interventions may also be an issue for large organisations.</p><p id="Par15">The use of prompts as a way of reminding office workers to break up their sitting has had promising results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Prompts, as a behaviour change technique, have been defined as an &#x02018;environmental or social stimulus with the purpose of prompting or cueing the behavior&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] and may be useful at breaking the &#x02018;habit&#x02019; of sitting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Participants who received prompts achieved a significant reduction in the number (&#x02212;&#x02009;6.8%) and length (&#x02212;&#x02009;15.5%) of prolonged sitting events (&#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], an increase in self-reported standing of +&#x02009;7.99&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.44&#x000a0;min a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], a significant reduction in total work day sitting (&#x02212;&#x02009;6.6%) and prolonged (&#x0003e;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;min) events (&#x02212;&#x02009;13%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and an increase in weekly work time standing of +&#x02009;9% when prompts were delivered in conjunction with receiving a sit-stand desk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Little was reported on the messages delivered by the prompts in these studies, but positively framed and tailored messages had been shown to have greater impact on health behaviours by enhancing individuals&#x02019; health intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">As sedentary behaviour, as a distinct and independent health risk, is an emerging area of research, it cannot be assumed that all members of the general public are aware that sitting could be detrimental to their health. Providing such information usually forms part of interventions to reduce sitting, if not to intentionally form part of the behaviour change process, then to fulfil the ethical requirements of the research. However, this element is rarely described within SB interventions, let alone evaluated in terms of its impact. Where educational components are recorded, they are often too vague to draw comparisons or to elicit best practice. Yet, education could be important in forming individuals&#x02019; intentions to change their sedentary behaviour, and in doing so, form an essential foundation for subsequent components of an intervention to bring about action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. For example, prompts or the presence of a standing desk reminding people to act on the intention to break up sitting, initiated during an earlier education session.</p><p id="Par17">There is a current lack of understanding with regard to how and why interventions such as prompts may be successful at reducing SB in a workplace setting. An important first step in gaining such understanding is identifying or developing explanatory theory for behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], which has so far been lacking in SB research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Both the theory of planned behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and dual process theory of motivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] have been studied with regard to explaining sedentary behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], but their inability to allow for the potential influence of the environment may prohibit them from fully explaining workplace SB. One theory that recognises the complex interaction between individuals and their environment is social cognitive theory (SCT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] which argues that the behaviour and opinions of those in our immediate environment are more likely to influence behaviour than regulations alone. SCT identifies five key influences for behaviour: (i) situation/environment, (ii) outcome expectations, (iii) self-efficacy, (iv) self-regulation and (v) observational learning. To date, SCT has not been applied to SB. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of using Microsoft Outlook as a vehicle for delivering customisable prompts to office workers, alongside education, to encourage breaks in SB during working hours. In addition, an indication of both the impact of, and behaviour change mechanisms behind, education and prompts on SB was sought through the collection of both quantitative outcome measures and qualitative data. It is recognised that whilst sample sizes may preclude definitive conclusions regarding efficacy, such conclusions may have important implications for future trial design. This study is structured using the updated CONSORT guidelines for reporting feasibility trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], and an adapted CONSORT flow diagram is presented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par18">This feasibility study was a 2-arm, parallel group and cluster-randomised trial.

Full- and part-time employees working in a large open-plan office were recruited via email and posters displayed in the workplace. The recruitment email was sent to all employees (~&#x02009;150). Volunteers were included if they met the following criteria: age 18 or over; self-reported that they were primarily engaged in sedentary, computer-based activities at a non-height adjustable desk during working hours; had&#x000a0;access to Microsoft Outlook calendar; and absence of a pre-existing health condition that prohibited standing on a regular basis. All potential participants were given a participant information sheet and asked to sign a consent form.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Education intervention</title><p id="Par20">All participants attended an education session, delivered by a health-care professional, on the health risks associated with SB, the potential benefits of breaking up prolonged sitting, and tips on how to reduce sedentary behaviour at work. For example, prompting time management to facilitate regular breaks in sitting throughout the day. The information provided was based on recently published research in the field of occupational sedentary behaviour. Each education session lasted approximately 45&#x02013;60&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par21">To minimise contamination between groups in the open plan office, participants were assigned to one of two equal sized clusters according to their geographical location in the office. Clusters were then randomly assigned to being in the Education Group (EG) who received no further intervention after the education session or the Prompt Group (PG) who received a 10-week prompt intervention in addition to the education session. Randomisation was achieved using sealed envelopes prepared by a third party. The researcher was blinded to cluster allocation during collection of activity data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Prompt intervention</title><p id="Par22">Seventy brief, positively framed messages centred around taking breaks from sitting were compiled. Where appropriate, messages included the organisation&#x02019;s name and location. For example, &#x02018;Help Glasgow make a stand for better health!&#x02019; A custom Excel macro was used to assign one prompt message to a randomly generated time point every hour. Prompt times were restricted to a half hour period in the middle of each hour, to prevent prompts appearing close together, e.g. at 09.58 and again at 10.02. Prompts were generated for a period of 10&#x000a0;weeks, taking into account planned periods of absence from the office. A 10-week intervention period allowed adequate time for new behaviours to become a habit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Microsoft Outlook was selected as a vehicle for delivering prompts to participants as it is widely available, has familiarity of use, poses no additional cost, and does not involve the security issues of downloading commercially available prompt software. Individual excel files containing prompt messages and timings were emailed to participants in the PG with instruction on how to upload the prompts to a newly created calendar in Microsoft Outlook. During the 10-week intervention period, prompts appeared as meeting reminders on the screen, which could be &#x02018;snoozed&#x02019; or &#x02018;dismissed&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par23">The primary outcome measures of the study were to assess the feasibility of the interventions in terms of:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par24">Eligibility, recruitment and follow-up rates.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par25">Acceptability of and utility of information from the education session.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par26">Acceptability and ease of use of prompts delivered by Microsoft Outlook.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par27">Insight into the experiences, motivations and barriers of participants with regard to making changes to SB.</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par28">These outcomes were assessed using logs kept of recruitment, retention rates and any operational issues regarding the prompts.

The activPAL is a tri-axial accelerometer worn on the midline of the anterior aspect of the thigh, and from the signal, time-stamps data into categories of sitting/lying, standing and walking. It has been validated as an accurate tool for capturing changes in posture and motion in adults during daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. ActivPAL monitors were heat sealed inside transparent plastic tubing and further sealed with a waterproof dressing (Opsite Flexifix, Smith &#x00026; Nephew). Participants were asked to keep a diary, recording waking and working hours, and any periods of non-wear, for the same 7-day period. Activity data was cross-validated with completed diaries.

The minimum data required for inclusion was 3&#x000a0;days of data, including at least one working day, for at least two of the three time periods. Inclusion criteria were set at this level in order to maximise the amount of data available to analyse from a small sample. SB outcomes were analysed using SPSS (Statistics Package for Social Sciences IBM version 22). Although this was a feasibility study, interferential statistics were performed to provide information about potential effectiveness.

The process of generating and uploading prompts proved straightforward, with no operational issues reported. In this regard, using Excel and Microsoft Outlook proved to be a feasible, low-cost method of providing office workers with randomly timed reminders to break up their sitting. However, despite variation between 50 prompt messages, participants reported ignoring prompts before the end of the intervention period, and with lack of evidence that prompts resulted in greater reductions in SB than education alone, further research is needed to ascertain whether it is worthwhile rolling out this intervention on a larger scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Experiences, motivations and barriers for changing sedentary behaviour</title><p id="Par77">Thematic analysis of focus group data identified themes in line with the key constructs of social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This has provided valuable insight into why changes were or were not made to SB during and after the intervention.</p><p id="Par78">Focus group participants were in agreement that both the office environment and the situation of performing work tasks greatly influenced their SB at work. Analysis of the transcripts suggested that the education session was successful at increasing participants outcome expectations regarding the benefits of changing their SB. Studies have shown that individuals are more likely to act on health issues if they perceive they are susceptible to the problem; it has serious consequences and that a course of action will minimise these consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. However, not all participants were convinced that they needed to improve their SB patterns, suggesting that providing feedback on baseline SB may be valuable in terms of encouraging change and setting behaviour goals. Goal setting and feedback are common behavioural strategies associated with self-regulation of behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. A recent review of techniques used in SB interventions found that setting behavioural goals was the most frequently discussed behavioural change technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">Following the education session, some participants that developed their own behavioural strategies to break up their sitting had identified specific work tasks to be done whilst standing. This method not only provided an existing cue (the task) for changing posture but also fulfilled the desire to be carrying out a work task whilst standing that was expressed by participants in both groups. In addition, by associating particular tasks with standing, some of the need to make a conscious decision to stand was removed. Evidence suggests that when a behaviour is not demanding and more easily engaged in (e.g. sitting at a desk), cognitive control systems give way to regulation by lower control systems in which behaviour is automatic and less consciously thought about [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Assigning tasks to standing could therefore be an effective strategy that has the potential to result in long-term behaviour change.</p><p id="Par80">Focus group discussions suggested that an important barrier to changing SB was low self-efficacy. Participants felt that they did not have the ability to change their SB during working hours due to be the pressure of work tasks that prevented taking a break or caused them to lose track of time. This endorses the findings of other studies in which participants cited perceived time pressures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and interruptions to productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] as barriers to taking breaks from sitting. In this way, employees felt they were not to &#x02018;blame&#x02019; for their sitting behaviour, almost absolving themselves from responsibility, an attitude at odds with the UK NHS manifesto to empower citizens with greater control over their health and care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">Observational learning or how non-sitting behaviour was perceived by and replicated (or not) by others was important to focus group participants. They perceived that they would look &#x02018;weird&#x02019; and &#x02018;strange&#x02019; if they stood at their desks and expressed a desire not to be carrying out a behaviour that was not the office norm. Changing what constitutes normal behaviour within an office is likely to be the key to facilitating large-scale behavioural change to reduce sitting at work. It will involve changing the culture not only in terms of behaviour, but in terms of the environment, policies, leadership and individual beliefs. Little is understood about how to facilitate such change. The focus of studies on workplace culture tends to centre around improving employee performance and productivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] rather than health. If breaking SB at work is seen to negatively correlate with the global objective of improved productivity, then this will pose a serious barrier to encouraging changes in work practice. Employers, perhaps, need to be convinced of the health benefits of reducing SB in their employees in terms of gains in productivity and reduced losses due to sickness absence.</p><p id="Par82">Focus group participants spoke about the study having increased their knowledge and outcome expectations, and, for some, their ability to self-regulate their SB. However, low self-efficacy and a desire to conform to normal sitting behaviour proved to be barriers to change. Health promotion interventions which utilise social support and increase self-efficacy are more likely to have a positive outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Future interventions to reduce SB in the workplace should look at ways of focusing on these constructs of SCT in order to maximise behaviour change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Outcome measures of sedentary behaviour</title><p id="Par83">Both the education and prompt group had a reduction in mean from baseline to intervention measurement for total sitting, sitting event duration and both measures of prolonged sitting during work hours. Evidence from focus group discussions suggest this decrease may have been the result of the education sessions, with participants from both groups adopting their own behavioural strategies to break up SB. Focus group participants felt that the prompts had been initially effective, but the impact had reduced during the intervention; it could be that the timing of the second measurement period was too late to capture such short-term changes. A significant reduction in the number and length of prolonged sitting events in a prompt intervention group has been demonstrated in the first 5&#x000a0;days of prompt delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Future studies should attempt to clarify if there is a short-term impact of prompts on SB and at what point they begin to lose effectiveness in order to modify intervention design to facilitate longer term behaviour change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Limitations</title><p id="Par84">The recruitment target for this study was not met, and ways of maximising recruitment should be considered in future studies. Although not its primary aim, the small sample size did not allow inferences to be drawn regarding the statistical significance of the differences in SB outcomes observed. Based on our post hoc calculations, a definitive trial should seek to recruit a minimum of 27 participants per group in order to be able to detect significant changes in SB outcomes. Whilst cluster randomisation was used to minimise contamination between groups, it also means that what might be being measured is behavioural patterns influenced by neighbouring colleagues rather than solely the impact of the intervention. Non-clustered randomisation to groups might have prevented such influences, but at the same time, it is important to acknowledge that participants felt self-conscious of behaviour not perceived to be the norm by others in the office. Participants&#x02019; baseline measurements may have been influenced by information about SB in the UK media occurring around the same time, and also the information given to them in the participant information sheet, explaining the purpose of the study. Either or both of these factors may have led them to alter their SB during baseline measurement. Whilst it is not possible to eliminate exposure to media, steps could be taken to minimise how much information was given in the study materials, e.g. participant information sheet. Blinding participants to the study hypothesis has been suggested as a method of reducing bias in trials on non-pharmacological interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par85">This feasibility study provides a valuable contribution to research into the use of prompts and education on changing the SB of office workers. Focus group participants evaluated both of these components favourably, and they provide a low-cost solution that would be easy to implement on a wider scale. The education component seemed to be successful at increasing outcome expectations and self-regulation in some individuals, leading to short-term reductions in SB. However, further research is needed to determine whether there is any added benefit to providing prompts in addition to education, and how any short-term behaviour change can be translated into long-term changes that are sustainable over time. The role of office culture in terms of what is seen as normal behaviour, and ways of increasing self-efficacy may play an important part in future intervention design.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>EG</term><def><p id="Par7">Education only group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PG</term><def><p id="Par8">Prompt and education group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SB</term><def><p id="Par9">Sedentary behaviour</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCT</term><def><p id="Par10">Social cognitive theory</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the contribution of Catrina Henderson &#x00026; Graeme Stevenson from the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives for initiating contact with the organisation involved in the research and contributing towards the study design.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par87">This research was funded by Glasgow Caledonian University and the Scottish Centre for Healthy Working Lives (SCHWL) who were involved in identifying a suitable organisation from which to recruit participants from the study.
