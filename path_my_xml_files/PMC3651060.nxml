Beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) and Fluticasone propionate (FP) are 2 inhaled corticosteroids that frequently be used in treatment of patients with asthma. In this study, the effectiveness of BDP and FP in management of asthmatic children was investigated. In this trial, 50 children with moderate persistent asthma were randomly selected to receive either BDP 600 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g or FP 500 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g for 3 months. Pulmonary function tests were measured in both groups at the beginning of study and monthly after treatment. Daily and night symptoms and consistency of drugs were also measured. There was significantly better FEV1 in patients receiving FP compared with the BDP group (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.01). There was also statistically significant difference in patients receiving FP compared with BDP group in increment of FVC, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75 (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.005). Night symptoms were significantly improved in the FP group from the first month (<italic>P </italic>= 0.001), while improvement of daily symptoms in this group compared with the BDP group was found from the second month (<italic>P </italic>= 0.001). Although symptoms and pulmonary function tests results were improved in both groups receiving either FP or BDP, this study suggested that FP was more effective than BDP in controlling moderate asthma in children.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>asthma</kwd><kwd>beclomethasone</kwd><kwd>fluticasone</kwd><kwd>inhaled corticosteroids</kwd><kwd>pulmonary function tests</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title/><p>Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways. There is a remarkable increase in prevalence of asthma worldwide, which makes it as one of the most common chronic diseases, especially in childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

Fluticasone propionate (FP) and beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) are 2 commonly ICS for the treatment of asthma.</p><p>There were several studies to compare the effects of these drugs in controlling asthma in different doses. This study was performed to compare the efficacy and acceptability of FP and BDP in nearly equal doses, in the treatment of asthmatic children with moderate persistent asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>Fifty patients with diagnosis of moderate persistent asthma were enrolled in this study. The patients aged between 6 and 17 years and referred to the Allergy Clinic of Valie Asr Hospital (Zanjan, Iran) with symptoms of moderate persistent asthma within at least 6 months before enrollment. All these patients had symptoms of cough and wheezing (at night and after exercise) and a FEV1 of between 60-80% on the basis of NAEPP guideline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Patients with other known causes of wheezing, such as cystic fibrosis and heart disorders, were excluded from this study. None of these patients had been receiving any ICS before the study.</p><p>It was an open label study in which the patients were randomly with unpredictable sequence, allocated into 2 groups. The first group received 250 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g FP twice daily (2 puff BD) and the second group received 200 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g BDP 3 times daily (4 puff TDS) for 3 months. All children were instructed to use ICS by mouthpiece spacer, provided by local company (Asan Nafas, Tehran Fanavar Teb, Iran). Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were done at the beginning of study and each month till the end of this study. Occurrence of daily and night symptoms and nonadherence of drug receiving were recorded to dairy card and assessed monthly.</p><p>Both ICS were registered trade mark of Cipla Company and prescribed open label; both of them had CFC propellant. Pulmonary function tests were done by one person who did not know any information about the kind of therapy. Spirometry was performed with a Jaeger Master Scope Spirometer (VIASYS Healthcare, Hochberg, Germany). The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Zanjan University of Medical Science; all patients or their parents gave written informed consent before enrollment. This study was also registered in the Iranian Registry of Control Trials (IRCT: 138812042976N2).</p><p>The results are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD. The One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test procedure was performed to check normal distribution of data by comparing the observed cumulative distribution function for a variable with a specified theoretical distribution. Comparisons of data between 2 groups were made using <italic>t </italic>test (for parametric data) and Mann-Whitney <italic>U </italic>test (for nonparametric data), <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

This study showed that both FP and BDP can improve the symptoms and PFT results. However, the degree of improvement in daily and night symptoms and PFT results among patients treated with FP was significantly better than the BDP group. This could be because of differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of FP and BDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Although the results of our study was in agreement with some previous studies toward benefit of FP than BDP,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] the studies by Nong et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Karakoc et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] did not find any significant difference in lung function improvement and symptom scores in asthmatic children receiving either BDP or FP. However, these studied might be limited by the fact that they considered half dose of FP than BDP in their study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Other studies showed CFC free product of BDP compared with FDP (or beclomethasone/formeterole vs. fluticasone/salmeterole) administration were equally effective for improving asthma control in children with mild to moderate asthma at the same daily dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Molimard et al showed that efficacy of beclomethasone extrafine aerosol was significantly better than fluticasone and budesonide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In our study, we used CFC-propelled BDP and did not find better response by this product.</p><p>BDP was the first ICS, substituted for systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of chronic asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It is the cheapest ICS currently available at both low and high doses and may remain so even, when CFC-propelled products are excluded,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] which might lead to good acceptance of BDP in our patients. It should be noted that similar results were achieved in drug administration in BDP and FP groups in third month, despite greater daily doses of BDP than FP.</p><p>ICS are effective potent medication in asthma with fewer side effects,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] but different studies showed increasing evidence of adverse effects in patients treated with Fluticasone than Beclomethasone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, our patients did not have any problem such as hoarseness, pharyngitis, or candidiasis of oropharyngeal area during the study period. This may be because of instruction of patients in using spacer and mouth rinsing after drug prescribing and the short course of therapy.</p><p>It should be emphasized that conclusion from this study is limited by the fact that we performed an open label study, and we did not include a placebo control as it was unethical to keep a group untreated. Indeed we compared CFC-BDP (with its lower efficacy compared with FP at equivalent doses given TDS (raising issues of adherence) with FP given at similar doses but BD. However, BDP is a short acting ICS in comparison to FP, and routinely prescribed more than 2 times a day, but FP could be even prescribed once per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; and thus, BDP was prescribed more times than FP in our study. By the way, the patients recruited and the methodology used should be taken into consideration before generlizability of the findings.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that FP in a daily dose of 500 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g results in a significantly greater increase in PFT results and improvement of symptoms than BDP at the dose of 600 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g in children with moderate asthma. Further studies with different doses of these drugs and different types of ICS are recommended to choose the best effective ICS with fewer side effect and better acceptance for patients.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p><italic>The author would like to thank Dr. Noureddin Mousavinasab for valuable advice and statistical expertise.
