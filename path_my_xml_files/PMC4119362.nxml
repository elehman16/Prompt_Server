There are two main groups of surgical procedures: Free graft and pedicle flap.

Also, patients allergic or sensitive to any medication or those who had contraindications for periodontal surgery were excluded from the study. The present study was assessed and approved by the Ethical Committee of the Islamic Azad University of Tehran, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>Twenty-seven eligible patients with 66 gingival recessions fulfilled the 6-month examination. Following selection, all patients received plaque control instruction and professional tooth cleansing on all tooth surfaces.

The control (group III) teeth were treated similarly but without additional application of any root conditioner.</p><p>After local anesthesia, an intrasulcular incision was made with a-15C surgical blade on the buccal aspect of the involved tooth. The adjacent papillae were only partially involved to preserve soft tissue and to leave the buccal gingival margin of the adjacent teeth intact. A frenum pull (when present) was eliminated before surgery. Two oblique releasing incisions were made from the mesial and distal extremities of the intrasulcular buccal incision beyond the mucogingival junction. The interdental papillae were preserved as much as possible (facial portion was de-epithelialized to create a connective tissue bed).

Also, our results demonstrated that there was a significant difference for RD between the EDTA and acid group and also between the EDTA and control group.</p><p>Several studies have compared the effect of Emdogain (EMD) and EDTA gel and CPF for covering exposed root surfaces; controversial results have been reported. Pilloni <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and Castellanous <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] showed that topical application of EMD and EDTA are beneficial in augmenting the effects of the CPF in terms of the amount of root coverage gained. Hagewald <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Modica <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] reported that additional use of EMD and EDTA, together with CPF technique for recession coverage showed no significant difference in overall clinical outcome. Several possible reasons may explain these controversies such as differences in methodology, duration of the study, and also data variability.</p><p>In the present study, the relative values for root coverage expressed as a percentage after 6 months in the EDTA group showed it to be superior. Hagewald <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] reported that the mean values for treatment success in the two treatment groups were 80% for experimental sites and 79% for control sites.</p><p>In this study, while there was a significant difference between the EDTA and acid group for gingival recession coverage (80.13% vs. 52.6%), no statistically significant differences for gingival recession coverage were found between the acid and control group. The relative values expressed as a percentage after 6 months for the acid and control group were 52.16% and 64.5%, respectively, and the absolute values of the change expressed in millimeter were also similar. Thus, there is no additional benefit for citric acid application on root surfaces for root coverage. This is in accordance with some other studies[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and suggests that, low PH etching agents such as citric acid exerts an immediate (within 20 s) necrotizing effect on both mucosal flaps and periodontal tissue. This is in sharp contrast to EDTA gel which operates at neutral PH. EDTA gel did not induce any detectable necrosis during the experimental period.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Thus, the superficial necrotizing effect on exposed periodontal tissues by citric acid in the present study may have restricted the healing potential of these tissues while etching at neutral PH (EDTA gel) may be argued to enhanced periodontal healing by inducing less adverse effects and consequently making full use of the healing potential of surrounding periodontal tissues.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The CAL was improved by reduction of RD and PPD in the EDTA and control group after 6 months. This is in accordance with other studies[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] and suggests that recession coverage by CPF procedure does not result in pocket formation but in tissue attachment on the previously exposed root surface; to facilitate this tissue attachment it has been advocated to condition the root surfaces with agents with a neutral PH. These agents such as EDTA gel 24% may be able to produce a biocompatible surface more conductive to periodontal membrane cell colonization after removal of root surface smear without compromising the vitality of the surrounding periodontium.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>On the other hand, acidic etching agents such as citric acid (PH = 1) was able to dissolves the mineral component of the roots and erodes the collagenous matrix[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and may not only be unable to produce additional new attachment[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] but may also exert an immediate necrotizing effect on the periodontium.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>The clinical significance of attached gingival width is questionable, as the dimensions of the keratinized tissue are not related to the health and stability of the gingival tissues.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Wennstrom and Zucchelli suggested that tooth brushing habits may be of greater importance for maintenance of the surgically established position of the gingival margin.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Short follow-up duration was one of the limitations of the present study. Long-term clinical studies are needed to evaluate the long-term clinical effects of the application of EDTA gel 24% and the stability of the results achieved.
