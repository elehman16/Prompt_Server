Healthcare professionals frequently provide guidance on physical activity, but often do not meet guideline levels of physical activity themselves. The main objective of this study is to develop and test the efficacy of a tailored intervention to increase healthcare professionals&#x02019; physical activity participation and quality of life, and to reduce work-related stress and absenteeism. This is the first study to compare the additive effects of three forms of a tailored intervention using different techniques from behavioural theory, which differ according to their focus on motivational, self-regulatory and/or habitual processes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>Healthcare professionals (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;192) will be recruited from four hospitals in Perth, Western Australia, via email lists, leaflets, and posters to participate in the four group randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to one of four conditions: (1) education only (non-tailored information only), (2) education plus intervention components to enhance motivation, (3) education plus components to enhance motivation and self-regulation, and (4) education plus components to enhance motivation, self-regulation and habit formation. All intervention groups will receive a computer-tailored intervention administered via a web-based platform and will receive supporting text-messages containing tailored information, prompts and feedback relevant to each condition. All outcomes will be assessed at baseline, and at 3-month follow-up. The primary outcome assessed in this study is physical activity measured using activity monitors. Secondary outcomes include: quality of life, stress, anxiety, sleep, and absenteeism. Website engagement, retention, preferences and intervention fidelity will also be evaluated as well as potential mediators and moderators of intervention effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first study to examine a tailored, technology-supported intervention aiming to increase physical activity in healthcare professionals. The study will evaluate whether including additional theory-based behaviour change techniques aimed at promoting motivation, self-regulation and habit will lead to increased physical activity participation relative to information alone. The online platform developed in this study has potential to deliver efficient, scalable and personally-relevant intervention that can be translated to other occupational settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Australian New-Zealand Clinical Trial Registry: ACTRN12616000462482, submitted 29/03/2016, prospectively registered 8/04/2016.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Computer-tailoring</kwd><kwd>Behaviour change</kwd><kwd>Behaviour maintenance</kwd><kwd>Habit</kwd><kwd>Healthcare professionals</kwd><kwd>Physical activity</kwd><kwd>Web-based</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>TEKES and the Finnish Academy</institution></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Future Leader Fellowships funded by the National Heart Foundation</institution></funding-source><award-id>ID100427</award-id><award-id>ID100029</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vandelanotte</surname><given-names>Corneel</given-names></name><name><surname>Duncan</surname><given-names>Mitch</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia</institution></funding-source><award-id>APP1090517</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Short</surname><given-names>Camille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Curtin University, Central Queensland University, and a grant from the Health Collaborative Research Network (HCRN) Australia</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Physical inactivity is related to increased risk of a number of chronic diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, obesity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Engaging in regular physical activity is related to reduced risk of chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, positive outcomes of physical activity include improved quality of life, better sleep, and reduced stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. World Health Organisation physical activity guidelines for adults to gain health benefits is to undertake at least 150&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity physical activity per week (e.g., walking, cycling), or at least 75&#x000a0;min of vigorous intensity physical activity per week (e.g., running, playing football) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Globally, 1 in 4 adults does not meet these recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>Healthcare professionals have a key role to play in the promotion of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; however they often do not meet guideline levels of physical activity themselves. For instance a study focussing on nurses&#x02019; physical activity (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;325) indicated that more than half of the assessed sample did not meet guideline levels of physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Those who were less active were also more likely to report poor general health and worse sleep patterns than their active counterparts. Despite significant health education among health care professionals, it appears that the health knowledge often does not translate into their own health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>In addition, there is a relationship between personal physical activity behaviours of healthcare professionals and their health-promotion practice. A systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] of cross-sectional studies (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) investigating this relationship found that a higher personal physical activity level in healthcare professionals was associated with higher physical activity-promoting practices in most studies. Health professionals with positive attitudes towards physical activity were also more likely to promote physical activity to their patients.</p><p>Healthcare professionals often exhibit unhealthy lifestyle behaviours with work-related stress identified as the most frequently-cited reason [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Professionals report that hospitals are a highly stressful work environment, and irregular shift work often places an additional strain on the hospital employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Sleep patterns and sleep quality among healthcare professionals were insufficient for good health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and physical activity is a recognised means to improve sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In addition, nurses are prone to suffer lower back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and physical activity is recommended to this occupational group for managing back pain. As such, there is strong rationale for promoting physical activity among healthcare professionals.</p><p>The workplace is reported as a suitable environment for making changes in the physical activity and improving health of employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Increased participation in physical activity in healthcare professionals can be promoted using behavioural interventions which utilise persuasive strategies and techniques to encourage individuals to change their behaviour (e.g., goal setting, planning, providing social support) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Such interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting increased uptake and maintenance of physical activity, including in the workplace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], hence they may be suitable for promoting physical activity to healthcare professionals.</p><p>Other than identifying the importance of context in the delivery of interventions, such as the occupational setting for healthcare workers, it is also important to look at the means by which interventions may be delivered to employees in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Recently computer-tailoring has been used to deliver behavioural interventions in health contexts and it has received increased attention as a means to effectively deliver personalised interventions to a wide audience at a relatively low cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These interventions provide users with individualised feedback based on their demographic profile and preferences. Users are prompted to provide information salient to the intervention (using an online questionnaire) and are subsequently provided with tailored feedback including information on behaviour change matched to their requirements and consistent with their responses. Pre-defined algorithms generate tailored content for the user based on user-provided information and the relevant behaviour change content that is stored in a database including all possible response options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p>Web-based interventions have a number of advantages over face-to-face interventions: they have wide reach, comparatively low cost of implementation and delivery, and flexibility of intervention use at times and location convenient for the user [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Tailoring web-based interventions also carries distinct advantages over non-tailored approaches: participants are presented only with relevant and personalised information, and non-relevant information can be omitted. This in turn may increase engagement and persuasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In computer-tailored interventions, less information is presented to the users and more attention is directed to the relevant intervention content. In addition, consistent with the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], information in the intervention is more likely to be thoughtfully attended to when it is personally relevant and when readers are motivated. Therefore, tailored interventions are more likely to be attended to and should lead to longer lasting behavioural change.</p><p>In addition to computer tailoring, there is also a growing literature supporting the use of short message service (SMS) or &#x02018;text&#x02019; messaging to promote health behaviour. Research has demonstrated that delivering health behaviour messages via text messaging can promote health behaviour change in numerous contexts, including physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Text messaging has also been used in conjunction with web-based interventions to improve health behaviour and to enhance their effectiveness. A systematic review reported that the effectiveness of web-based interventions can be enhanced by the inclusion of SMS as a means to remind participants of intervention content or to augment it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, adoption of web-based tailored interventions to promote physical activity augmented with text messaging, may be a useful, cost-effective means to promote physical activity to healthcare professionals.</p><p>In the context of physical activity promotion, computer-tailored behavioural interventions have been reported as effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]; however further investigation of the mechanisms is needed in terms of evaluating these interventions and their effectiveness across multiple contexts. Investigating the mechanisms that can improve the effectiveness of computer-tailored interventions is crucial. Therefore, studies that isolate specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs) within intervention conditions using factorial designs will provide robust evidence for testing the impact of specific BCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This means that knowledge of the specific individual components that are most likely to change behaviour will be identified.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Theories of behaviour change and maintenance</title><p>Health behaviour change interventions are usually underpinned by psychological theories of behaviour change and maintenance. Many such theories have focused on <italic>motivation</italic> and intentions to explain and change behaviour (e.g., the Theory of Planned Behaviour) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. These theories view lack of engagement in health behaviours (e.g., physical activity) as primarily a problem with motivation, such that increasing motivation will directly lead to increases in behavioural participation. The theories also assume that motivation is a function of an individuals&#x02019; explicit, consciously-held beliefs about the behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, theories of <italic>volition</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] indicate that motivation is a necessary but insufficient condition for behavioural enactment and suggests that volitional strategies (e.g., planning) that operate in a post-decisional manner (i.e. after intentions have been formed) lead to the effective execution of intentions into action because they enable an individual to more effectively recall their intended behaviour via prompts or cues that have been linked to the desired behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Dual process theories offer a broader perspective that integrates <italic>motivational</italic> and <italic>volitional</italic> processes, but also recognises that behaviour may also be influenced by more implicit, non-conscious processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Dual process theories propose that health behaviours are enacted through two processes &#x02013; the conscious, deliberative processes such as those described in motivational and volitional theories, as well as non-conscious processes that occur automatically, outside an individual&#x02019;s deliberation. The implicit processes reflect initiating or engaging in actions with very little deliberative, reasoned, and conscious decision making processes outlined in traditional motivational theories. Behaviours that may initially be controlled through deliberative, motivational pathways behaviours can, through a <italic>habit-formation process</italic> become controlled by automatic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Habit formation likely occurs through learning of context-behaviour associations via context-dependent repetition of the behaviour usually in the presence of some rewarding contingency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In some cases, the behaviour is enacted because repetition and experience has led the behaviour to occur without the need for any conscious control, as such the behaviour is classed as &#x02018;habitual&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>Researchers applying these theories to predict and change behaviour have identified strategies and techniques to promote the development of habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. These techniques should be separable and able to be isolated from techniques that promote, for example, increased behavioural engagement via the motivational and volitional pathways identified in dual process theories. As a consequence, factorial-type designs should be able to demonstrate the unique effects of techniques related to motivation and volition and techniques related to habit promotion on health behavior change. Such designs may also permit demonstration of whether the addition of components targeting specific processes (e.g., motivational, volitional, habitual) may lead to incremental changes in behaviour relative to each set of techniques alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>The present study</title><p>There is a need for cost-effective, efficacious behavioural interventions to increase physical activity in healthcare professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Research has suggested that theory-based interventions adopting multiple BCTs are effective in increasing physical activity behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Recent research efforts have focused on linking BCTs with underlying theoretical mechanisms of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However, few studies have systematically examined the efficacy of specific groups of BCTs that are thought to operate through one of the three specified processes (motivational, volitional, and habit-forming) and assessed their independent and additive effects on behaviour change. The purpose of the current study, the Physical Activity Tailored intervention in Hospital Staff (<italic>PATHS</italic>) study, is to evaluate the efficacy of a computer-tailored intervention to increase physical activity and quality of life, and decrease work-related stress and absenteeism, in hospital healthcare workers. The intervention will examine the additive effects of groups of BCTs derived from theories of motivation, volition, and habit on physical activity behavior change. The research is unique as it will provide the first evidence of the efficacy of techniques derived from these three theoretical approaches applied in a workplace context. The study will adopt a randomised controlled design to test and compare the effects of three distinct groups of BCTs derived from theory and focusing different processes of behaviour changes on study outcomes: motivation, self-regulation, and habit formation.</p><p>Specifically, the intervention will include motivational techniques to increase motivation and self-efficacy to engage in physical activity, self-regulatory techniques to increase capability and skills to initiate and regulate behaviour change, and habit-based techniques to increase the automatic, non-conscious tendencies to engage in physical activity on presentation of contextual and time-relevant cues. Three intervention conditions are proposed, each defined by the sets of BCTs in an additive design: (1) motivational BCTs; (2) motivational plus self-regulatory BCTs; and (3) motivational plus self-regulatory and habit formation BCTs. The intervention groups will be compared to a control condition that will receive basic non-tailored information about physical activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>Full- and part-time hospital staff including midwives, clinical nurse managers, clinical nurses, registered nurses, enrolled nurses, and patient care assistants will be eligible to participate in the <italic>PATHS</italic> study.

No restrictions will be placed on the type of contract and number of hours worked. Participants are eligible if they fail to meet the recommended weekly level of 150&#x000a0;min of moderate intensity physical activity because the intervention is designed for people who fail to meet this level.</p><p>Individuals who self-report a physical condition or impairment preventing them from being physically active will be excluded from the study.

However, individuals who are not eligible to participate in the study based on PAR-Q measures can still consult their GP to obtain approval. Hospital employees who do not have a mobile phone that allows them to receive text messages, who do not have access to internet on their mobile phone, computer or tablet outside of work, who are already meeting weekly recommended levels of physical activity or are currently participating in another physical activity program (e.g., a structured weight loss program, regular meetings with personal trainer or coach) will be excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Recruitment</title><p>Participants will be recruited from different hospital wards via email messages and printed letters that will be sent to all potentially eligible employees, accompanied by a description of the study and its requirements and inviting them to take part.

We chose randomisation of individuals within hospitals (rather than randomisation of hospitals or wards) because individual randomisation was more efficient and more feasible with continuous recruitment of the participants; program was delivered to individuals rather than groups so contamination across intervention groups was not considered a major risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].

At this second meeting, participants will also be asked to complete web-based baseline questionnaires using a provided tablet (Time 1).</p><p>After the second meeting, participants will be emailed a personalised login/password, and link to the website so they are able to login to the web-based <italic>PATHS</italic> study platform used to deliver the tailored intervention messages. Participants will be automatically randomly allocated online in an equal ratio to one of the four possible study conditions; a block randomisation will be used with block size of 16. If allocated to one of the three intervention conditions, they will be able to complete the first intervention session on the website immediately after completing the baseline assessments. If allocated to the control condition, they will receive an email directing them to the <italic>Library</italic> site for physical activity relevant information. The <italic>Library</italic> is a sub-section of the website with non-tailored evidence-based information about physical activity,</p><p>Across all conditions, participants will be encouraged to use and interact with the web-based <italic>PATHS</italic> platform for three consecutive months, completing sessions every fortnight. At the end of month three, participants will meet with the researcher and will be provided with a GENEActiv activity monitor to be worn for one week immediately post-intervention to assess physical activity. Participants will meet with the researcher again one week after they received the activity monitor to complete the post-intervention questionnaires and return the activity monitor (Time 2). All researchers collecting the data will be blinded to the allocation of participants&#x02019; study condition.</p><p>Following the three-month period, participants will be thanked for their study contribution via personal email and text message, and their names will be automatically entered into a prize draw allowing them to win shopping vouchers for their participation (four shopping vouchers, 20 AUD value per each hospital). Participants allocated to the control condition will then be given the opportunity to receive the content from one of the intervention conditions so that they are not prevented from participating in a potentially effective intervention. They will receive login details, password and link to the web-based tailored platform providing them with the option to engage in one of the three intervention conditions, chosen randomly. All study participants will be told that there are four different versions of the same program that differ in content and behaviour change techniques used. Participants will be asked not to share or compare intervention content to avoid study contamination among participants working on the same ward. They will be asked in the post intervention evaluation if they adhered to the aforementioned recommendation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention content</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control condition</title><p>Participants assigned to the control condition will be provided with information about physical activity recommendations compiled in the <italic>Library</italic> and will have the opportunity to rate the content (ranging from 0 stars [<italic>not interesting and not useful</italic>] to 5 stars [<italic>very interesting and very useful</italic>]). The presentation order of the articles will move up or down on the list based on the ratings given by the platform users, with the ones rated the highest displayed at the top of the page.

They will also be prompted to form action and coping plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>], specifying when, where and how they will perform their physical activities, and identifying barriers to their physical activity participation and how they might overcome them. Participants will be encouraged to specifically focus on self-monitoring in high risk situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], such as when they are tired or stressed and their capacity for self-regulation is most likely to be compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Participants will also receive information on managing multiple goals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and self-regulating the situation when competing activities arise (e.g., the desire to be active and healthy conflicts with other situational options such as watching TV and resting).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Habit condition</title><p>Participants assigned to the habit condition will receive the content from the motivation and self-regulation conditions along with content promoting habit development (e.g., recognising prompts to action and learning to act upon these prompts).

Participants in all conditions will have access to the <italic>Library</italic> in the form of brief clear-language descriptions of physical activity recommendations and information on the importance of physical activity. Given research demonstrating that providing information about health behaviour alone is not sufficient to change behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>], but also recognising the need to provide a rationale for engaging in the website and to ensure that information is controlled across conditions, all study participants will have access to the <italic>Library</italic>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>

</p><p>Each fortnight, participants will be provided with a new session including a recap of the messages from the previous two weeks along with new personally-relevant content and tailored feedback. If participants do not complete the session on time, they will be able to do so when they next login. Each session will end with a pop-up notification asking users to use a star rating system (<italic>What did you think of this feedback?</italic> 0 to 5 stars) and a qualitative <italic>feedback box</italic> to receive open-ended comments relating to each session content (<italic>Why did you rate it this way?</italic> [optional]).</p><p>During each intervention session, participants will receive personally-relevant content incorporating BCTs relevant to their allocated intervention condition (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). To generate the content-specific information, participants will be asked about their physical activity during the previous week at the beginning of each intervention session (including their low, moderate and high intensity physical activity, and resistance training, specifying number and length of sessions). They will also be asked questions regarding the psychological determinants of physical activity, physical resources, and social and environmental factors relevant to the condition to which they are allocated. For example, during the session on goal setting, participants allocated to the Motivation condition will receive information which prompts them to form activity goals and to stay motivated to achieve them. Participants allocated to the Self-regulation condition will also receive suggestions how to monitor and self-regulate towards the goal (action planning, coping planning). Participants assigned to the Habit condition will also receive information on the importance of repetition of the same activity in the same context to develop habits.</p><p>The platform uses if-then algorithms to provide tailored feedback based on the participant&#x02019;s responses. The feedback will be drawn from a database of messages incorporating feedback combinations tailored to the participant&#x02019;s condition and responses to prompts for information on the website. The platform will store participants&#x02019; responses for each session, permitting tailoring of the intervention to the responses from the current session, as well as to responses from previously completed surveys. For instance, graphs displayed to the participants will include changes in physical activity throughout the intervention.</p><p>In addition, all groups, with the exception of the control group, will receive weekly text messages sent at the same time each week to provide further condition- and session-relevant feedback based on their most recently completed session and including a short summary of key points. There will be three introduction messages and each session has two session specific text messages, followed by a final concluding message. Participants will also receive regular fortnightly reminders to login to the intervention website when a new session is available sent via email. Up to three reminders will be sent per session (one every four days).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Measures</title><p>Table <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref> describes measures that will

Data will be analysed using generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>] with a 4 (condition: control, motivation, self-regulation, habit) &#x000d7; 2 (time: baseline, 3-month follow-up) mixed-model design, accounting for nesting within hospital. Models will be conducting to compare change between conditions of the primary outcome (physical activity) and secondary outcomes (e.g., theory-derived psychological constructs, DASS21, MOS-SF12, and absenteeism). Mediation analyses will be conducted using path analytic models using Preacher and Hayes&#x02019; bootstrapped approach for multiple mediation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Separate path models will be conducted for each condition. Each condition will be represented by a dichotomous dummy-coded variable (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;did not receive intervention component, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;received intervention component). Each condition variable will be set as a predictor of physical activity at follow up with motivation and intention (motivation condition), perceived behavioural control and planning (self-regulation condition), and self-reported habit (habit condition) as multiple mediators in each analysis, respectively. Baseline physical activity will be included as a control variable. Intention-to-treat (baseline carried forward) will be utilised for missing data from drop-out. Other missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation with chained equations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. Both intention-to-treat and completers analyses will be reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Discussion</title><p>Participation in regular physical activity shown to be related to improved health outcomes, reduced health care costs, and reduced disease risk (e.g., cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes). Healthcare professionals including midwives, nurses and patient assistants are often involved in providing health-related behaviour change advice, yet their own health behaviour is relatively poor as demonstrated in occupational studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The <italic>PATHS</italic> study will examine the effectiveness of a web-based intervention evaluating different behavioural strategies to increase physical activity. The primary aim of the current trial is to test the main and additive effects of different theoretically-derived BCTs &#x02013; motivational, self-regulatory and habit-based strategies &#x02013; on physical activity and a range of secondary outcomes. We hypothesise that the habit condition, which includes the highest number of BCTs will be the most effective. However, we also acknowledge the potential for a larger number of BCTs may create problems for messages to be assimilated and recalled due to the relatively large amount of information provided. The greater information load may undermine, or even overturn, the effects of the BCTs on behaviour change. In addition, the current design does not allow for tests of interactions among sets of BCTs, rather the approach is focused on additive effects i.e. whether motivational interventions that include additional components (e.g., BCTs related to habit) are more effective compared to those that do not. However, this does not rule out the possibility of interactions among the different components affecting the result. Research aimed at identifying the optimum number and combination of BCTs is required to inform the design of future complex interventions.</p><p>In addition, the current study will focus on testing theoretically-distinct groups of techniques and their additive effects on health behavior change. The findings of the study will enable us to evaluate the potential mechanisms by which BCTs derived from motivation, volition and habit theories affect change in health-related behaviour. Our research will also enable us to test the mediators of the intervention effects to increase participants&#x02019; physical activity and quality of life, and to reduce work-related stress and absenteeism. We will be able to do this by comparing the effects of each intervention component (e.g., self-regulation) on outcomes mediated by specific theory-based psychological constructs (e.g., planning, self-efficacy) conceptually related to the component.</p><p>Personal characteristics of the intervention participants will be assessed to determine for whom the different intervention content is most suitable. Potential moderators of intervention effects will include level of engagement in the program and planning skills. Determining the characteristics of potential users will enable the future matching of participants with the most suitable intervention content. In addition, by providing opportunity for participants to report on the usability of the platform in healthcare professionals, we will be able to ascertain the extent to which the online intervention is feasible in this population and whether it would likely be used by the target population if it were rolled-out on a large scale.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Implications</title><p>The study described here has important implications for public health practitioners and researchers designing behaviour change interventions. The intervention will make a unique contribution to physical activity promotion and health research by testing the effectiveness of a computer-tailored web-based intervention in promoting physical activity and stress reduction in hospital workers; an under-researched group at risk of high stress. In addition, the intervention will add to theory and knowledge on behaviour change in health contexts by testing whether the inclusions of self-regulatory and habit-forming BCTs are more effective in promoting behaviour change and health-related outcomes relative to BCTs targeting motivation alone and an information only control. This is important as it will assist in elucidating the &#x02018;active ingredients&#x02019; of the intervention and the mechanisms by which they exert their effects. The current research will also assist in identifying the key mediators of intervention effects, providing data on the mechanisms by which each intervention condition affects changes in physical activity behaviour.</p></sec></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BCT</term><def><p>Behaviour change technique</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DASS21</term><def><p>Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale 21</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPAQ</term><def><p>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PANES</term><def><p>Physical Activity Neighbourhood Environmental Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PARQ</term><def><p>Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PATHS</term><def><p>Physical Activity Tailored intervention in Hospital Staff</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF12</term><def><p>Short Form 12 (Quality of Life Measure)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SMS</term><def><p>Short message service</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SUS</term><def><p>The System Usability Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TPB</term><def><p>Theory of Planned Behaviour</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Website software programming was done by Nathaniel Fitzgerald-Hood.
