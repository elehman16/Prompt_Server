In practice, individual treatment concepts are based on results of clinical studies as well as international guidelines (NICE Guidelines) that recommend a step-by-step treatment approach. Since the evidence supporting this approach is limited, the aim of the present study is to determine an optimal intervention regarding severity levels of ADHD symptomatology conducting a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Method</title><p id="Par2">We aim to include 279 ADHD subjects aged between 16 and 45&#x000a0;years. First, participants are randomized to either a face-to-face psychoeducation, telephone assisted self-help (TASH), or a waiting control group (Step 1). All participants assigned to the control group are treated using TASH after a 3-month waiting period. Participants are then allocated to one of three groups, based on their remaining severity level of ADHD symptoms, as (1) full responder, (2) partial responder, or (3) non-responder (Step 2). Full responders receive counseling, partial responders receive either counseling only or counseling and neurofeedback (NF), and non-responders receive either pharmacological treatment only or pharmacological treatment and NF, followed by a 3 month period without intervention.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The naturalistic sample is one of the study&#x02019;s advantages, avoiding highly selective inclusion or exclusion criteria. The efficacy of an evidence-based stepped care intervention is explored by primary (reduction of severity of ADHD symptoms) and secondary outcomes (functional outcomes, e.g., quality of life, anger management, enhancement of psychosocial well-being). Predictors of therapeutic response and non-response are being investigated at each step of intervention. Further, sex differences are also being explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">This study is registered by the German Trial Register (reference number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&#x00026;TRIAL_ID=DRKS00008975">DRKS00008975</ext-link>), 23 October 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s13063-018-2665-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>ADHD</kwd><kwd>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder</kwd><kwd>Adolescence</kwd><kwd>Adult</kwd><kwd>Psychoeducation</kwd><kwd>Neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>Pharmacological treatment</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trail</kwd><kwd>RCT</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01EE1408D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>R&#x000f6;sler</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par36">With up to 5.3% of children affected worldwide, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common diseases with early childhood onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. ADHD has long been considered a disease of childhood, with full remission in adulthood, with adult ADHD still being questioned by many practitioners. However, clinical long-term studies have shown that symptoms fully, or at least partially, persist into adulthood in 60% of ADHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cross-section analyses support this data. While approximately 3% to 7% of school-aged children are affected by ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], prevalence in young and middle adulthood, as well as in seniority, ranges between 2% and 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Pharmacological treatment</title><p id="Par37">Several meta-analyses provided evidence that short to medium term pharmacological interventions, using stimulant medication or atomoxetine as well as psychotherapeutic treatment strategies, will improve psychopathological symptoms of adult ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Recent investigations have revealed smaller effects in psychosocial interventions than in pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, effect sizes attained by pharmacological treatments have been found to be smaller for adults than for adolescents. Additionally, results of pharmacological trials are generally influenced by study sample selectivity and pre-defined study approaches, following strict inclusion and exclusion criteria such as comorbidities. Therefore, the characteristics of patients to be included in the current study will not necessarily match those of an average patient with ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Psychosocial treatment</title><p id="Par38">Regarding low level psychosocial treatment options, psychoeducation (PE) is well established in daily practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, telephone assisted self-help (TASH) interventions have been found to be useful for children and adolescents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], while they have only been used for patient parent education. This is a different approach than in adult psychiatry, where ADHD patients receive treatment directly. However, knowledge about the efficacy of TASH in adults is limited and promising results attained by childhood studies cannot yet be transferred to adult patients. To date, only one randomized controlled pilot study has been published, evaluating an 8-week bibliotherapy program for adults, in which therapist contact was minimized to phone call sessions. This study, conducted by Stevenson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], provides first promising results suggesting significant improvements of ADHD symptoms through TASH and the concept displays high similarities with the program introduced herein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Neurofeedback (NF) training</title><p id="Par39">Regarding NF training, impaired regulations of slow cortical potentials (SCPs), as well as reduced negativities in anticipation of tasks, have been observed through electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings for adults and adolescents as compared to children with ADHD. The most consistent neurophysiological finding in children with ADHD is an increased absolute power in the theta EEG band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; further, several studies have also found decreased activity in the beta band [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For adult ADHD patients, increased absolute power in the alpha and theta EEG were observed compared to control groups, while there were no differences in the beta activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Thus, the EEG of adult ADHD patients is characterized by an increased share of slow potentials and does not show the same abnormality in beta activity as in children with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This normalization of beta activity is associated with a reduced hyperactivity in adults with ADHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par40">Strehl et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] investigated the effects of self-regulation of SCP for children with ADHD. Measurement before and after the trials showed that children with ADHD are able to learn to regulate negative SCPs. After training, significant improvement in behavior, attention, and IQ score were observed.</p><p id="Par41">Based on these results, NF trainings were developed to augment the cortical activation necessary for focused attention and cognitive tasks. In previous research, the use of SCP as a treatment parameter in NF applications has been associated with a significant reduction of ADHD symptoms such as improved attention variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and corresponding event-related potential (ERP) changes. EEG recordings during SCP treatment indicated that children with ADHD were able to control their SCPs after training, a skill that remained stable after a 2-year follow-up period. Studies assessing SCP training in adult patients with ADHD are scarce, but preliminary data based on 10 adult patients, showed that 15 sessions of SCP training led to significant improvements regarding self-ratings of ADHD symptoms. A trend towards normalization of contingent negative variation amplitudes (CNV; an event-related potential (ERP) related to aspects of action preparation and self-regulation) could also be observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Meta-analytic results, attained by Sonuga-Barke et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] revealed medium to large effects (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.59) for children with ADHD, while the majority of randomized controlled studies (RCTs) included medicated patients. The authors also report that studies conducted in a (probably) blinded manner yielded smaller effects (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.29), reaching only a statistical trend. Further, they indicated that this estimate may be too low due to less sensitive ratings and non-standardized NF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The largest study employing standard NF and sensitive ratings, as proposed herein, reports considerably larger effects (parent rating: d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.64, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]; teacher rating: d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.42, as calculated in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]). Effect sizes shown for NF plus medication as compared to medication alone vary widely, ranging between small (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.46, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]) and large effects (d&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.2, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]). Meta-analytic estimates could not be obtained in this case because many NF RCTs did not exclude patients with concurrent medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In conclusion, there is a wide range of incremental NF effects that cover potentially large and clinically highly relevant effects. Until now, only few studies have focused on this topic, while none of them have included adult samples. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate potential effects of NF, along with individual response predictors, in a stepped care design.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Combined therapy</title><p id="Par42">There is ample evidence surrounding the effects of respective treatment options, yet the number of studies regarding combinations of psychosocial intervention and pharmacological treatment or even the stepped care model, as suggested here, is very limited. Concerning the combination of medication and psychosocial treatment in children and adolescents, the MTA study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] demonstrated a superiority of stimulant medication over psychosocial interventions, wherein patients responding to stimulant treatment did not experience additional benefit when treated with behavior therapy. A recent study of our consortium compared a structured group program therapy based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectic behavior therapy with individual clinical management in combination with methylphenidate (MPH) or placebo in a factorial four condition design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. This study has been granted by the BMBF (<italic>Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung</italic>, Registration: CCT-ISRCTN54096201). Results suggest that group program therapy is not superior compared to clinical management regarding the primary outcome (ADHD symptoms after 3 months of intense treatment), whereas MPH is superior to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Two studies conducted by Safren et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and Emilsson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] employed a different design, comparing patients treated with ADHD medication (mostly stimulants) only and patients receiving medication as well as individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] or group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] CBT. Both research groups were able to attain a significantly more pronounced reduction of ADHD psychopathology for patients through combined treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study objectives</title><p id="Par43">The limited data regarding combined treatments and the implementation of a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options in a stepped care model are the point of origin of our study concept, which holds promise for improving the knowledge on individual treatment optimization for adult ADHD patients in outpatient facilities. Further, prevailing research does not yield conclusive results regarding the prediction of response or non-response to psychosocial or pharmacological treatment. The role of psychosocial and biological predictors such as age, sex, compliance, comorbidities, lifestyle, adverse environment, or psychosocial state is yet to be resolved. The majority of studies concerning predicting factors have used data from pharmacological trials in an ex-post design to identify said factors, leading to the assumption that those studies had primarily been designed to demonstrate pharmacological efficacy. Since the question of possible differences concerning therapeutic needs between male and female patients is almost unmet in relevant research, sex effects will be of particular interest in the current study. Thus, we expect to attain new information regarding sex effects and other confounding variables on treatment adherence and outcome in a sample consisting of adult ADHD patients.</p><p id="Par44">The paper reports the ESCAlate trial protocol (<bold>E</bold>vidence-Based, <bold>S</bold>tepped-<bold>C</bold>are in <bold>Late</bold> Adolescents and Young <bold>A</bold>dults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity-Disorder, Version 05, from December 20, 2016) and has been conceived under consideration of the SPIRIT guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>] (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Spirit 2013 flow diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2665_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>ESCAlife</title><p id="Par45">ESCAlate is part of the research consortium ESCAlife, whose primary aim is to investigate adaptive interventions for patients with ADHD from preschool age to adulthood.

The coordinating center is the Institute for Forensic Psychology and Psychiatry, University of Saarland. To reach a sample size of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;279 patients with ADHD, as diagnosed according to DSM-5 (baseline; T0), we will be able to mobilize further recruitment centers if needed. Inclusion criteria are patient age (16&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years), their or a guardian&#x02019;s informed consent, and diagnosable ADHD, assessed through a structured clinical interview (Integrated Diagnostic Scale of adult ADHD &#x02013; Revised; IDA-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>].

Patients using psychotropic or ADHD medication need to undergo a 4-week wash-out period before they are eligible for participation in the study. Further exclusion criteria are current alcohol or drug dependence, severe heart disease, epilepsy, insufficient command of the German language, pregnancy, or breast feeding. Common comorbid conditions such as conduct disorder, personality disorders (except antisocial personality disorder), anxiety disorder or mild to moderate depression as well as substance use disorder in remission do not lead to exclusion.</p><p id="Par47">In a first step (T1), patients will be equally randomized to the two active treatments or waiting control groups. One-third of patients will be assigned to face-to-face PE, which is being implemented through standardized modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Eight individual sessions will be administered with each patient over a period of 3 months. The competing treatment is TASH, which essentially consists of the same standardized modules as the face-to-face PE, yet implemented through 30 min telephone sessions. Those modules include a structured procedure, defining primary problems that provide specific information concerning ADHD, present coping skills based on CBT, and require written homework. A third group of patients will be wait-listed; serving as a control group, these patients will not receive treatment for 3 months, and will subsequently receive TASH. Thus, the duration of step 1 is 3 months for PE and TASH groups and 6 months for the waiting list control group. We hypothesize that both PE and TASH will display superior effects in terms of ADHD symptom reduction as compared to wait-listed patients after treatment.</p><p id="Par48">Using the IDA-R, treatment response will then be determined (T2). Patients fulfilling our a priori criterion of full response (IDA-R score&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;18) will be followed up by monthly clinical routine sessions in which they get interviewed by a clinical doctor to control for psychopathological status and to prevent relapse.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], SCPs will be recorded at Cz (vertex region), then referenced against mastoid A1 with a ground electrode on mastoid A2, and averaged. This will be performed using NEURO PRAX<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (neuroConn group), a full-band DC-EEG system, primarily intended for neuroscientific application. For all channels, physiological signals, such as EEG, electromyogram (EMG), and evoked potentials (EP), are measured simultaneously and synchronously, in the frequency range of 0 to 1200&#x000a0;Hz. EEG activities, from the infra-slow (0 to 0.3&#x000a0;Hz) to the ultra-fast (80 to 1200&#x000a0;Hz), are captured by the unique amplifier technology. Various software and hardware modules are able to make online correction of artifacts caused by muscle and eye movements, conduct topographical analyses or spectral and amplitude mapping, as well as online averaging and bio-feedback and NF. Each training session is composed of four runs of 40 trials, with each trial lasting 8 seconds and consisting of three stages, namely a baseline phase (0&#x02013;2&#x000a0;s), an active phase (2&#x02013;7.5&#x000a0;s), and a reinforcement phase (7.5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;s). At the end of the baseline period, participants will be presented with a cue, namely a triangle pointed upwards indicating &#x02018;activation&#x02019; (regulate a negative SCP shift) or pointed downwards indicating &#x02018;deactivation&#x02019; (regulate a positive SCP shift). In this active phase, an object moving up or down across the screen will indicate activation or deactivation, thus providing feedback to the participant. In a third phase, participants will be positively reinforced receiving visual rewards in 75% of cases in which they successfully directed their SCP activity. In 25% of trials (&#x02018;transfer trials&#x02019;) there will be no feedback, ensuring that the application of regulation does not depend on the reward system but on acquired skills. The NF training employed herein comprises 25 sessions in 3 months, with sessions 1&#x02013;12 being composed of activation and deactivation trials equally. In sessions 13&#x02013;25, the ratio changes to 40% and 60%, respectively. Training sessions will take place once or twice a week and last approximately 1 hour each, including preparation time. Using a waiting list control group or another passive control group in the second treatment step can be problematic, as patients not responding sufficiently to therapy in step 1 would be without substantial treatment for 3 months, despite an urgent need for treatment. In order to avoid this, an individual counseling program was introduced to the study plan. Patients randomly assigned to the counseling program or counseling and NF will receive six individual sessions of 30&#x000a0;min, allowing them to address ADHD-related symptoms as well as individual, everyday functional problems. The intervention program for counseling in a one-to-one setting is manual-based but not yet published. It is based on the manual for group therapy with adult patients with ADHD by D&#x02019;Amelio et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].

MPH has been chosen as medical treatment because, according to evidence-based treatment guidelines (NICE Guidelines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], MPH is first line when it comes to ADHD medication. Medication administration will be coordinated by each patient&#x02019;s attending physician as part of their routine care as recommended by current treatment guidelines and according to the product information sheet, as well as the dosage schedule defined by the BfArM (Bundesinstitut f&#x000fc;r Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte). Specifically, the patients&#x02019; medical treatment will begin with a dosage of 10&#x000a0;mg MPH in the morning and will be increased in steps of 10&#x000a0;mg, with the highest possible dosage of 80&#x000a0;mg per day. If significant side effects are reported, dosage will be again decreased in steps of 10&#x000a0;mg until an appropriate level of medication is found. The optimal daily dosage will then be maintained and the number of subdoses taken during the day will be decided individually by the respective medical doctor.

Compared to the ADHD-DC, IDA-R comes with a higher user applicability, as the questions are already formulated. The examiner estimates the manifestation of the ADHD pathology based on 18 items.

Nine items are assigned to the inattentive and nine items to the hyperactive-impulsive type of ADHD. An ADHD diagnosis can be made when at least five items are rated with a score of &#x02018;2&#x02019; in one of the two subscales.

Changes in the IDA-R score between T1&#x02013;baseline and T2 (after interventions/waiting) or T2&#x02013;baseline (before randomization to &#x000b1; NF) and T3, respectively, will be evaluated in separate mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]). The MMRMs will include fixed categorical effects of treatment, center, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as well as continuous and fixed covariates of baseline and baseline-by-visit interaction. Further, covariates, which are predictive of missing values, will be included based on a pre-specified selection strategy to correct for potential bias arising from missing data. Unstructured covariance matrices will be used to model within-patient correlations (a prospective alternative strategy will be devised to address potential convergence problems). Comparison of primary treatment change scores at T2 and T3 will be based on least-squares means with two-sided 95% confidence intervals. Evaluation of PE will be conducted through confirmatory factor analysis. Subgroup analyses will be conducted in an exploratory manner by including interaction terms in the MMRMs, focusing on the analysis of psychosocial and neurobiological predictors. Particularly, sex effects will be investigated as prognostic and predictive factors.</p><p id="Par85">Potential biological predictors are initially assessed separately for each predictor and treatment through examination of their correlation with clinical improvement as well as planned comparisons, aiming to identify age- and treatment-specific predictor patterns.

The relationship between anger management at baseline (as measured by STAXI-2) and the efficiency of the respective treatment, measured by the difference in severity of ADHD (as defined by IDA-R) from T0 and T1 and from T2 and T3, will be analyzed using linear regression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Missing values</title><p id="Par91">As few patients as possible should discontinue treatment, while all patients who drop out should be followed up regardless in order to record data as required by the intention-to-treat principle.</p><p id="Par92">Mean changes from baseline will be analyzed using a restricted maximum likelihood-based repeated measures approach.

Key stopping rules for the trial will be if data suggests a revision of the risk-benefit ratio.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par96">Results of our current trial will underpin the recommendations as presented by the evidence-based and expert-derived treatment guidelines (NICE 2009) with empirical data. Thus far, evidence for non-pharmacological treatment options in adults with ADHD is limited. From the view of primary healthcare, predicting ADHD patients&#x02019; individual response to relatively low-level psychosocial interventions (e.g., PE, TASH) or to NF, which are widely used treatment options in clinical practice, is a prerequisite for individualized efficacious therapy in ADHD. In this regard, we expect that PE and TASH may have beneficial effects in terms of the adult-specific ADHD psychopathology and related symptom domains, e.g., emotional dysregulation and/or disorganization. If differences between PE and TASH treatment are found, we expect them to be very small and thus negligible. Moreover, our study aims to contribute to current research regarding the potential of NF as a treatment for adults and late adolescents with ADHD.</p><p id="Par97">There are two aspects to be investigated through our stepped care program. First, the main question is whether NF in combination with counselling will display larger effects than counselling alone. Effects between <italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3 and 0.5 are to be expected. The second aspect investigated, refers to the effects of NF in comparison to the well-known effects of MPH treatment. In light of the different modes of action in both treatments we hypothesize that NF and MPH might have additive effects and thus a combination will yield bigger effects as compared to MPH alone.</p><p id="Par98">Another aim of the study is to identify patients who are in need of pharmacological treatment. In order to do so, we re-evaluate our patients after they complete step 1 with respect to therapeutic response and remaining ADHD psychopathology as measured by the IDA-R. If a patient scores 18 or lower on the IDA-R, they will be classified as full responders. An average item score of this 18-item rating scale of &#x02264;&#x02009;1 indicates subclinical presence of ADHD. Non-response is given if the total score of the IDA-R is &#x02265;&#x02009;28, corresponding to an average item score of &#x02265;&#x02009;1.5. With reference to our population norms, which have been acquired within the last decade, a score of 28 has a <italic>t</italic> value of 81, which is more than two standard deviations from standard population mean. Partial responders are defined as patients scoring 19&#x02013;27 on the IDA-R, reflecting mild to moderate ADHD. Different interventions are assigned to full responders, partial responders, and non-responders. We hypothesize that symptom severity may be a predictor for the appropriateness of different treatment options.</p><p id="Par99">We aim to study different psychosocial and neurobiological predictors of therapeutic response or non-response. Possible sex effects and the influence of biological rhythms like sleep patterns are of specific interest in this context. Additionally, childhood adversity, social influences, and typical comorbid conditions will be analyzed regarding treatment outcome at several steps of treatment. These factors are relevant aspects influencing the pathogenesis of ADHD but have not yet been investigated within RCTs concerning late adolescents and adults.</p><p id="Par100">Data regarding the effects of different interventions at different stages of treatment as well as the identification of possible predictors may open the possibility to individualize treatment concepts. This may help to implement treatment decisions more effectively and lower healthcare expenses. Further, identification of optimal, individualized treatment combinations and concomitant improvement in terms of psychopathology and functional status will obviously benefit the individual patient.</p><p id="Par101">Another objective of this investigation is the identification of typical problems arising when transitioning from adolescence into adulthood for patients with ADHD. Thus far, neither adult patients nor adolescents have been included in treatment studies in order to evaluate efficacy and tolerability of pharmacological or non-pharmacological approaches. The age criterion for patient inclusion in the proposed study is 16 to 45&#x000a0;years, which closes the gap between adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, we have the opportunity to compare late adolescents with young adults and to study the effects of different treatments over a life span that is crucial for personal and social development.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par102">Protocol version 01 dated 8 July 2015.
