<bold>P</bold>ractical methods of monitoring innate immune mucosal responsiveness are lacking. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a component of the cell wall of Gram negative bacteria and a potent activator of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4. To measure LPS responsiveness of the nasal mucosa, we administered LPS as a nasal spray and quantified chemokine and cytokine levels in mucosal lining fluid (MLF).</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed a 5-way cross-over, single blind, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy non-atopic subjects (n = 14 <italic>per protocol</italic>). Doses of ultrapure LPS (1, 10, 30 or 100&#x003bc;g/100&#x003bc;l) or placebo were administered by a single nasal spray to each nostril. Using the recently developed method of nasosorption with synthetic adsorptive matrices (SAM), a series of samples were taken. A panel of seven cytokines/chemokines were measured by multiplex immunoassay in MLF. mRNA for intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) was quantified from nasal epithelial curettage samples taken before and after challenge.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Topical nasal LPS was well tolerated, causing no symptoms and no visible changes to the nasal mucosa. LPS induced dose-related increases in MLF levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, CXCL8 (IL-8) and CCL3 (MIP-1&#x003b1;) (AUC at 0.5 to 10h, compared to placebo, p&#x0003c;0.05 at 30 and 100&#x003bc;g LPS). At 100&#x003bc;g LPS, IL-10, IFN-&#x003b1; and TNF-&#x003b1; were also increased (p&#x0003c;0.05). Dose-related changes in mucosal ICAM-1 mRNA were also seen after challenge, and neutrophils appeared to peak in MLF at 8h. However, 2 subjects with high baseline cytokine levels showed prominent cytokine and chemokine responses to relatively low LPS doses (10&#x003bc;g and 30&#x003bc;g LPS).</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Topical nasal LPS causes dose-dependent increases in cytokines, chemokines, mRNA and cells. However, responsiveness can show unpredictable variations, possibly because baseline innate tone is affected by environmental factors. We believe that this new technique will have wide application in the study of the innate immune responses of the respiratory mucosa.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Key Messages</title><p>Ultrapure LPS was used as innate immune stimulus in a human nasal challenge model, with serial sampling of nasal mucosal lining fluid (MLF) by nasosorption using a synthetic absorptive matrix (SAM), and nasal curettage of mucosal cells. A dose response could be demonstrated in terms of levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL3 in MLF, as well as ICAM-1 mRNA in nasal curettage specimens, and levels of neutrophils in nasal lavage. Depending on higher baseline levels of inflammation, there were occasional magnified innate inflammatory responses to LPS.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Clinical Trials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02284074?term=nasal+lipopolysaccharide&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02284074</ext-link>

Challenge tests give a controlled stimulus after which serial measurements can be made, and the time course of responses can be assessed. Experimental challenge studies with components of microbes (including pathogen associated molecular patterns, PAMPs) and live viruses [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] give researchers the opportunity to study mucosal host-microbial interactions in terms of the specific and innate immune systems [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>The respiratory mucosa of the nose has an intricate sentinel role interacting with bacteria, viruses and aeroallergens [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. This is a complex and dynamic interaction that is mediated at a molecular level by PAMPs interacting with host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is contained in the wall of Gram negative bacteria and in a range of microbes, and is a powerful PAMP with potent immunostimulatory properties through interactions with Toll-like receptor (TLR)4. LPS represents the prototypic PAMP involved in certain bacterial infections [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], atopy [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and in acute lung injury [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Interestingly, TLR4 is involved in some viral infections [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. House dust mite allergen has been shown to mimic an LPS-binding component of the TLR4 signalling complex and causes activation of airway structural cells [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Environmental exposure to LPS in childhood may facilitate development of tolerance to allergens [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and this is one of a range of environmental microbial influences for the development of allergy and asthma [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>LPS has been employed extensively as a challenge agent by David Peden and coworkers: with systemic administration by intravenous infusion [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], by inhalation from a nebulizer [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], by segmental bronchial challenge [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and by nasal challenge [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In particular, the group of Lars-Olaf Cardell have carried out a series of studies with nasal LPS challenge: measuring CCL3 (MIP1&#x003b1;) in nasal lavage [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], evaluating a CXCR2 antagonist [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], demonstrating that allergen primes LPS responses [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and showing that LPS challenge has augmented nasal cytokine release in allergic rhinitis [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Recently, synthetic absorptive matrices (SAM) have been used to sample mucosal lining fluid (MLF) in the nose, followed by measurement of mediators. Nasosorption has been employed in neonates [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], children with rhinitis [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] and in relation to nasal allergen challenge (NAC) [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The method of nasosorption has advantages in being non-invasive and being able to sample neat MLF, which is eluted in a known volume of buffer [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Because there is less dilution, nasosorption allows detection of higher levels of chemokines and cytokines than after nasal lavage. An additional non-invasive sampling method employs nasal epithelial curettage that has been employed to assess gene expression after nasal allergen challenge [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and experimental rhinovirus infection [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In this study we carry out topical nasal ultra-pure LPS challenge in healthy non-atopic volunteers, and investigate the inflammatory response following a series of different doses of LPS. We employed serial nasosorption sampling and measured levels of soluble chemokines and cytokines using a multiplex immunoassay system. In addition, nasal epithelial curettage samples were taken for analysis of mRNA (transcriptomics) for intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) that is elevated in the nasal mucosa in allergic rhinitis [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics and Consent</title><p>This study was approved by the South West London Research Ethics Committee.

LPS potency was confirmed within our laboratory using the E-Toxate (<italic>Limulus</italic> Amoebocyte Lysate) kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, UK). A standard curve and dilutions of the test LPS were prepared and mixed with the lysate.

The subjects were seated in a forward-flexed neck position (60 degrees from the upright position) to prevent fluid from reaching the nasopharynx. To ensure adequate washing, the lavage fluid (5ml of 0.9% normal saline) was passed via a 10ml syringe slowly into the nasal cavity via an olive consisting of an oval, hollow, stainless steel device that was used to obstruct the nostril. The fluid was withdrawn into the syringe and gently flushed back into the nasal cavity 20 times over 1 minute.</p><p>Nasal lavage samples were initially centrifuged (4&#x000b0;C, 10 min at 400g), and the cell pellet resuspended in 0.01% dithiothreitol in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The samples were gently agitated on a rolling mixer for 10 minutes and centrifuged; the supernatant was discarded; the pellet was resuspended in PBS at 1 to 2 million cells/mL, and cytospin slides were prepared. Differential leukocyte counts were determined by assessment of 400 leukocytes on the stained cytospin.</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Nasosorption</title><p>Nasosorption was performed with strips of synthetic absorptive matrix (SAM; Fibrous Polyester; Hunt Developments, Midhurst, West Sussex, UK).

Nose clips were used to ensure good contact with the mucosal surface. Pre-chilled assay buffer (PBS, bovine serum albumin (BSA) 1%; Tween-20 0.05%, sodium azide 0.08% (Milliplex Assay Buffer, cat no. L-AB, Merck Millipore, Billerica, Mass., USA), was dispensed in 500&#x003bc;L aliquots into filter cups within Eppendorf tubes (Costar spin-X, cellulose acetate). After removal of the SAM strips from the nose, they were placed in the assay buffer, and spin filtration was performed (4&#x000b0;C for 5 min at 16,000 g).

The plates provided are pre-coated with antibody for the specific analytes. Diluent 2 (MSD) (25&#x003bc;l) was added to each well and the plate was incubated for 30 min while being vigorously shaken. All incubations in the MSD immunoassay were done on an orbital shaker at 1000 rpm at room temperature. 25&#x003bc;L of the sample or calibrator was added to each well. A standard curve of calibrators (10000, 2500, 625, 156.3, 39.1, 9.8 and 2.4pg/mL) was run in duplicate. Controls of known concentrations (625pg/mL and 9.8pg/mL) were done in quadruplicate. Three replicates of each sample were added. After an incubation of 2 hours on a shaker with the sample/calibrator the plates were washed three times with PBS + 0.05% Tween and then 25&#x003bc;L of 1X Detection Antibody Solution was added to each well. After incubation for 2 hours with vigorous shaking the plate was washed 3 times with PBS + 0.05% Tween. 150&#x003bc;L of 2X Read Buffer was added to each well and the plate was read immediately using a MSD Sector Imager 6000.

Original features of this report include the use of ultrapure LPS, serial nasal sampling by the novel method of nasosorption, employing LPS at a range of 4 doses, measuring a range of cytokines and chemokines using a multiplex immunoassay, and assessment of mRNA in epithelial curettage specimens. We were able to observe a dose response to LPS up to 30&#x003bc;g in terms of significantly increased levels of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, CXCL8 and CCL3, which suggests that the dose of 50&#x003bc;g per nostril employed by Cardell and co-workers is optimal in non-atopic subjects [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

In a study if repeated sampling in healthy volunteers, it was found that nasal lavage levels of a range of mediators were approximately 10-times lower than those from nasosorption eluates [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This was confirmed in a study of levels of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 after nasal allergen challenge (NAC), where levels of these interleukins were higher in nasosorption eluates, and frequently undetectable in nasal lavages [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In a recent study it was found that repeating nasal lavage within 0.5 to 4h caused markedly decreased levels of mediators, and they concluded that nasal lavage can only be performed once daily to get comparable results [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Using a modified nasal lavage collection method, a recent nasal LPS challenge study failed to show significant cytokine responses in allergic rhinitis patients, but amplified responses occurred when nasal allergen challenge preceded nasal LPS challenge [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The reason our study was able to document a dose response was probably because we utilized nasosorption to obtain nasal MLF, while other studies have generally measured more dilute nasal secretions present in nasal lavage.</p><p>An interesting finding in the study was that in 2 subjects there were large idiosyncratic responses to submaximal doses of LPS. Whereas the median response following higher doses of LPS may be up to 5 times greater than that after placebo, the idiosyncratic reactions involved IL-6 and IL-1&#x003b2; responses of greater than 1000 times those of placebo. Despite these large inflammatory reactions, subjects reported no symptoms, and there were no visible signs of nasal inflammation. When we assessed the sequence of LPS administrations, there was no evidence of a sensitization or tolerization process occurring with earlier doses. The phenomenon of tolerance to endotoxin has been demonstrated when low dose endotoxin is administered nasally up to 3 times on consecutive days [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>],</p><p>The idiosyncratic exaggerated reactions occurred in one subject after 10&#x003bc;g LPS and in another subject at 30&#x003bc;g LPS. The upper respiratory tract is now recognised to contain a vast array of commensal and pathogenic bacteria included within the nasal microbiome, and these may interact with aeroallergens [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In asymptomatic healthy individuals there is frequently carriage of the potential pathogens <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. There is then extensive crosstalk among PAMPs, TLRs and other innate PRRs in the mucosa [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Interestingly the mucosal relationship with bacteria and viruses is altered in the asthmatic or allergic airway. In particular, TLR4 signalling in stromal cells has been shown in mice to be critical for initiation of allergic Th2 responses [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>We are not currently able to explain these idiosyncratic responses, but each case there were high levels of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-6 in nasal mucosal lining fluid before challenge. This leads us to speculate that the idiosyncratic reactions relate to pre-activation by variations in nasal exposure to aeroallergens, viruses or bacteria.</p><p>In addition LPS caused a dose response in terms of induction of gene expression for ICAM-1, that is upregulated following inflammation, and acts as an epithelial receptor for human rhinoviruses (HRV). ICAM-1 is upregulated in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], and HRV causes activation of epithelial cells through this receptor. Measurement of soluble-ICAM-1 in nasal MLF would confirm whether the increased ICAM-1 gene expression relates to increased production of protein.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates a dose response to nasal LPS challenge in terms of levels of cytokines and chemokines measured in serial nasal MLF samples, and also with raised levels of ICAM-1 mRNA being found in serial nasal epithelial curettage samples. However, we also highlight the occasional phenomenon of an idiosyncratic large response to LPS, which is not dose-related, and that occurred in 2 subjects on single occasions.</p><p>In future studies this method, we intent do examine mucosal immune responses to a series of different challenge agents ranging from allergens, diverse microbial components and live viruses. We will also study the longitudinal responses to LPS and other agents over time and to document the influences of one nasal challenge agent on another (as has been done for nasal allergen challenge followed by LPS challenge [<xref rid="pone.0135363.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). Finally, in assessing the response to these nasal challenges in patients with allergic rhinitis and asthma, it may be possible to characterize mucosal immunology in individual patients as a basis for rational therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec028"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135363.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135363.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135363.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data Files.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135363.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0135363.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study Protocol.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0135363.s003.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0135363.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
