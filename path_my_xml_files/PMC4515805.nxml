Tea is prepared by the infusion of dried leaves of the tea plant, <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>, which contains bioactive compounds like polyphenols, flavonoids, and catechins that are thought to be responsible for the health benefits that have traditionally been attributed to tea. These compounds have multidimensional effects such as antibacterial action, inhibitory action on the bacterial and salivary amylase, and inhibition of acid production.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims:</title><p>The aim of this study is to compare the antiplaque efficacy of 0.5% <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract, 0.05% sodium fluoride, and 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash in children.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A randomized blinded controlled trial with 60 healthy children of age group 9&#x02013;14 years was carried out. The subjects were randomly assigned to three groups, i.e. group A &#x02013; 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, group B &#x02013; 0.05% sodium fluoride, and group C &#x02013; 0.5% <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract, with 20 subjects per group. Plaque accumulation and gingival condition were recorded using plaque index and gingival index. Oral hygiene was assessed by simplified oral hygiene index (OHIS). Salivary pH was assessed using indikrom pH strips.

Periodontitis starts with inflammatory lesions of the gingiva, which, if left untreated, may progress and eventually involve and compromise the entire periodontal apparatus of the affected teeth. Dental plaque is the primary etiologic factor in periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Mechanical plaque control is the most dependable oral hygiene measure, but mechanical oral hygiene methods of plaque removal require time, motivation, and manual dexterity.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Hence, the use of the antimicrobial agent is warranted to limit the growth of cariogenic microorganisms and prevent dental caries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The antiplaque agents can be delivered in the form of mouthwashes, dentifrices, chewing gums, gels, and chips. Mouthwashes, a safe and effective delivery system for antimicrobials, can play an important role in plaque reduction.</p><p>Chlorhexidine, triclosan, cetyl pyridinium chloride, essential oils, and fluoride-based solution are some of the antimicrobial agents tested against oral microbes.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Chlorhexidine is the gold standard chemical plaque control agent. Its ability to bind to soft and hard tissues in the oral cavity enables it to act for a long period after application. However, brown discoloration of dentition and restorative material, dorsum of the tongue, taste perturbation, oral mucosal ulceration, unilateral/bilateral parotid swelling, and enhanced supragingival calculus formation have been reported as the side effects of long-term chlorhexidine use.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Tea, a product made from the leaf and bud of the plant <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>, is the second most consumed beverage in the world, well ahead of coffee, beer, wine, and carbonated soft drinks. Numerous studies have demonstrated that tea possesses antioxidant, antimutagenic, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and antiviral, as well as cancer-preventive properties.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Green tea is made solely with the leaves of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> that have undergone minimal oxidation during processing. The most abundant components in green tea are polyphenols, in particular flavonoids such as the catechins, catechin gallates (Cg), and proanthocyanidins.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Many of the biological properties of green tea have been ascribed to the catechin fraction, which constitutes up to 30% of the dry leaf weight. These potent antioxidants comprise free catechins, such as (+)-catechin, (+)-gallocatechin, (&#x02212;)-epicatechin, and (&#x02212;)-epigallocatechin, and the galloyl catechins, such as (&#x02212;)-epicatechin gallate (ECg), (&#x02212;)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), (&#x02212;)-Cg, and (&#x02212;)-gallocatechin gallate. Green tea also contains carotenoids, tocopherols, ascorbic acid, minerals such as Cr, Mn, Se, or Zn, and certain phytochemical compounds. The therapeutic and biological activities of catechins reported include lower incidences of various pathological conditions such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, obesity, and cancer. These effects have been attributed, in part, to the antioxidative and free radical scavenging activities of the polyphenolic components of green tea.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Studies conducted in the past have shown that the green tea polyphenolic catechins, in particular (&#x02212;)-(EGCg) and (&#x02212;)-(ECg), can inhibit the growth of a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species with moderate potency. Evidence is emerging that these molecules may be useful in the control of common oral infections such as dental caries and periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Fluoride is an established antimicrobial agent. Because of its anticariogenic and remineralization properties, it is extensively used in the prevention of dental caries. However, due to risk of ingestion and fluoride toxicity, it is not recommended in small children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Sodium fluoride is regarded as a gold standard of caries prevention. It is extensively used to prevent and treat dental caries due to its anticariogenic and remineralization properties.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] This study was conducted to come up with novel and cost-effective mouthwashes that can be used by people for reducing the oral diseases. Tea is commonly used in India. What is required is promotion of the existing resources to gain confidence of local people, as well as efforts to promote oral health. The aim of the present study was to compare the effectiveness of 0.5% tea, 0.05% sodium fluoride, and 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwashes on oral health in children. The objective of the study was to compare the effects of three mouthwashes on plaque, gingivitis, salivary pH, and oral hygiene status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized blinded controlled trial was conducted with 60 healthy children of age group 9&#x02013;14 years was conducted [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].

(about seven tablespoons) of green tea with four cups of still (not sparkling) mineral water. This was steeped at room temperature for 1 h and then poured into a lidded container, straining the tea with sieve as it is poured, followed by refrigeration. The loose tea is discarded.

The names of children were written on small pieces of paper by a person not involved in this study and they were shuffled and randomly allocated into three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 20 subjects per group) by lottery method. The subjects were randomly assigned to three groups, i.e. group A &#x02013; 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate, group B &#x02013; 0.05% sodium fluoride, and group C &#x02013; 0.5% <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract, with 20 subjects in each group.</p><p>The children were instructed to rinse their mouth after brushing at morning and night, with 20 ml of the mouth rinse containing 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthwash, or 0.5% <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract mouthwash, for 60 s, twice a day, for 2 weeks. After each application, they were requested not to eat or drink for 1 h. Children's proper application of mouth rinse was supervised by their parents. After 2 weeks of regular application, the participants were instructed to stop using mouth rinses. It must be noted that the participants were given the same tooth brush and fluoride tooth paste to brush their teeth twice a day during the study. The subjects were requested not to use xylitol-containing products, tea, coffee, cocoa, systemic antibiotics, and topical fluoride treatment for 4 weeks before and during the study. They were also asked to report any change in health status or medicine being used. Any participant violating the rules was excluded.</p><p>Before starting the first phase, professional oral hygiene, which included scaling and root planing with polishing, was done and the plaque score was brought to zero. Single trained and calibrated investigator assessed the baseline plaque by PI, gingival status by GI, and the oral hygiene status was assessed by simplified oral hygiene index (OHIS; John C Greene and Jack R Vermillion, 1964) before the mouthwashes were distributed.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The pH of the saliva was checked by using commercially available pH strips, i.e. indikrom papers, with pH ranging from 2&#x02013;4.5 to 5.0&#x02013;7.5.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] The color changes on the pH strips were noted after keeping the strip in the unstimulated saliva for 1 min and matching with the color of standardized color chart given by the manufacturer to represent the pH of saliva. The results of this research indicated that before any intervention, there were no significant differences in the baseline values between three groups. So, it was possible to make a comparison between the effectiveness of three different mouth rinses on the plaque, gingival status, oral hygiene status, and salivary pH.</p><p>Exactly 250 ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, 0.05% sodium fluoride mouthwash, and 0.5% <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract mouthwash were provided to each subject in group A, group B, and group C, respectively, in a bottle. Data were collected at baseline, immediately after first rinse, and every week until the second week of study, and assessed for gingival status, plaque, oral hygiene, and salivary pH. Any side effects and acceptability of mouthwashes was recorded with a questionnaire. The questionnaire consisted of four questions (three close-ended and one open-ended) on acceptability or non-acceptability, reason for non-acceptability, any recommendations to change the mouthwashes, and how do they rate the present mouthwash.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The data were analyzed using a computer software program (SPSS version 17; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

The most commonly used mouth rinses in children for therapeutic purposes are 0.05% sodium fluoride and 0.02% chlorhexidine gluconate. Fluoride is an established antimicrobial agent; because of its anticariogenic and remineralization properties, it is extensively used in prevention of dental caries. However, due to risk of ingestion and fluoride toxicity, it is not recommended in small children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Chlorhexidine is known to be the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; mouth rinse against cariogenic flora. Many clinical trials have shown that the taste of chlorhexidine mouth rinse is not well accepted by children.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It also produces brown staining of teeth and affects the mucus membrane and tongue.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The most commonly prescribed concentration is 0.2%, which was, therefore, used in the study.</p><p>There is always a quest for new and improved products, with emphasis being placed on natural/nature identical products.

This was a triple-blind study wherein the investigator, study subjects, as well as the statistician were not aware to which group the subjects belonged and coding was done for each group and individual. The results of this research indicated that before any intervention, there were no significant differences in the baseline values between three groups. So, it was possible to make a comparison between the effectiveness of the three different mouth rinses on the plaque, gingival status, oral hygiene status, and salivary pH. No side effects or mishappenings were observed during the study procedure.</p><p>0.5% tea was used, so that the concentration does not change the taste but should cause maximum inhibition of variables. In the present study, 0.5% <italic>C. sinensis</italic> extract had the maximum desired effect when compared to 0.05% sodium fluoride and 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate. The plaque level was brought to 0.56 at the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> week from baseline (1.52), when compared to chlorhexidine. The salivary pH increase was more in tea group. The oral hygiene status improved from poor to good. Tea group had an upper hand when it came to gingival status, as the response was very good and quick when compared to sodium fluoride or chlorhexidine, which also showed significant effects.</p><p>Various mechanisms have been explained for the effect of tea on gingival health. Green tea catechin has been shown to be bactericidal against <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic> spp. <italic>in vitro</italic>. Tea catechins containing galloyl radicals possess the ability to inhibit both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell-derived collagenase, an enzyme that plays an important role in the disruption of the collagen component in the gingival tissues of patients with periodontal disease.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Catechin derivatives have been reported to inhibit certain proteases of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and may reduce periodontal breakdown.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Green tea catechins have also been shown to inhibit protein tyrosine phosphatase in <italic>Prevotella intermedia</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] EGCg has been reported to inhibit the production of toxic metabolites of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic>. A study has shown that purified tea polyphenols inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> growth and H<sub>2</sub> S production of <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Fusobacterium nucleatum</italic> associated with human halitosis.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Fluoride is an established antimicrobial agent and has anticariogenic and remineralization properties. So, it is extensively used in prevention of dental caries. Fluoride prevents dental caries through different processes. It inhibits adhesion of <italic>S. mutans</italic> to the tooth structure and, therefore, inhibits insoluble dextran production by the bacteria. It inhibits tooth demineralization and also remineralizes incipient carious lesions. However, due to risk of ingestion and fluoride toxicity, it is not recommended in small children.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Chlorhexidine is known to be the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; mouth rinse against cariogenic flora. Its ability to bind with soft and hard tissues in the oral cavity enables it to act for a long period after application. However, brown discoloration of dentition and restorative material, dorsum of the tongue, taste perturbation, oral mucosal ulceration, unilateral/bilateral parotid swelling, and enhanced supragingival calculus formation have been reported as the side effects of long-term chlorhexidine use. Many clinical trials have shown that the taste of chlorhexidine mouth rinse is not well accepted by children.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The most commonly prescribed concentration is 0.2%; hence, this was considered in the study.</p><p>The findings of a study on 6&#x02013;16-year-old children showed that regular daily consumption of green tea rich in catechin (576 mg per can) had no side effect on children's health. However, it can decrease obesity and cardiovascular risk factors in fat children.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] There have been other studies on the safety of catechin and no side effects have been found.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Whereas high amount of fluoride ingestion may lead to acute poisoning and its low repeated ingestion causes fluorosis, especially in children. So, sodium fluoride mouth rinse is not recommended for children younger than 6 years as they may swallow it.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Hence, this study is conducted on 8&#x02013;12-year-old children.</p><p>It has been shown that the earlier the colonization of <italic>S. mutans</italic> in the mouths of children, the higher the caries prevalence at 4 years of age. In fact, the earlier transmission of <italic>S. mutans</italic> occurs, the higher the caries risk at older ages.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Therefore, prescribing a safe and harmless antibacterial agent in children has an important role in prevention of dental caries at older ages.</p><p>Based on the results of this study and owing to fewer side effects along with good acceptability of green tea in comparison to sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine, it seems that green tea can be used with less concern compared to sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine mouth rinses in children. It is recommended that studies with larger sample size on chlorhexidine, sodium fluoride, and tea mouthwashes should be encouraged to assess their efficacy, dosage, toxicity, exact concentrations, formulas for patient recommendation, and long-term effectiveness.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In developing countries, the cost of traditional restorative treatment of dental diseases usually exceeds the available resources for oral health care. Prevalence of oral diseases is very high in India. Therefore, continued research is going on to find safe and effective oral hygiene aids for oral self-care of patients. Mouthwashes are used in dentistry for prevention and curative purposes, but their affordability and side effects have raised questions. Considering the fact that the mouth rinses available presently in market are chemical based, costly, and have side effects, which restricts their use especially in India, a cost-effective and easily available herb as an adjuvant to oral hygiene maintenance may have a far-reaching effect on the prevention as well as prevalence of oral diseases. The promotion of botanical herbs with fewer side effects and low cost may motivate the patient for oral hygiene maintenance.</p><p>The results of the study indicate that mouthwash prepared from green tea has a comparable antiplaque efficacy to chlorhexidine gluconate when used for a period of 14 days. Furthermore, green tea mouthwash has better taste and no known side effects that are found with fluoride and chlorhexidine mouthwashes. So, it can be used on a daily basis as an alternative for chlorhexidine gluconate and sodium fluoride as an antiplaque, anticariogenic, and remineralizing agent. More studies with bigger sample sizes and different variables are required to explore the role of extract of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> as an adjunct to oral health care.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
