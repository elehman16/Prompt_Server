Sexual and reproductive health in Sweden is generally good compared with international data but there are some worrying trends. The use of condoms has declined and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are increasing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C30">The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the abortion rate in Sweden is the highest among the Nordic countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C27">The Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare, 2009</xref>) and the highest abortion rate in Sweden is found among women aged 20&#x02013;29 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C31">The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2012a</xref>). As in other parts of Europe, women in Sweden delay childbearing until ages when reproductive capacity is decreased and the risk for age-related complications during pregnancy is increased; the mean age of first-time mothers is close to 29 years, and 13% of them are 35 years or older (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C32">The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2012b</xref>). Along with technical improvements this has led to a 4-fold increase of IVF in the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C32">The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2012b</xref>).</p><p>Attitudes to having children in the future have been investigated among the highly educated in Sweden, who tend to postpone childbearing more than those with lower education (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C2">Andersson <italic>et al</italic>., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C26">Statistics Sweden, 2011</xref>). Although it is often concluded that there will never be a perfect time for having children, many state prerequisites for parenthood, such as being of reasonable age, having a partner ready for a child, good living conditions and stable finances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C37">Tyd&#x000e9;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C11">Eriksson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). In studies among university students, the majority want to have on average two to three children; the first child at age 28&#x02013;32 years and their last child after age 35 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C25">Skoog Svanberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C16">Lampic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Six out of 10 women would choose to have an abortion if they became pregnant during their studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C37">Tyd&#x000e9;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Men and women are not sufficiently aware about age and fertility, and they overestimate the success rate of assisted reproduction techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C16">Lampic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C25">Skoog Svanberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Knowledge gaps about fertility issues have also been found among US, Finnish, Italian, Israeli and Canadian university students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C4">Bretherick <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C23">Rovei <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C14">Hashiloni-Dolev <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C39">Virtala <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C22">Peterson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Sexual health education, including basic information about reproduction, has been mandatory in Swedish schools for over 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C1">Agency for School Improvement, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C36">The Swedish National Agency for Education, 2011</xref>). The national guidelines do not, however, specify how or by whom the education should be implemented, and there are consequently differences in quality and quantity of sexual health education both between and within schools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C35">The Swedish National Agency for Education, 2000</xref>). The official responsibility for family planning in Swedish health care lies within maternity care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C29">The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2008</xref>) but the responsibility for coordinating measures to prevent unwanted pregnancies at a governmental level is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C28">The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, 2009</xref>). If appointments for contraceptive counselling, screening for Chlamydia and cervical screening are discounted, the majority of women will either enter the maternal health-care system once pregnant or when having trouble conceiving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C31">The National Board of Health and Welfare, 2012a</xref>). As there are no recommendations or guidelines for pre-pregnancy counselling, i.e. preconception care, within the Swedish health-care system, many women are unaware of the recommended health-promoting lifestyle changes to increase their chances of becoming pregnant and of having a normal pregnancy and a healthy child, until it is too late. One example of these is the intake of folic acid. Daily intake of folic acid 1 month prior to pregnancy reduces the risk of fetal neural tube defects by up to 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C19">Medical Research Council, 1991</xref>), and is therefore recommended by the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C34">National Food Agency (2013)</xref> for all women of reproductive age. A Swedish study shows that only 20% of pregnant women had taken folic acid in connection with pregnancy planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C38">Tyd&#x000e9;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The Health Belief Model (HBM) is a theoretical framework for understanding health behaviour. According to the HBM, a person will take action to prevent a health condition only if she (i) considers herself susceptible to the condition, (ii) estimates the consequences of the condition to be severe enough, (iii) believes the specific action is effective in decreasing the risk, (iv) believes that the benefit of the action outweighs the barriers to, or cost of, taking the action and (v) has enough self-efficacy. These beliefs are influenced by modifying factors, such as age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomics and knowledge. The model also describes cues to action, which is something that activates the individual behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C7">Champion and Skinner, 2008</xref>). The HBM has been applied to different areas within sexual and reproductive health, for example knowledge of human papillomavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C12">Gottvall <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>), sexual risk taking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C10">Ekstrand <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>) and contraception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C5">Brown <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>). In this study, the HBM was used as a theoretical framework for understanding different aspects of family planning.</p><p>The reproductive life plan (RLP) is a tool developed in an American context for reproductive health promotion in a life cycle perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C21">Moos <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) and consists of a set of non-normative questions about having or not having children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C20">Moos, 2003</xref>). The RLP aims to encourage both women and men to reflect on their reproductive intentions and to find strategies for successful family planning, for example to have the wanted number of children and to avoid unwanted pregnancies as well as ill-health that may threaten reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006</xref>). The RLP can be used both in counselling and in a written form, as booklets or worksheet (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/preconception/documents/ReproductiveLifePlan-Worksheet.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/preconception/documents/ReproductiveLifePlan-Worksheet.pdf</uri>). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended the RLP as a tool to increase preconception health and decrease both unintended pregnancies and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and emphasizes the importance of integrating reproductive health in primary health care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C6">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006</xref>). Several descriptions of the RLP are available in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C20">Moos, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C24">Sanders, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C17">Malnory and Johnson, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C3">Barry, 2011</xref>) and one study demonstrates that assessment of RLP in primary care is appreciated by exposed patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C9">Dunlop <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>). In spite of this, no previous study has systematically evaluated the effectiveness of using an RLP protocol in clinical practice. In the present study we evaluated the use of an RLP protocol as a starting point for providing structured information about reproduction in contraceptive counselling.</p><p>The aim of our study was to investigate if RLP-based information in contraceptive counselling increases women's knowledge of reproduction, and particularly knowledge of folic acid intake, prior to pregnancy. Secondary aims were to evaluate the influence on women's family planning and to explore different aspects of the women's overall experience of the RLP-based information. Although the RLP is developed to target both men and women, this study will focus on women only.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting, participants and procedure</title><p>The study had a randomized controlled design and the procedure is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DET279F1">1</xref>. The study took place at a Student Health Centre from March to June 2012. Female students (<italic>n</italic> = 338) who visited midwives for contraceptive counselling (<italic>n</italic> = 287), Chlamydia testing (<italic>n</italic> = 37) or cervical screening (<italic>n</italic> = 14) were invited in consecutive order to participate in the study. Swedish midwives are licensed to prescribe hormonal contraceptives and to insert intrauterine devices and implants for women without medical problems. The midwives at the Student Health Centre have 15 min allotted for each consultation. Some appointments take 15 min or more while others (prescription of gestagen-only pills, testing for Chlamydia) take less time. Three midwives (among these the last author, T.T.) at the clinic recruited the participants. The only exclusion criterion was insufficient knowledge of Swedish. Before the study, the principal investigator (J.S.) informed the midwives about the concept of the RLP and the study procedure to ensure equivalent execution. During the study period, all visits to the midwives were scheduled for 5 extra minutes.

The calculations assumed that the intervention would increase the knowledge of folic acid to 40% (i.e. increase by 100%). To detect a difference between the intervention and control groups with 80% power and with a significance level of <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, 82 women were needed in each group. In order to allow for possible drop-out during the study, we planned to recruit 100 women in each group.</p><p>During the study period, 338 women visited the clinic and were assessed for eligibility. The study procedure is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DET279F1">1</xref>. The midwives informed eligible women about the study in the waiting room, ensuring that they knew that participation was voluntary and could be ended at any time without further explanation or consequences for treatment. The women received both verbal and written information before giving their written consent. The response rate was 88% (<italic>n</italic> = 299).</p><p>The women who accepted participation were randomized in blocks of three by receiving a sealed envelope containing instructions for either the intervention group (IG, <italic>n</italic> = 101) or one of two control groups (CG1, <italic>n</italic> = 100 and CG2, <italic>n</italic> = 98). The envelopes for the IG were coded so that the midwife would know whom to give the intervention to. Before the counselling the IG and CG1 completed a baseline questionnaire in the waiting room. In order to be able to analyse the effect of the questionnaire <italic>per se</italic>, the women in CG2 were not asked to complete this questionnaire.</p><p>All groups received standard care. The national guidelines for standard care in contraceptive counselling includes taking a medical history (heredity, medication, previous pregnancies and previous experiences of contraception), measuring blood pressure and weight, counselling and provision of contraceptives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C18">Medical Products Agency, 2005</xref>). Standard care for Chlamydia testing and cervical screening is the testing procedure as such, with no extensive counselling involved. In addition to standard care the IG received the RLP-based intervention.</p><p>Two months after the visit (May to August) trained research assistants interviewed the women in all groups according to a structured questionnaire equivalent to the baseline questionnaire. The follow-up was conducted by telephone instead of mail or email to minimize the risk that the women would check the brochure or other source for information for the correct answers to the knowledge questions while answering and thereby biasing the results. Non-responders were approached repeatedly via telephone, text message and email. Of the 299 women who entered into the study, 262 (88%) participated in the follow-up interview. After the interviews the brochure used in the intervention was sent to the women in CG1 and CG2 in order to provide them with the same information about reproduction that was given to the IG.</p><p>The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board in Uppsala, Sweden.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Instrument</title><p>The main outcome measure was knowledge of reproduction including knowledge of folic acid intake prior to conception. Secondary outcome measures were family planning intentions and the experience of the intervention.</p><p>The questionnaire was designed by the authors to evaluate the intervention and was developed on the basis of earlier research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C20">Moos, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C16">Lampic <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C37">Tyd&#x000e9;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C25">Skoog Svanberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C7">Champion and Skinner, 2008</xref>). It was reviewed and commented on by researchers, clinicians and laypeople to ensure high face and construct validity. To test the instrument and procedure, we also conducted a pilot study with 25 women in each group. Based on feedback from the women, the phrasing of two questions was modified and a clarifying explanation was added. The final baseline questionnaire included 28 questions.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Background/demographic data (seven items)</title><p>The women were requested to state the date, their age, level of university education, own and parents' country of birth, sexual orientation and if they currently were in a stable relationship or not.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Reproductive history (five items)</title><p>The women were asked if they had experience of trying to get pregnant and, if so, any problems in achieving pregnancy.

The women were also requested to state how confident they felt in having the number of children they desired on a visual analogue scale (VAS) with the extreme values &#x02018;not confident at all&#x02019; (0) and &#x02018;totally confident&#x02019; (10). Finally, all women were requested to state how likely it was that a pregnancy within the following 6 months would be planned, with four response alternatives ranging from &#x02018;very likely&#x02019; to &#x02018;totally unlikely&#x02019;.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Knowledge about different aspects of reproduction (six items)</title><p>The knowledge questions were open ended to minimize the risk of an overestimation of the knowledge by listing alternatives.

The questions covered: if the woman had previously thought about the topics included in the intervention (&#x02018;a lot&#x02019; to &#x02018;not at all&#x02019;), if any of the information was new to her (&#x02018;a lot&#x02019; to &#x02018;not at all&#x02019;), the overall impression of being asked about the RLP (&#x02018;very positive&#x02019; to &#x02018;very negative&#x02019;), if the intervention made her think about reproduction in a different way (&#x02018;very much&#x02019; to &#x02018;very little&#x02019;), if the intervention had made her search for more information about reproduction (&#x02018;a lot&#x02019; to &#x02018;not at all&#x02019;), the likelihood of turning to a midwife if she had further questions about reproduction (&#x02018;very likely&#x02019; to &#x02018;very unlikely&#x02019;) and finally, if midwives and/or other health-care professionals routinely should discuss RLP with their patients (yes, both midwives and other health-care professionals/yes, but only midwives/yes, but only other health-care professionals/no/don't know).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Intervention: RLP-based information</title><p>In addition to the standard care given to all women, the IG participated in a semi-structured discussion aimed to encourage the woman to reflect on her own RLP. The midwife then provided targeted information based on the woman's reproductive intentions. For guidance, the midwife used an RLP-based interview guide, as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C20">Moos (2003)</xref>, as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DET279F2">2</xref>, and the specific information as listed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DET279F3">3</xref>. All women received the same information, but delivered in an individualized way depending on the woman's answers. For women who did not wish to have children emphasis was placed on how to avoid an unplanned pregnancy and preserve fertility. For women who intended to become pregnant in the future, emphasis was placed on information on how to preserve their fertility and what to do when they wished to become pregnant. All women were informed to start taking folic acid on the same day they discontinued their regular contraceptive method. It took &#x0223c;5&#x02013;15 min to relate the RLP-based information to women. All women in the IG also received a specially designed brochure to take home. The brochure was inspired by RLP leaflets used in the USA and adapted to the Swedish context, and included both information about the RLP and the information about reproduction shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DET279F3">3</xref>.

The IG and CG1 were compared regarding background variables (age, level of university education, immigrant background, relationship status) and reproductive history (history of STI, pregnancy, abortion, miscarriage, childbirth) with independent <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables, Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test for ordinal variables and Pearson's <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test for categorical variables. Non-responders at follow-up were compared with responders using the same procedure.</p><p>In order to obtain the main outcome variable, knowledge questions were computed to form a knowledge score. The answers to the two open-ended questions could sum up to a maximum of six points each (1 point for at least one correct answer in each category) according to the intervention-specific information (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DET279F3">3</xref>). For the additional four questions, each entirely correct answer received two points and almost correct answers were given one point. The total score could thus range between 0 and 20. Since this score was not normally distributed, it was analysed using non-parametric methods. Correlations between the total score and background variables (age, level of education, immigrant background) and reproductive history (history of STI, relationship status, desire for having children, history of pregnancy) were analysed using Spearman's correlation coefficient. Differences in the knowledge score between groups at baseline and follow-up were analysed with Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test. Differences between baseline and follow-up within groups were analysed with Wilcoxon signed ranks test. To adjust for baseline differences between the groups a multiple linear regression analysis was conducted, using the total knowledge score as the dependent variable and baseline knowledge score and group assignment as independent variables. The relationship between knowledge of folic acid (mentioned folic acid/did not mention folic acid) and group assignment at baseline and at follow-up was analysed with Pearson's <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test.</p><p>Differences between groups in the secondary outcome variables (desire of having children, preferred age for having children and confidence of having the desired number of children) were analysed with Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test.

Our study showed that with only a small period of time, &#x0223c;10 min, we succeeded in increasing both knowledge of reproduction in general and knowledge of folic acid intake. Our intervention influenced women to plan for their last child earlier in life. This is very promising, as previous studies have indicated a need for education about age and fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C4">Bretherick <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C23">Rovei <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C39">Virtala <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C14">Hashiloni-Dolev <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C8">Daniluk and Koert, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C22">Peterson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The midwives explicitly told the women in the IG to take folic acid pills when they discontinued hormonal contraceptive pills. The advice of taking a new kind of pill instead of a contraceptive pill might be easy to remember and can explain the increased knowledge.</p><p>Increased knowledge about reproduction may enable women to make informed choices about their RLP easier, avoiding unwanted pregnancies, preserving fertility and enhancing preconception health. It is therefore important to increase accessibility to information and health education about reproduction. Although significantly higher than the control group, the knowledge of reproduction was still not particularly high after the intervention. We used the RLP-based question &#x02018;do you plan to have (more) children in your life?&#x02019; as a starting point for our intervention. However, as the information about reproduction was initiated by the midwives and not requested by the women in the IG this might be one explanation for the limited effect on their knowledge. This may also be due to the fact that the women were young and many did not plan to start a family for several years. The intervention might have given even better results in a motivated population, with women who are planning to become pregnant soon. Regardless of this, it is important to target all women of reproductive age, since many pregnancies are unplanned.</p><p>In line with earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C25">Skoog Svanberg <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C37">Tyd&#x000e9;n <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), women had planned to delay childbearing until an age when reproductive capacity decreases and age-related complications increase. It is therefore encouraging that the intervention made the women plan for their last child earlier in life. We believe that the intervention may empower women and, for example, help them to understand what aspects of reproduction they are able to control, such as lifestyle habits, and what aspects they cannot control, for example declining fertility with advancing age. The intervention increased their self-efficacy in taking health-promoting actions for their reproductive health. After the intervention the women were more confident to have the desired number of children, stated to a higher degree that it was unlikely that they would ever experience an unplanned pregnancy and responded to higher degree that it was likely that they would make lifestyle changes in connection with pregnancy planning. Conclusions about the increase in confidence need to be drawn with caution, as an increase was also seen in CG1. Responding to questions about the RLP may have stimulated reflection on their own plans and thereby increased their confidence, regardless of whether the questions were posed in a questionnaire or by health-care personnel. The increase might also reflect the difference in measurement: in writing, as a VAS, at baseline and verbally at follow-up. As a higher proportion of women in the IG stated that they wanted children after the intervention, it is possible that lack of desire to have children is related to low knowledge of reproduction. But as the difference was seen also in the CG1 it is likely that many women had not fully reflected on these questions earlier, and only by being asked about their RLP did they realize that they actually wanted to have children sometime in the future.</p><p>Our follow-up time was short (at 2 months) and it was therefore not possible to study the intervention's possible effect on behaviour, such as increased incidence of health-promoting behaviour prior to pregnancy. Still, according to HBM, changing modifying factors and targeting individual beliefs are the first steps to change individual behaviours. The intervention aimed not only to increase the knowledge of reproduction, but also to influence the women's perception of their susceptibility to and severity of the consequences of an unplanned pregnancy, the perceived benefits of lifestyle changes in connection to pregnancy planning and to increase their self-efficacy. Pregnancy planning was intended to be perceived as a cue to action for health-promoting lifestyle changes. By targeting these aspects, young women would become better equipped to make informed choices about their sexual and reproductive health. The use of the HBM to understand contraceptive behaviour has recently been reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C13">Hall (2012)</xref>, who concluded that the HBM can be used as a framework to predict and explain contraceptive behaviour and to promote strategies to improve family planning outcomes. The HBM is also applicable for understanding preconception health and was used in a recent study about folate intake to demonstrate mechanisms influencing behavioural changes in women who are planning a pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C15">Jensen <italic>et al</italic>., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Another important finding was that the majority of women appreciated the intervention and considered that midwives routinely should discuss RLP with their patients. Since the majority of our participants visited the clinic for contraceptive counselling we suggest that guidelines for contraceptive counselling should include RLP-based questions. Our results show that health-care personnel should not hesitate to pose personal questions about reproductive health, even if they feel those questions are sensitive. This correlates well with a previous study, in which it was found that young women consider it natural to be asked questions about sexual health during gynaecological encounters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C41">Wendt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>), and they express great trust towards midwives and doctors. The women feel that questions about their situation open a dialogue and help clarify their situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C40">Wendt <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Still, it must be emphasized that it is always important when discussing questions such as these, to adapt the information to the individual, to use a non-normative approach and respect the informant's autonomy. If health professionals feel unable to give RLP-based information due to time constraints, we suggest using specially designed leaflets and/or recommending reliable websites. We believe that national evidence-based guidelines for preconception care would be an important step towards promoting reproductive health and, as such, useful for both the public and for health care personnel.</p><p>The study was conducted by dedicated midwives at a small clinic. It is possible that if implemented routinely, the RLP-based information would be less standardized, and more adapted to the individual patient, which could have both advantages and disadvantages. It is also possible that the effect of the intervention was connected to the women's high level of education. Women with a university education might more easily benefit from such an intervention than women with a lower level of education, and conclusions for the general population should therefore be drawn with caution. Still, consistent with earlier research among university students in different settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C4">Bretherick <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C23">Rovei <italic>et al</italic>., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C14">Hashiloni-Dolev <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C39">Virtala <italic>et al</italic>., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DET279C22">Peterson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), these highly educated women had low levels of knowledge of reproduction at baseline. It is likely that women with a lower level of education might have more limited knowledge and therefore could benefit even more from a similar intervention.</p><p>This is the first study to evaluate the use of an RLP in clinical practice in a systematic way. By using a randomized controlled design with two control groups we are confident that our results demonstrate the effect of the RLP intervention and that they are not biased by group selection. This study presents a feasible way of introducing the concept of preconception care in the Swedish health system, where preconception has not yet been included. The intervention was conducted with a limited amount of time and resources and is easy to adapt to the current standard care. Given the moderate knowledge of reproduction at baseline, there seems to be a need for increased health education to women of reproductive age. The RLP should be considered as a useful tool for reproductive health promotion and can be used by all health-care professionals working with issues related to reproductive health, for example at youth clinics, family planning services, genitourinary medicine clinics and by general practitioners. The next step in our research will be to implement RLP in routine contraceptive counselling. The counsellors will play a key role in successful implementation and it is therefore important to capture their perceptions of this novel approach to contraceptive counselling. Further studies will be needed on how to target men and also to investigate the effect on health behaviour.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study showed that the RLP-based information increased women's knowledge both of reproduction and of folic acid intake prior to pregnancy, affected the women's RLP and was appreciated by the women.
