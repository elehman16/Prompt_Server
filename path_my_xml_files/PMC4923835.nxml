<bold><italic>Introduction:</italic></bold> Education is the most effective and economical
part of diabetes treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a
training program with multimedia software on the knowledge and self-care behaviors of
patients with type 2 diabetes. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> This study was a randomized controlled clinical
trial in which 60 patients referred to diabetes clinic at Arak city were divided randomly
into experimental (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. The instruments for collecting data
were "Summary of Diabetes self-care activities questionnaire" and "knowledge of self-care
in patients with diabetes". Data were collected before and 2 months after the intervention
in the both groups. Educational program with equal content was applied for both
experimental group (self-care program with multimedia software support) &#x00026; control
group (lecture and presentation with PowerPoint). Data analysis was done using SPSS
Ver.13. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> Implementation of the self-care program with
multimedia software support resulted in improvements in patients&#x02019; self-care behaviors in
the experimental group, whereas these behaviors had not significant changes in the control
group after eight weeks. There was a significant difference in the mean score of knowledge
in both the experiment and control groups before and after the intervention.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusion:</italic></bold> Considering beneficial effects of training
program with multimedia software support on the knowledge and self-care behaviors and the
importance of this issue, suggested that the patients preferably provide terms of use of
educational software for themselves.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Diabetes mellitus type 2</kwd><kwd>Multimedia</kwd><kwd>Self-care</kwd><kwd>Software</kwd></kwd-group><counts><table-count count="3"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta><notes><p> Please cite this paper as: Farmahini Farahani M, Purfarzad Z, Ghorbani M, Ghamari Zare Z,

levels, which happens as a result of insulin resistance or impaired insulin secretion in the
body.<sup><xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Disturbance in the metabolism of
carbohydrates, proteins and fats deficiency or lack of insulin leads to damage to various
organs and reduce the life span of patient.<sup><xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup></p><p> In 2010, the number of patients with type 2diabetes was approximately 200 million people
worldwide which is projected to rise to 266 million people within 25 years.<sup><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> According to the statistics, the percentage of
patients with this disease is reported to be between 1% and 4% in the general population and
5% and 10% in individuals older than 40.<sup><xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
&#x0200f;</p><p> Regarding the epidemic of diabetes mellitus and its high mortality and morbidity, this
disease has become a concern at public health in the world.<sup><xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p> The amount of knowledge on diabetes patients has significant role in controlling this
disease and promoting self-care activites.<sup><xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
According to the Orem&#x02019;s definition, self-care is a regulatory learned function in humans
that is based on the people&#x02019;s ability to take care of themselves.<sup><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p> Lack of awareness of related behavior to self-care, incorrect information or lack of
understanding of treatment impact on patient&#x02019;s adherence to the treatment. However,
awareness by implementing education programs has positive effects on the lifestyle and
outcome of the disease.<sup><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Jalilian, citing
Kamel et al., highlights the importance of knowledge of self-care behaviors.<sup><xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup></p><p> People with chronic diseases such as diabetes need self-care behaviors during their
lifetime<sup><xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and it includes the most
important activities such as healthy and balanced diet, following-up of medical therapy,
monitoring glucose levels to adjust the diet, activity level and prescribed
medication.<sup><xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Using appropriate
strategies about lifestyle and self-care are the key elements for the prevention of diabetes
that requires comprehensive educational interventions.<sup><xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In this regard, various
educational programs is provided around the world to empower and present adequate skills of
self &#x02013;care to patients.<sup><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> However, the main challenge of training programs is selecting
the interventions which has long term effects, because most programs have a positive impact
in the short or medium time.<sup><xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p> One of the major innovation in education is E-learning. This unique approach allows
individuals to learn anywhere they like.<sup><xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>
Using computer training programs help learners who have a limited time for training and
consultancy. Use of technology-based approaches may be has greater value in people with
diabetes, elderly and people who have complicated problems. Multimedia programs have lots of
advantages such as benefiting from contexts and audio or video elements like videos, icons
and graphic.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Computer-based training
programs may reduce the workload of busy service providers and has limited time for helpful
consultancy and training.<sup><xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> In addition,
these programs enable people to benefit from information according to personal needs,
profits and competency and also evaluation of knowledge for enrichment of goals.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> It is also possible to use computer technology
to provide constant support and help to facilitate the care of patients.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p> The study of Khandan et al., and Noohi et al., show that E-learning is effective on
operations of patients suffering from diabetes type II,<sup><xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and knowledge and self-care
attitude.<sup><xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p> The results of one qualitative study (2014) showed that diabetic patients had limited
training to applying technology in managing their disease and require interventions based on
computer technology for their education management strategy.<sup><xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> According to the findings of previous study and with regard to
the management of diabetes that is a challenge for patients and health care
professional,<sup><xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>one of the most
important and integral component of managing diabetes at any age is training patients on
self-care activities.<sup><xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p> Implementation of new training techniques such as the use of educational software which is
freely available, may have positive impact on patient&#x02019;s knowledge on managing diabetes.
Therefore, by believing that traditional classes are not effective,<sup><xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> the present study was performed to evaluate
the effectiveness of training programs with multimedia software support on knowledge and
self-care behaviors of diabetic patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and methods</title><p> This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial. The study population included all
patients with diabetes type II, who had referred to diabetes clinic of Arak city and met
inclusion criteria. An informed consent form was obtained from all candidates after
explanation of the goals and plans of the study.</p><p> Participants were randomly divided into two groups, experiment (n=33) and control (n=34)
by random number table. The sample size was obtained through conducting a pilot study and it
was evaluated using the minimum sample size formula for making comparison means between two
independent sample populations. Using mean and standard deviation of variables for groups
and possible 10% attrition rate, the required sample size for the Alpha 0.05 and test power
of 0.8, 33 patients were calculated in each group.</p><p> Inclusion criteria included: patients with diabetes type II, aged between 20 to 60 years,
personal or one of the family members access to computer for using software, ability to
read, ability of performing self-care, and lack of previous use of multimedia training
approach for diabetes. Exclusion criteria included: unwillingness to continue participation
in the study, failure to complete the questionnaire, and lack of use of the software. Seven
patients don&#x02019;t complete the questionnaire, 2 month after clinical trial. Finally, 30
patients in experimental and 30 patients in control group completed the study.</p><p> A one-day training course was performed in control group under the title of &#x0201c;Self-care in
diabetes patients&#x0201d;. Educational program with equal content was applied for both groups. Time
schedule of this program was 180 minutes. Educational methods were lecture and presentation
with PowerPoint program. The experimental group was trained with self-care program.</p><p> Self-care program with an educational software support was applied in experimental group
with following steps:</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Designing &#x00026; determining the validity of multimedia software: </title><p> The title of multimedia software was &#x0201c;Self-care in diabetes patients&#x0201d;. The content of
educational software included an introduction on diabetes, diabetes &#x00026;amp;amp; sport,
diabetes &#x00026;amp;amp; blood sugar control, diabetes &#x00026;amp;amp; digestion and diabetes
and foot care. Firstly the researcher prepared required items for determining the validity
of software by the use of relevant books and papers about training of diabetes patients.
Some images, contents, animation and audio were used for making this software. For
ensuring about scientific validity of content, 5 members of Nursing Scientific Board
checked the software. Also 3 diabetes patients received the same software to determine
their understanding of educational issues. Finally all required changes were made
accordingly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Group training</title><p> There were 2 group training sessions with a 2-week intervals. All group training
sessions include 10-15 patients and hold at Health Center of Markazi province.</p><p>
<italic><bold>First session:</bold></italic> The educational content included introduction of diabetes, diabetes
&#x00026;amp;amp; sport, diabetes &#x00026;amp;amp; blood sugar control, diabetes &#x00026;amp;amp;
digestion and diabetes and foot care. All questions from patients were answered. The first
session was about 180 minutes. At the end, all patients received their self-care software.
They were requested to use their self-care software at least once a week after the
educational program. In case of any question, they were free to call us for telephone
consultancy. So, they received the required telephone numbers.</p><p>
<italic><bold> Second session: </bold></italic> After assessing the patient's condition
and their self-care activities and receiving suitable feedback, all questions of patients
about their self-care necessities were answered in this session. Also patients were free
to explain their experiences and feelings. Time schedule of second session was averagely
90 minutes.</p><p> To determine the level of knowledge of self-care of patients with diabetes, a researcher
made questionnaire was used. The questions were developed based on a review of literature.
It consisted 34 questions and 4 subscales including diet (11 questions), exercise (5
questions), blood Sugar control (11 questions) and Foot Care (7 questions). The
questionnaire was given to 8 of the Faculty of Nursing and 3 patients in order to
determine its content validity and after considering their comments, the questionnaire
distributed among 20 patients with diabetes and calculated reliability with Cronbach's
alpha was 0.74. For easy interpretation of the findings, the total score and subscales
were calculated as percentage. The minimum and maximum score was 0 and 100, respectively.
Higher scores indicated higher levels of knowledge.</p><p> To determine the self-care activities of patients with diabetes, The Summary of Diabetes
Self-Care Activities (SDSCA) questionnaire was used. This questionnaire was designed by
Toobert et al., Regarding the purposes of this study, some parts of the questionnaire was
used which was consisting of 14 questions and 4 subscales including; diet (5 questions),
exercise (2 questions), blood sugar testing (2 questions) and foot care (5
questions).<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> For validity, the
questionnaire was translated into Persian and then was back translated to English. During
the process, problems and ambiguities has been identified and resolved in translation. The
results of the study of Ghaneie et al., in Iran showed that its reliability by using
test-retest method was r = 0.71.<sup><xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In
the present study, Cronbach's alpha was 0.70.</p><p> The evaluation is parameterized in days of the week, on a scale of 0 to 7, corresponding
to the behaviors related to the last seven days. The mean scores of questions were
calculated for each subscale.<sup><xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p> Data were collected before and 2 months after the intervention in the both groups. To
complete the questionnaire, the patients of both groups were called to refer to diabetes
clinic two month after clinical trial.</p><p> Statistic data were analyzed by SPSS Ver 13 software and using descriptive statistics
(Absolute and estimated frequency, mean and standard deviation) and inferential
statistics. Independent t test was applied for comparing of demographic variables between
both groups in term of age and duration of disease. Chi-square test was used for gender
and literacy level.</p><p> Independent t-test was used for comparing the mean difference between knowledge scores
and self-care activities between pre- and post-intervention in both control and experiment
groups. Paired t-test was used in comparing the mean score of self-care activities in each
group before and after intervention. It should be noted that the results of the
Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnov&#x000a0;test showed that all of the study variables had a normal
distribution.</p><p> The present study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Arak University of Medical
Sciences, Arak, Iran, and (No.92-151-7).</p><p> This study was conducted after obtaining an informed consent from all subjects
participating in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p> The majority of participants were female (n = 39, 65%). The mean (SD) of age was 51.64 &#x000b1;
12.29 year. The mean (SD) of duration of illness was 8.01 (6.82) year. Results of
independent t-test didn&#x02019;t show any significant difference in comparing the mean age (P=0.19)

were middle-aged and their mean duration of illness showed that this disease is chronic in
nature; therefore, they are in greater need for more information on their disease and
effective methods of self-care.</p><p> According to the Winkelman&#x02019;s view, diabetes has a complicated nature, with a gradual
development, and unpredictable relapses and recoveries periods, which due to its chronic
course, entails the patient&#x02019;s greater involvement in the self-care program.<sup><xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> In the present study, women composed the
majority of patients in both experimental and control groups. Similar studies have shown
that the incidence of Type 2 diabetes is rising among female populations.<sup><xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> The results of the present study are also
indicative of changes in the scores of study variables in experimental and control groups.
This showed the positive impacts of education on the patients.</p><p> This study was done to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs, by using
multimedia software on knowledge and self-care behaviors in diabetic patients. The results
showed that training can improve patient knowledge (experimental and control) .This result
is in line with other studies which support the positive impact of education on raising
awareness of diabetes.<sup><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>-<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Heinrich et al., studied the impact of self-management
training program based on web on patients with diabetes type II. The intervention resulted
in significant increase in knowledge of patients, and users satisfied with the content and
credibility of the program.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> In another
study by Kandula et al., study, multimedia training program also caused a significant
increase in knowledge scores of patients with any level of education. However, patients with
inadequate literacy could less learn significantly as compared to those who were literate
enough.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> According to a systematic
review 16 studies from 19 trial studies showed the positive effect of computer using on
diabetic patients.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup></p><p> In this study, the self-care behaviors were also investigated because of increasing
knowledge and improving health behavior change is not sufficient to conclude. Several
studies have been done in Iran and abroad on self-care behaviors in patients with type 2
diabetes. Considering the results indicating the weak performance of the patients on
self-care behaviors and, eventually, the possibility of the incidence of undesirable side
effects and outcomes, all of these studies unanimously agree on the need for making
lifestyle modifications for improving self-care behaviors.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p> The results showed that the training can be effective on care activities of patients in
the experimental group. However, there wasn&#x02019;t significant difference in the results of
regular tests after training (lecture and slide presentation) in the control group. This
finding could indicate an application of the training method used in experimental group that
are displayed high potential for enhancing the lifestyle and self-care behaviors.</p><p> Also, due to the lack of a significant difference in the mean score of knowledge before
and after the intervention in both groups, the use of educational software as an effective
strategy for teaching could lead to greater balance in the visual and auditory learning and
by learning and implementing the recommendations of care achieved more improvements in
care.</p><p> Clinical benefits of computer-based diabetes education are one of the findings of several
studies. Glasgow et al., found that patient-centered interventions and computer technology
could improve the problems of diabetic patients in the areas of quality of life, depression,
fat and HbA1c.<sup><xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> In another study in 2006,
he concluded that short-term periods of interfere by the help of computer and further
feedbacks, designed goals, problem solving and consistency of health consultants may lead to
a significant reduction in high-fat regimes and weight.<sup><xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> The results of these studies were consistent with the findings of this
study.</p><p> Optimal use of educational programs and strategies is necessary for type 2 diabetic
patients. We believe that health education interventions must incorporate strategies that
can improve retention of health information and engaging patients in long-term learning.</p><p> Norris et al showed that implementing of e-education programs, due to increased self-care
and patient involvement in their care, was a good way to teach these patients.<sup><xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup></p><p> Khan et al., also indicated the impact of multimedia educational program on
self-management performance on diabetic patients, achieved a significant difference in the
correct use of drugs and reducing HbA1c levels in multimedia group. The results of the
comparison showed that the experiment group had more knowledge; however it was not
significant.<sup><xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p> Numerous studies show that most diabetic patients have low or moderate level of
knowledge<sup><xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>-<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> and also lower-middle self-care.<sup><xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>-<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup></p><p> One of the strength points of study was designing a software for the whole information
needs of diabetes patients in a form of an integrated software which is applicable for other
learners such as nursing students, nurses, patients&#x02019; families and even for automatic display
at therapeutic clinics on monitors and TV sets. Regarding the applied sounds, even
illiterate and low literate patients could benefit due to the lack of facilities to be
present in educational courses.</p><p> Since the participants of the present study were selected from among referring patients to
diabetes clinic, therefore it was possible to have volunteer bias. On the other hand, all
data were collected as self-reporting form. Then, it is possible not to reflect real
functions of people.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p> In this study, training program was done to support multimedia software and in accordance
with the findings of the research, the effect of interventions to increase knowledge and
self-care of patients with diabetes was confirmed. It seems that the active role of patients
in their care is the reason for this change. It is hoped that the ability to distance
training attract the attention of policy makers and health care providers to use electronic
management of chronic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p> The authors thanks all the research assistants and diabetes specialists at the health
