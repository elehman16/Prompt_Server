While several factors appear to be involved in this phenomenon, growing evidence suggest that appetite reduction plays an important role <xref rid="pone.0098874-Kayser1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Indeed, decreased appetite and energy intake, collectively termed &#x0201c;altitude anorexia&#x0201d; is frequently reported during high altitude exposures and can induce negative energy balance, especially when coupled with increased levels of physical activity <xref rid="pone.0098874-WesterterpPlantenga1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Rose1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p>Altitude-related appetite modulation is not entirely understood. Initially, the observed appetite reduction was only linked to acute mountain sickness <xref rid="pone.0098874-Hackett1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. However, the reported reductions in appetite, as well as energy intake, after altitude sickness symptoms subside imply other underlying mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0098874-Tschop1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Among these, hormonal regulation might potentially play a role since several appetite-related gut hormones, and adipokines are affected by acute and/or prolonged hypoxic exposure <xref rid="pone.0098874-Kayser1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Riepl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Acute hypoxia has been shown to reduce circulating levels of the appetite-stimulating hormone, ghrelin, both in the fasted <xref rid="pone.0098874-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and fed state <xref rid="pone.0098874-Riepl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, although the fasting ghrelin concentration reportedly returns to baseline levels after 7 and 49 days of continuous exposure <xref rid="pone.0098874-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Benso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. On the other hand, hypoxia has been shown to increase serum levels of the satiety-signaling hormone leptin, both acutely <xref rid="pone.0098874-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Tschop2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and after 7 days at altitude <xref rid="pone.0098874-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Reports in the literature present contradictory findings with regard to both ghrelin and leptin responses to hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0098874-Benso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-SierraJohnson1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, presumably attributable to different experimental paradigms (hypobaric vs. normobaric hypoxia, rest vs. exercise and different hypoxic doses). Another potential explanation for the discrepancies between the outcomes is the fact that some studies measured total ghrelin <xref rid="pone.0098874-Riepl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> while others measured the acylated ghrelin <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> known to be essential for ghrelin appetite-stimulating effects <xref rid="pone.0098874-Broglio1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. To date, the contribution of other potential anorexigenic hormonal modulators that can be altered by hypoxic exposures such as peptide YY (PYY) <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) <xref rid="pone.0098874-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, has received less attention. Hence, their role and contribution to altitude-related appetite reduction is currently unclear.</p><p>Similarly to hypoxia, acute or chronic exercise significantly modulates hormonal appetite regulation <xref rid="pone.0098874-Schubert1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. Acute exercise transiently suppresses appetite, while chronic exercise training typically results in an augmented appetite leading to a restoration of the exercise-induced energy imbalance <xref rid="pone.0098874-Stensel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Although the exact mechanisms of these exercise-induced acute appetite alterations are unclear, reductions in ghrelin and increases in PYY and GLP-1 have been proposed as the key underlying factors <xref rid="pone.0098874-Stensel1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Russel1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Long-term studies have also indicated that chronic exercise training can improve appetite control system sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0098874-Martins1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and augment fasting and postprandial satiety sensations <xref rid="pone.0098874-Guelfi1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. While combining hypoxia and exercise is mostly used by athletes aiming to improve performance <xref rid="pone.0098874-Debevec1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, it is gaining popularity as a novel modality for treatment of obesity with related comorbidities <xref rid="pone.0098874-Kayser1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wiesner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Netzer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. It has been suggested that hypoxia and exercise synergistically enhance metabolic health, since both individually up-regulate glucose, glycolysis and satiety related genes through hypoxia-inducible factor-1 stabilization <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wenger1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098874-Katayama1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Training under hypoxic condition has already been shown capable of improving metabolic status and glycemic control in healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0098874-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and clinical populations <xref rid="pone.0098874-Mackenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. However, the potential additive effects of exercise during prolonged hypoxic exposure on hormonal appetite regulation and metabolic risk factors have, to our knowledge, not yet been investigated. Only one study to date investigated the effects of rest and exercise in acute (7-hrs) hypoxia on specific appetite regulating markers, and noted that both hypoxia and exercise reduce hunger and ghrelin concentrations <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Given the potential application of hypoxia and exercise for improving metabolic health and fighting the escalating obesity pandemic, their combined effects on appetite regulation should be further elucidated. Moreover, the potential contribution of physical exertion to hormonal appetite modulations observed during prolonged high altitude sojourns is currently unresolved.</p><p>Accordingly, this study sought to determine the acute and prolonged effects of continuous normobaric hypoxic exposure and exercise training on hormonal appetite regulation and select metabolic risk factors. The participants underwent 10 days of normobaric hypoxic confinement, either with daily moderate-intensity exercise training, or without any exercise. It was hypothesized that the addition of exercise training to continuous hypoxia would result in further reduction of appetite, through a synergistic effect of hypoxia and exercise. We additionally hypothesized that performing exercise training during continuous hypoxia would further augment select indices of metabolic health.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The present study was approved by the National Committee for Medical Ethics at the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Slovenia and conformed to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki.

To account for the different energy expenditure requirements of the interventions, the values were subsequently multiplied by a physical activity level factor of 1.8 and 1.4 for the Exercise and Sedentary group, respectively. The targeted daily energy intakes were 3166&#x000b1;219 kcal for the Exercise and 2380&#x000b1;80 kcal for the Sedentary group. The menus were prepared using the web-based application Open Platform for Clinical Nutrition (OPKP (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.opkp.si">www.opkp.si</ext-link>), Jozef Stefan Institute, Ljubljana, Slovenia). The OPKP enables individual planning and monitoring of dietary intakes based on food tables. Five meals (breakfast, morning snack, lunch, afternoon snack and dinner) were served per day, with portion size adjusted according to the OPKP calculations to achieve the required energy intake for each individual. All meals were prepared in the facility kitchen by the staff of the Olympic Sport Centre. To provide each individual with the exact targeted intakes all food items were weighed on a precision (&#x000b1;0.1 g) scale (TPT 6C, Libela ELSI, Celje, Slovenia) prior to each meal. In case of any leftovers, the unconsumed food items were re-weighed and the outcome deducted from the initial weight to provide the actual food intake.

Briefly, all participants performed an incremental test to task failure on an electronically braked cycle-ergometer (Ergo Bike Premium, Daum electronics, F&#x000fc;rth, Germany) prior to the start of the confinement, to assess their baseline aerobic capacity. After an initial 2-min warm up at 60 W, the workload was increased by 25 W&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> until task failure (cycling cadence below 60 rpm). A calibrated metabolic cart (Quark CPET, Cosmed, Rome, Italy) was used for breath-by-breath gas exchange measurement.

The MTT was performed in a quiet, thermally comfortable laboratory (temperature &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22.6&#x000b1;0.9&#x000b0;C; relative humidity &#x0200a;=&#x0200a;48.3&#x000b1;6.8%), with participants in a semi-supine position. The first MTT was performed in the morning of the Day -1 (Pre) and the second commenced following exactly 240-hrs of confinement on the morning of Day +1, prior to exiting hypoxic environment (Post). The participants refrained from exhaustive exercise, and from alcohol and coffee consumption and were placed on a standardized, prescribed diet for two days prior to the first MTT. The last meal before both tests was a standardized dinner served exactly 12-hrs before the start of the MTT. The MTT comprised fasting sample collection, standardized meal ingestion at time 0, and subsequent postprandial sample collection for two hrs. Breath samples for determination of <sup>13</sup>C isotope in expired CO<sub>2</sub>, used as an indicator of the glucose uptake and the rate of gastric emptying, were obtained at 15-min intervals throughout the MTT. Perceived appetite ratings were obtained at 30-min intervals during the MTT. A standardized liquid meal (Ensure Plus vanilla flavor, Abbott nutrition laboratories Ltd., Maidenhead, U.K.) with an energy value of 1.5 kcal&#x000b7;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> was used. Both, the meal volume (5 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and the amount of diluted <sup>13</sup>C isotope-labeled glucose (9.2 mg&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) were calculated according to each individual's body weight on the day of the MTT. The average volume and energy content of the liquid meal were 366.8&#x000b1;40.5 mL and 550&#x000b1;61 kcal, respectively. The average liquid meal comprised 73.9&#x000b1;8.1 g of carbohydrate, 22.8&#x000b1;2.5 g of protein and 18.0&#x000b1;1.9 g of fat. The participants were requested to consume the liquid meal in its entirety.</p></sec><sec id="s2d7"><title>Blood sampling</title><p>Arterialized venous blood samples were obtained from a 20-gauge cannula (Venflon, Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy, Helsingborg, Sweden) inserted retrograde into a vein on the dorsum of the wrist or the forearm. A 7-cm extension catheter (Connecta, Becton Dickinson Infusion Therapy, Helsingborg, Sweden) was attached to allow blood to be sampled away from the hand. The catheterized arm was placed in a hot box (Handwarmer, MEU University of Nottingham, Nottingham, U.K.) at least 15 minutes before the first blood sampling to provide a constantly high hand temperature throughout the MTT (air temperature within the heated box &#x0223c;55&#x000b0;C). The cannula was flushed with saline solution (0.9% Sodium Chloride, Baxter Healthcare, Norfolk U.K.) after each sampling. To account for the cannula dead space and saline blood dilution, two mL of blood was drawn and discarded before each sampling. The first two fasting samples (8 mL) were obtained before the ingestion of the meal (&#x02212;15 &#x00026; &#x02212;5 min) with additional samples (6 mL) collected at 15-min intervals throughout the MTT (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 &#x00026; 120 min). The plasma concentration of total ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, insulin and plasma glucose were determined at all sampling points, while the concentrations of serum leptin, adiponectin, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, plasma free-fatty acids (FFA), triacylglycerols (TAG), and catecholamines (adrenaline &#x00026; noradrenaline) were only determined from the two fasting samples. A 0.5 mL blood sample was also obtained every 10 min to monitor the plasma glucose concentration throughout the MTT. To determine any acute changes in the measured markers an additional fasting venous blood sample (6 mL) was obtained following the first 24-hrs of confinement (morning of Day 2), by venepuncture from the antecubital vein.</p><p>The sampled blood for determination of total ghrelin and PYY was collected into a precooled EDTA tube (Vacutainer K2E, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, U.K.) containing 50 &#x000b5;l of Trasylol, whereas a pre-cooled EDTA tube containing 50 &#x000b5;l of Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 was used for GLP-1 determination. For fasting TAG and catecholamine assessment, the blood was collected into a continuously ice-cooled Lithium Heparin tube (Vacutainer LH, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, U.K.) containing 50 &#x000b5;l of ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA) and 10 &#x000b5;l of the lipase inhibitor, tetrahydrolipostatin. 50 &#x000b5;l of EGTA was added to a precooled Lithium Heparin tube (Vacutainer LH, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, U.K.) used to collect the fasting sample for FFA determination. These samples were immediately centrifuged (3500 rpm; 10-min @ 4&#x000b0;C) using a laboratory centrifuge (Centric 200R, Tehtnica &#x0017d;elezniki, &#x0017d;elezniki, Slovenia). The remaining sample was collected into a separate tube (Vacutainer SST II Advance tube, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, U.K.) for serum insulin, leptin, adiponectin and cholesterol determination, and centrifuged, as detailed above, after standing at room temperature for 15 minutes to allow clotting to occur. Blood samples for glucose concentration determination were collected in a safe-seal fluoride oxalate tube (Microtube FH, Sarstedt, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Deutschland) and immediately centrifuged (13500 rpm; 1-min @ &#x0223c;22&#x000b0;C) in a micro centrifuge (Mini, Labogene, Lynge, Denmark). The plasma was transferred into a microtube (Microtube Cap, Sarstedt, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Deutschland) and frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C immediately after the MTT for subsequent analysis performed less than 6 months after the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d8"><title>Biochemistry</title><p>The analysis of all plasma and serum samples was performed in duplicate using the methods outlined below. Appropriate radioimmunoassays (EMD Millipore, Billerica, U.S.) were used to determine the concentration of total ghrelin, PYY, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin. GLP-1 concentration was determined using sandwich ELISA (EMD Millipore, Billerica, U.S.), comprising amide acid GLP-1 7-36 and 7-37. The glucose concentration was assessed using the glucose oxidase enzymatic method (YSI Inc., Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA).</p><p>The concentration of FFA, TAG, HDL-C, LDL-C and total cholesterol was determined using spectrophotometry (ABX Pentra 400, Horiba Medical, Montpellier, France). Adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations were determined by extraction of both from the plasma (HPLC &#x02013; ECD; Glutathione preservative E4378, Sigma-Aldrich Company Ltd., Dosert, U.K.), followed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection <xref rid="pone.0098874-Forster1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.

The inter-assay CV for total ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, insulin, plasma glucose, adiponectin, adrenaline and noradrenaline (analyzed in multiple runs) were 9.1%, 6.7%, 4.9%, 7.4%, 2.3%, 8.6%, 11.8% and 17.2%, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2d9"><title>Isotope <sup>13</sup>C tracer protocol</title><p>Ubiquitously labeled <sup>13</sup>C glucose, tested for pyrogenicity and sterility (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, U.S.) was dissolved in the individual's liquid meal immediately prior to the MTT. The breath sampling protocol is based on the principle that the ingested substrate is absorbed, metabolized, and a measurable metabolite subsequently expelled through the respiratory system. The rate of appearance of <sup>13</sup>C isotope in exhaled breath CO<sub>2</sub> is a product of the rate of gastric emptying, absorption from the gut, uptake by metabolizing tissues and oxidation of the liquid meal. Exhaled breath samples were collected into a 500 mL breath-sampling bag using a one-way valve, before the meal ingestion (&#x02212;15 &#x00026; &#x02212;5 min) and at 15-min intervals postprandially (15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105 &#x00026; 120 min). At each sampling point, duplicate 12-mL breath vials (Exetainer, Labco Limited, Lampeter, U.K.) were filled from the breath-sampling bag using a catheter (Vacutainer adapter, Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, U.K.). All <sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> samples were analyzed in triplicate using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry (VG Isochrom, VG Analytical, Manchester, U.K.) less than six months after the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2d10"><title>Perceived appetite ratings</title><p>Visual analogue scores (VAS) were obtained before and during the MTT using a custom-designed application on an iPad tablet (Apple, Cupertino, USA) to assess perception of hunger, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective food consumption (PFC) <xref rid="pone.0098874-Stubbs1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The VAS scale was a 100 mm digital line, anchored to the left with &#x02018;sensation not felt at all&#x02019; and to the right with &#x02018;sensation felt the greatest&#x02019;.

The participants were instructed to place a vertical line according to their perceived feeling at that particular point in time for all included questions. VAS were filled by the participants 5 min before the liquid meal ingestion and 30 min, 60 min, 90 min and 120 min thereafter. The Composite Satiety Score (CSS) was subsequently calculated from the obtained scores using the following formula (higher the score, higher the level of subjective satiety): CSS &#x0200a;=&#x0200a; (Fullness + (100 &#x02212; Desire) + (100 &#x02212; Hunger) + (100 &#x02013; PFC))/4. CSS scores were also obtained throughout the confinement period before and after breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p></sec><sec id="s2d11"><title>Statistical analysis and calculations</title><p>All data were coded and analyzed using Statistica 12.0 for Windows (StatSoft, Tulsa, USA). Prior to analysis the data were tested for normality of distribution using a modified Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Student's independent-samples t-test was used to compare participants' baseline characteristics and average daily energy and macronutrient intakes between groups. Area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for total ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1, insulin, plasma glucose and CSS changes during the MTT, using the conventional trapezoid rule. Due to blood clotting and resulting inability to obtain the last two blood samples during one of the Post MTT tests the AUC values were calculated over 90-min for total ghrelin, PYY, GLP-1 and insulin and over 100-min for glucose. The Pre data obtained at 105 and 120-min from this individual were omitted from the analysis. A 1-way repeated measures unbalanced ANOVA analysis was used to define the effect of the 10-day confinement on BP, HR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, LLS [group (Exercise &#x00026; Sedentary) &#x000d7; Time (Day1&#x02013;Day10)] and fasting metabolic markers (leptin, adiponectin, FFA, TAG, cholesterol and catecholamines), calculated AUC values and body-composition changes [group (Exercise &#x00026; Sedentary) &#x000d7; testing period (Pre &#x00026; Post)].

Similarly, based on the <sup>13</sup>C tracer results, the passage of glucose from ingestion to breakdown and CO<sub>2</sub> excretion was also unaffected. The potentially beneficial effects of adding exercise to hypoxia observed in this study were the reduction in postprandial glucose response, a significant decrease in fasting total cholesterol, secondary to LDL-C reduction and a reduction of whole body fat mass.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Hypoxia and hormonal appetite regulation</title><p>Ghrelin is the only known appetite stimulating gut peptide, and it has been suggested to play a role in the altitude-related appetite modulation.

Interestingly, the fasting ghrelin levels in our study were unchanged both upon acute exposure (24-hrs), and after the 10-day exposure to a simulated altitude of 4000 m. Furthermore, postprandial ghrelin kinetics and the ghrelin AUC were also unaffected by hypoxic confinement <italic>per se</italic>. As the degree of hypoxia (&#x0223c;3500&#x02013;4200 m altitude) and AMS responses were similar in the present and aforementioned studies <xref rid="pone.0098874-Riepl1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, factors underlying the different outcomes are not obvious. These might include the diet and mode of hypoxia (i.e normobaric vs. hypobaric). It has to be noted however, that the lack of change in ghrelin concentration was also previously observed following chronic high-altitude altitude exposure <xref rid="pone.0098874-Benso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>The measured anorexigenic modulators leptin, GLP-1 and PYY were also unaffected by prolonged hypoxic exposure in our study. This seems contrary to the majority of other studies indicating that the levels of the satiety-inducing adipokine leptin increase as a result of acute hypoxic exposure <xref rid="pone.0098874-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Tschop2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. However, the response of leptin to hypoxia has been widely debated and collective results from the reported studies are equivocal. Leptin has also been related to GLP-1 production in a rodent model, and subsequently a leptin appetite suppression through a GLP-1 mediated pathway was proposed <xref rid="pone.0098874-Anini1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. To date only one study examined the response of GLP-1 to acute hypoxia and showed a tendency for increased GLP-1 postprandially with no changes in the fasting state <xref rid="pone.0098874-Snyder1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The dependent relation between leptin and GLP-1 could therefore play a role in the lack of appetite regulation changes observed in this study. Similarly to GLP-1, only one study to date examined the effects of hypoxic exposure on PYY concentration and observed a tendency for lower PYY values in response to acute hypoxia than to normoxia <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Thus, implying that PYY might not be involved in hypoxia-induced appetite modulation. Our data also lend support to this notion as no significant changes in PYY after acute or prolonged hypoxic exposure were observed. The lack of changes in the measured hormonal appetite regulation markers following hypoxic confinement without concomitant exercise is also corroborated by the unchanged fasting and postprandial ratings of perceived appetite throughout the 10-day confinement. Collectively, the responses of the Sedentary group participants indicate that acute or prolonged exposure to simulated altitude of 4000 m does not seem to alter fasting and postprandial (2-hrs) concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, GLP-1 and PYY plasma.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Hypoxia, exercise and hormonal appetite regulation</title><p>While many studies investigating concomitant hypoxia and exercise aimed to determine the potential beneficial effects on performance in athletes <xref rid="pone.0098874-Debevec1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, very few scrutinized the combined effects on appetite regulation and metabolic health <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Moreover, no long-term study to date attempted to discern the separate effects of exercise, often associated with high altitude sojourns, and prolonged hypoxia on hormonal appetite regulation.</p><p>The hypothesis that combination of hypoxia and exercise might down-regulate appetite through modulation of orexigenic and anorexigenic hormones was recently tested in healthy sedentary men <xref rid="pone.0098874-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The participants in this study performed 12 training sessions over a four-week period (3 training sessions per week) under either hypoxia (&#x0223c;4000 m) or normoxia. Similarly to the current study they did not find any changes in fasting ghrelin, leptin and GLP-1 following hypoxic training although postprandial levels of leptin were increased in both the hypoxic and normoxic group. Interestingly, GLP-1 levels were only increased after the normoxic training. This is in line with previous studies demonstrating elevated GLP-1 levels following exercise training in normoxia <xref rid="pone.0098874-Martins2" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, and suggests that GLP-1 might not play a role in combined exercise and hypoxia related appetite reduction. Wasse et al. <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> recently investigated ghrelin and PYY responses to acute hypoxic exposure, in combination with exercise and showed that there is a significant effect of both hypoxia and exercise on postprandial acylated ghrelin concentration. This was not confirmed in our study where total ghrelin was unchanged after the first 24-hrs of hypoxia as well as following 10 days of chronic hypoxia combined with exercise. This is in line with previous reports showing that ghrelin concentration can return to baseline upon prolonged exposure to hypoxia <xref rid="pone.0098874-Shukla1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Benso1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. However, it has to be noted that we also did not observe any acute changes in total ghrelin levels. No changes in PYY concentration after combined hypoxia and exercise were observed in this study, which support the notion that PYY might not play a role in hypoxia induced hormonal appetite regulation <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wasse1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. This notion is further reinforced by reports suggesting that the addition of hypoxia to exercise might even suppress PYY compared to identical exercise performed in normoxic conditions <xref rid="pone.0098874-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.</p><p>No change in the perceived appetite ratings was also noted in the Exercise group during or after the 10-day confinement in spite of the fact that the actual intakes were lower then targeted. Both observations together could be suggestive of a reduced motivation to eat during combined hypoxia and exercise training. Collectively, this corroborates the unchanged hormonal appetite measures and also, importantly, indicates that the physical activity factors used for dietary intake calculations (1.4 Sedentary; 1.8 Exercise) were appropriate for both conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Hypoxia, exercise and metabolic risk factors</title><p>Training in hypoxia has been shown to be superior to normoxic training for reducing fasting and postprandial insulin levels, insulin resistance <xref rid="pone.0098874-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and improving glucose tolerance <xref rid="pone.0098874-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Based on these reports, and the fact that both hypoxia and exercise exert strong effects on the metabolic system, we reasoned that the addition of exercise to continuous hypoxic exposure would result in enhanced insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles. Especially, since hypoxia and exercise have been shown to up-regulate hypoxia-inducible factor 1&#x003b1; target genes <xref rid="pone.0098874-Semenza1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> involved in glucose, oxygen uptake and lipid metabolism through increases in peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &#x003b3; co-activator-1&#x003b1; <xref rid="pone.0098874-Zoll1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. However contrary to our hypothesis we did not observe any changes to measured metabolic variables as a result of exercise during prolonged hypoxia. Indeed the glycemic responses to feeding were similar in both groups, with significantly reduced insulin AUC at Post compared to Pre and no significant changes in glucose AUC in both groups. This finding supports the notion that hypoxia <italic>per se</italic> beneficially affects insulin postprandial kinetics <xref rid="pone.0098874-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. While the glucose AUC was unchanged following the confinement in the Sendentary group, a tendency for a decreased glucose AUC was observed in the Exercise group. This observation could be explained by the increased glucose turnover previously documented following prolonged acclimatization to high altitudes <xref rid="pone.0098874-Brooks1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Taken together, the glucose AUC and significant postprandial glucose concentration reductions, suggest that performing exercise training during hypoxic confinement might also results in improved postprandial insulin sensitivity although this was not observed in the present study. This hypothesis is in line with recent studies showing that the use of hypoxia during exercise training additively improves insulin sensitivity in sedentary individuals <xref rid="pone.0098874-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> and glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0098874-Mackenzie1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.</p><p>It has to be noted however that the postprandial insulin levels were only significantly reduced following the confinement in the Sedentary group. No significant changes in postprandial insulin kinetics were observed in the Exercise group in spite of the fact that glucose was reduced. Furthermore, the postprandial values of both glucose and insulin were, albeit not significantly, lower at Post compared to Pre following the confinement in both groups. The fact that these reductions were predominantly not significant could be explained by the relatively small sample size, potentially limiting the statistical significance of the outcomes.</p><p>Although beneficial effects of combining hypoxia and exercise training on TAG have been reported previously <xref rid="pone.0098874-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we did not observe any additional effect of exercise during continuous hypoxia. Interestingly, we noted a significant increase in TAG in the Sedentary group after the first 24-hrs of confinement. Moreover, we did not observe any significant changes in FFA concentration during and after the confinement in either group although FFA reductions were previously reported following exercise performed at moderate altitudes due to their increased metabolic utilization during exercise and recovery <xref rid="pone.0098874-Katayama1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. The substrate metabolism responses could also be altered by the exercise-induced changes in catecholamine levels. Indeed, hypoxic training has been shown to potentiate the exercise-induced sympathetic activation <xref rid="pone.0098874-Seals1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. This is in line with our findings indicating a significant increase in noradrenaline after the first 24-hrs of hypoxia in the Exercise group only.</p><p>Another potentially beneficial metabolic response of exercise in the present study, besides a tendency for a reduced postprandial glucose profile was a significant reduction in LDL-C and a concomitant total cholesterol reduction. Athough this has previously been reported to occur following hypoxic training <xref rid="pone.0098874-Bailey2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, other studies did not find any changes in either total cholesterol or LDL-C following combined hypoxia and exercise <xref rid="pone.0098874-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to select appetite and metabolic risk measures, the <sup>13</sup>C glucose tracer protocol was implemented in this study to indirectly assess postprandial glucose uptake and related gastric emptying.

The hypoxic nature of our intervention is clearly demonstrated by significant reductions in SpO<sub>2</sub> throughout the confinement period. While the SpO<sub>2</sub> values gradually increased during the ten-day confinement, as a result of the well-established hypoxic ventilatory acclimatization, the average values did not exceed 89% at any time.</p><p>The main strengths of the present study are standardized diet (i.e. macronutrient diet composition) as well as general living conditions (i.e. sleep, activity, environmental conditions) throughout the 10-day confinement period. Other studies investigating prolonged effects of training in hypoxia did not precisely control both the dietary composition and intake levels and that might have significantly affected the metabolic measures <xref rid="pone.0098874-Wiesner1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Netzer1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Morishima1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098874-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It has to be noted that although the dietary intakes were matched between groups in terms of macronutrient intake percentages the intakes were significantly lower in the Sedentary than in the Exercise group. Moreover, the fact that the participants in the Exercise group did not attain the targeted intakes resulted in a negative energy balance, also documented by the reductions in whole body fat mass. We can only speculate whether the reductions in fat mass observed in the Exercise group were a result of hypoxia and exercise or a consequence of insufficient energy intakes. The observed reductions in whole body fat mass are in line with the study by Haufe et al. <xref rid="pone.0098874-Haufe1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> reporting similar reductions following a four-week hypoxic exercise training intervention. Nevertheless, the observed energy deficit and body composition changes might have influenced our metabolic outcomes since a negative energy balance resulting from reduced dietary intake has previously been shown to influence hormonal appetite regulation in healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0098874-King1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. An increase in basal metabolic rate as a result of exposure to hypoxia is also a factor that might have contributed to the negative energy balance and body mass reductions observed in both groups. While we did not perform the metabolic rate measurements, previous reports suggest that energy intake requirements at high altitudes may be higher as a consequence of increased basal metabolic rate <xref rid="pone.0098874-Hamad1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>While the results of this study extend our understanding of hormonal appetite regulation during combined exercise and hypoxia a few limitations of this study need to be addressed. First, the present study investigated the effects of normobaric rather than hypobaric hypoxia. Even though there are no known effects of pressure <italic>per se</italic> on hormonal appetite regulation, recent reports suggest that, for certain physiological functions, normobaric and hypobaric hypoxia do in fact induce somewhat different responses <xref rid="pone.0098874-Faiss1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Second, due to the relatively small sample size the results should be interpreted with caution and it is warranted that the hypothesis of a synergistic effect of hypoxia and exercise is tested using higher number of participants. Third, to determine the potential orexigenic effects of combined hypoxia and exercise we measured resting and postprandial responses of total ghrelin rather than its acylated (active) form, suggested to mainly underlie the appetite inducing effects of ghrelin <xref rid="pone.0098874-Broglio1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Finally, the dose of both, hypoxia and exercise should be taken into account when interpreting the findings of the present study. Based on previous reports indicating profound reductions in appetite as a result of exposures to extreme altitudes (&#x0003e;5000 m) <xref rid="pone.0098874-WesterterpPlantenga1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, more severe hypoxia would probably exert larger effects on the measured appetite markers than those observed in the present study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>While some minor metabolic benefits of exercise training during normobaric hypoxic confinement were noted (i.e. decreased postprandial glucose response and reduced cholesterol levels), the findings of this study do not support the hypothesis that adding exercise training to hypoxic exposure significantly alters appetite regulation or improves metabolic outcomes. In addition, our findings indirectly indicate that glucose uptake and gut permeability are unaltered following prolonged hypoxia with or without exercise. Based on the current inconsistencies in the literature and given the escalating prevalence of obesity and metabolic dysfunctions, future well-controlled and powered dose-response trials are warranted to ultimately determine the potential of combining hypoxia and exercise for reducing appetite and improving cardio-metabolic risk factors in both clinical populations and healthy humans.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the devoted participants who made this study possible.
