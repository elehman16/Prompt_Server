In addition, the reductions were consistent across different classes of prior antihypertensive monotherapy and dual combinations. The results observed were not dissimilar to those reported in previously conducted randomized clinical trials, such as the 16-week EX-FAST study where the Aml/Val combination delivered meaningful BP reductions in patients uncontrolled on antihypertensive monotherapy, including beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and diuretics.<xref rid="b26-vhrm-11-071" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Our findings of BP reductions with an Aml/Val SPC in patients previously treated with monotherapy are also similar to those reported in another large observational study in a real-life setting and conducted in Chinese patients.<xref rid="b32-vhrm-11-071" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Similarly, the incremental reductions observed with the triple SPC in patients previously receiving dual combinations are meaningful and reinforce the clinical utility of having a triple combination therapy in the armamentarium of a treating physician, particularly in view of the observation that up to one third of hypertensive patients are likely to require more than two agents to achieve BP control.<xref rid="b33-vhrm-11-071" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>This analysis of the EXCITE study further supports the efficacy of Aml/Val and Aml/Val/HCT SPCs in high-risk patients and in patients not adequately benefiting from prior monotherapy or dual therapy. The limitations of this analysis include the absence of a separate safety assessment for each subgroup and the post hoc nature of analysis for the prior anti-hypertensive monotherapy and dual therapy groups. However, the observational nature of the study has enabled collection of real-world data from a more naturalistic clinical setting and from a large number of patients. Notably, useful data have been collected for a number of countries in the Middle East and Asia, where research on antihypertensive treatment has been limited. The large number of patients included also serves to increase the validity of the data, as indicated by the narrow confidence intervals for the main study outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the large multiethnic EXCITE study, conducted in a real-world setting, Aml/Val and Aml/Val/HCT SPCs were effective in high-risk patients with hypertension, including the elderly, and patients with obesity, diabetes, or ISH.
