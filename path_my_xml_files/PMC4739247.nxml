diets, physical inactivity and high alcohol consumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Aim</title><p>To investigate in patients undergoing Roux-Y-of gastroplasty weight regain,
nutritional deficiencies, candidates for the treatment with endoscopic argon
plasma, the diameter of the gastrojejunostomy and the size of the gastric pouch at
the time of treatment with plasma.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A prospective 59 patients non-randomized study with no control group undergoing
gastroplasty with recurrence of weight and candidates for the endoscopic procedure
of argon plasma was realized. The surgical evaluation consisted of investigation
of complications in the digestive system and verification of the increased
diameter of the gastrojejunostomy. Nutritional evaluation was based on body mass
index at the time of operation, in the minimum BMI achieved after and in which BMI
was when making the procedure with plasma. The laboratory tests included
hemoglobin, erythrocyte volume, ferritin, vitamin D, B12, iron, calcium, zinc and

decreases the absorption of macro- and micronutrients. It is known that this mechanical
process, accompanied by changes in lifestyle - including regular physical activity and
appropriate psychological treatment for the various nuances of compulsive eating - can
be strong allies in the weight loss process.</p><p>However, bariatric surgery patients, after satisfactory weight loss, may regain weight
if they go back to bad eating habits and sedentary lifestyle <sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>. Other causes may be equally important
factors for regaining weight, for example, excessive consumption of alcohol, craving for
sweets or fattening foods in general, increase in the diameter of the gastrojejunal
anastomosis and the length of the gastric pouch.</p><p>Weight regain may occur after satisfactory loss of excess weight or even before that if
treatment in itself does not have its desired effect, resulting in insufficient weight
loss. This process is perceived, but many patients do not seek necessary help from the
attending staff for many reasons, among them the feeling of failure at the chance for
effective weight loss so expected with the operation, which then becomes a
nightmare.</p><p>Weight gain, in turn, can still result in nutritional consequences due to poor
intestinal absorption caused by the majority of surgical techniques in the treatment of
obesity. Although weight regain may represent a return to full energy utilization, many
essential nutrients are still lost, which may result in severe iron-deficiency anemia,
megaloblastic anemia, vitamin D deficiency and chronic malnutrition. This situation
results in an obese individual with various nutritional complications that need to be
addressed before considering weight loss per se.</p><p>The objective of this study was to investigate in patients who underwent Roux-en-Y
gastric bypass (RYGB) the following aspects: weight regain, nutritional deficiencies,
candidates for endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC), and the diameter of the
gastrojejunal anastomosis at the time of APC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHOD</title><p>A non-randomized prospective study with no control group was conducted with 59 patients
who underwent RYGB, had weight regain and were candidates for APC in the Hospital Vita
Batel, Curitiba, Brazil in 2013. The study was approved by the Hospital Ethics
Committee. The patients were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team; they were invited to
participate and signed an informed consent form.</p><p>The surgeon's evaluation consisted of an investigation of the complications in the
digestive system and determination of an increase in diameter of the anastomosis.
Nutritional assessment was based on body mass index (BMI) that the patient had at the
time of gastric bypass, the lowest BMI the patient achieved after the operation and BMI
at the time of APC. The laboratory tests included hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume,
ferritin, vitamin D, vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, iron, calcium, zinc and serum albumin.</p><p>The results were analyzed using the mean values. Data were tabulated in a spreadsheet
(Microsoft Excel, version 2007).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Of the 59 selected patients, eight were men and 51 women. Were included only 49 patients
(five men and 44 women) who had complete data. Exclusion was due to the lack of some
laboratory tests. On APC, 19 patients (38.7%) had a gastric band, while 30 (61.2%) did
not.</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p>Description of the patients included in the study (n=49)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr style="background-color:#c18372"><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Parameter</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean&#x000a0; &#x000b1; Standard deviation</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maximum</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1">Minimum</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47 &#x000b1; 21</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">68</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcb9ac"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hemoglobin (g/dl)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.3 &#x000b1; 3.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hematocrit (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.2 &#x000b1; 7.8</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">31.4</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcb9ac"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ferritin (ng/ml)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112.4 &#x000b1; 110.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">222.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.9</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> (pg/ml)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">806 &#x000b1; 694</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1500</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">112</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcb9ac"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Iron (mg/l)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">99.7 &#x000b1; 77./7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">177.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vitamin D<sub>3</sub></td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.2 &#x000b1; 14.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.3</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcb9ac"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Calcium</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.2 &#x000b1; 1.2</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Albumin</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.2 &#x000b1; 0.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.7</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.7</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcb9ac"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glucose (mg/dl)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">132.3 &#x000b1; 51.6</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">183.9</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">80.7</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Zinc</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">92.7 &#x000b1; 55.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">148</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.4</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcb9ac"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI before surgery (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.2 &#x000b1; 14.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.1</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI lowest after surgery kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29 &#x000b1; 11.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.5</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#dcb9ac"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI at time of APC (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.3 &#x000b1; 14.1</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.2</td></tr><tr style="background-color:#f0e0d9"><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anastomosis (mm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.5 &#x000b1; 12.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Iron-deficiency anemia was common in this population, and 30 patients (61.2%) had a

Blood glucose was above 99 mg/dl in three patients (6.12%). BMI before surgery varied
between high with severe obesity (BMI 35.1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and very high with morbid

weight regain at the time of APC, BMI ranged from normal (BMI 25.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) to
high again with obesity (BMI 53.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The anastomosis varied in the
subjects included in the study. The mean diameter was 27 mm, with the lowest value being
15 mm and the highest 40 mm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>According to Blomain et al.<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> and
Bordallo et al.<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>, obesity is a global
pandemic and is associated with comorbidities. With RYGB, many diseases are again under
control, such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis. But because of
compensatory mechanisms and failure to make lifestyle changes, many patients regain
weight and begin to have the same comorbidities as before, now along with serious
nutritional deficiencies.</p><p>In this study, 100% quit follow-up with the attending staff. Many did not repeat
examinations for years. They regained excess weight and then believed they were healthy,
even though overweight.</p><p>Bariatric surgery resulted in satisfactory weight loss in most cases. The study group
showed a significantly lower BMI after the operation. However, over time, the patients
relapsed. Many explanations were given, such as return to poor eating habits,
significant increase in alcohol consumption and physical inactivity.</p><p>Over time, there was a significant reduction in BMI and with it the individual's
expectation that the disease of obesity would be cured. In one case, the individual's
BMI decreased from 63.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>to 40.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which already showed
quite effective weight loss.</p><p>The cure of comorbidities was also experienced by those who lost weight, but after
relapse, many again had abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism. In the study
group, three patients again had changes in blood glucose and were at risk for diabetes
after regaining excess weight.</p><p>After the "honeymoon" of bariatric surgery, the first signs that something was wrong
were the numbers on the scale rising rapidly, and why would this be happening? It was
probably because of going back to poor eating habits, facilitating the increase in the
size of the anastomosis, which greatly facilitates the entry of more extra calories. At
this time, there was the possibility of APC, which would be a quick, effective,
noninvasive solution that could be another attempt at weight control.</p><p>According to Marchesini et al.<sup><xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>, APC
is performed by endoscopy, where the endoscopist surgeon uses argon gas to cause a
"burn" in the region of the enlarged anastomosis to promote healing to decrease the size
of the anastomosis, minimizing the gastric emptying rate. This process aims to increase
the patient's satiety and facilitate weight loss. This should be done only in people who
have had bariatric surgery.</p><p>In this study population who experienced weight regain, BMI at the time of APC ranged
from normal (BMI 25.2 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) to very high again with obesity (BMI 53.4
kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The study by Correia Horvath et al.<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>, who recruited 77 operated patients, found deficiency of
potassium in 19% of respondents, of calcium in 26% and of iron in 66.2%. Even with
weight regain, patients still had nutritional deficiencies. The general condition of
most of them always involved some deficiency, severe anemia and vitamin D<sub>3</sub>
insufficiency. In the present study. there was iron deficiency in 61.2%. The occurrence
of anemia, both iron-deficiency and megaloblastic, was quite common after RYGB, in which
there is substantial loss in absorption sites for these nutrients. Decreases in
intrinsic factor and ileum for absorption of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are also determining
factors. Women of reproductive age may have substantial changes in their menstrual cycle
and exacerbated flow and more days of bleeding, which greatly hamper the use of iron. In
parallel with the lack of nutritional supplements taken by mouth or intravenously,
anemia becomes serious and debilitating.</p><p>Another common nutritional deficiency, also found in individuals not operated, is
vitamin D<sub>3</sub>. In the subjects studied were, 100% had a nutritional deficiency.
There was a lack of regular sun exposure and diet records included few sources of
vitamin D<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Bariatric surgery reduces excess weight, but relapse can be observed after a period of
five years, especially with the return to the previous dietary pattern as described by
Bastos et al.<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Foods with high satiety, such as those high in protein and fiber and with low caloric
density (fruits and vegetables), may not be well tolerated after the operation,
particularly due to the lack of proper chewing and of concomitant fluid intake. Johnson
Stoklossa and Atwal<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> referred to
apples as an example, where one has only 78 kcal and needs to be well chewed to be of
value, versus 118 kcal for apple juice, which does not require any effort to be
digested.</p><p>The wrong nutritional selection regarding soft foods can cause weight gain. Eating less
fruits causes a decrease in fiber intake and, consequently, vitamins and minerals.</p><p>This study did not determine the nutritional value of daily caloric intake, but was
noticed a sharp change in food consistency to soft foods high in calories, use of
chocolate and soft sweets in general, as well as inclusion of alcoholic beverages in
large amounts and daily, which greatly surpassed the recommended daily caloric
intake.</p><p>Adaptive thermogenesis is decreased after weight loss. There is decreased resting energy
expenditure and there may be changes in fat and muscle mass.</p><p>Meguid et al.<sup><xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>reported that weight
regain occurs in 20% of patients two to three years after RYGB and that it is a serious
complication. It leads to consequences that are attributed to a diminished peptide YY
concentration, indicating that the combination of RYGB and pharmacological stimulation
with peptide YY can promote weight loss.</p><p>Stewart et al.<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>, in an inspiring
paper called "Back on track", proposed that bariatric patients who regained weight after
the operation need to resume care under the multidisciplinary team. Simple and effective
measures are mentioned, such as proper chewing, better food choices, back to regular
physical activity and treatment of compulsions.</p><p>Nutritional counseling was offered to all patients who underwent APC to treat weight
regain and were included in this study. They were encouraged to return to careful eating
and regular physical exercise, as well as to use more willpower. All had a psychological
evaluation.</p><p>Chapman et al.<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> described lifestyle as
being responsible for the recurrence of weight gain, including watching television,
drinking alcohol, sleep deprivation, which are not correlated with obesity but favor
high caloric intake. These habits are known to affect cognitive function, involving
inhibitory control and it is a common mechanism facilitating overeating. In this study,
protein or caloric intake was not evaluated.</p><p>It is important to realize that all patients in the study, at some point after weight
loss, abandoned follow-up with the multidisciplinary team. This was a determining factor
for weight regain, especially when they saw that they had lost the excess weight and
thought that they could ignore the guidelines outlined by the staff before the
operation. Resuming office visits and seeking good advice from trained professionals
would be a good way of getting "back on track" to lose weight and maintain a healthy
weight.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>On APC for weight regain after gastric bypass, the conditions found were: anastomosis
