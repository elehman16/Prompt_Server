It has many potential advantages such as improved nursing care, reduced laryngeal ulceration, decrease in respiratory resistance, better tolerability, and improved communicability.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Tracheostomy tubes (TTs) are periodically changed according to institutional protocol and are almost always associated with tracheal stimulation causing coughing and pressor response leading to sympathoadrenal system stimulation and release of catecholamine. Although this response is transient, it may be detrimental in patients with traumatic brain injury where pressor response due to TT change may cause increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) and poor outcome. The rise in blood pressure (BP) and ICP is usually transient, variable, and unpredictable. To &#x0201c;blunt&#x0201d; this pressor response during tracheal intubation, various methods have been tried including adrenergic blockers, vasodilators, calcium channel blockers, and &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-agonists.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Literature on sedation or analgesia during TT change is scarce, and in many centers, TTs are changed without any sedation or analgesia. In our trauma, intensive care midazolam or opioid is commonly used but not very effective in controlling cough and pressor response. Hence, there is a need of a short-acting drug having property of sedation and analgesia which effectively control the cough and pressor response during TT change.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine (DEX), which is widely used in anesthesia and intensive care, possesses properties of sedation, anxiolysis, and analgesia without the development of respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] It reduces catecholamine's release at the neuroeffector junction, inhibits neurotransmission of sympathetic nerves, and decreases plasma catecholamine's, which results in a slight decrease in BP and lowering of the heart rate (HR).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] DEX has a relatively high ratio of &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>/&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub>-activity, the &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>:&#x003b1;<sub>1</sub> binding selectivity ratio 1620:1; therefore, DEX is a highly specific and selective &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic receptor agonist.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Previous studies that had used intravenous (IV) boluses of DEX showed decrease in BP and cardiac output after small boluses (0.25&#x02013;1 &#x003bc;g/kg), which were associated with decrease in serum norepinephrine concentration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Review of previous literature showed that DEX has been extensively used for attenuation of pressor response during laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, but literature on attenuation of pressor response during TT change is not available.</p><p>The purpose of the present study is to determine the effect of two different doses of DEX on the cough and hemodynamic responses to TT change and associated adverse events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After Institutional Ethical approval and written informed consent, sixty tracheostomized traumatic brain injury patients in trauma ICU, aged 18&#x02013;60 years, of either sex scheduled for TT change were included in this prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial from January 2015 to December 2016. Patients with a history of cervical spine injury, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, diabetes, hypertension (mean arterial pressure [MAP] &#x0003e;110 mmHg, systolic BP [SBP] &#x0003e;160 mmHg, or diastolic BP [DBP] &#x0003e;90 mmHg), hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;70 mmHg or SBP &#x0003c;90 mmHg or DBP &#x0003c;50 mmHg), and patient allergic to study drugs were excluded from the study.</p><p>All patients were randomly (computer-generated randomization and concealment via sealed opaque envelope technique) assigned to two equal groups: Group A to receive DEX 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg and Group B to receive DEX 1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg. After dilution in 50 ml normal saline, calculated dose of DEX was infused over 10 min (with infusion pump) before the scheduled procedure in both groups. Under aseptic and antiseptic precaution, TT was changed after IV administration of respective studied drug.</p><p>Hemodynamic variables were measured at T0-at the time of starting infusion, T1: 5 min after starting infusion, T2: after infusing the drug, T3: at the moment of TT change, and T4: 5 min after TT change and T5: 10 min after TT change. Grading of cough was noted as a measure of response to tracheal stimulation. Coughing after the change of tube was assessed using a 5-point scale: (1) No cough, easy breathing; (2) Slight coughing (one or two), easy breathing; (3) moderate coughing (three or four); (4) heavy coughing, breathing hard, and (5) laryngospasm, severe coughing, and hardly breathing.</p><p>The patient was monitored for any complications. Hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;70 mmHg) was treated with IV blouses of ephedrine. Bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;50 beats/min) was treated with 0.6 mg of IV atropine. Hypoxia was treated with supplementation oxygen or by increasing FiO2.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviations.

A similar but slightly less intense response can be seen at the time of TT change due to tracheal stimulation producing coughing and pressor response, and this can be detrimental in head injury patients due to increase in ICP.</p><p>It has been observed that DEX used in premedication suppresses the sympathetic activation due to the endotracheal intubation and at the time of the tracheal extubation.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Literature related to use of DEX during TT change is not available, so this study was planned in head injury patients where using DEX during TT change may be helpful. In different studies, different doses of DEX have been used, commonly from 0.5 to 1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Hence, we have conducted a prospective and comparative study of effect of two different doses (0.5 vs. 1 &#x003bc;g/kg) of DEX for attenuating the hemodynamic and cough response to TT change.</p><p>Our study demonstrated that DEX is effective in the prevention of undesirable hemodynamic and cough reflex during TT change. There is blunting of hemodynamic response in both the groups, more with 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dose but associated with increased incidence of adverse effects such as hypotension and bradycardia. Cough reflex is suppressed more effectively with 1 &#x003bc;g/kg as only 13.33% patient develop Grade 3 cough reflex while 46.7% develop with 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg. More incidences of adverse events were noted in Group B as indicated by more episodes of hypotension (16.6% vs. 3.33%), bradycardia (13.33% vs. 0), and hypoxia (3.33% vs. 0). Hence, DEX can be a good drug for future in the prevention of cough and pressor response during TT change in monitored care facility.</p><p>Our study has two main limitations. First is lack of control group, so we did not know the intensity and severity of cough and pressure response without drug. Second is only two doses (0.5 and 1.0 &#x003bc;g/kg) selection, but it may be possible the most appropriate dose may be in between two doses. Future trials are needed to investigate these aspects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSIONS</sc></title><p>Thus, we conclude from the present study that DEX is able to suppress hemodynamic response to tracheal stimulation at both doses (statistically significant), there was better suppression of cough response with higher doses, i.e., 1 &#x003bc;g/kg, but with this dose, higher episodes of adverse events were noted. Finally, we conclude that 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg loading dose provides significant attenuation of hemodynamic responses to TT change and fewer incidences of adverse events, which were observed at 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dose.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no
