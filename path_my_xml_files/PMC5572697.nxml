C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol is a novel cholesterol tagged LA HIV-fusion-inhibitor (FI). We assessed pre-clinical toxicology and first-in-human administration of C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol. Pre-clinical toxicology was conducted in 2 species. HIV-positive men were randomised to a single subcutaneous dose of C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol at incrementing doses or placebo. Detailed clinical (including injection site reaction (ISR) grading), plasma pharmacokinetic (time-to-minimum-effective-concentration (MEC, 25&#x02009;ng/mL) and pharmacodynamic (plasma HIV RNA) parameters were assessed. In both mice and dogs, no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) was observed at a 12&#x02009;mg/kg/dose after two weeks. Of 5 men enrolled, 3 received active drug (10&#x02009;mg, 10&#x02009;mg and 20&#x02009;mg). In 2 individuals grade 3 ISR occurred and the study was halted. Both ISR emerged within 12&#x02009;hours of active drug dosing. No systemic toxicities were observed. The time-to-MEC was &#x0003e;72 and &#x0003e;96&#x02009;hours after 10 and 20&#x02009;mg dose, respectively, and mean change in HIV RNA was &#x02212;0.9 log10 copies/mL. These human pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic data, although limited to 3 subjects, of C34-PEG-4-Chol suggest continuing evaluation of this agent as a LA-ARV. However, alternative administration routes must be explored.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Mounting evidence from both high and low income countries suggests a near normal life expectancy for people living with HIV (PLWH) who start antiretroviral therapy with CD4+ lymphocyte cell counts above 350&#x02009;cells/&#x000b5;L<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Consequent to the success of antiretroviral therapy and the longevity expected for PLWH, over recent decades there has been a gradual upward shift in the median age of PLWH. Antiretroviral therapy management becomes increasingly challenging in older individuals due to the presence of non-infectious co-morbidities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, which are reported to occur at a higher incidence in PLWH compared to matched control populations, the presence of poly-pharmacy and drug-drug interactions. As such, there is an urgent unmet need for new antiretroviral agents and combinations for older PLWH which includes drugs with a low propensity for drug-drug interactions and which lack end-organ toxicities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">The HIV-fusion inhibitors (FIs) are peptides derived from the heptad repeat (HR)&#x02212;2 region of the viral fusion protein gp41. Their mechanism of action is to prevent the formation of a critical intermediate along the virus-cell fusion pathway responsible for enacting cell-virus fusion. To date, only one FI, enfuvirtide has been approved for use<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Clinical use of enfuvirtide has been limited by the lack of oral bioavailability and short half-life, thus necessitating twice daily subcutaneous injections, and high rates of painful injection site reactions (ISRs). Notwithstanding, enfuvirtide and other investigational FIs display low systemic toxicity and a general lack of drug-drug interactions, making them promising for further investigation as antiretroviral agents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Modification of a number of FI compounds has prolonged their plasma half-lives in animal models and fueled a renewed interest in their development as potentially long-acting antiretroviral drugs suitable for use in older PLWH with comorbidities and receiving concomitant medications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">Extensive evidence supports that HIV viral entry occurs within cholesterol and sphingolipid enriched cell membrane domains known as &#x02018;lipid rafts&#x02019;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Notably, CD4+ receptors, the primary receptors on HIV target cells, lie within lipid rafts on the target membrane. In addition, gp41 associates with caveolin-1, the structural protein component of a subset of lipid rafts known as caveolae. C34 is a lead compound corresponding to amino acid residues 117&#x02013;150 of the HR-2 region of gp41. By conjugating to C34 a cholesterol group with a 4-unit polyethylene glycol (PEG<sub>4</sub>) spacer, the compound is concentrated in lipid rafts of cell membranes. Compared with underivatised C34, C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol shows dramatically increased antiviral potency on a panel of primary isolates, with 90% maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>90</sub>) values 15- to 300-fold lower than enfuvirtide. With an IC<sub>90</sub> between 15&#x02013;460 pM (0.08&#x02013;2.5&#x02009;ng/mL) depending on the viral strain, C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol is the most potent HIV fusion inhibitor to date<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Moreover, the cholesterol moiety drives binding to serum proteins, an effective way to improve peptide pharmacokinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> and accordingly, the circulatory half-life of C34 in rodents is extended by 10-fold when conjugated with cholesterol<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Allometric scaling from animal studies suggests that once-weekly subcutaneous administration in humans may be achievable with a dose range of 10&#x02013;80&#x02009;mg.</p><p id="Par5">We sought to establish the safety, pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic effects of C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol as a potential long acting FI in PLWH.

</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par27">We report on pre-clinical and the first clinical study of C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol. Systemically, the peptide was well tolerated with no alteration in safety parameters observed. However, we observed ISRs meeting grade 3 adverse event criteria in 2 out of 3 individuals administered C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol via the subcutaneous route. In the pre-clinical studies, ISRs had not been observed in mice and were mild and reversible in dogs. In this species ISRs, albeit milder, were also observed in the control group, suggesting that the chosen formulation might have contributed to the side-effect. Although high rates of ISRs are observed with subcutaneous administration of enfuvirtide, and therefore not an absolute impediment for clinical use, in the present scenario of HIV therapeutics we do not consider this route of administration suitable for further clinical development. Rather, intramuscular administration might represent a viable option, in light of recent data showing that rates of ISR are less marked when long-acting rilprivirine, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor is administered via intramuscular administration compared to subcutaneous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Identification of both an administration route and a different formulation for C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-chol that minimises ISRs would be attractive, since the preliminary pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol we have observed in HIV-positive men are supportive of continuing evaluation of this drug.</p><p id="Par28">At a dose of 10&#x02009;mg of C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol, we observed in two subjects a plasma concentration above the LLOQ of 62&#x02009;ng/mL at 72&#x02009;hours (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This concentration is still 25&#x02013;770 fold the IC<sub>90</sub> observed <italic>in vitro</italic> on several viral strains and notably, it coincides with the threshold (67&#x02009;ng/mL) which prevents growth of resistant virus <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the only subject at the 20&#x02009;mg dose, LLOQ was reached after 96&#x02009;h. We have observed linear dose-exposure in animals, and limited to the two doses here, also in humans (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Extrapolation to higher doses, up to the intended maximum of 80&#x02009;mg, strongly suggests the possibility of once-weekly use, although such extrapolations are based on data from only 3 subjects. For comparison, enfuvirtide requires administration of a &#x02009;90&#x000a0;mg dose twice-daily. The preliminary pharmacodynamic data are also encouraging, with &#x02265;0.5 Log<sub>10</sub> reduction in plasma HIV RNA observed in all three participants after a single dose at the lower end (10&#x02013;20&#x02009;mg) of the intended dose range (10&#x02013;80&#x02009;mg) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Notably, rebound of viral load was measured only after 96&#x02009;hours, which is consistent with a plasma concentration of C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol above the IC<sub>90</sub> for longer than our assay could measure. Our pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic observations are limited to three subjects, and therefore lack statistical power to infer such observations would be observed with larger numbers of subjects.</p><p id="Par29">The first human data with a cholesterol-conjugated FI reported here augur well for the whole class. Cholesterol-conjugated FIs have been reported for several viruses for which there are limited or no therapies, which renders the issue of ISRs less relevant than for HIV therapeutics.

In particular for the threat of emerging viral diseases, it should be noted that FIs can be developed rapidly because their design only requires knowledge of the viral genome, which is available before or rapidly acquired at the time of an epidemic. Moreover, since for each viral family the fusion proteins, from which the FIs are derived, share the same mechanism of action and display considerable sequence conservation, a cholesterol-conjugated FI for a &#x0201c;sentinel virus&#x0201d; would represent the template for all the other viruses within the same family.</p><p id="Par32">Although our study included small numbers of participants, the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic signals were have observed in humans for C34-PEG<sub>4</sub>-Chol now offer a critical validation for this strategy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec25"><p>
