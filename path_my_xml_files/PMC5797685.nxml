Guidance for how to provide effective reassurance is scarce and there may be a need to counter patient concerns arising from misinterpretation of spinal imaging findings. &#x02018;GLITtER&#x02019; (Green Light Imaging Intervention to Enhance Recovery) was developed as a standardised method of communicating imaging findings in a manner that is reassuring and promotes engagement in an active recovery. This feasibility study is an important step towards definitive testing of its effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This feasibility study was a prospective, quasi-randomised, parallel trial with longitudinal follow-up, involving sampling of patients attending a spinal outpatient clinic at a metropolitan hospital. English speaking adults (18&#x02013;75 years) presenting to the clinic with low back pain and prior spinal imaging were considered for inclusion. Eligible patients were allocated to receive a GLITtER consultation or a standard consultation (as determined by appointment scheduling and clinician availability), and were blinded to their allocation. Full details of the GLITtER intervention are described in accordance with the <italic>Tidier</italic> template.<bold/>Follow-up data were collected after 1 and 3 months. The primary outcome of this study was the fulfillment of specific feasibility criteria which were established <italic>a priori</italic>. Determination of a sample size for a definitive randomised controlled trial was a secondary objective.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two hundred seventy-six patients underwent preliminary screening and 31 patients met the final eligibility criteria for study inclusion. Seventeen participants were allocated to the intervention group and 14 were allocated to the control group. Three month follow-up data were available from 42% of the 31 enrolled participants (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13, six intervention, seven control). <bold/> Feasibility indicators for consent, resource burden and acceptability of the GLITtER intervention were met, however participant recruitment was slower than anticipated and an acceptable follow-up rate was not achieved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p><bold/> Failure to achieve pre-specified recruitment and follow-up rates were important outcomes of this feasibility study. We attribute failure to issues that are likely to be relevant for other clinical trials with this population. It is realistic to consider that these challenges can be overcome through careful strategy, ample funding and continued partnership with health care providers.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>The trial was registered on the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on 28/2/2017 (ACTRN12617000317392).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Low back pain</kwd><kwd>Reassurrance</kwd><kwd>Spinal imaging</kwd><kwd>Education</kwd><kwd>Conservative management</kwd><kwd>Secondary care</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund-1"><funding-source>The Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Foundation Clinical Research Grant (2015)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-2"><funding-source>The Royal Adelaide Hospital Research Foundation Dawes Scholarship (2016&#x02013;2018)</funding-source></award-group><award-group id="fund-3"><funding-source>The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia</funding-source><award-id>106279</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>Emma L.

Consequently, their contribution to the massive burden of LBP (<xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr">Vos et al., 2016</xref>) is likely to be significant. General practitioners (GPs) frequently refer their patients to specialist secondary care clinics for surgical opinion (<xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr">ABS, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr">Coulter, 1998</xref>)&#x02014;however surgery is recommended for only a small proportion of cases (<xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Li &#x00026; Yen, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Robarts et al., 2017</xref>). For the remainder, clinicians are generally challenged to provide time-efficient, guideline-based, conservative care recommendations. Screening tools have been used to determine risk and optimal pathways for back pain patients in primary care, but systematic review data (<xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Karran et al., 2017a</xref>) are underwhelming and they seem to offer little benefit within the context of secondary care (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Karran et al., 2017b</xref>).</p><p>There is widespread current agreement in LBP clinical practice guidelines that clinicians should deliver high quality information as a key component of their management (<xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">O&#x02019;Connell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, patients should be reassured that their condition is not likely to be serious, that a favourable outcome is usual and that activity levels should be resumed as soon as possible (<xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr">NICE, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Koes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Qaseem et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr">Stochkendahl et al., 2017</xref>). While patient reassurance can be considered a central tenet of this approach, practical guidance for how to effectively deliver reassurance in the clinical setting is lacking (<xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr">Hasenbring &#x00026; Pincus, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Traeger et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the impact of providing reassuring information on pragmatic outcomes appears to be poorly understood (<xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr">Pincus &#x00026; McCracken, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr">Traeger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Counter to clinicians&#x02019; efforts to reassure, the communication of spinal imaging findings have been suggested to have the potential to increase patients&#x02019; fear of re-injury and reduce their likelihood of a good outcome (<xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Roland &#x00026; Van Tulder, 1998</xref>). Adverse effects of early imaging of the lumbar spine have also been reported (<xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr">Graves et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr">Webster &#x00026; Cifuentes, 2010</xref>). That most LBP patients attending secondary care present with spinal images (<xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Sears et al., 2016</xref>) and that these images are routinely considered during the consultation, provides opportunity for careful consideration of how imaging results are interpreted and communicated in this setting.</p><p>Recent evidence reveals a high prevalence of common degenerative features in the imaging reports of asymptomatic adults (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Brinjikji et al., 2014</xref>). This indicates that many of these features&#x02014;particularly when found incidentally&#x02014;should not be considered pathological and instead be regarded as normal age-related changes. Coherent with this interpretation is that degenerative findings have been found to be poorly associated with current pain (<xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr">Brinjikji et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Carragee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Suri et al., 2014</xref>) and prognosis (<xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Carragee et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr">De Schepper et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr">Steffens et al., 2014</xref>). Considering this evidence, we developed and tested an intervention framework based on using imaging findings for clinical benefit (<xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Karran et al., 2018</xref>). This psycho-educational intervention, referred to as &#x02018;GLITtER&#x02019; (Green Light Imaging Intervention to Enhance Recovery), involves a standardised method of communicating radiological findings in a manner designed to reassure patients and promote engagement in an active recovery.</p><p>A feasibility trial, conducted in the spinal outpatient setting at an Australian metropolitan hospital, is the crucial first step towards definitive testing of this intervention. The primary aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of recruitment and retention, assessment procedures, implementation and acceptability of the GLITtER intervention for LBP patients attending a spinal outpatient clinic. Secondary objectives included the identification of modifications needed in the design of a larger effectiveness trial and provision of data to enable calculation of an appropriately powered sample for a subsequent effectiveness trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Trial approval, registration and reporting</title><p>The Research Ethics Committees at the Royal Adelaide Hospital (protocol no. 150308) and the University of South Australia (protocol no. 0000034887) provided approval for this study.

The study also adopted an adaptive trial design, whereby modifications could be made during its conduct with the purpose of increasing the probability of success of the study procedure or the intervention. Adaptations were made during recruitment of the first one-third of participants, as pre-specified in the protocol (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/8zrq3/">https://osf.io/8zrq3/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Study setting and participants</title><p>The study was conducted in the SAC, which operates in the Spinal Outpatient Department at a large metropolitan hospital in South Australia. The SAC is a Physiotherapist-led clinic attended by patients who warrant non-urgent consultation, as identified by a paper-based triage procedure prior to appointment scheduling. All patients aged between 18 and 75&#x000a0;years who were scheduled to attend the SAC with a lumbar spine disorder were considered for inclusion. To be eligible, patients were required to be able to speak and understand (verbal and written) English and have access to recent images of their lumbar spine. Baseline pain duration was not an eligibility consideration, however it was anticipated that patients presenting to the SAC were likely to have experienced pain for longer than 3 months, based on usual minimum timeframes for appointment scheduling. Patients with a history of lumbar spine surgery were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants allocated to the intervention group received a &#x02018;GLITtER&#x02019; consultation, integrated into the standard SAC consultation. Participants allocated to the control group received a &#x02018;standard consultation&#x02019;.

In brief&#x02014;a routine, or &#x02018;standard&#x02019; consultation involves comprehensive patient assessment, review and interpretation of relevant investigations and discussion of management recommendations. A key objective of the patient-centered interaction is identification of potential surgical candidates, or the guidance of patients appropriate for continued conservative care towards community-based options. The GLITtER consultation includes all components of the standard consultation but is enhanced by the implementation of a standardised framework through which imaging findings are interpreted (designed to optimise patient reassurance), includes provision of take-home resource, emphasizes the need for an <italic>active</italic> recovery, and offers links to further information.</p><table-wrap id="table-1" orientation="landscape" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.4301/table-1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Description of the intervention and control consultations (consistent with the TIDieR reporting checklist (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.equator-network.org">www.equator-network.org</ext-link>)).</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="peerj-06-4301-g003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" content-type="text"><colgroup span="1"><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/><col span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">GLITtER consultation</th><th align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Standard consultation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">WHY</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Goal:</bold> To supplement and enhance the standard SAC consultation with a strategy designed to optimise patient reassurance and facilitate engagement in an active recovery.</td><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"><bold>Goal:</bold> To provide comprehensive assessment and management of patients with LBP attending the SAC.

Within this session, a neurosurgeon (YHY) led instruction and discussion of the imaging interpretation strategy developed for GLITtER. The second stage involved providing clinicians 1 and 2 with the framework for the GLITtER intervention, with instruction to undertake self-directed familiarization with the content (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3">Supplemental File 3</xref>). The third stage was a face-to-face session with the principal researcher to discuss the intervention framework and practice strategies for clinical implementation.

The main issue discussed was the failure to consistently meet the weekly target for participant recruitment. An unforeseen change to clinic process (with the result that fewer patients who were likely to be recommended for conservative management received SAC appointments) was identified as the reason for the lower number of patients meeting the final eligibility criteria than anticipated. While no significant resolution to this issue was identified, the exclusion of patients who reported a past history of spinal surgery was discussed. We recognised that many of these patients did not require further imaging or surgical opinion and had the potential to benefit from GLITtER.

While pre-specified targets for consent rates, resource burden and acceptability of the GLITtER intervention were met, participant recruitment was slower than anticipated and an acceptable follow-up rate was not achieved.</p><p>Recruitment of participants into the study occurred at half of the anticipated rate, due largely to fewer patients meeting the final eligibility criteria than expected. An identified contributor to this was the change to referral management processes such that patients who were unlikely to be candidates for intervention were no longer offered SAC appointments. (Instead, these patients and their General Practitioners were informed via a letter that community-based management was most appropriate.) Although the number of patients attending the SAC who were eligible for this study was low, this may not indicate that the number of individuals suitable for the GLITtER intervention is also low. Instead, it may indicate that there is need to further consider how best to access the patients for whom GLITtER may offer potential benefit. Alternatively, plans to further investigate the GLITtER intervention in the spinal outpatient setting must carefully consider patient triage procedures, allow for slower recruitment, and investigate the potential for recruitment at multiple sites. The wording on the information sheet should also be reconsidered to avoid the risk that some patients may have declined participation out of concern that they would be given reassuring information during their consultation, rather than the information that they were seeking.</p><p>We achieved a 3-month participant follow-up rate of only 42%, which failed to meet our feasibility criterion. In hindsight, our objective to achieve complete follow-up data from 95% response rate was high&#x02014;a drop-out rate of more than 20% is generally considered to compromise the validity of a clinical trial unacceptably (<xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Schulz &#x00026; Grimes, 2002</xref>). Possible reasons for the high drop-out rate may have included participant improvement (such that LBP was no longer a significant concern), or patient perceptions of a lack of relevance of the intervention or the follow-up requests. The protocol for collecting follow-up data via postal questionnaires and SMS reminders was based on the procedure applied in our previous work, which achieved a 4 month follow-up rate of 89% (<xref rid="ref-16" ref-type="bibr">Karran et al., 2017b</xref>). There were two main differences in the follow-up conditions between these studies. Firstly, our prior study involved participants while they were still waiting for their clinic appointments to be scheduled which may have facilitated engagement, whereas follow-up for the current trial occurred after patients had received their clinic consultation. Secondly, for our initial study, we sent small packets of confectionery with requests for completion and return of questionnaires, whereas in the current trial we did not. Future investigations in this setting should further consider developing an enhanced protocol for achieving follow-up targets and providing participant incentives (<xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Brueton et al., 2013</xref>). It may also be important to consider revision of the inclusion criteria to ensure that the patient&#x02019;s problem is of sufficient severity to warrant engagement with the study. Unfortunately, the poor response rate attained in this study impacted the achievement of our secondary objectives. Collected data were used to cautiously inform the determination of sample size for a larger RCT, but was considered insufficient to undertake exploratory analysis of effect.</p><p>The GLITtER intervention was acceptable, of perceived benefit to both patients and clinicians, and was able to be integrated into a standard consultation without significant time burden for clinicians. The 95% data completion rate on the recommended minimal dataset for LBP research (<xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr">Deyo et al., 2014</xref>) suggests that despite its length, it is not overly onerous for participants. The consent rate of 75% exceeded our target rate, however it must be acknowledged that a further 8% of patients who met the primary eligibility criteria did not either confirm or decline consent. Whilst a number of these exclusions were likely to be related to procedural or timing issues it must be also considered that some of these patients may have opted out of the study (without this action being recorded)&#x02014;with impact on the overall consent rate.</p><p>This study employed rigorous scientific methods throughout. The protocol was developed in accordance with the SPIRIT checklist and pre-registered on Open Science Framework. The trial was registered on the ANZCTR and has been reported according to the CONSORT statement. Description of the GLITtER intervention followed the TIDieR recommendations for reporting of clinical interventions and the NIHs task force recommended minimum data set for LBP clinical trials was implemented. The specification of feasibility criteria prior to conducting this investigation is a further strength of this study&#x02019;s design.</p><p>Several weaknesses have also been recognised. There are no standardised criteria for evaluating feasibility, or how achievement of the established criteria should be measured. We used an evidence-informed but ultimately investigator-led approach to identify and quantify our feasibility criteria, which may not have been optimal. Factors such as participant adherence to management recommendations and investigator burden could also have been considered. In addition, we consider that the ability to engage clinicians and administrative personnel is imperative to the success of a clinical trial but we did not formally assess engagement. Our sample size and our follow-up rate were smaller than we expected, which resulted in less data to evaluate our feasibility criteria than we specified as a requirement a priori. The study sample may therefore not be representative of the larger patient population, raising the risk that estimates or interpretations that arise lack precision or are potentially misleading. Last, staff training was not formalised and treatment fidelity was not assessed. While we did calculate an estimated sample size required for a RCT to definitively examine the effect of the GLITtER intervention, this result should be interpreted with caution. Encouragingly, the baseline value for the pain NRS score and the standard deviation of this measure at 3-month follow-up, were very similar to the data recorded in another LBP feasibility trial on which a sample size estimate was also based (<xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr">Ellard et al., 2017</xref>). Based on the assumption that two participants from each SAC would meet final eligibility criteria for inclusion in the study and be randomised, and that clinics operate on 46 weeks of the year&#x02014;it appears realistic that 92 participants could be recruited annually. Timely achievement of a recruitment target of 126 is likely to be possible, and potential also exists to consider enrolment of participants at two or more sites.</p><p>This study successfully tested for feasibility of a highly pragmatic approach to addressing the clinical challenge of providing time-efficient, low cost, guideline-informed management of patients with LBP attending secondary care. Based on analysis of our feasibility criteria, a full-scale RCT evaluating the effectiveness of the GLITtER intervention is not recommended without considering strategies that are capable of resolving the recruitment and follow-up issues that we have identified. The shift in clinical pathways raises the possibility that testing of GLITtER in primary care may be indicated. These issues are likely to affect other trials in this population and as such, we humbly suggest that the lessons we have learnt be considered recommendations for the field.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Failure to achieve pre-specified recruitment and follow-up rates was disappointing, however these were important outcomes of a feasibility study. It is realistic to consider that these challenges can be overcome through careful strategy, ample funding and continued partnership with health care providers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplemental-information"><title> Supplemental Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.4301/supp-1</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 1</label><caption><title>Trial registration data</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-06-4301-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.4301/supp-2</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 2</label><caption><title>CONSORT 2010 checklist</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-06-4301-s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.4301/supp-3</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 3</label><caption><title>GLITtER framework for clinicians</title></caption><media xlink:href="peerj-06-4301-s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="supp-4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7717/peerj.4301/supp-4</object-id><label>Supplemental Information 4</label><caption><title>Outcome measures (1): Pain and Disability NRS &#x00026;
