The protocol was divided into three distinct phases for the purpose of the study. Both groups were evaluated at time 1 (T1), before the first 8-week intervention, which only G1 received. The second evaluation was made on both groups at time 2 (T2), immediately after this first program; in order to test the program&#x02019;s replicability and investigate possible follow-up effects, an identical second 8-week program was offered to G2 during time 3 (T3), while G1 was simply instructed to maintain the practice they had learned without further instruction between T2 and T3. A Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to investigate the construct validity of PROGRESS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Repeated measures MANOVA test, comparing G1 and G2, showed the effect of the intervention from T1 to T2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.021) and from T2 to T3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.031). Univariate analysis showed that participants from G1 improved levels of non-severe psychiatric symptoms, anxiety, depression, stress, processing speed/attention and mindfulness when compared with G2, from T1 to T2 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). After the participants in G2 received the intervention (T2 to T3), this group also showed improvement in the same variables (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). At the end of their follow-up period (T2-T3) &#x02013; during which they received no further support or instruction &#x02013; G1 maintained the improvements gained during T1-T2. The two main components were stress (stress in the last 24-h, in the last week and last month) and mental health (non-severe psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety and mindfulness).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> PROGRESS, an <italic>in situ</italic> mindfulness program adapted to fit within the reality of business time constraints, was effective at replicating in more than one group the reduction of stress, depression, anxiety, non-severe psychiatric symptoms, processing speed and also the improvement of attention skills, showing sustained improvement even after 8-weeks follow-up.

Participants also reported stress as a source of negative impact on their mental and physical health, and a considerable proportion of them did not feel they were doing enough to manage it.</p><p>The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health in the United States reported that 25% of American employees mentioned that their jobs are the main stressor in their lives and 40% considered that their jobs are very or extremely stressful (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017</xref>). It is well known that stress is associated with health problems, such as mental and cardiovascular disorders, and a cause of absenteeism and reduction in productivity in companies (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Henderson K. M. et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Chronic stress at work may lead to burnout, with detrimental consequences to workers&#x02019; well-being and health. In a systematic review burnout was shown to be a significant predictor of physical consequences such as coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disorders, musculoskeletal pain and prolonged fatigue. As for the professional impact, the review related burnout to dissatisfaction, absenteeism and presenteeism. Among psychological symptoms, the study found depression, insomnia and psychological ill-health. Both preventative interventions and early identification of burnout in the work environment may alleviate the individual and social impacts of this condition (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Salvagioni et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Depression and anxiety are common comorbidities associated with stress. In their review, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Liu and Alloy (2010)</xref> discussed the relation between stress and depression. Their review suggests that earlier research demonstrated stressful events often triggering symptoms of depression and anxiety, whereas more recent research revealed that depression and anxiety can increase future exposure to stress. This suggests that stressors and internalizing responses influence each other reciprocally.</p><p>Work stress is not, unfortunately, related only to the work environment. Employees who fail to psychologically deal with stressful events in the workplace also experience difficulties in facing life outside working hours. According to <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Demsky et al. (2014)</xref>, work stressors such as workplace aggression may be associated with higher levels of work-family conflict, a form of conflict in which pressures from work and family are mutually incompatible to some degree. It is associated with a number of important problematic outcomes, including negative employee attitudes and reduced performance, health and well-being. Work stress at the end of a workday is related to work-related rumination and low levels of restful sleep measured the morning after (<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Vahle-Hinz et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, stress reduction programs may improve well-being and lead to prosocial behaviors (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bhui et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Davidson and McEwen, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mindfulness-Based Interventions</title><p>The increasing worldwide concern about the impact of stress-inducing lifestyles has a large part to play in the interest research has gained into mindfulness-based interventions. Currently, many of the most successful skills-based stress reduction programs are based on this principle of mindfulness. According to <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn (2003)</xref>, mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way; on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally. It was Kabat-Zinn who, in the late 1970s, created the <italic>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</italic> (MBSR) program which includes contemplative practices (such as meditation, gentle movement, and body awareness techniques), for the development of self-knowledge and resilience (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chiesa and Malinowski, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Salmon et al., 2011</xref>). MBSR was originally developed for the management of chronic pain and stress-associated illness and it was primarily this program that paved the way for many recent innovations in contexts outside hospitals and health clinics. The original MBSR format comprises eight 2.5 &#x02013; 3 h weekly sessions with a silent 7-h retreat (shortly after the sixth session). It is recommended that everyday during the program the participants do both formal silent meditative practices and also informal practices such as mindful walking or eating (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Since the very early days of secular mindfulness training it has been found that silent meditation practices can support the cultivation of mindfulness. The practitioner learns how to develop a broader inner perspective on their own passing thoughts and emotions, identifying them as simple mental events occurring in the present moment. Participants in these programs develop the ability to reduce their over-identification with these mental events even during stressful situations, instead of engaging in anxiety, preoccupation or in negative thinking which can lead into a cycle of stress reactivity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale et al., 1995</xref>). Some mindfulness-based programs were combined with Cognitive Therapy to improve these abilities. One of the most well-known of these if Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy which was developed to help patients diagnosed with major depression to learn to manage and prevent relapses (<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>The participants develop sustained attention to observe their thoughts and emotions without identifying themselves with them, observing the adaptive and non-adaptive content as soon they appear in the mind. With persistent practice in this way they begin to notice triggers from which these cognitive and emotional patterns are stimulated and to perceive their subsequent consequences. As a result, mindfulness helps to reduce the tendencies which charge these non-adaptive thoughts and emotions (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rapgay and Bystrisky, 2009</xref>), thereby reducing their negative effects, and increasing positive outcomes (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schroevers and Brandsma, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Benefits of Mindfulness at the Workplace</title><p><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Davidson et al. (2003)</xref> evaluated 48 biotech employees who received an in-situ MBSR protocol during their working hours, and the results suggested an increase in antibody response to a flu vaccine. Since 2003 comparatively few studies of this kind have been carried out to further the investigation of the possible benefits of mindfulness interventions within the business community (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Hyland et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Mindfulness-based programs have been seen to be efficient in dealing with intrusive thoughts, rumination and stress (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Mendelson et al., 2010</xref>) and in the prevention of relapse in depression (<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Segal et al., 2010</xref>). Mindfulness programs have been efficient in alleviating some of the secondary effects of chronic pain (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Morone et al., 2008</xref>) and primary insomnia (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Gross et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The investigation into whether mindfulness reduces emotional exhaustion and improves job satisfaction has also been carried out (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;lsheger et al., 2013</xref>). This research revealed that as a result of short mindfulness interventions (5 or 10-day trainings) &#x02013; known as &#x0201c;low-dose mindfulness interventions&#x0201d; &#x02013; mindfulness is positively related to job satisfaction, and negatively associated with emotional exhaustion.</p><p>A few years later the same team devised a self-training, randomized field protocol with a wait-list control group. They investigated psychological detachment, sleep quality, and sleep duration assessed in daily measurements over 10 workdays. The intervention had effects on sleep quality and sleep duration, however no effects were found for psychological detachment after work (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;lsheger et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A significant increase in the risk of injuries at work has been associated with fatigue, rush, distraction, emergency situations, teaching or being taught by someone, field, excess noise, complex procedures, anger, along with other factors (<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Valent et al., 2016</xref>). Most of these factors are related to the lack of attention to the work in progress which may be improved by mindfulness training. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Jha et al. (2007)</xref> evaluated changes in attention using the Attention Network Test (ANT) devised to identify behavioral and neural indices of alerting, orienting, and conflict monitoring during a single task (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2002</xref>). The participants in the MBSR group significantly improved the aspect of attention known as orienting when compared to the control and retreat participants. The orienting system has been associated with areas of the parietal and frontal lobes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Posner, 1980</xref>). <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al. (2015)</xref> proposed in a review about brain regions and mindfulness, the involvement of anterior cingulate and striatum (attention control), prefrontal and limbic regions and striatum (emotion regulation), insula, medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices and precuneus (self-awareness).</p></sec><sec><title>Developing a Tailor-Made Mindfulness Program for the Workplace</title><p>Studies within the workplace focus on programs which range from 36 h of training &#x02013; a mindfulness course aimed at relieving teachers of stress (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Roeser et al., 2013</xref>) &#x02013; to research of highly shortened interventions lasting between 5 or 10 days for employees (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;lsheger et al., 2013</xref>). Adapting these interventions to the needs of the workplace is the challenge of the present protocol.</p><p>This current study was developed around lengthy discussions in 2012 with the Brazilian National Confederation of Industries (CNI) and the Brazilian Institute of Social Services for Industry (SESI). These initial discussions led to the development of a new 9-h, 8-week mindfulness-based stress reduction in-situ training program, called PROGRESS. This format both respects the limiting time constraints of business, and also remains true to the nature of the mindfulness process, which defies any &#x0201c;quick fix&#x0201d; approach and requires time and patience to unfold.</p><p>This program was developed with three main aims in mind: providing psychological well-being (stress reduction and increased attention skills), developing emotional skills (such as empathy and interpersonal relating) and also capable of having classes short enough to fit into existing business time constraints and the program itself long enough to respect the necessary 2-month learning process coupled with the integration of the basic skills into daily life.</p><p>The most obvious adaptation was having the weekly meetings brief (the first and last sessions lasting 90 min, and the others only 60 min each). Next, the theoretical and practical examples chosen for the course material had to be related specifically to the workplace and stress reduction within that context, otherwise the focus would be quickly lost and time wasted. As many employees would find it difficult to have the necessary space or discipline at home to reproduce the meditations between one class and the next, the weekly meditation routine was organized within the workplace with a special allocated space for that activity and an audio system installed there. The meditation recordings were all reduced to half the original durations defined by MBSR to facilitate daily practice during a heavy work routine. The original MBSR format of including a 7-h practice retreat in week 6 was removed from the program as it was impractical, and replaced by a &#x0201c;Practice class&#x0201d; in Class 6. And interpersonal relationship management and empathy were emphasized especially in sessions 7 and 8, being considered as two key abilities in human relationships, and served to broaden the scope of the course, eschewing any tendency for it to fall into being a mere attention/concentration training program.</p><p>From these considerations, we hypothesized that a specially adapted 9-h, 8-week <italic>in situ</italic> mindfulness program based on mindfulness practice and basic emotional skills &#x02013; offered in the workplace &#x02013; could be effective in the reduction of stress, depression, anxiety and non-severe psychiatric symptoms, in the increase of mindfulness and processing speed and that these changes could be sustained within the normal daily work routine even without further instruction after 8 weeks follow-up.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate an in-situ mindfulness program, named PROGRESS, offered to meet the specific needs of workers in a business context and its impact upon non-severe psychiatric symptoms, stress, anxiety, depression, and attention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This is a randomized controlled trial with a follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Seventy-seven participants (employees from two companies) agreed to participate in the study and were randomly divided in two groups (<bold>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>).

Weeks 1&#x02013;4 are devoted to the development of self-awareness &#x02013; awareness especially of palpable physical changes within the body during meditation and throughout the day. These first weeks are mainly dedicated to supporting the practitioner to recognize physiological and psychological reactions of stress, anxiety and depression in their mind and physical experience. In weeks 5 and 6 the participants learn, in increasingly specific ways, how to integrate into their daily lives the training principle of facing their stressful experience as it is happening, gradually reducing stress in practice. In weeks 7 and 8, they learn how to develop not only self-awareness but also self/other awareness which allows a more empathetic and constructive relationship with themselves and with other people. The schema is cyclic because we recommend participants to keep practicing after the end of the program.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>FIGURE 3</label><caption><p>Principles of progress: the main elements of the program.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fpsyg-09-00668-g003"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The differences between the scores at baseline and those after the intervention were analyzed by a method of repeated measures.

The group which received the first intervention (G1) improved in all of the variables, and G2 &#x02013; which did not receive it at that time &#x02013; had no differences between the baseline and T1, suggesting that the intervention worked as we hypothesized, being effective in the reduction of stress, depression, anxiety and non-severe psychiatric symptoms and also increasing mindfulness and processing speed.</p><p>After G2 received the intervention it improved in the measured variables, except in BAI, digit-symbol and stress in the last 24 h. In the same period, participants in G1 were left to manage their practice on their own and they were able to sustain the improvements in the follow-up evaluation. This means that the learned skills were maintained without any further support or training in accordance with our hypothesis.</p><p>The improvements in both groups after their respective interventions in different time points were equivalent (there were significant differences from T1 to T3). It is important to notice that at the conclusion of the study (T3), after both groups had received the intervention, they had very similar outcomes.</p><p>PROGRESS participants showed reduction in non-severe psychiatric symptoms. Other interesting results were the increase in mindfulness and the increase in attention processing speed (digit-symbol results). This may considerably decrease the number of mistakes made during routine work and reduce injuries, which are a burden, especially in industry, and particularly in the case of one of the study settings. The low cost of stress reduction programs such as PROGRESS can open the possibility of investing in the human resources of the host company, and this may provide a return in productivity and reduced absenteeism (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Henderson C. et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmatory Factor Analysis</title><p>As a complementary analysis, we conducted a CFA which showed that there are two main components responsible for the efficacy of PROGRESS: stress and mental health. Processing speed could not enter in the model because of the type of outcomes presented in this test.</p><p>The two main components were stress (stress in the last 24 h, in the last week and last month) and mental health (non-severe psychiatric symptoms, depression, anxiety, and mindfulness). Our hypothesis was that mindfulness would be a separate component associated with processing speed because both depend on attention, however mindfulness is more related to mental health than attention. On the other hand, as hypothesized, non-severe psychiatric symptoms, depression and anxiety were associated.</p></sec><sec><title>Stress Reduction Programs</title><p>A number of successful stress reduction programs are based on the principle of mindfulness and involve self-knowledge and self-awareness (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Chiesa and Malinowski, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Salmon et al., 2011</xref>). PROGRESS is an adaptation of MBSR and, in it, mindfulness is taught to emphasize not only awareness of the self, but relational skills as well. The development of empathy may lead to a less stressful environment, and to a more cooperative predisposition within and between work teams and, of course, with the client. Most of the components of emotional intelligence (self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skill) (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Goleman, 1998</xref>), are part of PROGRESS. These qualities are tending to be increasingly valued by both the employee and the organization. This ability to expand mindfulness into one&#x02019;s everyday life has influenced how PROGRESS encourages the application of mindfulness practice within the work routine, and a key aspect of the program supports participants in coming up with their own ways of using the practice to manage the day-to-day work challenges they come up against. All of this is explored during the classes &#x02013; especially in the second half of the course.</p><p>One common problem in organizations is that the individuals involved frequently avoid conflict due to the possible negative impact on the individual, group and the organization. Participants in a mindfulness program tended to decrease conflict avoidance and improve emotional acceptance compared with a control group (<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Skarlicki et al., 2015</xref>). Mindfulness practice arguably reduces over-identification with mental events and ruminations and it help to reduce negative thinking which frequently leads to the beginning of cycles of stress reactivity (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Kabat-Zinn, 1982</xref>; <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Teasdale et al., 1995</xref>). Non-adaptive thoughts and emotions may be weakened by mindfulness practice (<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Rapgay and Bystrisky, 2009</xref>) and some evidence suggests a reduction in negative effects and an increase positive ones (<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schroevers and Brandsma, 2010</xref>). A 3-week online self-training mindfulness intervention as a cognitive<italic>&#x02013;</italic>emotional segmentation strategy to promote work<italic>&#x02013;</italic>life balance compared to a waitlist control group showed promising results in promoting significantly less strain-based work<italic>&#x02013;</italic>family conflict and significantly more psychological detachment and satisfaction with work<italic>&#x02013;</italic>life balance (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Michel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Other mindfulness programs researched in companies report signs of more job satisfaction and reduced emotional exhaustion (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;lsheger et al., 2013</xref>), and better sleep quality (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000fc;lsheger et al., 2015</xref>). These possible effects may explain the reduction of non-severe psychiatric symptoms, stress, depression and anxiety scores after the PROGRESS intervention.</p><p>According to <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Biggio and Cortese (2013)</xref>, well-being in the workplace can be promoted not only &#x0201c;from above,&#x0201d; by means of actions from management level, but also &#x0201c;from below,&#x0201d; influencing individual traits and behaviors within the environment. This suggests that for a successful stress reduction program in companies it is important to have the participation of the different staff levels in the company, including leaders.</p></sec><sec><title>Why PROGRESS Is Different From Other Programs?</title><p>PROGRESS was &#x0201c;tailor-made&#x0201d; for companies, and has deliberately adapted each class to a 1-h format (or an hour and a half in the case of the first and last classes). This shorter class time was specifically requested by The Brazilian Institute of Social Services for Industry &#x02013; SESI, arising from the knowledge that a longer class time implies higher costs for companies and reducing employee adherence. A follow-up study, similar to a crossover design, was tested because it is important to verify if the participants were able to retain the benefits of the intervention, having only the written handouts and CDs as a support. Even without further instruction our follow-up has shown that the benefits were maintained. At the same time, we recommend companies to consider having regular practice classes as a sustaining support, maybe once a month, because they will probably have better results in the long term this way. Those who did not adhere to the program were interviewed revealing that the majority of these participants were unable to reorganize their schedule to the time-slot chosen by the company for the program to take place. In one company the allocated time-slot was scheduled early in the morning before the beginning of the working day. The other company defined the period before lunch as the best time for the program to take place. This points out the possible value of offering different training schedules within host companies. Taking these considerations into account we suggest that interventions based on mindfulness and the development of emotional abilities may be effective in reducing stress at the workplace.</p><p>There are few studies about mindfulness programs for companies. After interviewing employers and employees, PROGRESS was created in order to adapt a stress reduction program for companies. The adaptations we highlight are the brief and concise weekly class meetings, the additional support for short daily meditation practices within the company, and the emphasis on training interpersonal relationship management and empathy. The meetings are theoretical and practical with examples specifically related to the workplace and oriented to show how to learn to reduce stress.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and Further Considerations</title><p>As a possible bias, one of the authors (SWL) developed this mindfulness program. PROGRESS was tested only in Brazilian industries and it may be a limitation of this study. Another limitation is the so-called Hawthorne effect: improvements can be related to participants knowledge about their allocation in the intervention or control groups (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">McCarney et al., 2007</xref>), however there are many discussions about the heterogeneity of study methods, contexts, and findings in Hawthorne effect research (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">McCambridge et al., 2014</xref>). Another limitation is the lack of a placebo group that could control the effect of the intervention expectation. Other interventions such as physical exercise or psychotherapy may reduce stress in the work environment, however we decided to focus our study on mindfulness which, by having a classroom format focused on training palpable skills over a short period of time, may be more easily implemented in a modern company setting. As a next step, we may suggest a larger sample in which it will be possible to compare the effects of PROGRESS on different categories of workers, such as leaders, administrative staff and factory production line employees. A placebo intervention could also be included and biological measures such as cortisol levels would also strengthen the evidence of the effects of PROGRESS. From the point of view of the company, it would also be important to measure productivity, absenteeism and presenteeism indicators, as well as job satisfaction.</p><p>Concluding, PROGRESS &#x02013; when compared to a waiting-list &#x02013; reduced non-severe psychiatric symptoms, stress, anxiety, depression and increased attention. Its efficacy can be attributed to its effects in two main components: stress and mental health. The improvements lasted at least for 8 weeks of follow-up.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SSL and EHK: Design, data collection, analysis, article writing, and revision.
