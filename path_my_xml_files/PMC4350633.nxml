After an academic year schools were crossed over to the alternative arm. According to the socio-ecological model, the intervention included children, their parents and teachers, and the school environment where MOVI-KIDS was conducted. MOVI-KIDS consisted of: i) three-h/week sessions of recreational non-competitive physical activity in after-school time; ii) educational materials to parents and teachers about physical activity benefits and sedentary lifestyle risks; and iii) modifications in the playground to promote physical activity during recess. Baseline and post-intervention outcomes are going to be measured in both arms three times, at the beginning and at the end of first academic year, and at the end of the second academic year.

The prevalence of overweight, including obesity, in the province of Cuenca in 2010 was 35.4% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Similar prevalence figures have been reported in other areas of Spain and other Mediterranean countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The trend to increase the overweight prevalence has also been accompanied by high rates of underweight in children from Spain and other European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Obese children are at increased risk to becoming obese in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and to suffer premature cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The risk of obesity in children increases as earlier adiposity rebound occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Moreover, child obesity has been related with hypertension, dyslipidemia, platelet aggregation, hyperinsulinemia, osteoarticular problems and carotid intima-media thickness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], all of them predictors of cardiovascular events in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Conversely to physical fitness, obesity is negatively related to academic achievement, self-esteem, and health-related quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Obesity is a complex disorder determined by both genetic and environmental factors, but also by their interaction. The obese child is the phenotypic expression as a result of the interaction between polygenic inheritance with food intake and physical activity (PA) habits, although also social, psychological and environmental factors have been related to the development of obesity during childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The relative importance of both energy expenditure and energy intake is a controversial issue in Spain and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In Spanish children, however, some characteristics of the obesity epidemic should be taken into account when we are examining which are the main drivers of this epidemic: i) data from the AVENA study support an association between television watching, videogames, and excess of body fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; and ii) it has been recently described in the adolescents from European HELENA sample that the more physically active and leaner adolescents have higher energy intake than less active adolescents with larger amounts of fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Vigorous PA may have an important role in the prevention of excess of weight in children and overall cardiovascular diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Furthermore it has been suggested that PA at early ages could increase bone and muscular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and could have cardio-metabolic benefits throughout lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Many observations have suggested that the earlier age at adiposity rebound is known to be a risk factor of later obesity because it is associated with a particular body mass index (BMI) trajectory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The age of adiposity rebound depends on genetic factors and environmental and nutritional conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Time spent in vigorous PA at early ages might represent a practical strategy to delay the onset of adiposity rebound.</p><p>Several studies have assessed the risk factors of obesity and the effectiveness of the interventions to prevent them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The latest Cochrane revision that evaluated the interventions for preventing obesity in children concluded that there is enough evidence of the effectiveness of PA intervention in children from 6 to 12&#x000a0;years old to prevent obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Also, this review indicates that there is a lack of evidence in studies to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions in children younger than 6&#x000a0;years. No study describes in detail the intervention or the cost-effectiveness analysis and none informs about its negative consequences and potential damage. Only one study analysed a health lifestyle promotional program in children of this age, with successful effectiveness in reducing fat mass and improving fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Our group has conducted so far two interventions based on after-school programs of recreational PA to control obesity and other cardiovascular risks in primary schools (8 to 11&#x000a0;years old) in Cuenca, Spain. The first edition, called MOVI program, showed a moderate effect in reducing adiposity and improving lipid profile, but did not significantly improve overall cardiometabolic risk, mainly because it did not reduce blood insulin levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A second edition (MOVI-2) increased duration and intensity of the sessions and was more focused on increased muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. It shows a decrease in body fat and fasting insulin, and as a consequence in global cardiometabolic risk levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>This paper reports the rationale and methods of a trial to assess the effectiveness of a multidimensional PA (MOVI-KIDS) promotion intervention in schoolchildren for preventing obesity, improving fitness, and reducing cardiovascular risk during the adiposity rebound period in children from 4-to-7&#x000a0;years of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). Secondary objectives were to evaluate the effectiveness of this program on increasing the children&#x02019;s level of PA, their physical fitness and the reduction of carotid intima-media thickness. In addition, a nested qualitative study had as objectives to identify barriers and facilitators to PA in children in the school environment.</p><p>This project was coordinated with another project that share the same population-based sample and that was aimed to assess the effectiveness of the PA intervention to prevent obesity and improve academic performance in children with and without Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) risk (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01971827).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This was a cross-over randomised cluster trial that involved 21 schools located in as many municipalities in the province of Cuenca and Ciudad Real, Castilla-La Mancha region (Spain). All were public schools except for two private schools, one of each capital province. In municipalities with more than one school, only one was selected for the study. Of the 22 invited schools, only one school refused to participate in the study, arguing that teachers did not accept to participate due to excessive administrative overhead that the study could mean for them. After the approval of School Councils, the schools were randomly allocated by using the statistical package StatsDirect to either the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG); for this goal the whole sample of schools was divided in three subgroups of randomisation as follows: i) nine public schools from Cuenca; ii) ten public schools from Ciudad Real; and iii) two private schools in the capital of the provinces (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In each school, all children belonging to third year of pre-school and first grade of primary school (4-to-7&#x000a0;years old) were invited to participate.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>

The approval of Boards of Governors was necessary in order to participate in the intervention and in the measurements at the beginning and the end of the academic year. For all children informed consent from parents or legal representative was a compulsory requirement to participate. The parents were invited to collaborate fulfilling the questionnaires regarding family leisure habits, sleeping, eating, and getting around town.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Exclusion criteria</title><p>Participants who had severe Spanish language learning difficulties were excluded. Also were excluded participants with serious physical or mental disorders identified by parents or teachers which would impede participation in the program&#x02019;s activities, and also those with diagnoses of chronic disorders such as heart diseases, diabetes or asthma that in opinion of their paediatricians prevents the participation in the program activities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Ethical and legal aspects</title><p>The project was supported by the Department of Education and Science of the Junta de Communities of Castilla-La Mancha (Spain), who sent a letter to each school to inform them of the study. Investigators then visited each school to provide information on the study objectives and methods, and to obtain the consent of the head teacher and the school board. This was followed by classroom-by-classroom briefings, in which pupils were asked to collaborate. The MOVI-KIDS study was also presented to physical education teachers. A letter was sent to parents inviting them to a meeting in order to explain the study objectives and procedures. Subsequently parents were asked to sign informed consent approving the participation of their child in the study, with the recommendation to consult the child and to take their views into account.</p><p>Data of the child examinations were sent to parents by a letter after each measurement process, and when any anomalous values were detected, the team doctors gave to parents the appropriate recommendations.</p><p>The Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the &#x02018;Virgen de la Luz&#x02019; Hospital in Cuenca approved the study protocol. An insurance policy was signed to cover any potential risks associated with the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention</title><p>The design of the MOVI-KIDS is based on the social ecology model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], a theoretical model of behaviour change. From this paradigm the behaviour is the interaction between the physical and social environment. The MOVI-KIDS program is a multidimensional intervention aimed to influence on individuals (children, families, and teachers) and the environment (including some changes in the physical structure of the schoolyard).</p><p>The intervention has been applied in the IG during two full academic years, and was implemented at three levels:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>i)</label><p>Children participated in an extracurricular, adapted to the schoolchildren levels of motor competences (4-to-6&#x000a0;years old), play-based and non-competitive PA program (MOVI-KIDS). The aim of MOVI-KIDS was to increase the weekly PA time through three 60&#x000a0;min sessions/week in the school facilities. The program included basic sports games, playground games, dance and other activities focused on to develop motor skills. At the end of the first year, approximately 90-sessions were performed in each school.</p></list-item><list-item><label>ii)</label><p>Parents and teachers included in the IG were involved in actions to promote active lifestyles activities in children. These activities included the following: a) use of reinforcement tools that had demonstrated their utility on improving parents&#x02019; and teachers&#x02019; compliance and involvement in the program (i.e. a refrigerator magnet with recommendations for PA for children); b) answer a satisfaction with the program questionnaire; and c) access to the blog (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://movi3kids.blogspot.com.es/">http://movi3kids.blogspot.com.es/</ext-link>) where parents could observe their children&#x02019;s progress, read news reinforcing healthy lifestyles, and where parents could asking questions or making complaints to the research team.</p></list-item><list-item><label>iii)</label><p>Finally, environmental interventions were conducted in the schoolyards. Fixed (a balance circuit and panels with incentives to be physically active during recess) and mobile equipment (tyres of different colours and sizes) were put in the playgrounds to encourage children to be more active during playtime.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The standard physical education curriculum (one h/week of psychomotor activities to third year of pre-school children and two h/week of physical education to first grade of primary school children with physical activity levels at low-to-moderate intensity) continued to be taught in both the control and intervention schools because it is compulsory in Spain.</p><p>In the second year the CG became IG and the IG became the CG.</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Organisation and functioning of the MOVI-KIDS program</title><p>The MOVI-KIDS program has been coordinated by two Physical Activity Sciences graduates, and implemented by monitors with technical qualifications in PA and sports, Physical Education teachers, or Physical Activity Sciences graduates.

The MOVI-KIDS program was conducted in the school environment, and has several strong points. First, it is a program that takes into account the parents&#x02019; and teachers&#x02019; opinions and preferences without overburdening them. Second, it does not require any changes in the curriculum and includes innovative aspects in the physical structure of the schoolyard, because some studies suggest that painting the schoolyard with attractive colors and providing it with permanent or fixed equipment increases the time that children spend in moderate or vigorous PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Third, this program was designed according to the socio-ecological model paradigm, thus the inclusion of the main school&#x02019;s stakeholders (teachers, parents, school board) during the whole process of the program implementation might help circumvent the influence of some barriers for the PA that the qualitative research approach could identified. Finally, it seems judicious to think that the interventions aimed to improve adiposity levels in Spanish children should be mainly focused on the promotion of PA because of: i) the low physical fitness levels of the students; ii) it has been reported data suggesting that an excess of energy intake might not be necessarily the main driver of the obesity epidemic in Europe; iii) a diet intervention could increase the risk of thinness in children, and iv) an intervention based on playground games could improve other aspects such as quality of life, academic achievement, and quality and time of sleep. Thus, it seems necessary to assess the effectiveness of the interventions to prevent the overweight, in order to prevent the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of the future. Moreover, the timing when the adiposity rebound occurs might be, along with pregnancy and breastfeeding, one of the most important periods for preventing children and adolescent obesity, and the school is the most suitable place to develop these interventions.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CG</term><def><p>Control group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IG</term><def><p>Intervention group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SES</term><def><p>Parental socio-economic status</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contribution</bold></p><p>VMV and MSL designed the study.
