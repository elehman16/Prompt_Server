A 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the degree of pain. The Disability of Arm, Hand, and Shoulder (DASH) score was used to assess the functions of the upper extremity. To determine the range of motion, a universal goniometer was used to measure range of shoulder motion. Wilcoxon test was employed to examine differences in pain and function of the experimental group and the control group before and after the treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There were significant differences in function and pain of the experimental group (p&#x0003c;0.05). The therapeutic effect in the experimental and control groups revealed significant differences in flexion, abduction, VAS and the DASH (p&#x0003c; 0.05); respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The results of this study suggest that Throwers Ten (T10) exercise would be positively affected pain alleviation and functional recovery in shoulder impingement patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
