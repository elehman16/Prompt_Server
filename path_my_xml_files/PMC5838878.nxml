The secondary and the exploratory efficacy objectives were analyzed using the same mixed model as used for the primary analysis, with baseline and prior treatment as a covariate where appropriate, with the exception of time to onset of action which was analyzed using Murray&#x02019;s method for weighted Kaplan-Meier statistics for paired data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and proportion of patients achieving &#x02265;12% improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> which was analyzed using McNemar&#x02019;s test.

A sample size of 100 randomized patients (84 completers) was planned to provide 90% power (assuming a significance test at the 5% level, with no multiplicity adjustment). For each efficacy comparison, between and within patient variance components were assumed to have standard deviations (SDs) of 0.13&#x000a0;L; the SE of each comparison was calculated using a generalized least squares analysis which assumed spherical errors with no carry-over effects. The non-centrality parameter of the t-test was calculated assuming the SE from the generalized least squares analysis and a difference of 0.1&#x000a0;L (the minimally clinically significant difference, which is defined as the change in pre-dose FEV<sub>1</sub> that can be perceived by patients) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec10"><title>Study population</title><p id="Par57">A total of 133 patients were screened and 103 were randomized to receive study treatment (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).

These results, therefore, supported further evaluation of GP MDI at doses below 3.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g and no higher than 14.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID, which were explored in a study that investigated the dose-response of GP MDI 14.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 7.2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 3.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 1.9&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, 1.0&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, and 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID over 14&#x000a0;days and found that GP MDI 14.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g demonstrated the greatest efficacy versus placebo MDI, with no increase in the incidence of AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The findings from these Phase IIb studies added to the evidence that resulted in GP MDI 14.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID being selected as the optimal dose for investigation in the Phase III studies PINNACLE-1, PINNACLE-2, and PINNACLE-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par73">The findings of this study demonstrated the efficacy and safety of 7-day dosing with GP MDI 3.6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g to 28.8&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g BID for patients with moderate-to severe COPD. All doses of GP MDI in this study were well tolerated, and the most frequent TEAE observed (dry mouth) was a well-established AE associated with LAMA therapy. No unexpected safety findings were observed. The results further supported GP MDI 14.4&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for use in the Phase III clinical studies.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AE</term><def><p id="Par6">Adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ATS</term><def><p id="Par7">American Thoracic Society</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12</sub></term><def><p id="Par8">Area under the curve from 0 to 12&#x000a0;h</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BID</term><def><p id="Par9">Twice daily</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par10">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p id="Par11">Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p id="Par12">Computerized tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECG</term><def><p id="Par13">Electrocardiogram</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FDC</term><def><p id="Par14">Fixed-dose combination</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV<sub>1</sub></term><def><p id="Par15">Forced expiratory volume in 1&#x000a0;s</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FF</term><def><p id="Par16">Formoterol fumarate dihydrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FVC</term><def><p id="Par17">Forced vital capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GFF</term><def><p id="Par18">Glycopyrronium/formoterol fumarate dihydrate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GP</term><def><p id="Par19">Glycopyrronium</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HFA</term><def><p id="Par20">Hydrofluoroalkane</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IC</term><def><p id="Par21">Inspiratory capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ICS</term><def><p id="Par22">Inhaled corticosteroid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p id="Par23">Intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LABA</term><def><p id="Par24">Long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LAMA</term><def><p id="Par25">Long-acting muscarinic antagonist</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LSM</term><def><p id="Par26">Least squares mean</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDI</term><def><p id="Par27">metered dose inhaler</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>mITT</term><def><p id="Par28">Modified intent-to-treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEFR</term><def><p id="Par29">Peak expiratory flow rate</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p id="Par30">Per-protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QID</term><def><p id="Par31">Four times daily</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAE</term><def><p id="Par32">Serious adverse event</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p id="Par33">Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SE</term><def><p id="Par34">Standard error</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TEAE</term><def><p id="Par35">Treatment-emergent adverse event</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all the patients and their families, and the team of investigators, research nurses, and operations staff involved in this study.
