The age of onset of PsA is in the 30&#x02013;40s for men and women, an age at which many men and women would be in the midst of working careers. Additionally, two separate studies to identify issues of concern among PsA patients reported the reduced ability to work or volunteer<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and the reduced ability to fulfil personal roles, social life and work, as common concerns.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Reports from several studies of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor in PsA have suggested that these biologic agents can have a positive impact on productivity in PsA patients, improving employment status and work productivity compared to placebo.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> However, further research is required to better understand the impact of PsA and TNF inhibitor therapies on workplace productivity, as well as on daily activities within the household and participation in social or leisure activities.</p><p>The efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol (CZP), a PEGylated Fc-free anti-TNF agent, in PsA patients has been investigated and reported in the RAPID-PsA trial (NCT01087788).<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Here we report on the impact of CZP on productivity in paid and household work, and on participation in family, social and leisure activities, in patients with active PsA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>The RAPID-PsA trial (NCT01087788) randomised 409 patients aged 18&#x02005;years or older, with a diagnosis of adult-onset active PsA of &#x02265;6&#x02005;months&#x02019; duration as defined by the ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> All recruited patients had to have active psoriatic skin lesions or a documented history of psoriasis.

The first question addresses employment status and provides additional information on job type for employed patients (non-manual, manual with no supervisory duties, or mixed) and on the status of those not employed. For employed patients, three questions relate to paid work productivity outside the home. These questions assess over the past month: absenteeism (full days of work missed due to arthritis); presenteeism (days with work productivity reduced by &#x02265;50% due to arthritis); and the level of interference of arthritis on work productivity (on a 0&#x02013;10 scale; where 0=no interference and 10=complete interference).</p><p>All patients, regardless of their employment status, answer five questions which are related to household work and daily activities.

Cumulative productivity scores were derived for each individual treatment group by summing the productivity scores over the 24&#x02005;weeks of the double-blind phase, starting at week 4.

These findings are consistent with previous reports of severe work disability and loss of productivity in PsA patients,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> including studies that report a reduced ability to work or volunteer,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> or to fulfil work, personal and social lives.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Previous reports also suggest that patients with severe PsA may be forced into early retirement or unemployment due to an inability to perform physical work activities.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, compared with a large number of reports on the burden of RA on patient productivity, relatively little is known about the true negative impact of PsA on productivity. There is some evidence to suggest that the employment rate in PsA patients is higher than in the RA population, but significantly lower than that seen in the general population.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> However, age of onset of PsA is in the 30&#x02013;40s for men and women, an age at which many patients are in the midst of their working careers. Thus, the earlier onset of disease in PsA, compared with RA, could result in greater disability over the course of a PsA patient's working life and may impact significantly on career progression.</p><p>The financial burden of PsA is likely to be significant and includes both direct costs associated with the provision of healthcare, and indirect costs associated with loss of productivity, due to time off work for medical care, lost wages from time off, decreased productivity at work and unemployment due to disability.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Previous papers have reported large indirect economic costs associated with PsA in terms of costs associated with patients&#x02019; short-term absence from work, patients&#x02019; permanent work disability and caregivers&#x02019; short-term absence from work.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref> As the indirect costs attributed to lost productivity in the workplace and at home are major contributors to the economic burden of PsA, any improvements in productivity associated with CZP treatment will help reduce the economic burden of this chronic inflammatory disease.</p><p>In the RAPID-PsA study, CZP treatment resulted in rapid and substantial improvements in workplace and household productivity. Improved productivity at work and within the home was seen as early as week 4 and continued up to week 24. This included reduced absenteeism and presenteeism for employed patients in both CZP groups, compared with placebo. CZP treatment also resulted in improved productivity within the home, and fewer days of lost participation in family, social and leisure activities per month. These results, alongside clinical improvements seen over the first 24&#x02005;weeks of CZP treatment in PsA patients,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> indicate that CZP may be a valuable treatment option for PsA patients. Improvements in productivity may also contribute to the patients&#x02019; psychosocial well-being, enhancing these additional aspects of their health-related quality of life.</p><p>In line with the current PsA study, CZP plus methotrexate (MTX) has previously been shown to improve productivity in RA patients both outside and within the home. The combination therapy also resulted in greater participation in social activities compared with placebo plus MTX.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Other TNF inhibitors, namely etanercept, infliximab and golimumab, have also been shown to improve productivity in patients with active PsA.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> However, differences in the measures used to assess the impact of specific treatments on productivity make it difficult to compare between specific TNF inhibitors.</p><p>A limitation of the current report is that it only presents results up to week 24 of the RAPID-PsA trial. Consequently, longer-term results from this study or from real-life observational studies will be needed to confirm these initial findings. This is important as currently there is limited evidence from long-term observational studies in terms of the benefits of anti-TNFs on work disability in PsA.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Other limitations of the data reported here include the early withdrawal of some patients (prior to week 24) and use of LOCF methodologies to impute any missing data. Nevertheless, the data reveal a rapid effect of CZP treatment, with improvements seen within 4&#x02005;weeks of administration, in both CZP dosing regimens (CZP 200&#x02005;mg Q2W and CZP 400&#x02005;mg Q4W) across a broad spectrum of productivity-related concepts.</p><p>In summary, PsA had a significant burden on patient productivity at study baseline. The rapid improvements seen in CZP-treated patients in paid work productivity, household productivity and participation in family, social and leisure activities, alongside the clinical improvements seen, suggest that CZP is a potentially valuable treatment option for PsA patients. These beneficial effects with respect to PsA patients&#x02019; workplace and household productivity could ultimately result in gains in the quality of life and in the economic burden of this chronic inflammatory disease, particularly in those of working age.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Marine Champsaur, UCB Pharma, Brussels, Belgium for publication coordination and Costello Medical Consulting, UK, for writing and editorial assistance, which was funded by UCB Pharma.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors were involved in planning for the analysis of data, reviewed the primary data, reviewed and approved each draft of the manuscript including approval of the final version.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The RAPID-PsA study was funded by UCB Pharma.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests:</bold> AK has received research grants from Abbott, Amgen, BMS, Pfizer, Roche, Janssen, UCB Pharma.
