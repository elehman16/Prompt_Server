Theoretical accounts of cognitive control highlight anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a central node in this network. However, a better understanding of the relative primacy and functional contributions of these areas to decision conflict requires insight into the neural dynamics of successive processing stages including conflict detection, response selection and execution. Moderate alcohol intoxication impairs cognitive control as it interferes with the ability to inhibit dominant, prepotent responses when they are no longer correct. To examine the effects of moderate intoxication on successive processing stages during cognitive control, spatio-temporal changes in total event-related theta power were measured during Stroop-induced conflict. Healthy social drinkers served as their own controls by participating in both alcohol (0.6 g/kg ethanol for men, 0.55 g/kg women) and placebo conditions in a counterbalanced design. Anatomically-constrained magnetoencephalography (aMEG) approach was applied to complex power spectra for theta (4&#x02013;7 Hz) frequencies. The principal generator of event-related theta power to conflict was estimated to ACC, with contributions from fronto-parietal areas. The ACC was uniquely sensitive to conflict during both early conflict detection, and later response selection and execution stages. Alcohol attenuated theta power to conflict across successive processing stages, suggesting that alcohol-induced deficits in cognitive control may result from theta suppression in the executive network. Slower RTs were associated with attenuated theta power estimated to ACC, indicating that alcohol impairs motor preparation and execution subserved by the ACC. In addition to their relevance for the currently prevailing accounts of cognitive control, our results suggest that alcohol-induced impairment of top-down strategic processing underlies poor self-control and inability to refrain from drinking.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by funds from the National Institutes of Health (AA016624 and RR031599) and Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (MIND) Institute.

ACC, also termed rostral cingulate zone <xref rid="pone.0043957-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, seems to be the nexus of this distributed network and is particularly activated by conflict-inducing conditions that rely on controlled processing <xref rid="pone.0043957-Botvinick1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Procyk1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>Alcoholics and children at risk for developing alcoholism manifest reduced event-related theta power during cognitive tasks <xref rid="pone.0043957-Andrew1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Porjesz1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Rangaswamy1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Furthermore, both event-related theta power and alcohol dependence have been linked to the same alleles in genes coding for neurotransmitter receptors <xref rid="pone.0043957-Rangaswamy2" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Given this converging evidence, the scarcity of studies exploring effects of acute intoxication on event-related theta power is notable. In a study of auditory memory, Krause and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0043957-Krause1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> showed that event-related fm-theta is attenuated by a moderate alcohol dose.</p><p>A recent fMRI study <xref rid="pone.0043957-Marinkovic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> showed that moderate intoxication selectively attenuates ACC activation during high-conflict and error trials during the Stroop naming task, indicating vulnerability of regulatory, top-down functions to alcohol. However, the spatio-temporal characteristics of this effect remain unexplored. More specifically, it is not clear which processing stage is most affected by alcohol and what are the relative contributions of the ACC and the fronto-parietal distributed network under alcohol intoxication. It is possible that the ACC is primarily active during the early processing stage as it monitors for potential conflict <xref rid="pone.0043957-Botvinick1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. It may also contribute to response inhibition, selection, and execution <xref rid="pone.0043957-Marinkovic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Data analysis methods adapted to the time-sensitive signal allowed us to examine alcohol&#x02019;s effects on both, stimulus-related processing and response preparation stages. The aim of the present study was to use multimodal imaging to investigate the effects of a moderate alcohol dose on total event-related theta power during different stages of conflict processing elicited by the Stroop naming task in healthy participants. Better insight into the dynamics of relative contributions to successive processing stages is essential for the currently prevailing accounts of the specific roles that the ACC and fronto-parietal areas play during decision conflict. Furthermore, better understanding of alcohol&#x02019;s effects on regulatory functions may illuminate alcohol-induced dysregulation of self-control and inability to desist drinking, which can contribute to alcohol dependence <xref rid="pone.0043957-Fillmore1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Finn1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Lyvers1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Behavioral Measures</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Performance</title><p>The modified Stroop task successfully evoked interference effect as indicated by lower accuracy (F(1,19)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;40.8, p&#x0003c;0.0001 ) and longer reaction times (F(1,19)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;130.5, p&#x0003c;0.0001) to INCONG as compared to all other conditions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043957-g001">Fig. 1</xref>.

The main findings can be summarized as follows: 1) The Stroop task elicits event-related theta power in a fronto-parietal network with the primary generator estimated to ACC. 2) Event-related theta power is stronger during conflict trials (i.e. INCONG vs. CONG contrast) under placebo. 3) During the early time window, only the ACC is sensitive to decision conflict, confirming its role in conflict detection. During subsequent processing stages the ACC remains the principal generator of the conflict-related theta power. While alcohol attenuates event-related theta power overall, conflict-related theta is reduced selectively by alcohol in ACC and lateral fronto-parietal regions. 4) In the interval immediately preceding the motor response, the ACC is the only region showing differential theta to conflict, suggesting that it additionally contributes to response control. Alcohol decreases theta in ACC to high-conflict INCONG stimuli during motor preparation which correlates negatively with reaction times. Longer RTs are associated with decreased theta power under alcohol, indicating that alcohol impairs ACC&#x02019;s role in response preparation and execution under conflict conditions. 5) Results were pooled across both genders since men and women did not differ on any of the measures, in agreement with our previous fMRI study with the same task <xref rid="pone.0043957-Marinkovic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Overall, these results indicate that event-related theta power is reduced by moderate alcohol intoxication in ACC and fronto-parietal regions during conflict processing. Selective vulnerability of the top-down executive functions to alcohol may result in reduced self-restraint and propensity of engaging in continued or heavy drinking.</p><p>The anatomically-constrained distributed MEG approach applied in the current study estimated the principal generator of event-related theta oscillations to ACC, with other fronto-parietal areas additionally contributing to the signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043957-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).

Furthermore, theta power estimated to ACC correlated negatively with RTs under intoxication during the late time window encompassing response preparation. Slower RTs were associated with attenuated theta power in the ACC, suggesting that alcohol impairs motor preparation and execution subserved by the ACC. Therefore, ACC&#x02019;s selective sensitivity to conflict starting with the early processing stage and its role in motor preparation and execution on high-conflict trials, reveal its top-down regulative and executive role in goal-oriented actions under conflict <xref rid="pone.0043957-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Paus1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.

At this latency, conflict-related theta power was observed only in ACC under placebo and was blunted by alcohol, suggesting impairment of the early conflict detection stage as subserved by the ACC. Alcohol abolished conflict-related theta power increase in subsequent time windows particularly in the right ACC with superior prefrontal contributions, consistent with at least some evidence suggesting sensitivity of the right hemisphere to alcohol <xref rid="pone.0043957-OscarBerman1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. This finding is also compatible with results of our previous fMRI study employing the same paradigm and the same level of alcohol intoxication <xref rid="pone.0043957-Marinkovic1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. In that study, alcohol selectively attenuated BOLD activation in ACC during high-conflict trials and erroneous responses. These two neuroimaging methods rely on fundamentally different sources of signal: MEG/EEG signals reflect postsynaptic currents measured as magnetic fields and electric potentials <xref rid="pone.0043957-Hmlinen1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Nunez1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. In contrast, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal depends on hemodynamic changes, reflecting neural activity only indirectly as a result of neurovascular coupling <xref rid="pone.0043957-Buxton1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Due to its limited temporal resolution, the BOLD signal cannot resolve differential effects on successive processing stages. Furthermore, the BOLD is sensitive to alcohol&#x02019;s vasoactive properties and may not accurately represent the magnitude of the neural changes resulting from intoxication <xref rid="pone.0043957-Rickenbacher1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Iannetti1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>. Therefore, temporally sensitive methods are needed to verify alcohol&#x02019;s effects on the executive network. Nevertheless, both aMEG and BOLD-fMRI results concur in showing that alcohol intoxication attenuates conflict-induced activation in ACC. Overall, this convergence of results strongly indicates that regulative functions are particularly vulnerable to moderate alcohol intoxication. Indeed, a large number of neuroimaging studies suggest that ACC subserves top-down controlled processing <xref rid="pone.0043957-Ridderinkhof1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Bush1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref> in the sense of guiding behavior that is not habitual or automatic <xref rid="pone.0043957-Procyk1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The present aMEG results further refine and extend this overall conclusion by providing insight into the successive <italic>stages</italic> of processing with respect to stimulus presentation as well as response execution. While ACC is uniquely sensitive to conflict and it is the principal generator of theta during both early conflict detection, and late response preparation and execution stages, it is co-active with other fronto-parietal areas that also contribute to theta generation. Alcohol intoxication attenuates theta associated with conflict indicating that the controlled processing is susceptible to its effects during successive stages. Controlled processing, an aspect of executive functions, refers to the capacity to inhibit automatic responses in favor of relevant, previously unrehearsed responses <xref rid="pone.0043957-Posner1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Roelofs1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Raichle1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Its main function is to ensure that our actions can be flexibly modified in agreement with intents and goals <xref rid="pone.0043957-Lezak1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Results of the present study indicate that alcohol disrupts the top-down strategic processing of conflict, potentially resulting in increased susceptibility to immediate cues. Indeed, impaired self-regulation is considered important in the development of alcohol abuse.

However, superior temporal sensitivity of the aMEG method employed here further refined and extended these findings by providing insight into alcohol effects on conflict processing stages. The principal generator of conflict-related theta power was estimated to ACC, with contributions from distributed fronto-parietal areas. The ACC was uniquely sensitive to conflict during both early, conflict detection, and later stages reflecting response preparation and execution, suggesting a broader functional role of the ACC in decision conflict than proposed by major theoretical accounts <xref rid="pone.0043957-Botvinick1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043957-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.

Placebo and alcohol sessions were 32&#x000b1;26 days apart on average. Urine pregnancy test administered to women in the beginning of each session ascertained that none were pregnant. All subjects were asked about their compliance with requirement to abstain from food for 3 hours and from alcohol at least 48 hours prior to each experimental session. Breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) was measured with a breathalyzer (Draeger, Inc.) upon arrival and throughout the session when the subjects were outside the recording chamber.

The signals were recorded continuously with 600 Hz sampling rate and minimal filtering (0.1 to 200 Hz). The position of magnetic coils attached to the skull, the main fiduciary points such as the nose, nasion and preauricular points, as well as a large array of random points spread across the scalp were digitized with 3Space Isotrak II system for subsequent precise co-registration with structural MRI images. Trials with incorrect responses were excluded from all further analysis. In addition, the number of included trials was equated across beverage and task conditions for each subject in order to eliminate potential bias due to unequal number of trials. The MEG analysis stream primarily uses our custom Matlab functions and it relies partially on publicly available packages including FieldTrip <xref rid="pone.0043957-Oostenveld1" ref-type="bibr">[77]</xref>, EEGLAB <xref rid="pone.0043957-Delorme1" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>, and OpenMEEG <xref rid="pone.0043957-Gramfort1" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Single trial MEG data were low-pass filtered at 100 Hz and epoched in two different ways in order to gain insight into both stimulus-related processing and response preparation and execution stages. Data were epoched from &#x02212;500 ms to 1000 ms relative to each stimulus onset for the stimulus-locked analysis and from &#x02212;500 to 500 ms relative to each button press for the response-locked analysis. For each epoch, the data were downsampled by a factor of 2, linear trend was removed, and mean activity across the entire epoch was subtracted from each time point. Epoched data were then passed through automatic threshold rejection to remove trials that were contaminated with eye-blinks or other artifacts.

Complex power spectrum was calculated for each trial using convolution with complex Morlet wavelets <xref rid="pone.0043957-Lachaux1" ref-type="bibr">[82]</xref> in 1 Hz increments from 4 to 7 Hz, with a constant time resolution of 80 ms and frequency resolution of 2 Hz. Wavelet width varied from 2 to 4 cycles in the specified frequency range to ensure constant wavelet length of 500 ms for all frequencies in the theta band. The first and last 250 ms of each epoch were discarded to remove edge artifacts potentially resulting from wavelet analysis. Theta band power was plotted for each individual epoch to further visually inspect the wavelet results and reject additional artifact contaminated trials that had not been detected via the automatic threshold rejection procedure. Complex power spectra were downsampled by a factor of 4 and entered into inverse calculations resulting in 13 ms temporal sampling rate for the spatio-temporal power estimates. To estimate the noise covariance for calculation of the inverse and to prevent biasing the inverse solution against spontaneous brain oscillations, we used empty room data that were detrended and band-pass filtered between 3 and 50 Hz. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) equaling 5 <xref rid="pone.0043957-Lin1" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref> was used for scaling of the noise covariance matrix in calculation of the inverse operator. The identity matrix was used for noise-sensitivity normalization of the source-space solution. The noise-sensitivity normalized estimates of total source power were obtained at each location on the cortical surface at each frequency. For each subject, a map of total source power was calculated by averaging across theta band frequencies (4&#x02013;7 Hz) and across trials. Finally, total event-related theta power was baseline-corrected by subtracting the mean theta source power estimate in the 250 ms prestimulus period. Intersubject averages were created by morphing each subject&#x02019;s reconstructed surface onto an average representation after aligning their cortical sulcal-gyral patterns <xref rid="pone.0043957-Fischl2" ref-type="bibr">[83]</xref> and averaging individual source power estimates.</p><p>Region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was conducted to further examine possible interactions of the factors of beverage, task condition, and gender on event-related changes in theta power.
