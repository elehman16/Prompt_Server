The findings of this pilot study showed that all the evaluated concentrations and durations of quercetin application might succeed in recovering the bond strength back to normal prebleaching levels. The same also was seen for the delayed bonding and Vitamin C application, with no statistically detectable difference between the techniques. Since there is no study on quercetin effect (either in orthodontics or restorative dentistry etc.), we are limited to compare our findings with other methods of SBS recovery. Our findings in terms of the application of both quercetin and Vitamin C were in line with most of studies on orthodontic brackets. In orthodontics, Vitamin C application has been suggested as a successful method for reversing the deteriorating effect of bleaching on SBS, by Lai <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Bulut <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Kaya <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] G&#x000f6;k&#x000e7;e <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Lima <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Khsoravanifard <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and Yadav <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The only study failing to observe its proper effect was that of Sasaki <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In the present study, 10% Vitamin C was used for 10 min. Earlier studies have suggested different durations for Vitamin C to be effective. For example, according to Kaya <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] at least 1 h of Vitamin C application was needed, while according to Lima <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] only 1 min of VC application would suffice. We employed the duration used successfully by Khosravanifard <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and found it useful. The quercetin as well could be used for short durations of 5 or 10 min with similar efficacies. The mechanism responsible for SBS increase is likely to be the reduction of free oxygen radicals remaining after bleaching.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The oxygen inhibits polymerization of resin monomers and hence reduces the SBS.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Antioxidants reduce the amount of free oxygen radicals and allow proper polymerization of the bonding agent which accounts for the SBS increase.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>The findings of the present study in terms of the efficacy of delayed bonding was in line with the results of Bulut <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] who found both Vitamin C application and delayed bonding similarly effective in reversing the effect of bleaching, while was in contrast to the study of G&#x000f6;k&#x000e7;e <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] who reported that only Vitamin C application and not delayed bonding was useful in neutralizing the negative effect of bleaching. These differences can be due to various factors involved such as the duration of postbleaching delay, the concentration of the evaluated Vitamin C, or its application duration. Although delayed bonding might be efficient in many cases, it is slow and time-consuming (not to mention cost increasing), and hence is less favorable clinically.</p><p>In this study, the duration of quercetin application did not have a significant effect on its efficacy. It was in contrast to a study showing that the SBS increases proportional to the application period of Vitamin C.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The difference could be attributable to confounding factors in this study, as well as methodological differences. Our result showed marginally significant effects, which could become significant if the two compared application times had a greater contrast and/or if better control was present over latent variables in this setup. The effect of quercetin concentration on the other hand reached the level of significance. Since it was the first study of its kind, these concentrations were suggested by a pharmacologist. It is possible that higher concentrations of this flavonoid can have even faster and greater effects. Future studies are warranted to find the optimum concentration of quercetin.</p><p>There were some limitations in this study. The findings of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study cannot be necessarily generalized to other brands of the used materials and are also not completely representing clinical conditions. Nevertheless, we tried to improve the reliability of results by employing four different control groups (including different durations of application of the solvent of quercetin), three different treatments, and three durations of application of two different concentrations of quercetin as well as using artificial saliva at body temperature. Moreover, we used the ceiling of the controversial range of suggested values for acceptable bond strengths (6&#x02013;10 MPa[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) to improve the confidence in the positive results. In addition, incubation and thermocycling were performed as a standard procedure to simulate the oral environment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Bleaching can weaken the bond strength of orthodontic brackets below acceptable levels. Delaying the bracket bonding or 10 min of 10% Vitamin C application can recover the SBS. It was showed for the first time that these experimental concentrations of quercetin (0.1%, 0.5%, and 1%) were capable of improving the SBS to normal levels, regardless of the duration of application.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial Support and Sponsorship</title><p>This study was financially supported by Dental Materials Research Center of Babol University of Medical Sciences
