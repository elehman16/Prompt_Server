Receiving a genetic test result indicative of increased obesity risk is expected to result in prevention efforts by increasing risk perceptions, in line with protection motivation theories <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. However, it has also been argued that genetic information could lead to disengagement with health behavior change <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Receiving a lower-risk result may result in decreased risk perceptions and thus decreased motivation to prevent obesity. Furthermore, some evidence indicates that genetic information may lead to fatalism and diminish perceived control over disease development <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>Although several studies have examined the psychological impact of genetic test feedback for risk of obesity in individuals already struggling with weight control and found it effective for increasing intentions to lose weight <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, a recent Cochrane review failed to confirm any effect on behavior change <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. However, most studies in this review focused on gene feedback to aid smoking cessation. In addition, none has investigated the effects of genetic test feedback for intentions to prevent weight gain, although the prevention of ill health is one of the main expected benefits of returning genetic test feedback to healthy individuals <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>One period that has been associated with an increased risk of weight gain is the transition from high school to university <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Although anecdotal reports of weight gain of 15 lbs in the first year of university are prevalent (the so called &#x0201c;Freshman 15&#x0201d;), empirical evidence indicates that actual weight gain is likely closer to 5 lbs <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. However, because students commonly have low intentions to implement healthy behaviors <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, weight gained during this period may not be lost over time, leading to an increased proportion of young adults classified as overweight or obese <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><p>We were therefore interested in whether genetic feedback for one gene (<italic>FTO</italic>) that has been consistently associated with risk of weight gain <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, would increase readiness to control weight in a population of first year students, in line with the transtheoretical model of behavior change <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>.</p><sec><title>Study objectives</title><sec><title>Primary research objective</title><p>Evidence from earlier studies on genetic test feedback indicates that genetic test feedback can increase behavior change intentions regardless of the &#x0201c;actual&#x0201d; genetic test result, presumably because of its personalized nature <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>. The primary aim of the study was therefore to test the hypothesis that adding <italic>FTO</italic> genetic test feedback to simple weight control advice (Feedback and Advice, FA) would result in greater readiness to control weight in the intermediate-term (1 month later) compared with weight control advice alone (Advice only, AO).</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary research objectives</title><p>All secondary objectives were exploratory because the trial was not powered to detect significant differences.

We also explored whether lower-risk <italic>FTO</italic> feedback reduced readiness to control weight compared with not receiving any feedback, to address the concern about &#x0201c;complacency&#x0201d; raised in the literature <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p></list-item><list-item><p>(iii) To explore whether genetic test feedback increased adherence to weight control advice.

However, they were made aware of group allocation only at the point at which they received either gene feedback with the advice leaflet or only the advice leaflet, minimizing the risk of bias. Furthermore, all participants only knew they were taking part in a study about genes and eating behavior and that they would be randomized; therefore, self-report responses to the primary outcome should not have been influenced. The data collector was unblinded, but questionnaire data (including the primary outcome) were collected online, and not in the presence of any member of the research team, to minimize the risk of inadvertent data manipulation. Finally, because the first author (SFM) acted as both data collector and data analyst, she was unblinded, but a data analysis plan had been drawn up prior to data collection, and decisions to change this were made with the rest of the research team who were blinded, so this knowledge is unlikely to have affected the final analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Analyses were planned to be per protocol (completers only) because of the anticipated large amount of missing data previously reported in student samples <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.

As specified in the study protocol <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, participants who reported having been controlling their weight for more than 1 month were excluded from analyses (<italic>n</italic> = 104), because we were interested in the effect of <italic>FTO</italic> feedback in individuals who had not yet reached the maintenance stage of weight control. To assess effects of excluding these participants we conducted a sensitivity analysis with the full sample. No differences in results were observed (data not shown).</p><p>For the primary outcome, ordinal logistic regression (Polytomous Universal Model, PLUM) was used to assess the difference between &#x0201c;FA&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;AO&#x0201d; group in readiness to control weight. Results from secondary analyses were considered exploratory. All models included age, gender and weight status as covariates. Age was dichotomized into &#x0201c;younger&#x0201d; (18-20 years) and &#x0201c;older&#x0201d; (&#x02265;21) and weight status into &#x0201c;normal weight&#x0201d; (BMI &#x0003c; 25 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and &#x0201c;overweight/obese&#x0201d; (BMI &#x02265; 25 kg m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>). Differences in readiness to control weight by weight status were investigated by including the group &#x000d7; weight status interaction in the ordinal regression model.</p><p>To assess the effect of risk status on motivation to control weight by genotype, <italic>FTO</italic> status was dichotomized into higher/lower risk, with those having at least one risk allele being classified as higher risk in accordance with previous studies <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Ordinal regression analyses were used to examine effects of risk status on readiness to control weight by first comparing higher <italic>FTO</italic> risk and lower risk with controls and then comparing higher with lower risk. Age, gender, and baseline weight status were included as predictor variables in all models. To assess group differences in weight control behaviors, we built a mean score of the frequency of adherence to the tips included in the advice. Data were analyzed using ANCOVA including age, gender and weight status.

In line with our hypothesis, weight control advice in conjunction with <italic>FTO</italic> feedback successfully increased motivation more than weight control advice alone, and effects were stronger in those receiving a higher-risk result. Importantly, lower-risk <italic>FTO</italic> feedback did not decrease motivation to engage with weight control, with effects being equivalent to receiving no genetic test feedback. This finding matches those from the smoking cessation field <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and hints that complacency to lower-risk genetic test feedback for weight gain prevention may not be as much of a concern as has been thought. One reason may be that individuals may hold multifaceted causal explanations of weight gain, including both genetics and environmental factors <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, which may diminish any adverse impact of the genetic test result.</p><p>Genetic test feedback appeared to be especially effective in increasing readiness to prevent weight gain for individuals who were already overweight, perhaps because of greater perceived relevance of the test result. Alternatively, it is possible that genetic test feedback reduces self-blame and stigma, which has been posited as a barrier to weight control <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. Given that individuals did not enroll specifically in a weight control intervention, this is encouraging. However, the results have to be viewed with caution because only a small number of overweight/obese individuals returned for follow-up. Equally, although the intervention achieved modest effects on readiness to control weight, contrary to our secondary hypothesis, this did not translate into action, regardless of the gene test status. However, the results might plant a seed that could have effects in the future (e.g., if they gain weight). Long-term studies on the effects of genetic test feedback for common conditions are needed in this new field of research.</p><p>These findings add to the emerging literature on the effects of genetic test feedback as an aid for prevention and control of common, complex disorders. In contrast to earlier work focused on improving treatment adherence <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, the focus on prevention of weight gain in a community sample of young, healthy adults at university is novel. However, despite differences in context, our findings match earlier studies <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> in finding that genetic test feedback can affect behavior change intentions, shows no obvious adverse psychological effects, but has little or no effect on actual behavior change.</p><p>This study had a number of strengths. Despite high drop-out rates, it is one of the first trials to be powered to detect an effect of genetic test feedback on the outcome of interest. The study set-up provided a model for a possible &#x0201c;real world&#x0201d; scenario should genetic test feedback be introduced on a large scale to aid disease prevention, i.e., we chose a young, healthy population largely unaware of their genetic risk. The intervention could also be administered to a large sample without specific training, in a cost-effective manner (gene testing was priced at 1.50 pounds sterling per analysis), and without extensive staff resources.</p><p>It also had important limitations. Baseline weight control intentions were not assessed, so that no direct evidence of change in motivation as a result of genetic test feedback is available, only a between-group comparison (although groups were randomized). Although readiness to control weight was assessed with an established measure of stage of change, it comprised only a single item, which limits robustness of the findings. Future studies could explore the topic using more straightforward measures of motivation. Furthermore, since we were interested in the effect of <italic>FTO</italic> feedback on initiation of weight control, we had to exclude about a quarter of participants due to the chosen measure, although the sensitivity analysis indicated that effects were not significantly different when all participants were included. In addition, although the weight control leaflet was evidence-based, it had not been piloted specifically in the prevention context. The absence of a &#x0201c;no treatment&#x0201d; control group precluded any conclusion on whether the leaflet alone would be effective in behavior change, but that was not the focus of the study. Participants were not specifically encouraged to follow the tips in the leaflet because we were interested in whether genetic test feedback would be a sufficient prompt for initiating action without additional support. They may have engaged in alternative weight control behaviors not mentioned in the tips, but these were not assessed. Finally, the study suffered from high drop-out rates. Although this was anticipated, it nonetheless limits the generalizability of findings. Participants were more likely to enroll if they were normal weight and less likely to return for follow-up if they had a higher BMI at baseline, which limited opportunities for exploring effects of <italic>FTO</italic> test feedback in individuals who were already overweight.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides evidence that <italic>FTO</italic> genetic test feedback can successfully increase readiness to control weight in a young, healthy population in a situation with established risk of weight gain, but it found no evidence that it impacted actual behavior. However, importantly, it did not lessen weight control intentions or behaviors, suggesting that concerns about genetic determinism leading to disengagement from behavior change following obesity genetic testing may be unfounded.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank David Withers (Cambridge University, Institute of Metabolic Sciences, Cambridge, UK) for performing the DNA analysis.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Collins</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Has the revolution arrived?</article-title><source>Nature</source><year>2010</year><volume>464</volume><fpage>674</fpage><lpage>675</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20360716</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rosenstock</surname><given-names>IM</given-names></name><name><surname>Strecher</surname><given-names>VJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Social learning theory and the health belief model</article-title><source>Health Educ</source><year>1988</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>175</fpage><lpage>183</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Marteau</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinman</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Self-regulation and the behavioural response to DNA risk information: a theoretical analysis and framework for future research</article-title><source>Soc Sci Med</source><year>2006</year><volume>62</volume><fpage>1360</fpage><lpage>1368</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16162383</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Haga</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Khoury</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Burke</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Genomic profiling to promote a healthy lifestyle: not ready for prime time</article-title><source>Nat Genet</source><year>2003</year><volume>34</volume><fpage>347</fpage><lpage>350</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12923535</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shiloh</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Rashuk-Rosenthal</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Benyamini</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Illness causal attributions: an exploratory study of their structure and associations with other illness cognitions and perceptions of control</article-title><source>J Behav Med</source><year>2002</year><volume>25</volume><fpage>373</fpage><lpage>394</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12136498</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Senior</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Marteau</surname><given-names>TM</given-names></name><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Will genetic testing for predisposition for disease result in fatalism?.
