Sumatriptan powder administered with an innovative, closed-palate, Bi-Directional, Breath Powered intranasal delivery mechanism is efficiently absorbed across the nasal mucosa and produces fast absorption into the circulation. Results from a previously conducted placebo-controlled study of AVP-825 showed a high degree of headache relief with an early onset of action (eg, 74% AVP-825 vs 38% placebo device at 1 hour, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.01).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in adults with a history of migraine with or without aura, participants were randomized via computer-generated lists to AVP-825 or placebo device to treat a single migraine headache of moderate or severe intensity. The primary endpoint was headache relief (defined as reduction of headache pain intensity from severe or moderate migraine headache to mild or none) at 2 hours post-dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Two hundred and thirty patients (116 AVP-825 and 114 placebo device) were randomized, of whom 223 (112 and 111, respectively) experienced a qualifying migraine headache (their next migraine headache that reached moderate or severe intensity). A significantly greater proportion of AVP-825 patients reported headache relief at 2 hours post-dose compared with those using the placebo device (68% vs 45%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.002, odds ratio 2.53, 95% confidence interval [1.45, 4.42]). Between-group differences in headache relief were evident as early as 15 minutes, reached statistical significance at 30 minutes post-dose (42% vs 27%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.03), and were sustained at 24 hours (44% vs 24%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.002) and 48 hours (34% vs 20%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.01). Thirty-four percent of patients treated with AVP-825 were pain-free at 2 hours compared with 17% using the placebo device (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.008). More AVP-825 patients reported meaningful pain relief (patient interpretation) of migraine within 2 hours of treatment vs placebo device (70% vs 45%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.001), and fewer required rescue medication (37% vs 52%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.02). Total migraine freedom (patients with no headache, nausea, phonophobia, photophobia, or vomiting) reached significance following treatment with AVP-825 at 1 hour (19% vs 9%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.04). There were no serious adverse events (AEs), and no systemic AEs occurred in more than one patient. Chest pain or pressure was not reported, and only one patient taking AVP-825 reported mild paresthesia. No other triptan sensations were reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Targeted delivery of a low-dose of sumatriptan powder via a novel, closed-palate, Breath Powered, intranasal device (AVP-825) provided fast relief of moderate or severe migraine headache in adults that reached statistical significance over placebo by 30 minutes.

The swallowed portion of the dose is then subject to the same challenges of variable intestinal absorption associated with oral delivery. This &#x0201c;dual route&#x0201d; of absorption from standard liquid nasal-spray delivery is shown in pharmacokinetic (PK) studies of sumatriptan.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> A small peak in plasma concentration is observed at &#x0223c;20 minutes post-dose (nasal absorption), followed by a delayed peak at &#x0223c;90 minutes post-dose (intestinal absorption).</p><p>AVP-825 (formerly &#x0201c;OptiNose Sumatriptan&#x0201d;) is an investigational drug&#x02013;device combination containing sumatriptan powder that is being developed by Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., for the acute treatment of migraine with and without aura. It employs a novel closed-palate, Breath Powered intranasal drug-delivery system (OptiNose US, Inc., Yardley, PA, USA) designed to take advantage of specific features of nasal anatomy and physiology in order to overcome the deficiencies of conventional liquid nasal sprays. Closure of the soft palate and opening of the nasal valve during AVP-825 intranasal delivery of sumatriptan powder allows targeted deposition deep into and throughout the nasal cavity while helping to avoid sumatriptan deposition in the oropharynx or lungs.<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The device includes a mouthpiece for exhalation, connected to a device body, and a nosepiece, designed to seal the nasal opening to improve the extent and reproducibility of drug dosing.<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Exhalation into the device causes air flow resistance and positive air pressure in the oropharynx that naturally elevates the soft palate, separating the nasal and oral cavities. The shaped, sealing nosepiece redirects the exhaled air into the nasal cavity, without creating obstructive compression by soft tissues, to balance the pressure across the soft palate and gently expand the narrow, slit-like nasal passages, including the nasal valve. Under balanced pressure, a pathway located deep in the nasal cavity behind the nasal septum remains open between the two nostrils. With these dynamic circumstances, powdered drug particles emitted into the airflow enter via one nostril and are deposited deeply throughout the nasal cavity before the air delivering the particles exits through the other nostril (Bi-Directional delivery).<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Drug deposition studies in humans using radiolabeled lactose powder delivered using the closed-palate, Breath Powered device have demonstrated significantly greater delivery to the deeper nasal regions beyond the nasal valve, compared with radiolabeled liquid delivered with a conventional nasal spray-pump (Fig.&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Greater initial deposition to more superior and posterior regions of the nasal cavity beyond the nasal valve following Breath Powered delivery of powder is consistent with decreased anterior drip-out and less swallowed drug.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>Gamma camera image of deposition 2 minutes after delivery of a solution of <sup>99m</sup>TcO<sub>4</sub> in saline using a conventional liquid spray device (A) and <sup>99m</sup>Tc-labeled lactose powder delivered using the Breath Powered device (B).

Subjects were recruited from the clinics of investigators where they were receiving care, and in some instances via advertising or referral from other clinics. Eligible patients must have reported experiencing between 1 and 8 migraine headaches/month in the 12 months prior to screening and have verified airflow through both nostrils, ability to close the soft palate (eg, ability to inflate a balloon), and demonstrated ability to use the Breath Powered device.</p><p>Patients with hemiplegic or basilar migraine; a history or symptoms or signs of ischemic cardiac, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular syndromes; uncontrolled hypertension or seizures; or a history of headache of any kind &#x02265;15 days per month, were excluded.

Patients with known nasal obstruction due to severe nasal septum deviation, polyposis, severe mucosal swelling, or any other reason, current uncontrolled nasopharyngeal illness, or known velum insufficiency were also excluded. Moderate nasal congestion (eg, due to common cold or allergic rhinitis) was not a reason for exclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Protocol Approvals, Registrations, and Patient Consents</title><p>The TARGET study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, all relevant US federal regulations, and in compliance with the International Conference on Harmonization guideline for Good Clinical Practice. The study protocol, informed consent forms, and any other appropriate study-related documents were reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee at each center. Written informed consent was obtained from each patient prior to any protocol-related activities. All authors had full access to study data.</p><p>Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive web-based response system to either AVP-825 or placebo device. Randomization sequences were computer generated in blocks of four. The patients, investigators, sponsor, and staff involved in the clinical trial remained blinded during the conduct of the study. Randomization codes were maintained within the interactive web-based response system.</p><p>Following randomization, patients were instructed to treat their next migraine headache when it was moderate or severe in intensity (qualifying migraine). If a patient was unable to treat the first headache with study medication, the patient was instructed to treat the next one. To maintain study blinding, the placebo device was identical to AVP-825. Study medication was provided in disposable nose pieces containing capsules identical in appearance. The active treatment capsule contained an 11&#x02009;mg base equivalent (15.4&#x02009;mg of the succinate salt) of sumatriptan powder and the placebo capsule contained lactose powder. At the time of treatment, patients inserted one new nose piece onto the body of the Breath Powered device and administered the study medication or placebo into the nostril on the side of the headache. Following administration, the nosepiece was replaced with a new one and the contents of the second nosepiece were administered into the opposite nostril (total loaded dose of active treatment in the two nosepieces was 22-mg sumatriptan base equivalent). It should be noted that this dose has been reported as nominally 20&#x02009;mg in previous literature, which was based on <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of delivered dose.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Use of triptans (other than study drug) and other 5-HT<sub>1</sub> receptor agonists was prohibited from 48 hours prior to the use of study medication until 2 hours post-dose. The use of ergot medications, opioid analgesics, medications for migraine prophylaxis (unless the patient was on a stable dose for at least 30 days prior to the screening visit), monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, antipsychotics, and investigational study drugs was prohibited prior to the use of study medication and for 48 hours after administration. Patients who had taken any monoamine oxidase A inhibitors, antipsychotics, or investigational drug prior to screening were required to have a minimum washout period of 4 weeks. For patients whose migraine headache persisted or worsened after treatment, rescue medication (excluding ergot medications and opioids) was allowed starting 2 hours after treatment with study medication.</p><p>Patients recorded treatment time, efficacy assessments, and any rescue medication use in an electronic diary. Efficacy assessments were made immediately before study medication dosing (baseline) and at multiple time points up to 2 hours after administration and at 24 and 48 hours post-dose. Electronic diaries with time alerts were employed for recording of patient reported outcomes. Patients recorded the headache severity score (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no pain, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;mild pain, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate pain, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;severe pain), functional disability score (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no disability, able to function normally, 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;performance of daily activities mildly impaired, can still do everything but with difficulty, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;performance of daily activities moderately impaired, unable to do some things, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;performance of daily activities severely impaired, cannot do all or most things, bed rest may be necessary), and the presence or absence of the migraine-associated symptoms of nausea, phonophobia, photophobia, and vomiting. Achievement of meaningful pain relief based on individual patient interpretation was also recorded. The patient-reported data for the 2-hour assessment were captured prior to use of any rescue medication. Any patient not experiencing a qualifying headache within 8 weeks of randomization was withdrawn from the study. Patients returned for follow-up evaluations 48 hours to 7 days after treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>&#x02009;The primary efficacy endpoint for statistical hypothesis testing was the percentage of patients in each group with headache relief, defined as a reduction in headache intensity from moderate or severe (grade 2 or 3) to mild or none (grade 1 or 0) at 2 hours. Secondary endpoints included headache relief at other time points, pain freedom, relief of migraine-associated symptoms (ie, nausea, phonophobia, photophobia, and vomiting), clinical disability scale score, patient self-assessment of meaningful pain relief, rescue medication use, and maintenance of headache response (patients with headache relief at 2 hours who had no headache recurrence and no rescue medication use) at 24 and 48 hours post-dose. Additionally, maintenance of pain freedom (patients who were pain-free at 2 hours and had no recurrence and no rescue medication use) at 24 and 48 hours and total migraine freedom (no pain and no migraine-associated symptoms) at 2 hours were calculated post hoc. Safety assessments included AEs, laboratory variables (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), physical examination, vital signs, and ECG recording.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>&#x02009;Sample size calculations for this study were based on headache response data from a prior study with AVP-825.<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> It was assumed that 35.9% of placebo patients would report headache response at 2 hours.

A large fraction of AVP-825-treated patients (42%) reported headache relief by 30 minutes, with over two-thirds reporting relief at 2 hours post-dose, and over one-third of patients reported sustained headache relief at 48 hours, despite the low delivered dose. The 42% rate of response at 30 minutes, in particular, is substantial in the context of other commonly used triptans.<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> For sumatriptan, 30-minute pain-relief rates reported in previous clinical trials range from 10% to 20% of patients for high-dose (100&#x02009;mg) oral sumatriptan and from 20% to 30% of patients for the traditional sumatriptan liquid nasal spray (20&#x02009;mg).<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Notably, the 30-minute response rate for AVP-825 approached that reported in multiple studies with sumatriptan subcutaneous injection (&#x0223c;50% of patients).<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Despite the high response rate with AVP-825 at 30 minutes in this trial relative to results with other sumatriptan formulations, it must be kept in mind that direct comparisons of data across trials are difficult to interpret due to a number of factors, including differences in study design, patient population, and placebo response rates. In addition, it should be noted that statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons for secondary endpoints, including the non-primary time points for pain relief, were not made in this study.</p><p>The rapid onset of effect with AVP-825 seen in this study is consistent with the quick systemic absorption of sumatriptan powder delivered by the Breath Powered device.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The rapid systemic absorption is presumed to occur because the Breath Powered device delivers drug deep in nasal passages where the ciliated respiratory epithelium is richly vascularized.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Delivery of a powdered drug may offer advantages over liquid formulations that include increased stability, reduced need for excipients, and slower clearance from the ciliated regions of the mucosa.<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In addition, those regions of the nasal cavity are extensively innervated by the branches of the trigeminal nerve and also in part by the olfactory nerve.<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Therefore, it is possible that migraine relief observed with AVP-825 is also partially mediated by local effects at trigeminal nerve endings in the nasal mucosa<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> and direct transport of sumatriptan to brain (via olfactory and trigeminal nerves),<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> to the trigeminal ganglion,<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and to the pterygopalatine ganglion,<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> all of which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine. In addition, it is possible that sumatriptan action at serotonin receptors on the nerve could have a direct role in modulating migraine-associated inflammation.<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Other effects related to the device may also have a role in migraine relief. The air exhaled through the device delivers CO<sub>2</sub> deep into the nasal cavity and may provide an effect (discussed further later).<xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Whether any of these additional mechanisms contribute to the clinical effects of AVP-825 has not been determined and is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>In addition to providing rapid headache relief, AVP-825 demonstrated broad clinical benefit as shown by a consistent effect across other efficacy measures. &#x0201c;Meaningful pain relief,&#x0201d; a patient-reported outcome, provides a comprehensive, clinically relevant appraisal of treatment benefit and has been widely used in non-migraine pain studies.<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> A high proportion of patients in the AVP-825 treatment group in this study reported meaningful pain relief during the first 2 hours, a rate that is similar to the previous phase 2 study of AVP-825 for the treatment of migraine headache (70% in this trial vs 71% in the phase 2 study).<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The median time to meaningful pain relief was also significantly faster in the AVP-825 treatment group than in the placebo&#x02013;device group (48 minutes vs &#x0003e;&#x02009;120 minutes). Maintenance of headache relief and pain freedom data further support the clinical benefit of treatment with AVP-825, as significantly more patients who reported headache relief or pain freedom at 2 hours did not experience headache recurrence or use a rescue medication through 24 and 48 hours in the AVP-825 group than the placebo&#x02013;device group. Sustained efficacy is particularly notable in light of the low dose of sumatriptan delivered through AVP-825 (averaged emitted dose is 15-16&#x02009;mg), showing a delivery method that is very efficient. Further substantiating the clinical relevance of the treatment effect, AVP-825 significantly improved patient function on the clinical disability measure as early as 45 minutes post-dose.</p><p>Reductions in the percentage of patients experiencing migraine-associated symptoms of nausea, phonophobia, photophobia, and vomiting were numerically larger for AVP-825, but did not reach statistical significance over placebo at most time points nor at the 2-hour endpoint. Despite the lack of significance, overall reductions in the percentage of patients experiencing these symptoms appeared generally consistent with reductions seen in published migraine trials.<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Although this study was not powered to assess the effect on migraine-associated symptoms, this result was unexpected, particularly in the context of the robust and significant symptom-related response seen in the AVP-825 phase 2 study. The results could be a consequence of the combination of high placebo response for these symptoms coupled with the low baseline incidence of some symptoms, such as nausea. To further evaluate effects on migraine-associated symptoms, we conducted a post-hoc analysis to evaluate total migraine freedom, defined as no headache pain and no migraine-associated symptoms. Patients in the AVP-825 treatment group experienced improved total migraine freedom that was significant at 1 hour and approached the level of significance (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;.05) at the 2-hour time point. Collectively, these results demonstrate that AVP-825 22&#x02009;mg, using closed-palate Breath Powered technology to deliver a low dose (mean 15&#x02009;mg delivered) of sumatriptan powder, provides a high level of treatment efficacy that is rapid, clinically meaningful, and sustained over time.</p><p>The 2-hour response rates in the placebo group and the percentage achieving freedom from pain were greater than those typically observed in similar migraine trials.<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Response to placebo treatment is sensitive to several aspects of the experimental intervention, including patient expectation of benefit, investigator bias, characteristics of the disease among participants (eg, headache intensity), and, particularly important in this case, factors related to the intervention being tested, such as the use of a device.<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> It is also conceivable that patient expectations of relief were influenced by the use of a medication (sumatriptan) known to be effective for the treatment of migraine; in fact, 27% of patients in this trial had an ongoing prescription for sumatriptan. Additionally, there may be a higher expectation of success in patients treated with innovative devices or new formulations<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> as well as bias introduced from investigator expectations based on efficacy observed in the previous trial. For example, placebo response rates for headache relief at 2 hours of 42-46%, comparable to those observed in this study, were reported with the rapidly dissolving sumatriptan tablet<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and the oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonist, telcagepant.<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Another factor that could theoretically contribute to placebo (and potentially active drug) response may be related to neurochemical effects of CO<sub>2</sub> delivery and/or removal of NO at the trigeminal nerve endings within the nasal cavity. Since AVP-825 redirects exhaled air deep into the nasal cavity, it has an added advantage of broadly exposing deep intranasal structures innervated by the first branch of the trigeminal nerve to positive pressure and high airflow of exhaled air.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> The increased Bi-Directional airflow (in one nostril, out the other) may locally replace the elevated levels of NO found in this region with exhaled air containing 5-6% CO<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> NO is known to stimulate release of CGRP, a key mediator in the pathophysiology of migraine, whereas increases in local CO<sub>2</sub> concentration causes a decrease in pH that mediates intracellular reactions that ultimately inhibit CGRP release from the trigeminal neurons, which may be beneficial in migraine modulation.<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> In the context of this study, it is important to recognize that all patients used the Breath Powered device and any purely device-related benefits would have accrued to both the active and placebo treatment groups.</p><p>AVP-825 showed a favorable safety profile in this trial, with no serious AEs, and no atypical sensations (the so-called triptan effects) other than mild paresthesia reported by just one patient; there were no reports of chest, jaw, or neck tightness. Common AEs were limited to the site of administration, such as abnormal product taste and nasal discomfort, which were both generally mild and transient.</p><p>Despite the availability of multiple triptans with varied formulations, dissatisfaction with migraine treatment persists for many patients.<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Oral tablets, although commonly prescribed and easy to use, can provide relatively slow onset of relief and inconsistent treatment response owing to delayed intestinal absorption during migraine headache.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Swallowing tablets also may not be tolerated during migraine headaches associated with nausea or vomiting. Furthermore, a high tablet dosage relative to other routes of administration is required to overcome poor drug bioavailability, and higher overall drug exposure may increase risk for triptan-related AEs.<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Subcutaneous injection of sumatriptan offers the greatest speed and magnitude of headache relief; however, injections are inconvenient, painful to administer, and associated with a high frequency of both local and systemic side effects.<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Conventional intranasal methods of drug delivery were developed in an attempt to complement and address the shortcomings of other routes of delivery. However, liquid nasal sprays have achieved limited use, potentially in part because patients have not perceived clinically relevant advantages over oral products. Shortcomings of conventional liquid nasal-spray technology contribute to the difficulties in achieving the promise of nasal delivery. Conventional nasal-spray delivery is associated with variable loss of drug due to drip-out with nasal-spray devices, exacerbated by the broad plume delivered into the anterior non-ciliated region of the nasal cavity due to the physical barrier of the narrow nasal valve. Much of the drug dose with these conventional nasal sprays, as PK data show, is ultimately swallowed and subject to delayed and variable gastric emptying and intestinal absorption during a migraine headache.<xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The novel AVP-825 delivery system of sumatriptan powder can offer an important therapeutic and practical alternative for migraine treatment by efficiently delivering sumatriptan powder beyond the nasal valve to the highly absorptive surface of the nasal cavity and to cranial nerve structures potentially relevant for migraine therapy.</p><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>&#x02009;In this study, AVP-825 (using closed-palate Breath Powered delivery of low-dose sumatriptan powder) provided fast and sustained migraine relief, was well tolerated, and had a low rate of triptan-related AEs.
