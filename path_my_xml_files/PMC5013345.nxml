Strong analgesics, such as opioid analgesics, are recommended by clinical guidelines for people with acute low back pain or neck pain who are slow to recover and require more pain relief. Opioid analgesics are widely and increasingly used, but there are no strong efficacy data supporting the use of opioid analgesics for acute low back pain or neck pain. Concerns regarding opioid use are further heightened by the risks of adverse events, some of which can be serious (eg, dependency, misuse and overdose).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>OPAL is a randomised, placebo-controlled, triple-blinded trial that will investigate the judicious use of an opioid analgesic in 346 participants with acute low back pain and/or neck pain who are slow to recover. Participants will be recruited from general practice and randomised to receive the opioid analgesic (controlled release oxycodone plus naloxone up to 20&#x02005;mg per day) or placebo in addition to guideline-based care (eg, reassurance and advice of staying active) for up to 6&#x02005;weeks. Participants will be followed-up for 3&#x02005;months for effectiveness outcomes. The primary outcome will be pain severity. Secondary outcomes will include physical functioning and time to recovery. Medication-related adverse events will be assessed and a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted. We will additionally assess long-term use and risk of misuse of opioid analgesics for up to 12&#x02005;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethical approval has been obtained.

<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> There is also a high economic burden: the latest estimates show that low back pain and neck pain cost A$4.8 billion in healthcare costs and $8 billion in lost productivity per annum.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Clinical guidelines recommend that first-line care for people with acute low back pain or neck pain should consist of advice (patient reassurance, staying active and avoiding bed rest) and, if required, simple analgesics (paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs).<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> For people who do not respond to first-line care, guidelines recommend stronger analgesics such as an opioid analgesic, particularly if the pain is severe.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There is evidence that opioid analgesics are widely and increasingly used by patients and general practitioners for low back pain and neck pain. We found that 12% of participants surveyed reported using an opioid analgesic or opioid analgesic combination (eg, paracetamol plus codeine) as their first-choice medicine when self-managing low back pain.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This proportion increased to 28% for those with severe pain. We also found that opioid analgesics were prescribed for up to 19% of patients with low back pain or neck pain by general practitioners in Australia, and were second only to NSAIDs as the most prescribed medication.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Internationally there is a trend of increasing opioid consumption over the past decades.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Despite guideline recommendations and the widespread use of opioid analgesics, there is no rigorous evidence to support their use for acute low back pain and neck pain.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Although there is evidence suggesting that opioid analgesics may be effective in the short term for persistent low back pain,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> there are no randomised placebo-controlled trials evaluating the use of opioid analgesics for acute low back pain<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> or for acute or persistent neck pain.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Furthermore, evidence from persistent low back pain is not compelling due to methodological issues such as high drop-out rates and the use of enrichment designs where only those participants who responded and tolerated the medicine in the run-in phase were subsequently enrolled.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>The lack of efficacy data is alarming given the adverse events associated with opioid analgesics. The most common adverse events include nausea and constipation,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> but there are also concerns of more serious adverse events such as dependency, misuse and overdose.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Australian data suggest that hospital separations for opioid poisoning doubled between 2005&#x02013;2006 and 2006&#x02013;2007,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and there has been a multifold increase in drug overdose deaths in the USA in the last 15&#x02005;years, primarily driven by opioid analgesics.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Alarmingly, since 2003, more overdose deaths have involved opioid analgesics than heroin and cocaine combined.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Although some suggest that these serious adverse events are rare,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref> are primarily associated with long-term use and may have stabilised with respect to rate,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> there is no doubt that the use of opioid analgesics is a contentious issue globally.</p><p>We have designed the current trial to provide high-quality data to inform the use of opioid analgesics for treating acute low back pain or neck pain. The primary aim of the trial is to investigate whether taking a short course of an opioid analgesic, compared to placebo, will reduce pain severity over the 6-week treatment period in people with acute low back pain or neck pain who are slow to recover. The secondary aim is to investigate whether taking a short course of an opioid analgesic, compared to placebo, will improve other clinical outcomes, be tolerated, be cost-effective and not result in long-term opioid misuse.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>OPAL&#x02014;a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of opioid analgesia for the reduction of pain severity in people with acute spinal pain&#x02014;is a randomised, placebo-controlled, assessor-blinded, clinician-blinded and participant-blinded superiority trial, with two parallel groups randomised at a 1:1 allocation.

The success of participant blinding will be tested at the 6-week follow-up (end of treatment period) (see the &#x02018;Outcomes&#x02019; section).</p><p>To maintain the overall quality and rigor of the trial design, non-blinding of the blinded trial personnel would occur only in exceptional circumstances when knowledge of the actual treatment is absolutely essential for further management of the participant. The decision for this will be made in consultation with the clinicians involved in the participant's management (including the trial general practitioner) and the Steering Committee.</p><p>If non-blinding is deemed to be necessary, the trial team will facilitate contact between the clinicians involved in the participant's management and the independent statistician who generated the randomisation sequence, and care will be made to ensure that only the trial personnel involved in further management of the individual participant will be non-blinded. Non-blinding should not necessarily be a reason for trial discontinuation.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Data collection methods</title><p>Outcomes will be collected by a blinded research assistant via phone or directly completed by the participant online or by email. Research assistants will be trained to ensure data accuracy, consistency and completeness. For participants completing data assessment online, an email reminder will be sent prior to the due date, with a unique link to complete the data online. For participants completing data assessment by email, a blank assessment form will be provided, which can be emailed to the trial team upon completion. Additionally, at each participant visit, general practitioners will be asked to complete data on trial medication prescription and adverse events (if any, excluding the initial visit).</p><p>The trial team will make every reasonable effort to contact and complete follow-up of every participant, including those who discontinue the trial treatment prematurely or deviate from the protocol. Attempts will be made to ensure that all outcomes will be collected. At a minimum and only as a last resort, we will attempt to collect the primary outcome. Where possible, we will record the reason for loss to follow-up (eg, consent withdrawn).</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Data management</title><p>The integrity of data will be closely monitored for omissions and errors. Data collected by phone will be directly entered into a secure, custom-built database by the trial team at the time of data collection, with a prompt for the trial team to double check the accuracy of the primary outcome. Any inconsistencies will be explored and resolved. Data directly completed by participants online will be automatically transcribed into the database. If participants return data by email, the data will be entered into the database with a prompt to check the accuracy of data entry to the primary outcome. Each trial personnel will be able to access the database only with a personal login and password. Range checks and data validation will be built-in to promote data quality.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>Data analysis will be blinded, by intention-to-treat and guided by a detailed statistical analysis plan. Analysis and interpretation (also performed blinded) on the primary and key secondary outcomes will be conducted by the trial team and by an independent biostatistician and checked for accuracy. A p value of &#x0003c;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.</p><sec id="s2l1"><title>Primary analysis</title><p>Repeated-measure linear mixed models will be used to assess the effect of treatment group on pain severity over the 6-week treatment period using baseline pain as a covariate. Correlations between repeated measures (weeks 2, 4 and 6 assessments) will be modelled using a repeated effect.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> We will conduct sensitivity analyses with duration of current pain episode and site of pain, that is, low back or neck, as additional covariates. In case &#x0003e;10% of the primary outcome data are missing, multiple imputations will be used to conduct sensitivity analyses for the longitudinal linear mixed model of the primary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2l2"><title>Secondary analysis</title><p>For all continuous secondary outcomes measured at weeks 2, 4 and 6, repeated-measure linear mixed models will be used as per the primary analysis. Medium-term effects at week 12 on the primary outcome and all secondary continuous outcomes will be analysed using a linear mixed model with the baseline value included as a covariate. For the secondary outcome of time to recovery, the difference in survival curves will be assessed for the groups using the log-rank statistic. The median days to recovery will be used to express the time to recovery.</p><p>Adverse events will be categorised and the proportion of patients with adverse events overall and within each category will be compared between the two groups. Self-reported data will be used as the primary source of data and supported by data reported by the general practitioners.</p></sec><sec id="s2l3"><title>Cost-effectiveness analysis</title><p>Two analyses will be conducted if between-group differences are found in the primary analysis: (1) a cost-effectiveness analysis using pain severity as a measure of effectiveness and (2) a cost-utility analysis where health state utilities (quality-adjusted life-years or QALY) will be based on measures obtained from the SF-12 and transformed into utilities via the SF-6D algorithm. The primary analysis will be conducted from the health sector's perspective to assess the incremental cost per 1-point pain reduction or per QALY gained between the two treatment groups over 12&#x02005;weeks. To obtain costs, public health services will be valued at published standard rates (eg, the Medical Benefits Scheme standard fees, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme costs). Private non-medical health services (eg, physiotherapy) will be valued at published standard rates, if available, or as reported by participants.</p><p>A secondary analysis will entail a societal perspective in which costs associated with the use of community services (eg, exercise classes) and work absenteeism related to low back pain or neck pain will be included. Costs of community services will be based on the self-reported costs. Costs of absenteeism from paid employment will be estimated by the number of days absent from work multiplied by the average wage rate. Sensitivity analyses will test uncertainty in key parameters such as the selection of cost weights and statistical variation in quality-of-life scores.</p></sec><sec id="s2l4"><title>Analysis of long-term outcomes</title><p>Pain severity at 6 and 12&#x02005;months, and treatment usage and risk of opioid misuse at 3, 6 and 12&#x02005;months will be reported descriptively. Between-group differences in pain severity and opioid misuse at each time point will be compared using the t-test and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be convened with the main purpose being to monitor (serious) adverse events, in order to ensure the safety of participants. The frequency of DSMB meetings and the stopping rules will be defined a priori in a charter, in consultation with the DSMB members and Steering Committee. The DSMB will have access to non-blinded data, and data on the primary outcome, adverse events (after coding) and serious adverse events; however, there is no planned interim analysis on efficacy data.</p><p>The DSMB will make recommendations to the Steering Committee, who will be responsible for making the final decision on the recommendations. If appropriate, this will be performed in consultation with the ethics committee.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Harms</title><p>Harm or safety reporting will follow a standard operating procedure on clinical trial safety reporting established by the trial sponsor, The George Institute for Global Health, which defines serious adverse events as any untoward medical occurrence that

If there are differing opinions in relatedness or expectedness, we will take the most conservative opinions. Serious adverse events will be reported to the relevant bodies (eg, ethics committee, regulatory body) within the required timeline.</p></sec><sec id="s2o"><title>Auditing</title><p>No formal auditing is planned. However if required, independent auditing of core trial processes and documents will be arranged.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Consent or assent</title><p>Trial general practitioners will be trained on the informed consent process and will introduce the OPAL trial to potential participants who will also receive an information sheet and consent form. General practitioners, with support from the trial team if required, will also answer any questions that are raised by potential participants, and obtain written consent from those willing to participate in the trial. At any stage, participants can withdraw consent without repercussion.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Confidentiality</title><p>All data will be stored securely in either locked filing cabinets (paper files) or electronically (electronic database files) with access granted only to the trial team.

This will include cover for additional healthcare, compensation or damages.</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p>The main results will be submitted for publication in a scientific journal, and presented at relevant professional conferences. The results will also be disseminated to the media and general public. Authorship eligibility guidelines of publications arising from the OPAL trial will align with those outlined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.icmje.org/">http://www.icmje.org/</ext-link>). There are no plans to use professional writers. There are currently no plans to grant public access to the raw data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Low back pain and neck pain are among the most burdensome conditions globally, in terms of disease burden to the patient and economic burden to society. Despite the widespread and increasing use of opioid analgesics and guidelines endorsing their use, there remains a lack of reliable evidence on the efficacy of opioid analgesics in acute low back pain or neck pain. Concerns are also being raised because of the risks of adverse events associated with opioid analgesics and, with persistent use, more serious consequences such as overdose.</p><p>OPAL will be the world's first placebo-controlled trial of opioid analgesics in people with acute low back pain or neck pain and will provide rigorous evidence to inform the appropriate and judicious use of this medicine. We will establish whether using a short course of an opioid analgesic in people who are slow to recover from acute low back pain or neck pain can effectively reduce pain, improve other outcomes (eg, function), be reasonably tolerated and cost-effective, and have minimal risk of long-term misuse.</p><p>The strengths of the OPAL trial include that it is adequately powered and incorporates features that reduce bias, such as concealed allocation and blinding. Since the trial is delivered at the point of care, the results can be directly translated to clinical practice and inform clinical guidelines. The choice of modified release oxycodone plus naloxone as the opioid analgesic for the OPAL trial relates to the ease of dosing (two times per day) compared to the immediate release opioid preparations that need to be taken more frequently. The combination with naloxone is known to reduce the frequency and severity of opioid-induced constipation, which will be important for protecting the blinding of the OPAL trial. A weakness is that although we will monitor opioid misuse, we rely on self-report that can be prone to reporting bias. There are alternative sources, such as government prescription data or urine or blood samples, which may provide more objective data. However, after considering trial resources, the burden on participants, the recruitment of an acute population with a short-term prescription of opioid analgesics and the exclusion of those with a history or at high risk of addiction, drug abuse or alcoholism, we have decided to use self-report to capture such information.</p><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria have been kept as broad as possible, so the results can be applicable to the heterogeneous population that present to primary care with acute, non-specific spinal pain. OPAL is specifically designed to establish the effects of opioid analgesics in acute spinal pain. If the results show that opioid analgesics are indeed efficacious and well tolerated, future research can further investigate if factors such as patient prognostic characteristics, treatment expectation, medication dosage and the type of opioid analgesics used will influence treatment responsiveness.</p><p>We have chosen outcomes that are patient-oriented, clinically relevant and recommended by international consensus.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Since the trial intervention will be implemented over a short period of time for an acute condition where patients in general make an initial, rapid improvement,<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> we will collect outcomes frequently (every 2&#x02005;weeks) during the 6-week treatment period to assess treatment effects. We will also collect outcomes at 12&#x02005;weeks to assess whether treatment effects, if any, can be sustained in the medium term. While we do not expect that a short-term treatment will influence long-term clinical outcomes, we will collect our primary outcome at 6 and 12&#x02005;months, as well as long-term opioid use and misuse data, to inform our results. We anticipate that participant recruitment will start early 2016.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All authors conceived and refined the trial design and procured funding.
