The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY) approach in older adults. The overarching hypothesis is that using the Health TAPESTRY approach to achieve better integration of the health and social care systems into a person&#x02019;s life that centers on meeting a person&#x02019;s health goals and needs will result in optimal aging.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This is a 12-month delayed intervention pragmatic randomized controlled trial. The study will be performed in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada in the two-site McMaster Family Health Team. Participants will include 316 patients who are 70&#x000a0;years of age or older. Participants will be randomized to the Health TAPESTRY approach or control group. The Health TAPESTRY approach includes intentional, proactive conversations about a person&#x02019;s life and health goals and health risks and then initiation of congruent tailored interventions that support achievement of those goals and addressing of risks through (1) trained volunteers visiting clients in their homes to serve as a link between the primary care team and the client; (2) the use of novel technology including a personal health record from the home to link directly with the primary healthcare team; and (3) improved processes for connections, system navigation, and care delivery among interprofessional primary care teams, community service providers, and informal caregivers. The primary outcome will be the goal attainment scaling score. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy for managing chronic disease, quality of life, the participant perspective on their own aging, social support, access to health services, comprehensiveness of care, patient empowerment, patient-centeredness, caregiver strain, satisfaction with care, healthcare resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation processes will also be evaluated.

They are generally not well-coordinated and plagued with barriers to a person-focused care system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In Canada, current provincial healthcare systems are confronted with working to overcome disorganized connections among primary, secondary, and community care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and the use of processes that are reactive versus proactive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Further, the current system is challenged by the burden of provider-patient interactions focused on a single disease rather than approaches that account for people who have multiple chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Although the field of medicine has evolved over the years to focus on wellness versus illness, much change is still needed to take into account patient goals and preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Finally, the system lacks coordinated strategies that address the social determinants of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Transformational healthcare system change is needed if a person is to truly realize the World Health Organization&#x02019;s (WHO) definition of health, &#x0201c;a resource for everyday life, not the objective of living; it is a positive concept, emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as physical capacities&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Countries with a strong emphasis on primary healthcare have realized better health outcomes and health equity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Effective primary healthcare is community-based, promotes healthy lifestyles as a pathway to disease prevention, provides ongoing care for chronic conditions, and recognizes the importance of the broad determinants of health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Primary healthcare embraces a wide suite of services and involves a broad range of healthcare providers in a manner that is person-focused and coordinated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It has been identified that integrated care allows a person to plan their care with people who work together to understand them and their caregivers, allow them control, and bring together services to achieve outcomes of importance to them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A strong primary healthcare system also needs to be well integrated with the rest of the healthcare system. The WHO defines integrated care as the bringing together of inputs, delivery, management, and organization of services related to diagnosis, treatment, care, rehabilitation, and health promotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. High-quality integration encompasses better care delivery horizontally through improved interdisciplinary team collaboration and vertically across different levels of care such as in the home, primary, secondary, and tertiary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Taking into account complexity theory concepts when considering effective healthcare delivery also recognizes that delivery of healthcare itself is a complex adaptive system and, as such, changes according to current demands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, improving primary healthcare requires the many components of the healthcare system to undergo whole-scale transformational system change and to do so in a manner that produces person-focused coordinated care.</p><p id="Par7">Individuals &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years are the fastest growing age group in Canada.

Many older adults report being in excellent or very good health and are able to carry on daily activities on their own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]; however, it is also well recognized that age is associated with increased numbers of chronic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], which can lead to functional decline and increased use of the healthcare system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

Six core elements of the chronic care model were incorporated: healthcare organization and leadership, linkage to community resources, support of client self-management, coordinated delivery system design, clinical decision support, and clinical information systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A five-pronged approach has been used to develop the Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality (Health TAPESTRY) platform: (1) developmental evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], (2) participatory co-development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], (3) formal investigation of sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], (4) iterative pilot testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] including evaluation of implementation of the intervention, and (5) a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. The combination of approaches allows the team to explicitly record and gain progressive insight into key decisions made during development including those intended to foster sustainability and scalability, ensure the views of key players were incorporated, and allow for improvements to the intervention to be made and tested in an iterative manner before large scale evaluation.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Chronic care model and health TAPESTRY</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Element</th><th>Definition</th><th>Health TAPESTRY</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="2">Healthcare organization and leadership</td><td rowspan="2">Strong leadership, readiness for change, and effective incentives to systematically promote successful quality improvement interventions.</td><td>Health TAPESTRY creates time and space for clinic huddles to take place to discuss clients individually in an organically defined, interprofessional process through support from clinic leadership.</td></tr><tr><td>Clinic leadership supports integration of volunteers into the team and the adoption and use of e-health technologies</td></tr><tr><td>Linkage to community resources</td><td>Efficient use of community resources such as peer-support groups, community programs, and counselling to improve the quality of care and support offered to patients and improve cost-effectiveness in the system.</td><td>Health TAPESTRY offers linkages to community organizations through support of volunteers and directed healthcare provider referral or connection based on goals and needs oriented action plans.</td></tr><tr><td>Support of patient self-management</td><td>Patient empowerment, activation, and support of self-management skills to effectively sustain management of chronic conditions.</td><td>Health TAPESTRY volunteers serve as advocates for clients and encourage self-management through follow-up and discussion of client-identified health goals.

Specifically, Health TAPESTRY centers on meeting a person&#x02019;s health goals with the support of trained community volunteers, technology, an interprofessional team, system navigation, and community engagement. Healthcare volunteers have been shown to provide social support that is both physically and emotionally therapeutic to patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

It aims to remodel community-based primary healthcare to better reach people in their homes to intervene ahead of critical need. It aims to use accessible technology and a network of volunteers, to let clients self-direct and monitor their care, and make better connections to their healthcare team. It aims to break down barriers between people in their homes and community partners and healthcare teams. Any change in healthcare delivery necessitates rigorous evaluation to understand whether new processes generate the desired improvements. Multiple pilot tests have studied various components of the Health TAPESTRY platform to demonstrate feasibility and process improvements. This protocol describes the plans to rigorously evaluate the Health TAPESTRY community-based primary healthcare platform to understand whether it creates a positive difference in the achievement of their individual health goals or in how people experience the healthcare system.</p><p id="Par42">The study uses the GAS score as a primary outcome. The strength of the GAS process is that it applies well to the situations of multimorbidity because it inherently allows the outcome to be individualized to the patient&#x02019;s priority areas across their personal set of multimorbidities. It is also a person-focused measure because it only measures areas applicable to that particular person. The GAS process enables a patient and healthcare provider to work together to identify the patient&#x02019;s priority problem areas and to systematically set realistic goals around that particular problem area. It allows for the negotiation of realistic, observable, and objective goals that could be attained with changes in health management, and it measures whether goals have been met at pre-specified follow-up times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The process is congruent with individualized clinical care but also provides a framework to consider as a measurement approach because it can accommodate multiple, individualized goals, and can evaluate and compare change in an individual or group over a heterogenous set of areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The criteria for success of an intervention thus becomes the extent to which individual goals are achieved rather than the achievement of uniform criteria that are assessed for all patients receiving an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. This approach is similar to a disease-specific quality of life measure that allows individuals to choose the disease-specific criteria to be measured and allows individuals to describe their life in ways they consider important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].</p><p id="Par43">One of the main limitations of the GAS score is that if scores are too high then this could mean that the GAS scales developed were not challenging enough or if scores are too low then the scales may be too challenging. The proposed study overcomes this limitation by employing randomization to compare GAS scores between intervention and control groups and uses the same process of asking the patient to self-report changes from baseline to follow-up in both groups so as to minimize measurement bias.</p><p id="Par44">The proposed study is intentional in its interest in being a pragmatic trial. Pragmatic trials ask about effectiveness in a real-world, unrestricted setting of study. They do not ask about efficacy as in explanatory trials that are carried out under selected, often ideal circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref> describes the Health TAPESTRY older adult RCT assessed according to the PRECIS domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The majority of PRECIS elements are highly pragmatic. One key element following a pragmatic approach is to intentionally allow the interprofessional team to adapt and evolve over time to the participant and volunteer information coming to them compared to setting a fixed rigid process of care mapping to handle the information. This approach specifically aligns with the recognition and acceptance that in the real world the healthcare system epitomizes a complex system that is driven by features such as nonlinearity, emergence, adaptation, uncertainty, dynamical system change, and co-evolution with the need for clinic teams to continuously refine or change their approach over time based on context. It is important in pragmatic trials to also focus on factors influencing implementation of the intervention to support spread of effective interventions to other jurisdictions. Implementation evaluation will provide a rich understanding of the clinic processes so as to help interpret the comparative evaluation results with an understanding of how the implementation unfolds.<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Evaluation of the Health TAPESTRY in older adult RCT assessed according to the PRECIS domains</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>PRECIS domain</th><th>Element</th><th>Assessment of the Health TAPESTRY older adult RCT</th><th>Research team rating on scale 1 to 5 (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;least pragmatic to 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;most pragmatic)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Participants</td><td>Participant eligibility criteria</td><td>Sample is quite healthy&#x02014;intentionally left it open and not too targeted at people who are frail; included individuals along bus routes had to screen-out those people who volunteers could not physically access (i.e., long-term care facilities, hospices, along rural routes); had to screen-out individuals who could not speak English or did not have a caregiver who spoke English and willing to facilitate volunteer visits&#x02014;this was outside the volunteer program&#x02019;s capacity</td><td>4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">Interventions and expertise</td><td>Experimental intervention-flexibility</td><td>TAP-reports reviewed and action plan is developed for that particular person based on their individual self-report information so action plans are all different.

The initiative grew from the Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trials in Health Care (Practihc) project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.practihc.org">www.practihc.org</ext-link>), an initiative funded by Canada and the European Union to promote pragmatic trials in low- and middle-income countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The PRECIS elements that are relatively less pragmatic include the eligibility criteria of participants, follow-up intensity, and practitioner adherence to study protocol, although ratings still represent a highly pragmatic trial. Program reasons for logistical purposes (i.e., excluding people living in areas not easily accessible by bus) and for the collection of process and outcome research measures (i.e., strictly timed follow-up measurement of research outcomes and researchers recording field notes in intake team meetings) have contributed to the lower pragmatic ratings of these elements</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
</p><p id="Par45">The proposed study takes place within a family health team, which may limit its generalizability to other types of primary care settings. Health TAPESTRY has considered the challenge of applicability to other settings during development and has taken steps to assess the sustainability of the integrated care delivery platform and individual components. Formal assessment of sustainability considerations based on the NHS sustainability model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] has led to decisions and modifications of the intervention during pilot testing that better encourage sustainability and adaptability to other settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The proposed study has some notable limitations. The evaluation of the Health TAPESTRY platform is in a context with an established climate of collaboration among family healthcare team members with an open source PHR (KindredPHR) linked with an open source electronic medical chart (OSCAR) to facilitate care coordination thereby limiting the generalizability of the results to other clinical settings delivering primary care. However, the open source nature of the e-health ecosystem affords a higher level of opportunity for adoption by other communities. This study will evaluate the way in which elements of Health TAPESTRY can push those processes beyond their current state. Further, the choice to use the outcomes developed by the Canadian Institute of Health Information through the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Community-Based Primary Healthcare initiative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>] to assess the quality of primary care compared to other valid and reliable surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] may limit the findings. Findings from this study may contribute to the evaluation of the psychometric properties of these untested common indicators.</p><p id="Par47">Strengths of our proposed study include its design as a pragmatic RCT, the use of measures that help to understand the effects of the approach from multiple perspectives, the inclusion of a health economics component, and the use of mixed-methods to evaluate the approach. In addition, process and evaluation outcomes are incorporated. In doing so, a complete understanding of all the moving parts of Health TAPESTRY will be captured. Further, the study will engage all key players in the process of implementation, including the clients, volunteers, healthcare team, and researchers involved in the evaluation. Having each perspective will add to the richness of the data and experience throughout the study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec27"><p>
