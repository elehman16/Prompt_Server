The most severe patients often do not achieve a complete recovery of consciousness, evolving in a Vegetative State (VS) or in a Minimally Conscious State (MCS) [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The prevalence of disorders of consciousness (DOC) is around 0.2&#x02013;6.1/100000 inhabitants [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Considering the increasing number of survivors, the long and expensive hospitalization and the remaining functional disabilities, ABIs represent a relevant clinical and social problem [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>International guidelines support the indication to hospitalize brain injured patients in neurological intensive care units (NeuroICU), in order to better manage primary and secondary mechanisms of damage [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Furthermore, several authors emphasize the value of an integrated approach, in which both the acute care and the rehabilitative treatment are carried out at the same time under one interdisciplinary team [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, increasing evidence show that starting rehabilitation in NeuroICU is safe and feasible, helps to improve patients&#x02019; functional outcome and leads to a shorter hospitalization with lower costs [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. An early generic mobilization by a physiotherapist improves circulation, ventilation and muscle metabolism, leading to a reduction of physical deconditioning, ventilator dependence and risk of complications (e.g. bed rest syndrome, infections, pressure ulcers, osteoporosis, deep vein thrombosis) and to an improvement of arousal, functional communication and psychological profile [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, because of the lack of widely approved protocols, how and when patients with ABI should be mobilized out of bed is still controversial. Recently, the AVERT (A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial) investigators stated that a very early in-bed and out-of-bed mobilization of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke patients in Stroke Unit leads to a less favorable outcome. However, their very early rehabilitation was carried out in the first 24 hours from the event (in the acute unstable phase of the brain injury) and only five hours before the physiotherapy timing of the controls [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>Regarding DOC patients, one of the most important component of their mobilization is the positional change, possible by placing the patient on a tilt table. Verticalization stimulates several sensorial pathways and postural reactions, improves the level of arousal and awareness and is safe even if started in ICU [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The use of tilt table in patients with ABI was unfortunately often limited (and thus the verticalization delayed) by the occurrence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope, due to blood pooling in the lower limbs [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The breakthrough was when in 2004 Czell et al demonstrated how, in normal subjects, a greater hemodynamic stability during tilt table could be achieved by applying passive stepping or cycling movements to the legs [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this field of research, Luther and coll. studied the effects of a tilt table with an integrated robotic stepping device in patients with VS or MCS after &#x0003e;30 days from the brain injury. The authors showed that, compared to a conventional tilt table, patients treated with this robotic-stepping tilt table experienced syncope episodes with a lower incidence [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In a recent paper, our group demonstrated the feasibility and safety of the very early use of a tilt table with stepping device in NeuroICU patients with DOC due to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Patients started the stepping verticalization protocol (30-minute daily sessions, five days per week for three consecutive weeks) at 12.7&#x000b1;8.7 days from the event; none of them experienced either dangerous hemodynamics variations or adverse events [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Same results were obtained in patients with DOC after cerebrovascular accident (personal data).</p><p>Aim of the present study is to examine if a very early stepping verticalization protocol, compared with conventional in-bed mobilization in ICU, leads to a greater functional and neurological improvement in patients with VS and MCS after severe ABI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>This is a parallel-group, single-center, single-blind randomized clinical trial, carried out in the Intensive Care Unit of &#x02018;Moriggia-Pelascini&#x02019; Hospital, Gravedona ed Uniti (CO), Italy, by a multidisciplinary team composed of Anesthesiologists, Neurologists, a Physiatrist, Physiotherapists and Nurses.

The protocol consisted of single daily sessions of verticalization, using a tilt table with an integrated robotic stepping device (Erigo. Hocoma AG, Switzerland) located in the ICU room. The upper body of the patient was secured to the table by fastening the chest and the shoulders with a harness. The feet were strapped to the two footplates and the distal thighs secured to the stepping device. Legs stepping movements were passively obtained with the rhythmic alternating pushing up of the feet, and controlled by a computer [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. After patient positioning, the slope of the tilt table was gradually increased from 0&#x000b0; to 20&#x000b0;, 40&#x000b0; and then 60&#x000b0; in a time span of nine minutes. The stepping frequency was set at 20 steps/min for the entire treatment. Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters were continuously monitored. The net time of the session was 30 minutes, excluding the time required to transfer the patient and set the machine. Sessions were performed with the supervision of a physiotherapist; an ICU nurse was always present in the room, while the intensive care physician was available in case of emergency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158030.s005">S1 Video</xref>). Sessions were performed five times per week (Monday-Friday) for three consecutive weeks (a total of 15 sessions per patient) [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. On the same days the patients received conventional physiotherapy for 30 minutes a day. Before the verticalization period the experimental group received conventional in-bed physiotherapy for 60 minutes a day.</p><p>Four conditions were defined as criteria for verticalization session interruption: mean arterial pressure &#x02264;70 mmHg, heart rate &#x02264;40 or &#x02265;150 bpm, oxygen saturation &#x02264;90% and traumatic dislodgement of a device (tracheal cannula, venous or arterial catheter, bladder catheter). Changes in inclusion/exclusion criteria during the course of the treatment were criteria for treatment interruption. More severe adverse events, as neurological worsening or myocardial infarction, were conditions determining withdrawal from the study.</p><p>Controls were treated with conventional in-bed physiotherapy (mobilization exercises in supine and sitting position on bed, without out-of-bed mobilization nor verticalization) for 60 minutes a day, from Monday to Friday, throughout the ICU stay.</p><p>Patients of both groups received an individualized best medical therapy depending on the evolution of their comorbidities throughout their hospitalization and started brain stimulating drugs only after Neurorehabilitation admission.</p><p>Patients of both groups were moved from ICU to our Neurorehabilitation clinic once they reached a general and neurological clinical stability; in addition, patients of the experimental group could be moved only after completion of the stepping verticalization protocol. During their Neurorehabilitation stay, patients of both groups received specialized nursing care and an individualized rehabilitative treatment composed of conventional physiotherapy, robotics (including stepping verticalization sessions), devices weaning, speech/swallowing therapy, cognitive therapy and the best medical treatment, without differences between groups. Stepping verticalization sessions with Erigo during the Neurorehabilitation phase were administered to patients of both groups 3 times/week until they achieved the ability to move to a more complex robotic treatment. The length of stay in our Neurorehabilitation department for DOC patients is set at a maximum of 6 months. Hence, the last discharge from Neurorehabilitation was in November 2015.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>We collected data about age, sex, etiology of the ABI, vascular risk factors and site of the main brain damage.

The scores for each scale were assessed from a blinded investigator on the third day from the injury (T0), at ICU discharge (T1) and at Rehabilitation discharge (T2). We then calculated for each score the following differences: T1-T0, T2-T1 and T2-T0, in order to evaluate the size of the neurological improvement for each patient and to define the short-term (at T1) and long-term (at T2) outcomes in the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size computation was not feasible since neither measures of standard error measurement (SEM) nor measures of the Minimally Clinically Important Difference were available for the outcome measures of our study [ref: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rehabmeasures.org/">http://www.rehabmeasures.org</ext-link>].

Seven patients in the experimental group and seven in the control group had a length of stay in Neurorehabilitation shorter than 100 days, due to good outcome (5 in both groups) or to patient transfer or family reasons (2 in both groups).

Four studies in the literature already showed that patients&#x02019; verticalization with a tilt table is able to induce an improvement on the level of consciousness. Elliott et al. assessed, using the Wessex Head Injury Matrix, the behavior of 12 VS and MCS patients while lying in bed and during a 20-minute period of standing with a standard tilt table. They attested consistent improvements in the highest ranked behavior and total number of behaviors in the standing position [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Riberholt et al. studied the effects of verticalization with a normal tilt table in 16 patients with VS/MCS within the first 3 months from injury. Despite the majority of patients needed to interrupt the sessions because of the occurrence of orthostatic intolerance, the authors observed an increased level of arousal (time with eyes open) in the upright position when compared to the supine one [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In comparison to the two abovementioned reports, that evaluate only the effect of single sessions of verticalization, our present study helps to give clinical implication to the previous findings, integrating the procedure into the rehabilitative treatment of DOC patients in ICU (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158030.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158030.g003">3</xref>). With the same purpose, Toccolini et al. treated 23 mechanically ventilated patients with daily sessions of gradual verticalization with a standard tilt table in ICU. The patients showed a significant improvement of GCS and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores during tilting between the beginning and the end of treatment [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, Krewer et al. compared the effects of 10 sessions of verticalization over 3 weeks with a standard tilt table or a tilt table with an integrated stepping device on CRSr scores of VS/MCS patients. They enrolled 50 patients between 1 to 6 months from injury and assessed the CRSr scores at baseline, after the 3 weeks of treatment and after 3 weeks of follow up and showed a better recovery with the standard tilt table [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The essential difference of our protocol lies in the verticalization timing (within the first month from the injury), in the use of a tilt table with integrated robotic stepping device in the rehabilitative treatment in comparison to standard physiotherapy alone and in the follow up timing (average of 4 months after the completion of the protocol).</p><fig id="pone.0158030.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0158030.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>&#x0201c;Erigo&#x0201d; setting in the ICU room.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0158030.g002"/></fig><fig id="pone.0158030.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0158030.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><title>Stepping verticalization treatment in ICU.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0158030.g003"/></fig><p>Our patients were selected if diagnosed as VS or MCS on the third day after the ABI to be sure of the presence of a severe DOC. The similarity of the two groups according to sex, etiology, site of the main brain damage, comorbidities, LCF, DRS and CRSr scores at admission and number of deaths during the hospitalization makes the samples homogeneous. However, we found that the control group was significantly older (as a consequence, it was more affected by hypertension) while the experimental group had a lower GCS score at admission. Both older age and lower GCS scores at admission were previously reported to be independent predictors of a less favorable outcome in TBI patients [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>According to the well-known adverse events [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and considering the acute phase of the brain injury, we decided not to create a group of patients treated with a standard tilt-table. Our safety and feasibility study has already shown that the stepping verticalization of unconscious patients after TBI, even before the complete stabilization of the medical and neurological clinical state, is safe and feasible in ICU [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The present study confirms the same findings, but it broadens its research to all types of ABIs: patients started the treatment after 12.4 &#x000b1; 7.3 days from the event, and none experienced orthostatic intolerance. Orthostatic hypotension was probably limited by: i) the precocity of the intervention, thus the shortness of the head-down bed rest, not enough to alter the autonomic and endocrine functions [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], ii) the rhythmic stepping movement of the lower limbs, able to lower the cardiovascular parameters fluctuation and the consequent risk of syncope in standing position [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>Our results point out that at the end of the ICU stay (short-term outcome) both groups showed a significant improvement in all the tested scales (GCS, DRS, CRSr, LCF). However, when compared to the standard physiotherapy care, the early stepping verticalization was able to improve the CRSr score in a greater way. The DRS improvement was also higher in the experimental group, but without reaching statistical significance. On the other hand, GCS and LCF changes were not different, probably because of their lower sensitivity in the neurological assessment.</p><p>The following hospitalization in Neurorehabilitation was effective in giving an additional improvement of all the parameters in both groups, without any significant difference between groups. In this period, all patients received the individualized best rehabilitative treatment that our department can offer, without any differentiation in groups. At discharge from the Neurorehabilitation we observed in the experimental group a greater number of patients reaching the CRS-r maximum score. This &#x0201c;high responders&#x0201d;, compared to patients with lower CRSr scores at T2, showed in both groups a younger age, a lower incidence of hypertension and higher CRSr scores at T0 (data not shown).The global improvement (between the first evaluation in ICU and the end of the Neurorehabilitation stay) of the scores was significant for both groups. Nevertheless, we observed better long-term results in the experimental group, with significant higher improvement of CRSr and DRS and non-significant higher improvement of GCS and LCF. Therefore we can affirm that, considering the absence of a difference between groups in the improvement obtained in the Neurorehabillitation phase, the initial gain obtained by the experimental group in the ICU phase from the stepping-verticalization treatment was kept until the discharge from the Neurorehabilitation Unit (an average of 4 months follow up).</p><p>Patients in the experimental group showed a significantly longer length of stay in ICU (13 days on average). This is due to their necessity to complete the stepping verticalization protocol before being moved to the Neurorehabilitation Unit. Considering the duration of the protocol (3 weeks) and its beginning between the 3rd and the 30th day from the event, it happened that patients of the experimental group stayed in ICU long after the achievement of their clinical stability (main criterion for ICU discharge in both groups). Even though this might have partly contributed to the better short-term outcome in the experimental group, the overall rehabilitation time did not significantly differ, and should not have influenced the long-term outcome.</p><p>The better improvement in the experimental group may be explained by sensorial stimulation due to orthostatic position: orthostatism could indeed activate the proprioceptive, tactile, and vestibular pathways in comatose patients, leading to an increased cortical activation [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Another mechanism contributing to the neurological improvement after head-up tilt could be the lowering of ICP. Postural changes are known to alter the ICP, by redistributing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the craniospinal space [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and modifying the venous outflow (thus the cerebral blood volume) through the valveless jugular veins [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, head elevation in trauma patients was reported to be dangerous because of a marked decrease of mean arterial pressure (MAP), if not balanced by the activation of the cerebral autoregulation mechanisms, with consequent reduction in CPP [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. On the other hand, a study performed with transcranial Doppler on patients with cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage did not show any significant change in cerebral blood flow (CBF) after gradual head of bed elevation to 45&#x000b0; [<xref rid="pone.0158030.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, our positive findings on the long-term outcome support the use of a tilt table with robotic stepping device in the context of an early rehabilitative program of DOC patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>This study has some limitations worthy of being addressed.</p><p>A study about the efficacy of a very early treatment on patients in the acute phase of an ABI, whose clinical evolution is highly variable before reaching a stability of the DOC, is always limited by the possible occurrence of an unverifiable spontaneous improvement. However, in our case, the use of a randomized trial reduced the power of this bias and increased the reliability of the results.</p><p>The same clinical variability, together with the study design, limited the homogeneity of the length of stay in ICU and in Neurorehabilitation unit between the two groups. Nevertheless, as discussed before, this did not affect the total time frame nor the consequent significance of the long term results.</p><p>The sample size was rather small, suggesting that our study might be better considered as a pilot trial. Indeed, the trends observed in the outcome variables, which in some cases could not be substantiated by statistical significance, foster the planning of large multicenter studies.Another limit was the absence of an ICP, CPP or CBF assessment during the sessions. However, exclusion criteria for our protocol were the presence of unstable ICP and a low CPP before starting the treatment. Considering that our patient did not develop secondary brain damages (e.g. new ischemic lesions) and significant MAP changes during and after the treatment, we can reasonably exclude a deterioration of the cerebral perfusion. Future studies about the trend of the abovementioned parameters during stepping verticalization would then be useful to clarify the mechanism of neurological improvement in DOC patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study shows as an intensive stepping verticalization protocol, started since the acute stages of a severe ABI, improves the short-term and, more convincingly, long-term functional and neurological outcome of patients with DOC. We therefore propose the use of a tilt table with robotic stepping device for the rehabilitation of this group of patients since the first days of hospitalization in ICU, upon the reaching of hemodynamic, respiratory and intracranial stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158030.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158030.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158030.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Patients data for statistical analysis.</title><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158030.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158030.s003"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Original Protocol, Italian language.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158030.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158030.s004"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>English summary.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0158030.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0158030.s005"><label>S1 Video</label><caption><title>Stepping verticalization procedure in ICU.</title><p>The video shows a 30-minute session of stepping verticalization of a patient in vegetative state.
