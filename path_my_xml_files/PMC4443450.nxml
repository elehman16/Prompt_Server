Conventional management of clinically suspected scaphoid fractures is cast immobilization for 2 weeks and then reassessment. Early MRI is a diagnostic alternative. We compared the cost and usefulness of the early MRI diagnostic strategy with that of conventional management.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p> This prospective pseudo-randomized study included patients between 18 and 49 years of age who attended Bergen Accident and Emergency Department, Bergen, Norway during 1 year in 2009&#x02013;2010, after sustaining an acute wrist trauma in the previous week and with a clinically suspected scaphoid fracture. 61 patients were investigated with acute MRI, while 63 patients received standard treatment as a control group. We used cost-minimization analysis to estimate the cost of the 2 patient groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p> Concerning cost, there were no statistically significant differences in the total direct medical costs or in indirect costs between the groups. Concerning usefulness, patients in the MRI group without a fracture (n = 35) used a cast for fewer days (mean 1 day) than patients in the control group with no fractures (n = 52) (mean 14 days; p &#x0003c; 0.001). They had less than half the number of days on sick leave than patients in the control group (mean 7 days vs. 15 days; p = 0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation</title><p> In a Norwegian setting, an early MRI was of value in patients with clinically suspected scaphoid fracture and normal plain radiographs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Initial plain radiographs have a sensitivity of 65&#x02013;93% for scaphoid fractures.

Conventional management of occult scaphoid fractures involves a temporary wrist cast, and a review in approximately 2 weeks for repeated clinical and radiographic assessment. Previous studies have shown that only 20% of patients treated with cast immobilization for clinically suspected scaphoid fractures&#x02014;who initially have negative radiographs&#x02014;are finally diagnosed with scaphoid fractures. Thus, 4 in 5 patients are immobilized unnecessarily (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al. 1997</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dorsay et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brydie et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">Pillai and Jain. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Jenkins et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>Acute MRI of wrist and hand injuries has become an increasingly better tool for diagnosing or ruling out injuries that are otherwise often missed or over-treated (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Hunter et al. 1997</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brydie et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Khalid et al. 2010</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">McCullough et al. 2011</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bergh et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">Jorgsholm et al. 2013</xref>).

Furthermore, direct and indirect costs vary between countries, different healthcare systems, and different institutional settings. National studies are therefore important in order to find out the relevance for a particular country.</p><p>We estimated and compared the direct, indirect, and overall costs of a diagnostic strategy involving early MRI and of the traditional conservative management in the treatment of clinically suspected scaphoid fractures with normal plain radiographs in a Norwegian setting. We also compared the benefits and disadvantages of the 2 diagnostic strategies for the patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="ss1"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>This prospective study was conducted at Bergen Accident and Emergency (A&#x00026;E) Department, Norway from November 5, 2009 to November 4, 2010. Bergen A&#x00026;E is an outpatient clinic that treats almost all minor injuries in Bergen, which is the second largest city in Norway. Annually, 100,000 patients attend the A&#x00026;E, 40,000 of whom are injured.</p><p>Patients aged 18&#x02013;49 years who attended the A&#x00026;E within a week after sustaining an acute wrist trauma requiring radiographic examination were assessed for eligibility in the study.

We constructed a clinical scaphoid score (CSS) by grading and adding the results of these tests: tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox with the wrist in ulnar deviation, tenderness over the scaphoid tubercle with the wrist slightly extended, and pain upon longitudinal compression of the thumb (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">Bergh et al. 2014</xref>). The CSS is therefore a sum of the findings from these examinations. Both the clinical examination and the interpretation of the X-rays were done by the doctors on call at the A&#x00026;E, as part of their daily clinical practice.</p><sec id="ss2"><title>Selection and randomization</title><p>This study was part of a larger project looking into different aspects of wrist injuries (n = 198) (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">Bergh et al. 2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This leg of the study included 125 patients with clinical suspicion of a scaphoid fracture with a CSS of &#x02265; 3 and with normal plain radiographs. At the design stage of the study, CSS &#x02265; 3 was hypothesized to be an appropriate level for suspicion of a scaphoid fracture. Every other day for the entire study period, patients were allocated to 2 different groups based on diagnostic strategy&#x02014;the early MRI group or the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

They were treated according to the MRI results. The patients in the control group received conventional treatment with a below-elbow scaphoid cast for 2 weeks, after which they had a follow-up consultation with a repeat clinical examination, investigation, and treatment as with standard practice. Half of the patients in the control group had scaphoid fracture ruled out by clinical examination, with or without repeat radiographs after 2 weeks.

The cost perspective in this Norwegian study corresponds to the expenses for the National Social Security, including healthcare provider costs and sick leave benefits combined with the expenses for employers when employees are on sick leave.</p><p>We chose a time frame that would be sufficient to capture all major health and economic consequences, including both intended effects and unintended side effects. All the records at the A&#x00026;E Department were reviewed 2 years after the inclusion of patients was completed. We also obtained sick leave data from the Norwegian Labor and Welfare Service (Ny arbeids- og velferdsforvaltning, NAV) from the start of the study until 6 months after inclusion was completed.</p><p>The direct and indirect costs were calculated for each patient in each group. Cost analysis was performed by comparing the cost of management of patients in the groups. We also calculated the costs for subgroups of patients within the groups: patients with scaphoid fractures, patients with all types of wrist fractures, and patients without fractures.</p></sec><sec id="ss6"><title>Direct costs</title><p>Direct costs included costs for consultations, radiographs, MRIs, plasters, and bandages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Table 3</xref>, see supplementary data). Information about each direct cost in 2010 (in Norwegian kroner (NOK)) was obtained from the Norwegian Health Economics Administration (HELFO; Helse&#x000f8;konomiforvaltningen) and from the Norwegian Directorate of Health (Helsedirektoratet). Patients&#x02019; co-payment was a part of the treatment-activities costs.</p></sec><sec id="ss7"><title>Indirect costs</title><p>Sick leave including self-certification was used as a measure of indirect costs. The employer covers 100% of an employee&#x02019;s income from day 1 to 16 of the sick-leave period. The Norwegian Labor and Welfare Service (NAV) gives compensation for all loss of income up to 6 &#x000d7; G for the rest of the first year, where G is the Norwegian public pension base rate (on May 1, 2010, it was 9,600 euros).</p><p>We recorded whether patients were employees or self-employed, and their type of work. The patient&#x02019;s type of work was divided into 3 categories: blue-collar, white-collar, and other.</p><p>We calculated the number of days of sick leave for each patient using data from our own records and from the NAV. The NAV has all the data on the sick-leave period from day 17.</p><p>We also received information from medical certificates issued by general practitioners or other medical specialists. If the patient had a partial or graded sick leave over a certain period of time, we converted this to the equivalent number of whole days on sick leave. We assumed that employees worked full-time, if nothing else was stated in the medical records. We chose not to differentiate the wages according to occupation, but used an average salary for all employees in order to be able to generalize from a relatively small group of patients. The cost analysis would otherwise be very sensitive to those few patients with either a very high salary or a very low salary.</p><p>According to Statistics Norway (SSB), we calculated the average cost of sick leave per day to be 242 euros in 2010, which corresponds to an average daily personal income including payroll tax of 14%.</p></sec><sec id="ss8"><title>Statistics</title><p>Results for continuous variables are given as mean values with 95% confidence intervals.

The difference in total costs between the MRI group and the control group was therefore marginal. The direct costs accounted for 15% of the overall cost and the indirect costs accounted for 85% of the overall cost.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="ss17"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="ss18"><title>Usefulness, strengths and limitations</title><p>In this prospective pseudo-randomized controlled trial of adults with clinically suspected scaphoid fractures, patients who received early MRI used a cast for fewer days when any type of wrist fracture was ruled out than the control group (1 day as opposed to 14 days). This difference is in agreement with findings in earlier studies (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Brydie et al. 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al. 2009</xref>). Mean length of time for a definite diagnosis was 1 day in patients in the MRI group and 18 days for the patients in the control group who underwent MRI. About half of the patients in the control group (n = 32) had few clinical symptoms at the reassessment after 2 weeks, and were therefore discharged without MRI. Other studies have shown a similar reduction in the time until final diagnosis by using early MRI (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al. 2005</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">Raby 2001</xref>).</p><p>It could be considered a weakness of the present work that the examination procedure took the form of a pseudo-randomized controlled study rather than a blind, randomized controlled study. The patients included followed one of 2 different diagnostic strategies depending on the day of presentation. This procedure was found to be the most practical to follow in our busy accident and emergency unit. The doctor in charge knew which diagnostic strategy group the patient was allocated to (early MRI or control), but could not move the patient to the other group. We therefore consider the risk of selection bias to be small.</p><p>Another weakness of our study is that we do not know with certainty the number of occult fractures or soft tissue injuries that were present in the control group. About half of the patients in this group (n = 32) had few clinical symptoms at the reassessment after 2 weeks. MRI was therefore not requested, but theoretically, an occult wrist fracture could have become partially asymptomatic after 2 weeks of immobilization in a plaster. We checked all relevant medical records at our accident and emergency unit up to 2 years after the inclusion of patients was complete. Only 1 patient returned with signs of continued pain in the wrist. A volar wrist ganglion was diagnosed by MRI and probably caused his symptoms. This indicates that there was identical clinical outcome in these 2 groups.</p><p>The strength of our prospective study was that all patients were examined in a standardized manner with the 3 most commonly used clinical tests to identify scaphoid fractures.</p><p>Patients in the MRI group without any fracture had less than half the number of days of sick leave than patients in the control group with no fractures. Other studies have also found a reduction in time absent from work when using subacute MRI (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al. 2009</xref>), but this has been contradicted by others (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al. 2005</xref>). Blue-collar patients had more days of sick leave than white-collar patients, as has been found in other studies (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Vinnars et al. 2007</xref>). Of the 11 patients in our study who were diagnosed with scaphoid fractures, 5 were given a sick leave certificate and 3 were not. Other studies have also found that some patients go to work in spite of their immobilized and cast scaphoid fracture (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">van der Molen et al. 1999</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fusetti 2003</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Vinnars et al. 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ss19"><title>Costs</title><p>Our choice of using cost-minimization analysis required that the clinical endpoint after the 2 different diagnostic strategies should be identical. Our clinical endpoint was that the fracture was healed and the patient had returned to work. An indication that this assumption is correct was that none of the patients in the 2 groups were on sick leave for longer than 2 months after their acute wrist injury. None of the patients returned to our accident and emergency unit with a late-discovered scaphoid fracture during the 2 years that followed. The principle of this cost analysis could be transferred to other countries. However, direct costs, sick-leave rules, and possible payment of expenses from the insurance companies will vary from country to country. The effect of different direct activity costs can be estimated. In our model, it is possible to use a one-way sensitive analysis of one specific parameter (e.g. MRI) to access the impact of the output of the model.</p></sec><sec id="ss20"><title>Direct costs</title><p>Despite the relatively high cost of MRI, our overall estimation of direct costs in all patients was similar in the 2 groups. This was contrary to what we had assumed. Conventional treatment was only marginally cost-saving regarding direct costs, which is in agreement with other studies (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gooding et al. 2004</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al. 2005</xref>) yet contrasts with another study that found that the mean cost of management was marginally lower with early MRI management (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Patel et al. 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, when we compared the average direct costs for detection and treatment of one occult scaphoid fracture, the cost was less in the MRI group (4,308 euros) than in the control group (6,999 euros). Moreover, the average direct medical cost per occult fracture was less than half in the MRI group than in the control group when the analysis was extended to diagnosing any wrist fracture, which is supported by other authors (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Gooding et al. 2004</xref>). This difference in costs for identification of occult fractures was probably caused by the fact that early MRI identifies more fractures and that some fractures may have been missed in the control group. More importantly, we do not know the significance of these undiscovered fractures, but in our study none of the patients returned during the subsequent 2-year period with signs of avascular necrosis, non-union, or other complications. This calculation is further complicated by the fact that a higher proportion of patients with known fractures in the MRI group would result in higher costs due to the fracture treatment. The question is really whether this cost is &#x0201c;unnecessary&#x0201d;, as the patient actually receives a complete diagnosis and treatment as opposed to follow-up consultations, further reviews, and possibly subsequent investigations. In recent years, the cost of MRI has decreased in Norway. This has resulted in more frequent use of MRI at an early stage. The next development in the years to come will probably be a small, dedicated extremity scanner suitable for wrist examination, preferably located at the accident and emergency unit, which would be even cheaper and more time-saving than a conventional whole-body scanner with a wrist coil as used in the present study (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Dorsay et al. 2001</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">Khalid et al. 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ss21"><title>Indirect costs</title><p>No statistically significant difference in indirect costs was found between the 2 groups. Patients in the MRI group who were employed, and who did not have any type of wrist fracture, had less than half the indirect costs of patients in the control group. This reflects that with early exclusion of pathology with MRI, the patient can be discharged and return to work. We found that the indirect costs for employees who were on sick leave represented 85% of the overall cost. This is in accordance with another study where the indirect cost accounted for 90% of the overall cost (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Fusetti 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="ss22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>By means of cost-minimization analysis, we found only a marginal difference in overall costs between the 2 groups of patients: one with early MRI for suspected occult scaphoid fracture and the other group following a conventional diagnostic strategy. However, from the point of view of usefulness, we found that patients receiving early MRI&#x02014;which ruled out wrist fracture&#x02014;had substantially fewer days in a cast unnecessarily and spent less than half the number of days on sick leave.</p></sec><sec id="ss23"><title>Supplementary data</title><p>
