Opioids given intraoperatively as well as post-operatively could play a significant part in post-operative pulmonary morbidity. On one side, post-operative pain ranges from mild to moderate and for a short period of less than 24 h in laparoscopic surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] On the other side, opioids may not be highly effective in alleviating such pain without causing much sedation, and impending rapid recovery and early mobilization.

PCA as a convenient regimen for pain management is gaining worldwide popularity in current clinical practice. Various adjunct drugs, including, antiemetic,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] three pure opioid-antagonist,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] opioid agonist&#x02013;antagonist, and Ketamine have been used in such a multimodal effort.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The present study was carried out to explore the value of non-opioid general anesthesia in morbidly obese patients. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of giving general anesthesia without the use of any opioids either systemic or intraperitoneal in bariatric surgery, we compared a narcotic free technique with a fentanyl infusion that has previously been shown to be effective in this population[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and were concerned that a higher dose carried an excessive risk of post-operative respiratory depression in morbidly obese patients. To eliminate the possibility of bias, the study was randomized controlled and the method of randomization was true one using the computer generated table. Moreover, the investigators were blinded to the interventions. This ensures high quality of the work carried out. As morbidly obese patients with BMI &#x0003e;50 is not common, the number of participants was limited to 30 patients. Because of the nature of the procedure, there was no drop out cases in this study.</p><p>In the present study, there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding their background characteristics. This demonstrates proper randomization and adequate adherence to the protocol. There was also no difference between different outcomes except for the patient satisfaction and nurse satisfaction, where is there was a trend for better satisfaction in the non-opioid group, but did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Our results matches with other investigators who found concern over opioid-related side-effects limited morphine administration in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and were likely to have caused under-treatment of post-operative pain. Sedated patients in pain in the PACU were likely to have had poor pain control for at least the first 24 post-operative hours, and less likely to be satisfied with the overall pain care provided during the first 24 post-operative hours.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Other investigators found results similar to ours, but reached statistical significance where they observed that dexmedetomidine treatment during open gastric bypass surgery decreased blood pressure, heart rate, and desflurane anesthetic requirement during surgery and decreased pain level and morphine use in the PACU compared with fentanyl. The decrease in morphine use in dexmedetomidine-treated patients may be important for attenuating the risk of narcotic-induced post-operative respiratory depression and hypoxemia in patients after open gastric bypass surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, non-opioid based general anesthesia for bariatric surgery is as effective as opioid one. There is no need to use opioids for such surgery, especially that there was a trend to less pain in non-opioid anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr"
