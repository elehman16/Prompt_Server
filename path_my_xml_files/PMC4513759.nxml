Dentifrices have different components, such as detergents, fluoride, therapeutic ingredients, flavors, and abrasives. Among the abrasives, the most common are calcium carbonate and silica.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> These abrasives have an important role in cleaning teeth, removing bacteria and stains from the tooth surface. However, the dentifrice should promote optimal tooth surface cleaning with minimal abrasion,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> since dentifrices with high amounts of abrasives can damage hard tissue, soft tissue and restorations, causing gingival recession, cervical abrasion, and dentin hypersensitivity.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Currently, patients increasingly value esthetic and seek simplified and safe results for their oral problems.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Thus, the composite resins have been widely used in restorative treatments. However, it should be considered that the success and longevity of these restorations are related to the material, the dentist, and the patient.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The patients are responsible to care for their dietary habits, preventive measures, availability of fluoride, and oral hygiene since carious lesions have been the most common cause of direct composite resin restorations replacements.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Studies have been conducted to evaluate the surface roughness of composite resins caused by the abrasivity of some dentifrices. Amaral <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> evaluated the action of abrasive dentifrices on esthetic restorative materials after simulated toothbrushing cycles. The researchers found a significant difference between the abrasivity of dentifrices, but not among the composite resins. The dentifrices that used silica and carbonate were less abrasive compared to the ones containing bicarbonate. Liljeborg <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> assessed the acrylic surface roughness caused by different values of relative dentin abrasivity (RDA), which is the abrasivity characteristic of dentifrices provided by the manufacturer. In this study, an association was analyzed between the value of RDA, provided by the manufacturer, with the surface roughness (Ra) found for each dentifrice after simulated toothbrushing. Surprisingly, the correlation between RDA and Ra value was too low. Dentifrice with low RDA (40) showed higher Ra (5.73 &#x000b5;m), while the other with high RDA (130) obtained Ra of 1.84 &#x000b5;m; a third dentifrice with the lowest value of RDA (30) showed a Ra value of 1.13 &#x000b5;m.</p><p>A large supply of new dentifrices has been available on the market nowadays, which makes the choice more difficult for patients. Furthermore, the speed of production has surpassed independent studies without ties to manufacturers.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>Concerned about the integrity of composite resin restorations from the abrasivity of dentifrices available, this study aims to answer the following questions: (a) does toothbrushing with dentifrice change the surface roughness of composite resins? (b) is the surface roughness the same, regardless of the type of dentifrice or composite resin evaluated? Therefore, the aim of the study was to evaluate, <italic>in</italic>
<italic>vitro</italic>, the surface roughness of two composite resins submitted to simulated toothbrushing with three different dentifrices in periods of 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years. The null hypothesis is that toothbrushing with dentifrices does not influence the surface roughness of composite resins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Selection of composite resin specimens</title><p>The composite resins Empress Direct (Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) and Z350 XT (3M/ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA), enamel shade A1, were selected.

The matrix was positioned on a glass plate and filled with composite resin. A polyester strip was then placed on the composite resin followed by a glass plate in order to obtain a flat surface. The composite resin was then light-cured with the light-emitting diode light unit Radii-cal (SDI, Australia) for 20 s at a distance of 1 mm from the surface of the specimen. The composite resin surface in contact with the polyester strip received the toothbrushing with dentifrices.

Utility wax was applied to fix the specimens. Each plate was placed in an acrylic tank, which was attached to the brushing machine by metal pins. The acrylic tank was filled with a mixture composed of 1 g of dentifrice paste per 1 ml of distilled water. Soft bristle Classic Colgate (Colgate-Palmolive, S&#x000e3;o Bernardo do Campo, SP, Brazil) toothbrushes were used, with a load of 200 g. The speed of brushing was 250 cycles per minute, carried out in 5,000 cycles, 10,000 cycles, and 20,000 cycles of simulated toothbrushing, cumulatively, that corresponds to approximately 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months of brushing,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> respectively. The dentifrice pastes and toothbrushes were changed every cycle.</p><p>After every brushing cycle, the specimens were washed in running water and ultrasonically cleaned in distilled water for 10 min, followed by drying with compressed air. The roughness of the surface was measured again.</p><p>The surface roughness reading was perpendicular to the brushing direction of the toothbrush bristles. For the correct positioning of the specimen in the brushing machine and to always ensure readability in the same direction (perpendicular to the brushing), a mark with a diamond bur and high-speed handpiece was made on the border of each specimen.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Analysis by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)</title><p>From each of the composite resins, 12 additional specimens were obtained, as previously described.

The specimens were dried in dehumidifier with silica gel for 72 h, metallized with gold (Balzers, Liechtenstein) and observed under a scanning electron microscope (JSM 6060, Eindhoven, Netherlands) at &#x000d7;4,000 magnification for qualitative analysis of the surface.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The values of surface roughness were submitted to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test.

The toothbrush abrasion, however, has been an important phenomenon in regards to wear of composite resins, which is most commonly seen on the buccal surface.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Hence, the marketing of various dentifrices, the abrasivity of three different dentifrices was evaluated in this study: CT12, containing silica; CS Pro-Relief, composed of calcium carbonate and bicarbonate; OBW, based on silica and titanium dioxide.</p><p>The dentifrice factor was significant and directly influenced the surface roughness results, rejecting the null hypothesis. This finding concurs with other studies that found that the action of toothbrushing associated with the use of abrasive dentifrices has been responsible for an increase on surface roughness of composite resins.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>The lowest surface roughness mean was obtained with the dentifrice CT12 (0.269 &#x000b5;m), confirming Barbieri <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> study that the same dentifrice was responsible for a low abrasion of composite resins analyzed. The CT12 contains silica as an abrasive agent that exhibits low abrasivity.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Amaral <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> study concluded that dentifrices based on silica or calcium carbonate are less abrasive than those containing sodium bicarbonate. This possibly justifies the fact that the dentifrice CS, which has bicarbonate in the composition, caused a higher surface roughness compared to CT12, although no statistical difference was found.</p><p>The dentifrice OBW showed the highest Ra (0.390 &#x000b5;m) mean, different from CT12. This result corroborates the findings of Amaral <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and Barbieri <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, in which the whitening dentifrices also results in higher surface roughness both containing silica abrasives in combination with other agents. The study of Menezes <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> found a significant difference in Ra caused by whitening dentifrices on bovine root dentin, stating that the change of Ra depends on the dentifrice used.</p><p>According to Cury <italic>et al</italic>.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> there are dentifrices with low, medium, and high abrasivity. Among the lower abrasivity are the dentifrices in the form of gel, containing silica as the abrasive agent. However, when this mineral is combined with other abrasives such as calcium carbonate, sodium pyrophosphate, titanium oxide, and sodium phosphate, it is considered a high abrasive dentifrice. This finding is consistent with the results of this study, in which the dentifrice OBW, responsible for a statistically significant abrasivity, has silica as an abrasive agent in combination with titanium dioxide, classifying it as a highly abrasive dentifrice.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>According to Gusm&#x000e3;o <italic>et al.</italic>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> the main cause factor of abrasivity is not limited to the type nor quantity of abrasive present in the dentifrice, but the physical characteristics of the mineral as the size and the shape of the particles. Silica, for example, when used in fine particles with regular shapes, preserves its mild abrasivity mineral characteristic, but when coarse and irregular particles are incorporated, it is highly abrasive. Thus, only the gel or cream formula, or the type of the abrasive agent present in the dentifrice has not been sufficient to characterize its abrasivity to the tooth structures and composite resins.</p><p>The simulated toothbrushing abrasion is considered an established model in the literature, because it is an important <italic>in</italic>-<italic>vitro</italic> wear factor, able to simulate a clinical condition. According Sexson and Phillips,<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> for each session of brushing a patient performs approximately 15 cycles. Thus, maintaining an oral hygiene based on two daily sessions of brushing, 10,000 cycles are performed by the end of 1 year.</p><p>In the present study, the brushing time was statistically significant. The highest surface roughness mean was obtained after 20,000 cycles, the equivalent of 24 months of brushing (0.584 &#x000b5;m), differing statistically from 5,000 cycles, equivalent to 6 months of brushing (0.297 &#x000b5;m) and 10,000 cycles, equivalent to 12 months of brushing (0.354 &#x000b5;m). This finding concurs with other studies.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In the present study, a nanohybrid composite resin (Empress Direct) and a nanocomposite resin (Z350 XT) were used, and there was no statistical difference in surface roughness among the composite resins. Senawongse <italic>and</italic> Pongprueksa,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> after evaluating the surface roughness of micro-hybrid, nanohybrid, and nanocomposite resins, also found no significant difference among the materials, although the nanocomposite resin demonstrated fewer irregularities. On the other hand, Suzuki <italic>et al.</italic>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> after evaluating the surface roughness of nanohybrid and nanocomposite resins in 50,000 cycles of simulated toothbrushing, concluded that there was significant difference in rates of roughness of composite resins. The nanohybrid composite resins had higher Ra, and nanocomposite resins showed better results, especially Filtek Supreme XT, which was considered a clinically successful composite resin. This finding is not equivalent with the present study, in which both composites (Empress Direct and Z350 XT) performed similarly to a performance evaluation of 24 months (20,000 cycles). This difference in results among studies is probably related to the amount of toothbrushing cycles performed on each study.</p><p>According to the manufacturer, the composite resin Z350 XT consists of a combination of zirconia and silica nanoparticles in nanoclusters reducing the interstitial space between the particles and increasing the amount of load. The resin matrix with nanoparticles results in better physical properties and greater wear resistance, which means that during the abrasion these nanoclusters wear at a speed similar to the surrounding resin matrix. The result is a smooth, glossy, and durable polished surface.</p><p>Through the analysis of the SEM images, it was found that both composite resins had higher surface irregularities, higher resin matrix wear, and exposure of the filler particles when brushed with the dentifrice OBW. This wear was higher with the increase in the number of brushing cycles. These wear patterns are commonly found in evaluations by SEM after abrasive test.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Regarding the clinical significance of this study, it is evident that the surface roughness of composite resins changes according to the type of dentifrice used and the time of brushing, and the whitening dentifrice OBW had greater capacity to change the surface of composite resins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Within the limitations of the methodology used, it was possible to conclude that:</p><p>
