Microalbuminuria has been identified as an early marker of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and as a predictor of progression to end-stage kidney disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Moreover, CKD manifesting with microalbuminuria is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>There is a graded association between the severity of obesity and the magnitude of microalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Surgical weight loss can normalize glomerular hyperfiltration and the albumin excretion rate in severely obese patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and dietary weight loss trials show benefits on albuminuria, proteinuria, and the decline in the estimated GFR (eGFR) in patients with pre-existing CKD. A review and meta-analysis of 13 studies, including 2 randomized trials, reported that nonsurgical weight loss interventions reduce proteinuria and blood pressure and seem to prevent further decline in renal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). However, most of the studies were relatively small and duration of follow-up short (typically not exceeding 12 months). Different dietary strategies to promote weight loss have not directly been compared in a randomized, long-term study. This is especially pertinent to low-carbohydrate high-protein diets that are debated for potentially adversely affecting kidney function, especially among patients with diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A recent study among obese individuals showed that a low-carbohydrate high-protein weight loss diet was not associated with harmful effects on GFR and albuminuria compared with a low-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>We therefore investigated the long-term effect of low-fat, Mediterranean, and low-carbohydrate dietary intervention strategies on renal function among overweight or obese people with or without type 2 diabetes and pre-existing mild to moderate renal dysfunction in the Dietary Intervention Randomized Controlled Trial (DIRECT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>The 2-year DIRECT</title><p>The DIRECT, previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), was conducted between July 2005 and June 2007 in Dimona, Israel, in a workplace at a research center with an on-site medical clinic.

We calculated the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio to assess changes in microalbuminuria after 2 years of dietary intervention because the protein-to-creatinine ratio in a random urine specimen provides evidence of the presence of significant proteinuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).

The low-carbohydrate diet was at least as effective as the Mediterranean or low-fat diets in improving eGFR, an effect likely mediated in all three diets by the weight loss-induced improvement in blood pressure and in insulin sensitivity. Remarkably, this trend of apparent improvement in renal functions was not attenuated, and indeed tended to be more pronounced, in participants with pre-existing (baseline) conditions indicating diminished renal function or being at high risk for deterioration of renal function; namely, lower baseline eGFR, type 2 diabetes, and microalbuminuria.</p><p>Several limitations of our study warrant consideration. Few women were enrolled in the study, thus compromising our ability to identify sex-specific risk factors in the effects of the various diets on kidney function, although there seemed to be similar weight loss-induced improvements in eGFR and microalbuminuria in men and women (data not shown). In addition, although the subgroups of patients with diabetes and advanced renal impairment are of great interest to assess the effects of weight loss diets on kidney function, most of our participants were not diabetic and had relatively conserved kidney function. In particular, only 23 had microalbuminuria at baseline. Use of this relatively healthy population could have potentially led to underestimation of the beneficial effect of weight loss on kidney function in the most vulnerable groups. Nevertheless, a significant improvement in eGFR could still be observed in addition to robust regression of microalbuminuria, thus underscoring the importance of weight loss on slowing the progression, and perhaps even regressing, CKD at early stages of the disease in patients with and without diabetes.</p><p>Furthermore, another consideration is that all estimating equations for GFR, including the MDRD Study equation, were suggested to be less accurate in patients with obesity. In fact, it has been argued that GFR estimates in obese people should be indexed to body surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Moreover, MDRD may be less accurate than CKD-EPI in the normal and slightly increased range of serum creatinine concentrations (&#x0003c;133 mol/L [1.5 mg/dL]), which is the relevant range for detecting CKD (&#x0003c;60 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Therefore, we analyzed and presented the data also with the CKD-EPI equation, which resulted in similarly significant findings.</p><p>Use of the calculated eGFR and spot urine microalbuminuria (rather than a 24-h urine collection) is a limitation. Furthermore, we used single spot urine at each time point, although the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) recommends confirmation of albuminuria in two of three spot urine collections because of intraindividual day-to-day variation.</p><p>Changes in muscle mass can affect creatinine levels, thus affecting eGFR and/or the albumin-to-creatinine urine ratio, so changes in fat-free mass may potentially confound results that suggest improved renal function, though probably in opposite directions. After 2 years, however, nearly all participants had stabilized weight or tended to exhibit slight weight regain, which is not consistent with muscle breakdown.</p><p>The strengths of the study include the one-phase design, in which all participants started simultaneously, the relatively long duration of the study, the large size, the equal intensity of the intervention while achieving three significantly distinct diet patterns, the high adherence rate, and the repeated comprehensive measurements of creatinine, eGFR, and microalbumin and creatinine throughout the follow-up period. The latter allows us to determine that patients with type 2 diabetes exhibit a continuous improvement in eGFR (from baseline to 6 months and from 6 to 24 months) despite a significant degree of weight regain in the latter phase of the study, which may represent effects of the dietary intervention on kidney function independent of body weight.</p><p>Low-protein diets have been proposed to patients with CKD for more than 50 years. However, the effects of these diets in preventing severe kidney failure and the need for maintenance dialysis have not been resolved. A recent Cochrane review (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) showed reducing protein intake in patients with CKD reduces the occurrence of renal death by 32% compared with higher or unrestricted protein intake. To avoid 1 renal death, 2&#x02013;56 patients need to be treated with a low-protein diet during 1 year. The optimal level of protein intake could not be confirmed from these studies, however. Extrapolating the effects of macronutrients, and especially protein, on the deterioration of kidney function from studies in patients with CKD to obese people is not obvious. Most of the participants included in those studies have already had advanced kidney disease, and the effects cannot be generalized to those with early subclinical loss of renal function. Our findings are consistent with results from a recently published small randomized trial of 68 participants with a shorter follow-up period of 1 year and with another recently published randomized trial with relatively low adherence demonstrating that a very low-carbohydrate diet did not adversely affect renal function compared with a high-carbohydrate diet in healthy obese individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Other studies were also consistent with lack of renal adverse effects during weight loss with relatively high protein&#x02013;containing diets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>For patients with diabetes, the wariness regarding use of high-protein diets is even greater, because dietary protein restriction was shown to slow the progression of nephropathy in patients with type 1 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and the risk of end-stage renal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Similar observations were confirmed in a meta-analysis of five studies including 108 patients in which dietary protein restriction resulted in a slower progression of diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). In type 2 diabetes, a low protein diet has also been suggested to improve renal function among patients with macroalbuminuria, although no benefit could be documented among patients with normal renal function or with microalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have provided evidence that the source of the dietary protein may be more important for renal function than the absolute amount of protein consumed. For example, replacing red meat with chicken in the usual diet reduced urinary albumin excretion by 46% in patients with type 2 diabetes with microalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) or macroalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Moreover, a diet including a high amount of fish protein, consumption of which was encouraged in our interventional trial, provided protection from the development of diabetic nephropathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Some of the differences observed between the various sources of dietary proteins have been attributed to different proportions of saturated versus polyunsaturated fat in meat, chicken, and fish. A higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids was reported to have beneficial effects on endothelial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) that could reduce albuminuria and renal injury.</p><p>Moreover, weight loss per se may improve kidney function indirectly by its effects on blood pressure, glycemia, and lipid profile, which may outweigh the potential deleterious effects of specific dietary macro- or micronutrients. Therefore, the beneficial effects of Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets on insulin sensitivity and lipid profile, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and the lack of inferiority in improving kidney function and regression of microalbuminuria compared with the low-fat diet, suggest that these diets could be an alternative dietary approach for overweight and obese people with mild renal dysfunction and/or type 2 diabetes.</p><p>We found a strong association between a decrease in systolic blood pressure and fasting insulin level with improvement in eGFR and regression of microalbuminuria. Elevated blood pressure is a well-characterized risk factor for kidney damage and microalbuminuria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>), as well as hyperinsulinemia, which is strongly correlated with the development of microalbuminuria early in the course of metabolic syndrome and diabetes, independent of glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). In an experimental model in mice lacking the gene for the melanocortin-4 receptor, the relative contribution of hyperinsulinemia and hypertension to the development of renal dysfunction could be differentiated. These mice were hyperinsulinemic but normotensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), yet developed glomerular hyperfiltration and albuminuria. When hypertension was induced, their GFR and albuminuria further increased significantly. These data support the concept of an additive or even synergistic effect of obesity, hyperinsulinemia, and elevated blood pressure on glomerular hemodynamics.</p><p>In conclusion, we found that dietary interventions to reduce weight cause progressive improvement in eGFR and marked regression of microalbuminuria regardless of the dietary approach. In patients with a pre-existing moderate renal dysfunction and microalbuminuria, or in patients with type 2 diabetes, a low-carbohydrate high-protein diet is not inferior to other dietary approaches in improving kidney function.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
