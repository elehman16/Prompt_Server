Most of the benefit from ICS is achieved at lower doses and further increasing the dose provides little therapeutic benefit.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] LABA and ICS potentiate each other's effect through synergism. Interestingly, combination of ICS and LABA has the potential to inhibit airway remodeling.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, it has recently been shown that bronchoconstriction in asthmatics even in the absence of mucosal inflammation may contribute to airway remodeling.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Long-acting bronchodilators such as LABA might prevent airway remodeling by causing sustained bronchodilation.</p><p>Combining LABA and ICS in one inhaler has been shown to improve compliance compared to when they are given in two separate inhalers.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Formoterol is a unique LABA because it has both a rapid onset and a sustained duration of action which lasts for at least 12 h. Its lipophilic properties help it to penetrate the cell membrane and be stored in the cytoplasm of smooth muscle cells of the airways leading to sustained bronchodilation, while its hydrophilic properties allow it to access and activate &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> -receptor rapidly, leading to rapid bronchodilation.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Ciclesonide is a prodrug which is activated in the lungs by lung-specific esterase to its active metabolite, desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC). Since, ciclesonide and des-CIC have almost no oral bio-availability, the systemic absorption of this steroid is minimal and, therefore, has minimal systemic adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Slow release of des-CIC from the depot of fatty acid esters in the lungs provides longer (24 h) duration to the anti-inflammatory effects of the drug.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In addition, Ciclesonide can be formulated in a hydro-fluro-alkane metered-dose-inhaler (HFA-MDI), providing it a unique advantage of being delivered to the lungs in smaller particle sizes ranging from 1.1 to 2.1 &#x003bc;m, thereby allowing it to exert its anti-inflammatory effects even in the smaller airways.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Because of the unique properties of formoterol and ciclesonide, a combination (FC) may offer distinct advantages in the management of asthma. Recently, the approach of using single ICS + LABA combination inhaler for both maintenance and rescue has gained popularity. However, such approach is associated with exposure to almost 50% increased doses of ICS.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] As ciclesonide has lesser systemic bio-availability, it may be a safer alternative to other ICS. In addition, better anti-inflammatory effects of ciclesonide on smaller airways coupled with fast onset and longer duration of action of formoterol make the combination inhaler of formoterol and ciclesonide an attractive alternative over other ICS + LABA combination inhalers.</p><p>However, the efficacy and safety of a combination inhaler containing FC have not been adequately studied, although there is evidence for better efficacy and safety profile of other ICS + LABA combination inhalers.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of ciclesonide 80 &#x003bc;g and formoterol 4.5 &#x003bc;g with ciclesonide 80 &#x003bc;g both given as 1 puff twice daily delivered through an HFA pressurized MDI (pMDI) for 6 weeks in asthma patients having moderate-to-severe airflow limitation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male and female subjects aged 18&#x02013;70 years with a diagnosis of asthma based on Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) between 40% and 80% of predicted were recruited into the study.

Except for symptoms all other improvements were significantly better than the improvements seen in the ciclesonide group. There was no difference in the adverse event profile between the two study groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating a better efficacy of FC combination inhaler compared to C in asthma subjects with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. In a previous study, Korn and Buhl demonstrated noninferiority of FC combination compared to Fluticasone-Salmeterol combination.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The improvement (356 ml) seen in their study with FC was higher than that seen in our study (110 ml). This could be because of the use of a higher daily dose (F = 18 &#x003bc;g, C = 640 &#x003bc;g) in their study compared to the dose in our study (F = 9 &#x003bc;g, C = 160 &#x003bc;g).</p><p>The dose of ciclesonide in the run-in period was doubled during the treatment period, and this doubling did not produce significant improvement in lung function parameters like FEV1, morning peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and evening PEFR, although it produced significant improvement in symptoms and rescue medication use. This is consistent with findings from other studies comparing various doses of fluticasone, beclomethasone, budesonide, triamcinolone, and mometasone in which only budesonide showed significant dose-response with FEV1 while triamcinolone and fluticasone demonstrated dose-response in terms of morning and evening PEF improvements.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Our study demonstrated that addition of a long-acting bronchodilator (formoterol, in this case) can produce better bronchodilation and symptomatic improvement in asthma patients having moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. This finding will help clinicians and those patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on low-dose ciclesonide to take a better informed decision. Such patients are more likely to benefit from the addition of bronchodilator than doubling the dose of inhaled steroid.</p><p>Our study could be criticized for comparing ciclesonide 160 &#x003bc;g/day with a combination containing formoterol and an equivalent dose of ciclesonide (160 &#x003bc;g/day). It might appear obvious that addition of LABA would produce an additional improvement over similar dose of ciclesonide. However, the efficacy of adding LABA to ciclesonide over conventional dose of ciclesonide has not been demonstrated. In our study, we found that addition of formoterol to ciclesonide produces additional significant improvement while doubling the run-in dose of ciclesonide during treatment period did not produce improvement in lung function.</p><p>We included patients having FEV1 between 40% and 80% predicted at a screening in spite of receiving a stable dose of ICS equivalent to fluticasone 500 mcg daily suggesting the inclusion of moderate-to-severe asthma patients. Asthma patients having severe airflow limitation are usually excluded from drug trials as severe asthma may be associated with airway remodeling, emphysema, and COPD. However, we included such patients as the combination inhalers are used most prevalently in moderate-to-severe asthma patients. Besides, patients having a diagnosis of emphysema or COPD were excluded from the study.</p><p>We did not find a significant difference between the adverse events between the two groups, although, adverse events such as tremors, palpitation, and cramps were more in the combination group. However, the duration of the trial (6 weeks) may be too short to capture long-term adverse effects and trials of at least 48 weeks might be appropriate. Furthermore, higher use of beta-agonist salbutamol in the steroid group might confound the adverse effects of LABA in such studies. In addition, it might have been valuable to study adrenal function in order to capture concerning adverse effects of steroid and study electrocardiogram and QTc to specifically capture the adverse effects of formoterol. It would also be useful to study the efficacy and safety of FC combination in COPD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Formoterol and ciclesonide combination in a single inhaler shows better therapeutic efficacy and comparable safety than ciclesonide alone in asthma patients with moderate-to-severe airflow limitation. This combination could be a new option to currently available ICS/LABA combination inhalers for obstructive airways disease.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Cipla Ltd., provided grant and drugs for the conduct of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank the investigators Dr. Pramod Niphadkar, Dr. P.A.
