After the needs assessment, the objectives of the intervention and the determinants of self-management at work were formulated (Step 2). Furthermore, theory-based intervention methods and practical strategies were selected (Step 3), and an intervention program (including the eHealth module) was developed (Step 4). Finally, plans for implementation and evaluation of the program were developed (Steps 5 and 6).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Step 1 of the IM protocol revealed that employees with CANS should be stimulated to search for information about the cause of their complaints, about how to deal with their complaints, and in which manner they can influence their complaints themselves. In Step 2, the overall goal of the intervention was defined as &#x0201c;self-management behavior at work&#x0201d; with the aim to alleviate the perceived disability of the participants. Step 3 described how the intervention methods were translated into practical strategies, and goal setting was introduced as an important method for increasing self-efficacy. The product of Step 4 was the final program plan, consisting of 6-weekly group sessions of 2.5 hours each and an eHealth module. In Step 5, a recruitment plan and course materials were developed, a steering committee was set up, trainers were recruited, and the final program was tested. In Step 6, an evaluation plan was developed, which consists of a randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up period and a qualitative evaluation (interviews) with some of the participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study resulted in a theory- and practice-based self-management program, based on behavioral change theories, guideline-related evidence, and practice-based knowledge that fits the needs of employees with CANS.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>CANS</kwd><kwd>work-related upper extremity disorders</kwd><kwd>WRUED</kwd><kwd>behavioral change theory</kwd><kwd>intervention development</kwd><kwd>perceived disability</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Work-related disorders of the upper limbs, also known as work-related upper extremity disorders or complaints of the arm, neck, and/or shoulder (CANS), are an important health problem.<xref rid="b1-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> CANS can cause major problems in work participation, which can lead to sickness absence and job loss.<xref rid="b2-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the Netherlands, the point prevalence of chronic complaints (persisting for &#x0003e;3 months) due to CANS is 19%; of these patients, 60% report the use of health care facilities in the past year.<xref rid="b1-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The yearly costs due to CANS have been estimated at 0.5%&#x02013;2% of the gross national product in the Nordic countries.<xref rid="b4-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Thus, work-related neck and upper limb disorders have both a health and substantial socio-economic impact.<xref rid="b5-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In 77% of the patients, the complaints are located in the upper back/neck/shoulder region, in 25% in the elbow/underarm region, in 19% in the wrist/hand region, and in 42% the complaints occur in a combination of these regions.<xref rid="b6-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A distinction is usually made between specific CANS (such as epicondylitis, carpal tunnel syndrome) and non-specific CANS.<xref rid="b7-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Non-specific CANS is defined as pain, stiffness, tingling, and/or numbness in the neck, upper back, arms, and/or hands related to work that has persisted for &#x02265;2 weeks.<xref rid="b1-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>A recent Cochrane review on conservative interventions for treating work-related CANS found very low-quality evidence showing that exercises did not improve pain compared with no treatment, or with minor intervention controls, or when provided as additional treatment on the short- or long-term follow-up;<xref rid="b8-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> these results were similar for recovery, disability, and sick leave.

Although there is a lack of hard evidence, providing information and knowledge about the causes of CANS to employees suffering from CANS is considered important, as is also the case in patients with a chronic disease.<xref rid="b26-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Furthermore, in the Dutch guideline, etiological and prognostic factors were found to influence the occurrence and cause of CANS and should therefore be addressed in the training; eg, physical factors such as long-standing use of the computer, repetitive work tasks, heavy physical, mental and/or diffi-cult work, unfavorable working times, and the ergonomics of the workplace/posture are important topics addressed in the guideline.<xref rid="b26-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Moreover, psycho-social factors such as high work demands, experienced stress, work satisfaction, experienced support, and personal characteristics are important factors mentioned in the guideline, and should be addressed in the training (when relevant). Also, the role of several behavioral components, which can positively influence the complaints (eg, decreasing workload, taking breaks, muscle relaxation, and physical activity in managing the complaints), were considered important topics that can influence CANS.<xref rid="b26-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The results of the focus groups with employees and experts indicated that the employee&#x02019;s behavior was considered as an important factor related to the onset of symptoms of CANS.

Therefore, for example, information and skills with regard to setting limits, dealing with stress, and communication were considered important.

This outcome is the same as that used by Detaille et al,<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and did not need to be changed.

In this matrix of behavioral change objectives (based on the determinants of behavior identified in the needs assessment), self-management behavior at work was operationalized as follows: 1) to be able to cope with pain, fatigue, limitations, disability and emotional aspects caused by CANS; 2) to be aware of which factors at the workplace cause stress and to adequately deal with work stress by re-organizing work in light of the complaints and according to one&#x02019;s capacity (eg, to modify workload and work pace, to take pauses when needed, and to say &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; when needed); and 3) to be able to communicate effectively about CANS with one&#x02019;s supervisor and colleagues (eg, being able to explain the type of complaints, to ask for facilities at work, and to communicate about a possible change in job demands).</p><p>Furthermore the main determinants of behavior change according to the ASE Model,<xref rid="b28-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> ie, attitude, social influence, and self-efficacy, were operationalized into three categories. Attitude, the first category, was defined as the perceived cognitive and emotional advantages and disadvantages of the health behavior.<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Employees with CANS should be aware that the etiology and persistence of CANS are multifactorial, and that individuals can influence the complaints themselves by being aware of the factors that cause stress and taking care of these factors at work. Therefore, awareness is considered very important with regard to a person&#x02019;s attitude.</p><p>Social influence, the second category, was defined as (perception of) social support at work and acquiring social support at work. Social influences consist of the perception of others carrying out this type of behavior (social modeling), the norms that people have with respect to these behaviors (social norms), and the support that they perceive from others in carrying out a particular type of behavior, eg, the support of the supervisor and colleagues at work.<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Employees with CANS often do all the work by themselves, do not seek/accept support, and do not always communicate about their complaints; therefore, it is important that employees are willing to ask and accept (social) support.</p><p>Self-efficacy, the third category, was defined as how confident the person with CANS is about his/her ability to modify the behavior that may cause and trigger CANS, such as perfectionist behavior at work, or to be able to regularly take exercise to deal with the complaint(s). Self-efficacy refers to a person&#x02019;s perception of his/her capability to perform the type of behavior.<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> The intervention aims to influence all three determinants of behavior, but especially the attitude and self-efficacy at work.

Self-management at work at the individual level is targeted through the development of 6-weekly group sessions of 2.5 hours each. An overview of the program is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jmdh-8-307">Table 4</xref>. Compared with the original program<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> for employees with a chronic somatic disease, the developed program is slightly adapted to the (work) situation of employees with CANS. Two new topics are added to the training. Firstly, the core quadrant (qualities, pitfalls, challenges, and allergies)<xref rid="b38-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> is added to gain insight into the participants&#x02019; qualities and pitfalls. Core quadrants focus on what is right and is going well. Each core quality has its positive side and its negative side, which can be a persons&#x02019; weak spot. Such a pitfall is frequently a source of conflict, irritation, and tension to other people in that person&#x02019;s environment. This is particularly so if the pitfall turns out to be another person&#x02019;s allergy.<xref rid="b38-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Secondly, a topic about time management is added because of the high level of (work) demands of employees with CANS. Moreover, the development of a mind map is added to the topic of &#x0201c;making plans for the future&#x0201d;, and an interactive topic about exercises with a movement scientist/physical therapist is also added.<xref rid="b39-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> All the original topics used by Detaille et al<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> are retained in the self-management sessions. The topic on nutrition is shortened because, although it is related to a healthy lifestyle, it is less specifically related to CANS. Furthermore, the original program topics are adapted with specific examples related to the work situation of employees suffering from CANS, and the order of several topics and sessions is changed. As a result of the needs assessment, the self-management sessions are seen as the main focus of the intervention, with the support of the eHealth. The self-management sessions are complemented by an eHealth module accessible for the participants (via a personal login) for a period of 1 year. The content of the eHealth module is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jmdh-8-307">Table 4</xref>. The more general self-management themes (which often need explanation, group discussion, and training) are addressed in the self-management sessions; the more specific CANS-related themes are mainly addressed in the eHealth module, because the relevance of these themes can differ widely between participants. Participants can use this information in the sessions to fulfil their action plans. The self-management sessions and the eHealth module complement each other, forming an integrated program of self-management. The structure of the eHealth module is linked with references to topics in the self-management sessions; this stimulates the use of the eHealth module and makes it easier to find related topics.</p></sec><sec><title>Step 5: plan for adoption, implementation, and sustainability of the program</title><p>In Step 5 of the IM process, inclusion criteria for the participants were defined, and a plan was made for the recruitment of participants for an evaluation study. Several actions can be taken to stimulate the participation of employees suffering from CANS within the participating organizations. During the process of developing the intervention, a steering committee of stakeholders was set up to facilitate short- and long-term implementation of the intervention. The final program was tested among the first groups of participants. Trainers were recruited, and recruitment materials were developed by NH, YH, JE, JBS, and MN. All trainers received the correct training and sufficient instructions to guide the course. The inclusion/exclusion criteria and recruitment plan are described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="b24-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>The course manuals for the participants and trainers were adapted by NH and SD. The content of the eHealth module was developed by NH, SD, YH, JE, JBS, and MN. The technical aspects of the eHealth module were developed in collaboration with an external party. Trainers were recruited from the staff of the Hogeschool van Arnhem en Nijmegen (HAN) University of Applied Sciences and the Radboud University Medical Center. All trainers were trained by SD, the developer of the original program for workers with a chronic disease and who is also experienced in the development/implementation of self-management programs. Depending on the number of participants, sessions can be facilitated by one or two trainers. No major modifications were made after testing the program with the first group of participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Step 6: generate an evaluation plan</title><p>The study protocol, including the evaluation plan, is described in detail elsewhere.<xref rid="b24-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The design of the study, a recruitment plan, and the promotion materials for participants were approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Radboud University Medical Center (registration number 2012/319).

The behavior change objectives were related to the factors of the ASE Model.<xref rid="b28-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The intervention aims to influence all three determinants of behavior, but especially the attitude to and self-efficacy at work. Interventions are known to be more effective if they focus on improving a participant&#x02019;s action planning activity and their self-efficacy and self-regulatory capabilities, rather than focusing on intention-enhancing risk perceptions.<xref rid="b32-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In the study of Detaille et al,<xref rid="b9-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> the attitude toward self-management at work (enjoyment) improved after 8 months (<italic>P</italic>=0.03) in the intervention group. Moreover, a qualitative evaluation of that study indicates that the intervention generally had a positive effect on the employees&#x02019; working life and wellbeing, and that participants would recommend the program to others.<xref rid="b15-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>The IM process resulted in a self-management program for employees suffering from CANS, consisting of six group sessions and a complementary eHealth module. Because the use of the eHealth module may vary between participants, the group sessions also address (to some extent) all of the topics identified in the needs assessment. By adding an eHealth module, we expect that higher educated employees will also benefit from the intervention; in the intervention of Detaille et al,<xref rid="b9-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> lower educated workers in the intervention group developed better physical health quality (SF-12) compared with the lower educated workers in the control group.</p><p>A possible strength of the developed intervention is the thorough adaptation and tailoring of an existing self-management intervention to fit the needs of employees with CANS. Moreover, two new topics were added to the training (the core quadrant and time management), and a mind map was developed and added to the topic making plans for the future.</p><p>There is inconsistent evidence for the effects of self-management programs for patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain,<xref rid="b39-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b54-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="b55-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> and there is some evidence that group-delivered short programs (&#x0003c;8 weeks) with a health care professional have the best potential.<xref rid="b39-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Moreover, group sessions can stimulate modeling and reinforcement of other participants&#x02019; activities, and participants can compare themselves with other participants. Also, discussion is stimulated, and participants can learn from the experiences of other participants. Therefore, we expect that the developed program, consisting of six group sessions and with an additional interactive topic on exercises with a movement scientist/physical therapist, could be beneficial for employees with CANS.</p><p>In addition to the sessions, the eHealth module was developed to provide more thorough tailoring of the intervention. It is probably possible to tailor the program for employees with other musculoskeletal disorders, by adapting the eHealth module and only slightly adapting the content of the group sessions. Another possible strength of the developed intervention is the use of the ASE Model,<xref rid="b28-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> which was also used in the original intervention of Detaille et al<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and in other IM intervention developments,<xref rid="b52-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> together with the use of methods and strategies for behavior change (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jmdh-8-307">Table 3</xref>), which emphasizes the theory-based character of the intervention. Also, the integration of expert opinion, not only regarding the needs of employees with CANS and the content of the intervention, but also concerning self-management and the development of the eHealth module, can be seen as a strength of the model&#x02019;s design. Expert opinion is increasingly used in the development of self-management interventions.<xref rid="b56-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="b57-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></p><p>Although the group sessions will last only 6 weeks, the eHealth module is accessible for 1 year, allowing participants to review the topics and exercises of the program; this may stimulate participants to maintain their behavioral changes in the long term. Moreover, in the future, the eHealth module can be converted into an online self-management tool, or can be used as an information tool for employees with CANS. It is reported that online self-management programs can be useful and beneficial.<xref rid="b58-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b60-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">60</xref></p><p>Another major strength is the diversity of the intervention topics, which is based on the combination of group sessions (with more generic themes), the eHealth module (with more specific themes; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jmdh-8-307">Table 3</xref>), and the use of personal action plans. As mentioned, action planning is an effective component of self-management interventions,<xref rid="b36-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and participants have indicated that working with an action plan is both useful and effective.<xref rid="b15-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Personalized action plans can be an important component with regard to the multifactorial etiology of CANS; in this way, all participants can work on their own goals. By dividing the topics between the group sessions (more general topics) and eHealth module (more specific topics), and with the use of action plans, we aimed to make the program both interesting and useful for each participant.</p><p>The fact that part of the intervention will be available via the computer might be seen as a weakness of the intervention, especially among employees whose complaints might (partly) be caused by use of the computer. However, we tried to address this issue by making use of the eHealth module optional rather than mandatory. Another possible weakness is that the views of employers and supervisors were not taken into account in the development of the intervention. Focus group sessions with employees revealed some issues with regard to their employers and supervisors. Therefore, as indicated by Detaille et al,<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> another point of discussion is whether a self-management program for the employee is sufficient to facilitate the workability of such a program for employees, or whether the physical and social working environment should also be the object of an intervention. We assume that not (only) the work environment, but also the personal characteristics of employees with CANS, are important when considering the causes of complaints and when dealing with complaints.<xref rid="b16-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Self-management interventions focus primarily on encouraging participants to be involved with and to control their own treatment, as well as improving their understanding of how their condition and treatment affect their lives.<xref rid="b61-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Therefore, the intervention focuses on empowerment of the participating employees.</p><p>Another limitation is that the intervention was developed to suit the participants&#x02019; needs in different stages of behavioral change; also, participants work on different behavioral goals. Therefore, the program is not tailored for participants according to a stage of behavioral change and one specific behavioral goal. In the development group, there was some discussion about the inclusion of the subject nutrition in the intervention. This topic was part of the original self-management program,<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> but seems to be less important with regard to employees with CANS. Eventually, it was decided to address this topic only briefly, because a healthy lifestyle is important for everyone and especially for individuals suffering from stress and fatigue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, a self-management program developed by Detaille et al<xref rid="b14-jmdh-8-307" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> was adapted and tailored for employees with non-specific CANS.

This resulted in a theory- and practice-based self-management program, including an eHealth module.
