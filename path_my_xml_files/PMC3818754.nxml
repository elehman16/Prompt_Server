on maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) from delayed onset muscle soreness
(DOMS). [Subjects] Sixty healthy adults participated in this study. The exclusion criteria
were orthopedic or neurologic disease. [Methods] The researchers induced DOMS in the
musculus extensor carpi radialis longus of each participant. Subjects in the control group
received no treatment. The ultrasound group received ultrasound treatment (intensity,
1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2;</sup> frequency 1&#x02005;MHz; time, 10 minutes). The vibration group received
vibration stimulation (frequency, 20&#x02005;MHz; time, 10 minutes). Maximal voluntary isometric
contraction (MVIC) was recorded at baseline, immediately after exercise, and 24, 48, and
72 hours after exercise. [Results] MVIC measurements showed statistically significant
differences in the vibration group compared with the control group. [Conclusion] Vibratory
stimulation had a positive effect on recovery of muscle function from DOMS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Vibratory stimulation</kwd><kwd>Ultrasound</kwd><kwd>Isometric contraction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Isometric contraction or phasic movement that expresses power can induce muscular pain.
Muscular pain that starts 12&#x02013;24 hours after unaccustomed exercise, serious resistance
exercise, or excessive use of specific muscles, is known as delayed onset muscle soreness
(DOMS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. DOMS increases during the first
24 hours after exercise and, peaks 24&#x02013;48 hours later. It is characterized by oppressive pain
to tactile perception and on movement, which disappears within 5&#x02013;7 days, and is accompanied
by decreased flexibility and maximum voluntary force production<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The effects of whole body vibration exercise are influenced by numerous factors including
amplitude, frequency, exercises performed, intensity, and volume<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. There is considerable evidence from studies that whole body
vibration exercise increases physical strength, improves muscle performance, and improves
balance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kawanabe et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that whole body vibration exercise
improves knee extensor strength, jumping power, chair-rising time, timed up and go, body
balance, chronic back pain, and hip bone mineral density, and increases the levels of serum
testosterone and growth hormone.</p><p>Vibration has also been shown to increase lower body bone density in postmenopausal women
and thus may be useful for rehabilitation and prevention of osteoporosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, vibration exercise induces additional
neural adaptation by stimulating the muscular system and enhances morphological functional
development of the muscular fiber, thereby improving overall muscle function<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There is a lack of evidence on the optimal treatment approach for effective recovery of
muscle function. This study aimed to examine the effects of vibration exercise on the
recovery of muscle function after induction of DOMS and to determine its potential as a
clinical treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> General characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group (n=20)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ultrasound group (n=20)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vibration group (n=20)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender (M/F)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 / 10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 / 10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10 / 10</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (year)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.10 &#x000b1; 1.97</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.25 &#x000b1; 2.29</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.80 &#x000b1; 2.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">168.02 &#x000b1; 7.18</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.82 &#x000b1; 6.69</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">169.22 &#x000b1; 8.14</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.77 &#x000b1; 11.03</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.77 &#x000b1; 8.96</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.71 &#x000b1; 11.40</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.05 &#x000b1; 2.23</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.84 &#x000b1; 2.09</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.73 &#x000b1; 2.42</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are means &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Sixty college students were assigned to a control group, an ultrasound treatment group, or
a vibration treatment group. The average age and height of the participants were 21.72 &#x000b1;
2.16&#x02005;years and 168.35 &#x000b1; 7.26&#x02005;cm. The averages weight and body mass index of the participants
were 62.42 &#x000b1; 10.35&#x02005;kg and 21.87 &#x000b1; 2.21&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The researcherS measured maximal voluntary isometric
contraction (MVIC). Measurements were performed immediately before and after the induction
of DOMS and, 24 hours, hours, and 72 hours after induction of DOMS. Changes in the
measurements over time were compared between group subjects.</p><p>The researchers induced DOMS in the musculus extensor carpi radialis longus in each study
participant. An isokinetic dynamometer (CS200 Dynamometer, JLW Instruments Inc., Chicago,
IL, USA) was used for all the testing and exercise. Three sets of eccentric contractions
were carried out 12 times using 70% maximum voluntary contraction based on 1 RM (repetition
maximum) for the induction of DOMS; this was based on when the eccentric contraction could
not be performed continuously three times, because the point of induction of muscular pain
varies among individuals.</p><p>Ultrasound was applied to the nondominant musculus extensor carpi radialis longus portion
of the wrist of participants in the ultrasound group for 10 minutes at a time, at a
frequency of 1&#x02005;MHz and an intensity of 1.0&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Ultrasound was carried out in
the most comfortable state once a day for three days after the commencement of DOMS.</p><p>Vibration stimulation was applied to the nondominant musculus extensor carpi radialis
longus portion of the wrist of participants in the vibration group. A research worker used a
vibration massager for 10 minutes at a frequency 20&#x02005;Hz. Applying the vibration stimulation
to the partcipants was carried out in the most comfortable state once a day for three days
after DOMS induction.</p><p>The researcher measured the maximum isometric physical strength of the musculus extensor
carpi radialis longus of the wrist extensor muscle in the nondominant arm. The upper side of
the participants' arms and the antebrachial bottom stanchion were supported, and the wrist
was maintained parallel to the stanchion by keeping the palm of the hand towards the ground
or surface of the earth. An isokinetic dynamometer (CS200 Dynamometer, JLW Instruments,
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to measure the maximum voluntary isometric contraction of
the non-dominant wrist extensor. A research worker calculated the average of 3 measurements
for the maximum power of voluntary isometric contraction, and included resting time to
prevent the muscle fatigue between the measurements<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. SPSS version 12.0 (ICC, Chicago, IL, USA) was used for data
analysis. Descriptive statistics are reported as means &#x000b1; standard deviation (M &#x000b1; SD). A
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine the difference between the
groups. Repeated measure analysis of variance was used to verify the mean difference in time
variation (pretest, immediately after commencement of DMOS and, 1, 2 and 3 days after the
commencement of DOMS) within each group, and Tukey's test was used to analyze post-
verification differences between the groups. Statistical significance was set at p&#x0003c;0.05
for all the analyses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> The changes in MVIC before and after inducing DOMS between groups (units:

through the measurement of MVIC. Delayed onset muscle soreness begins with muscle overload
or excessive or unaccustomed tension exercise, bringing pain ranging from stiffness and mild
discomfort to incapacitating pain that limits normal activity. There can be various reasons
for damage to muscle tissue, but eccentric contraction seems to be the main cause<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. After eccentric exercise, muscle cells
undergo ultra-minute changes including rupture of muscle fiber segmentation, such as
popping, Z-band flow, injury of T-tubules and the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and injury to the
muscle fiber. This rupture induces an increase in the flow of CA calcium outside the cells
into the tissue, leading to inflammation with increased protein serum activity. In addition,
the inner muscle cell contents, such as creatine kinase and myoglobin flow to the area of
inflammation and into the blood; these degenerative changes are connected with DOMS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Power decreases step by step during ongoing
isometric maximum voluntary contraction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Warren et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed that decreased muscle strength is the most valid and reliable guideline of direct
muscle injury in humans. Saxton et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>
measured the maximum voluntary contraction power to investigate the effects of muscle injury
induced by eccentric exercise in the vibration of neuromuscular functions and proprioceptor
factors<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. They observed that MVC
decreased after induction of DOMS but gradually recovered. In our study, it was decreased
one day after the induction but gradually recovered over 3 days, with significant
differences in the ultrasound and vibration groups compared with the control group. This
result indicates that vibration stimulates muscle spindles to activate &#x003b3; motor neurons for
muscle contraction. This study researched the effect on maximal voluntary isometric
contraction of vibration stimulation exercise for the wrist extensor muscle after inducing
DOMS.</p><p>In the above research results, the effects of vibration stimulation on muscle function
after inducing DOMS were revealed, and as more studies are carried out on the properties of
the mechanism of vibration stimulation, it will be possible to use vibration stimulation as
a new therapeutic approach in rehabilitation areas.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Kisner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Colby</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic Exercise: Foundations and Techniques, 5th ed.
