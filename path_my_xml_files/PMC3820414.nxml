spiral taping on menstrual pain and premenstrual syndrome, to investigate the efficacy of
the two types of taping as methods for alleviating menstrual pain and premenstrual
syndrome. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects of this study were 34 unmarried women. The
subjects were randomly divided into a Kinesio taping group, a spiral taping group and a
control group. Subjects with a regular menstrual cycle underwent taping a total of six
times; twice a week for about three weeks, starting from 14 days before menstruation and
continuing until its end. Degrees of menstrual pain and premenstrual syndrome were
measured before the application of taping. [Results] The results revealed that Kinesio
taping had significant effects on menstrual pain, while spiral taping was effective at
alleviating both menstrual pain and premenstrual syndrome. [Conclusion] Both taping
methods before menstruation brought significant relief to menstrual pain, which suggests
that spiral taping is an effective method of alleviating premenstrual symptoms.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Kinesio taping</kwd><kwd>Spiral taping</kwd><kwd>Menstrual pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>All human beings will experience pain (poena) sometime in their life, but if there is one
pain that is particularly hard on women, it is menstrual pain. Although the term pain
usually involves sensory emotional universality, and distinctiveness, menstrual pain is a
pain unique to women. About 50&#x02013;90% of women experience menstrual pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the pain can be so severe that it is cited as one of
the most common reasons for social problems such as regular absence from school or work.
Despite ongoing medical advances, many women still depend on medication to cope with
menstrual pain, which may result in drug abuse<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Research conducted on menstrual pain shows that a high percentage of women, 60 to 93%,
experience menstrual pain and that 42% of them suffer from a severe level of pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Menstrual pain is known to involve symptoms such as backache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
headache, fatigue, nervousness, and dizziness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a collection of such symptoms is called premenstrual syndrome,
which involves complex emotional and physical changes that begin one or two weeks before
menstruation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Premenstrual symptoms include at least one of the first four symptoms: 1) a depressed mood;
2) tension or anxiety; 3) lower back pain; 4) decreased activity; 5) changes in appetite;
and 6) physical symptoms (breast tenderness, headaches, bloating, and muscle pain).
Therefore, premenstrual symptoms are a frequent source of concern for women during their
reproductive lives and moderate to severe symptoms impact on their quality of life<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. To deal with menstrual pain and
premenstrual syndrome, many therapies, including medication and thermotherapy, which are
types of conservative therapy, and other self-treatment methods have been prescribed to
alleviate symptoms. For example, several medical therapies, herbal remedies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and acupuncture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup> have been reported to relieve menstrual pain. However, some
therapies can have harmful consequences, such as tolerance to analgesics, as a result of
abuse, and pain from and fear of acupuncture. Thus, methods of managing menstrual pain and
premenstrual syndrome easily and conveniently, rather than the use of medication or
irritating therapies would help reduce individual and social costs. One treatment
possibility is taping therapy. Taping therapy eases pain by contracting relevant muscles or
improving blood circulation through tape attached to the skin. Kinesio taping is a technique
which is based on the body's own natural healing process and is used for anything from
headaches to foot problems and everything in between<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of Kinesio taping and spiral taping,
that are being clinically applied for menstrual pain and premenstrual syndrome, to
investigate the efficacy of the two types of taping as methods for alleviating menstrual
pain and premenstrual syndrome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Kinesio taping<break/>(n=11)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spiral taping<break/>(n=10)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n=13)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Age (year)Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.6&#x000b1;1.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23.6&#x000b1;2.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.9&#x000b1;0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.7&#x000b1;4.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.2&#x000b1;2.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.0&#x000b1;2.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160.2&#x000b1;5.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.3&#x000b1;6.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.0&#x000b1;6.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Menarcheal age (year)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.4&#x000b1;2.2</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.2&#x000b1;1.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.2&#x000b1;3.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Menstrual Duration (day)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.8&#x000b1;1.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.3&#x000b1;0.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.1&#x000b1;1.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Menstrual interval (day) </td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">28.2&#x000b1;4.0</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.9&#x000b1;3.7</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.8&#x000b1;8.6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>The subjects of this study were 42 unmarried, non-parous women in their twenties and

premenstrual syndrome were assessed before the application of taping. Subjects with a
regular menstrual cycle underwent taping a total of six times twice a week for about three
weeks starting from 14 days before menstruation until its end. For the Kinesio taping
group, a piece of Kinesio tape (Kinesio Taping Co., Ltd. Japan), 5&#x02005;cm in width and 7&#x02013;8&#x02005;cm
in length was applied right from below the navel and reached to where the pubic hair
began, and another piece of tape 10&#x02005;cm in length was applied to make a cross shape with
the first piece (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>For the spiral taping group, based on balance taping points suggested by Tanaka, spiral
tape (ExcelSpiral tape A type: Spiraltape of Tanaka. Japan) was applied to the subjects in
a left-oriented direction in consideration of the research results that 95&#x02013;99% of the
entire population has left-oriented directivity, while 1&#x02013;5% has right-oriented
directivity. Taking into account the various patterns of menstrual pain, spiral tape was
applied to the lower abdomen, the chief complaint area, in order to see if it had any
effect on pain alleviation. An examination was carried out to determine the subjects'
tender points on the biceps brachii tendon of the left arm on the lateral or internal side
based on the taping application area. Taping was applied to the subjects with tenderness
on the lateral side as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>, while it
was applied to the subjects with tenderness on the internal side in the manner shown in
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Kinesio tape is directly attached to the site of pain, whereas spiral tape is attached
where it is determined that the balance of an antigravity muscle is broken<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the tender points of the
interior and exterior muscles of the biceps brachii, which is a major antigravity muscle,
were examined, and the balance between the left and right sides of the pelvis was checked
before tape that could balance the left and right functional adjustment of the pelvis was
attached.</p><p>Degrees of menstrual pain were assessed using a VAS, which is a method of representing
subjects' pain on a 10&#x02005;cm linear scale. In this study, a score of 0 meant &#x02018;a very low
degree of pain&#x02019; and 10 meant &#x02018;a very high degree of pain.&#x02019; To measure premenstrual
syndrome, the subjects' decreased activity, lower back pain, tension or anxiety, breast
tenderness, and headaches were assessed using the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire
(MDQ)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each item is scored on a
5-point Likert scale, with 1 being &#x02018;no pain at all,&#x02019; followed by &#x02018;mild pain,&#x02019;&#x02018;moderate
pain,&#x02019; &#x02018;slightly severe pain,&#x02019; and &#x02018;extremely severe pain.&#x02019;</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 14 for Window (SPSS Institute
Korea, Seoul, Korea) and values presented as Mean&#x000b1;SD. The mean and standard deviation of
the subjects' height, age, and weight were calculated using descriptive statistics. In
order to analyze the changes in menstrual pain and premenstrual syndrome between the pre-
and post-intervention, the Mann-Whitney test was used to test the significance of the
changes within each group, and ANOVA was used the three groups. Moreover, multiple
comparison analyses of the three groups were made using the Least-Significant-Difference
(LSD) test. In all analysis, statistical significance was accepted for values of
p&#x0003c;0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Comparison of menstrual pain and premenstrual syndrome between inter- group,

pain and premenstrual syndrome in 34 unmarried, non-parous women in their twenties and
thirties without pathologic findings in the pelvic cavity.</p><p>Between 20 and 90% of female adolescents experience menstrual pain, and 15% experience
severe pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, which can be serious
enough to disrupt their daily lives. This study also ascertained that all of the subjects
had suffered from a high degree of menstrual pain and that such pain had decreased their
everyday activities, affecting their daily lives.</p><p>Kinesio taping is an auxiliary treatment that maximizes natural recovery ability and
corrects the balance of the human body by adjusting electromagnetic flows on the skin,
indirectly stimulating muscles or organs right under the skin using non-chemically-treated
tape. This technique is said to promote three effects: to normalize muscular function; to
increase lymphatic and vascular flow; and to diminish pain. It is considered to be a very
simple, and safe treatment that has few side effects and continuously takes effect as long
as the tape remains attached to the skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Taping may increase or reduce muscle strength, and many
investigators have hypothesized on to explain the possible underlying mechanism, proposing
neurofacilitation and mechanical restraint, and a relationship between cutaneous afferent
stimulation and motor unit firing<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
other words, Kinesio tape decreases muscle tone and alleviates pain by inducing constant
relaxation and contraction of the muscles through physical stimulation of cutaneous
afferents, and is effective at maximizing natural healing power by stimulating organs
through muscles right under the skin or reciprocal innervation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>It has been shown that menstrual pain is caused by the increased secretion of endometrial
prostagladin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonsterodial
anti-inflammation drugs such as ibuprofen suppress prostaglandin synthetase, and for this
reason, drug therapies are frequently used to ease menstrual pain<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, because drug therapies have adverse reactions,
non-drug therapies have been investigated. Non-drug therapies include transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>,
subcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (SPNS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and acupuncture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Prostagladin plays the role of sensitizing pain in the spinal cord<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although TENS and SPNS have positive effects on menstrual
pain, it is not known whether they decrease the secretion of prostagladin. Because TENS and
SPNS uses the pain gate mechanism that controls pain at the spinal cord by stimulating
sensory fibers with large diameters such as tactile and vibratory senses in the skin, they
can control menstrual pain by suppressing the sensitizing action of prostaglandin in the
spinal cord to control menstrual pain. One of the key actions of Kinesio tape is suppression
of pain by stimulation of the tactile fibers in the skin through the pain gate mechanism as
well<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, Kinesio tape applied
to the lower abdomen would have stimulated the tactile fibers in the skin suppressing the
pain sensitizing action of prostaglandin in the spinal cord, thereby reducing menstrual
pain. This study demonstrated that Kinesio taping relieves not only musculoskeletal pain but
also menstrual pain, which is internal pain, based on the significantly decreased menstrual
pain of the subjects to whom Kinesio taping was applied.</p><p>Developed by Tanaka, spiral taping, also referred to as balance taping, is a method that
attaches inelastic tape in a spiral direction after measuring electromagnetic flows through
muscles and skin based on the principle of directivity and response points. This taping
method, which comprehensively deals with the antigravity muscles responsible for the human
body's functioning, treats, pain or diseases by adjusting functional balance between right
and left muscles based on the idea that physical abnormalities result from imbalances in
muscles that resist gravity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this
study, the subjects' menstrual pain significantly decreased after applying spiral tape,
indicating the effectiveness of the method. This study also demonstrated the effects of
spiral taping on premenstrual syndrome, which is caused by physiological imbalance, by
finding significant changes in breast tenderness, tension or anxiety, and decreased
activity. Our present results are consistent with the theory that spiral taping eases pain,
reduces inflammation, and induces muscle relaxation by restoring a normal energy flow of the
circulating energy in the human body to a spiral shape<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Spiral taping seems to have relieved premenstrual syndrome by
restoring the abnormal energy flow during menstruation to its normal pattern.</p><p>As discussed above, we consider both Kinesio and spiral taping to be effective methods for
alleviating menstrual pain and premenstrual syndrome. In other words, when experiencing such
symptoms, these taping methods can be added to the list of existing treatments as medically
recognized methods.</p><p>In this study, taping before menstruation induced significant changes in menstrual pain,
which suggests that taping is an effective method of alleviating menstrual symptoms.
Furthermore, considering that spiral taping resulted in significant changes in those
suffering from premenstrual syndrome, which is caused by comprehensive and complex factors,
this method can also be recommended for women as a strategy for coping with both menstrual
pain and premenstrual syndrome. Nevertheless, this study had limitations in that the results
may not be applied to parous women in other age groups because only unmarried women in their
twenties and thirties were surveyed in this study.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Gachon University research fund of 2013 (GCU-2013-M016).</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrath</surname><given-names>PJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Use of medication by adolescents for the management of
