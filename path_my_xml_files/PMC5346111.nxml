</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Psoriasis vulgaris is an immune-mediated, chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by plaques of scaly, thickened skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The most common topical therapies for treating mild-to-moderate psoriasis vulgaris are corticosteroids and vitamin D<sub>3</sub> analogs, which are used either alone or in combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Fixed combination calcipotriol 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g (Cal) and betamethasone dipropionate 0.5&#x000a0;mg/g (BD) in ointment and gel formulations are established first-line topical treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, patient adherence to topical therapies remains an issue, mostly because of the time-consuming and inconvenient nature of daily treatment application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>In order to address the different needs of patients, alternative topical formulations and methods of administration have been developed. Cal/BD aerosol foam (Enstilar<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; LEO Pharma, Copenhagen, Denmark), an alcohol-free, paraffin-based formulation with emollient properties, was developed with the aim of addressing these needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; this aerosol formulation becomes supersaturated when applied to the skin, leading to increased bioavailability and improved clinical efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A previous plaque test study demonstrated that Cal/BD aerosol foam had significantly greater efficacy over 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment than Cal/BD ointment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In the recent phase III, randomized PSO-ABLE study, Cal/BD aerosol foam demonstrated significantly greater efficacy at 4&#x000a0;weeks compared with 8&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with Cal/BD gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Betamethasone 17-valerate (BV) is a corticosteroid used in the treatment of psoriasis vulgaris and other inflammatory skin disorders. Potent BV-medicated plasters, containing 2.25&#x000a0;mg BV (Betesil<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> medicated plaster, manufactured by Altergon, Morra De Sanctis, Italy), are marketed as being suitable for plaques localized in difficult-to-treat (DTT) areas such as knees, elbows, and the anterior face of the tibia. The plaster can be trimmed to cover psoriatic plaques exactly and deliver the active ingredient to the affected area specifically.</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of Cal/BD aerosol foam with BV-medicated plasters using a psoriasis plaque test design modified from the method developed by Dumas and Scholtz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Eligible patients (aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) with psoriasis vulgaris, with preferably three (or at least two) plaques on their arms, legs, and/or trunk, were recruited. In patients with three plaques, each plaque had to be large enough to accommodate two test sites, while patients with two plaques needed to have one plaque that could accommodate four test sites and another that could accommodate two test sites. Each test site had an area of 5&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>, with at least 2&#x000a0;cm between the test sites. Patients were required to have stable psoriasis based on the difference in total clinical score (TCS; sum score of erythema, scaling, and infiltration for a particular test site) between screening and baseline visits (maximum 28&#x000a0;days), as well as plaques with a TCS of 4&#x02013;9 (inclusive) and a score of &#x02265;1 for each item. Patients with a change of more than one point in any of the clinical signs were excluded.</p><p>Patients receiving systemic treatment with biological therapies with a possible effect on psoriasis (etanercept within 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to randomization; adalimumab or infliximab within 8&#x000a0;weeks; ustekinumab within 16&#x000a0;weeks; other biological therapies within 4&#x000a0;weeks or five half-lives [whichever was longer]) were excluded from the study. Other exclusion criteria included systemic treatment (other than with biological therapy, e.g. retinoids, immunosuppressants) within 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to randomization; treatment with psoralen combined with ultraviolet&#x000a0;A therapy within 4&#x000a0;weeks or ultraviolet&#x000a0;B therapy within 2&#x000a0;weeks; potent or very potent (WHO group III&#x02013;IV) corticosteroids within 4&#x000a0;weeks; WHO group I&#x02013;II corticosteroids within 2&#x000a0;weeks, except if used for scalp and/or facial psoriasis treatment; any concomitant medical or dermatological disorders that might preclude accurate evaluation of psoriasis on test areas; use of emollients within 1&#x000a0;week; and initiation of, or expected changes to, concomitant medication that may affect psoriasis, such as &#x003b2;-blockers, antimalarial drugs, lithium and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, within 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study Design</title><p>This was a phase IIa, single-center, investigator-blinded, within-patient controlled, randomized, 4-week study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02518048) conducted in France (Centre de Pharmacologie Clinique Appliqu&#x000e9;e &#x000e0; la Dermatologie, Nice, France). The protocol was approved by the relevant independent Ethics Committee and appropriate regulatory authorities. The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all patients provided written informed consent prior to enrolment.</p><p>Each patient received both Cal/BD aerosol foam and BV-medicated plaster once daily (6&#x000a0;days per week, excluding Sundays, for a total of 28&#x000a0;days) to enable intraindividual comparisons. Both treatments were applied by clinical personnel to a total of six test sites (three for each treatment) and, to ensure blinding, were later removed by someone other than the investigator. BV-medicated plasters were cut into test site size for application and maintained with hypoallergenic dressing. The amount of Cal/BD aerosol foam (50&#x000a0;mg) was sprayed onto test sites that were delimited by an adhesive ring, gently rubbed into the skin using a gloved finger, and covered with a non-occlusive gauze.</p><p>During the study, patients were not allowed to use any medication that could interfere with the trial results, including those requiring washout. Treatments that were permitted during the study included inhaled corticosteroids, neutral emollients on psoriasis plaques that were not treated in the trial, and WHO group I&#x02013;II corticosteroids for the treatment of scalp and facial psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute change in TCS of Cal/BD aerosol foam and BV-medicated plaster from baseline to the end of treatment (day&#x000a0;29). The severity of clinical signs (erythema, scaling, and infiltration) for each target plaque and test site was assessed by the investigator using a 7-point scale (range 0 [no evidence], 1.5 [mild-to-moderate] to 3.0 [severe]; TCS total range 0&#x02013;9), and the absolute change in TCS was calculated from the mean TCS of the three test sites per treatment.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints comparing Cal/BD aerosol foam and BV-medicated plaster included TCS change at each visit (i.e. days 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25) compared with baseline; change from baseline in clinical signs at each visit; and change in ultrasound measurements of total skin and echo-poor band thickness (mm) from baseline to end of treatment (day&#x000a0;29).</p><p>A post hoc analysis on the TCS data was conducted to compare the effect of the two treatments from baseline to end of treatment on DTT (elbow, knee, and anterior face of the tibia) and other areas (arm, trunk/back, and areas of the lower leg, except anterior).</p><p>Adverse events (AEs), with a focus on local cutaneous AEs, were also assessed throughout treatment to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Cal/BD aerosol foam and BV-medicated plaster. An AE was defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigated treatments, regardless of its cause. The severity of the AE was classified into mild, moderate, and severe categories according to the investigator or sub-investigator&#x02019;s clinical judgment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Assuming the standard deviation (SD) for the difference in TCS of 2.0 and a mean difference of 0.75, a sample size of 33 patients and three within-subject replicates of each treatment was required to detect a difference between Cal/BD aerosol foam and BV-medicated plaster with 95% power. All statistical analyses were performed on the full analysis set (FAS), which comprised all randomized patients. The absolute changes in TCS (overall and for the post hoc analysis), total skin thickness, and echo-poor band thickness from baseline to the end of treatment were analyzed using a mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA), with treatment as the fixed effect and subject as the random effect. All significance tests were two-sided using the 5% significance level and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Missing data were imputed using the method of last observation carried forward (LOCF). All data presented are LOCF and mean values are least-square means calculated from the ANOVA analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>Thirty-five patients were enrolled and randomized in the study between September and December 2015 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

The TCS has been used in several plaque trials and has proven to be both reliable and useful for the evaluation of selected test sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>In this study, the rate of improvement in TCS and the individual TCS components (i.e. erythema, scaling, and infiltration) was more rapid with Cal/BD aerosol foam than with BV-medicated plaster; a difference was observed early into treatment (from day&#x000a0;8) and was maintained throughout the study. The mean change in TCS and total skin thickness from baseline to day&#x000a0;29, and rapid onset of symptom improvements for areas treated with Cal/BD aerosol foam, was similar to that observed in a previous 4-week plaque test study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Occlusion of corticosteroids is a widely accepted method to enhance the penetration of the medication and improve its efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. BV-medicated plasters are occlusive and are specifically recommended for use on psoriasis plaques localized to DTT areas (i.e. the knees, elbows, and anterior side of the tibia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A post hoc analysis showed that Cal/BD aerosol foam was significantly more efficacious than BV-medicated plasters, even on these DTT areas (<italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Cal/BD aerosol foam and BV-medicated plasters were both well tolerated throughout the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cal/BD aerosol foam demonstrated superior efficacy compared with BV-medicated plasters, including on DTT areas of the body. Cal/BD aerosol foam may therefore provide a more successful treatment outcome in patients with psoriasis vulgaris than some of the currently available topical therapies, regardless of plaque location.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Florence Pr&#x000e9;aud from LEO Pharma for clinical trial management, and Magali Procacci-Babled from CPCAD for study coordination.
