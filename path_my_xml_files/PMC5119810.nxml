The objective was to determine whether a 10-week health promotion program (Bingocize&#x000ae;) improves functional performance and health knowledge in older adults. Participants were assigned to experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 13) or control (<italic>n</italic> = 14) groups. The intervention was administered twice per week at two independent living facilities. Pre and postfunctional performance and health knowledge were measured. Mixed between&#x02013;within subject ANOVA was used to detect differences between groups (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .05). Improvements were found in all dependent variables except lower body flexibility, systolic blood pressure, and health knowledge. Adherence was 97.31% &#x000b1; 2.59%. Bingocize&#x000ae; has the potential to help older adults remain independent by improving functional performance. Statistical improvements in health knowledge were not found, but future researchers may explore modifying the health education component or using a different measure of health knowledge to detect changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>older adults</kwd><kwd>games</kwd><kwd>health education</kwd><kwd>health promotion</kwd><kwd>functional performance</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>January-December 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-2333721415613201"><title>Introduction</title><p>Quality of life for an aging population depends on their ability to remain functionally independent and able to manage their own life for as long as possible. Loss of mobility and independence leads to lower quality of life and a heavier burden on the health care system (<xref rid="bibr8-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Freiberger, Haberle, Spirduso, &#x00026; Zijlstra, 2012</xref>). Exercise interventions and health education programs designed to improve physical and mental fitness have the potential to help reduce health care costs as well as maintain, or even improve, quality of life for older adults (<xref rid="bibr4-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Chodzko-Zajko et al., 2009</xref>). Interventions that reduce chronic disease risk and severity can decrease lifetime Medicare costs as much as 60%, yet adherence and retention of older adults to health promoting programs continue to be a challenge (<xref rid="bibr14-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Rula, Pope, &#x00026; Hoffman, 2011</xref>). Half of all adults who start an exercise program will drop out after only a few months, whereas only 15% of adults 65 years and older are participating in enough regular exercise to enhance fitness (<xref rid="bibr7-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Dishman, 1988</xref>). Although a plethora of quality health education programs are accessible, the rates of chronic diseases linked to poor lifestyle choices continue to increase. The World Health Organization determined that only 50% of chronic disease patients adhere to therapeutic treatments, for example, medications, diet modifications, and/or physical activity, despite the benefits that treatments create.</p><p>The aforementioned facts led to the development of a combination bingo and exercise program called Bingocize&#x000ae; 1.0. The goal of the exercise component was to improve measures of functional performance. Functional performance is important for older adults to perform activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Offered twice per week, each 45- to 60-min session included walking in place, light stretching, resistance training, and balance exercises. Participants completed two exercises and were allowed to rest while two numbers were called out for the bingo game. This pattern of two exercises, followed by two rolls of bingo, was continued until a participant won the game (prizes were awarded to the winners). In a 10-week study, a group of older adults residing in two assisted living facilities achieved an adherence rate more than 80% and significantly improved muscular strength, flexibility, balance, and cardiorespiratory fitness as assessed using measures commonly used to track these abilities (<xref rid="bibr6-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Crandall, Fairman, &#x00026; Anderson, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Encouraged by these successes and conversations with senior facility administrators, a health education component was added to Bingocize&#x000ae; 1.0 to create Bingocize&#x000ae; 2.0. Combining exercise and health education could potentially replace or augment existing evidence-based disease and disability prevention (EDDP) programs because aging services agencies (e.g., assisted living homes, senior community centers, etc.) often do not have the willingness, resources, or personnel to fully implement these programs. Bingocize&#x000ae; 1.0 frequently requested information on health topics such as nutrition, so program leaders often presented this information during the games. Thus, for Bingocize&#x000ae; 2.0, we designed a curriculum of health education that included topics often covered in existing self-management programs: nutrition, fall risk reduction, managing medications, stress management, and communication with physicians.</p><p>Most of the EDDP programs currently available to aging services administrators either focus on exercise <italic>or</italic> health education, and few studies have directly compared them. In one recent study, <xref rid="bibr12-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Pahor et al. (2014)</xref> compared the effects of long-term exercise versus health education alone. They compared two groups of older adults: one that participated in a long-term exercise program and one that participated in a health education only program. The exercise program significantly reduced major mobility disability over 2.6 years when compared with the health education program alone. However, they did not examine the potential additive benefits of a program combining <italic>both</italic> exercise and health education. Indeed, few studies have combined the two into one program, but there is some evidence for positive synergistic effects of the combination.</p><p>For example, <xref rid="bibr18-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Song et al. (2012)</xref> combined exercise training and self-management education in community-dwelling diabetic older adults. Triglycerides, body weight, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes self-management behavior showed significant differences compared with wait-listed controls who continued their usual activities. <xref rid="bibr13-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Park et al. (2011)</xref> administered an integrated exercise and health education program for older adults with hypertension. Exercise self-efficacy, social functioning, and systolic blood pressure (BP) were all significantly improved compared with controls who did not receive either exercise or health education programs. Thus, there is clearly a strong need for experiments that compare and contrast the benefits of multimodal health promotion programs versus single-domain interventions.</p><p>The success of any health promotion program hinges on adherence and retention, and combining exercise and health education in a fun and familiar context may be an effective strategy to reduce older adults&#x02019; numerous barriers to participation. For example, many older adults believe health promotion programs are time-consuming (<xref rid="bibr15-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Schutzer &#x00026; Graves, 2004</xref>). By combining exercise and health education programs, time requirements are reduced because fewer sessions may be required to achieve the desired effects. This includes the time required for travel to the program site, which is even greater for those using public transportation, as many older adults report lack of transportation as a barrier. Reducing the number of sessions eliminates extra trips to the program site.</p><p>In addition, older adults also tend to perceive exercise as a form of therapy rather than recreation. They think of exercise as a negative activity that leads to muscle pain and soreness rather than a positive or fun activity (<xref rid="bibr15-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Schutzer &#x00026; Graves, 2004</xref>). However, group support has been found to be a motivator for older adults with Type II diabetes (<xref rid="bibr19-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Tomlin &#x00026; Asimakopoulou, 2014</xref>). The unique addition of bingo addresses both of these barriers to older adults&#x02019; participation in health promotion programs because the game is fun and done in a group setting. Indeed, participation in just bingo alone has been found to increase socialization and some aspects of cognitive performance in older adults with Parkinson&#x02019;s and Alzheimer&#x02019;s diseases (<xref rid="bibr17-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Sobel, 2001</xref>). It has also been effectively used to increase older adults&#x02019; knowledge about their risks of medication use and possible drug interactions (<xref rid="bibr2-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Benza, Calvert, &#x00026; McQuown, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Based on previous successes of Bingocize&#x000ae; 1.0 and a strong interest in adding a health education component to Bingocize&#x000ae; 1.0, the objectives of this study were to determine the efficacy of Bingocize&#x000ae; 2.0 for improving functional performance and health knowledge in community-dwelling older adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section2-2333721415613201"><title>Method</title><sec id="section3-2333721415613201"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>A two-group quasi-experimental pretest&#x02013;posttest design was used in this study.

The researchers randomly assigned each <italic>group</italic> of residents to either the experimental (<italic>n</italic> = 15; independent living facility) or control conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 14; hospital social group). Individuals of both genders above the age of 55, who were able to participate in physical activity, and not currently active in a structured exercise program in the past 30 days were selected. Cognitive deficiencies were assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) . Participants with cognitive deficiencies that inhibited them from giving informed consent (MMSE &#x02264; 20) or inhibiting their ability to comprehend the health education information were excluded from the study. A physician&#x02019;s release to participate in physical activity was required.</p><p>Two weeks prior to the start of the investigation, two informational sessions were conducted at a local community college and in the recreational building of an independent living facility.

If they had the answer on their card, a chip was placed on the answer square. The leader provided the correct answer only after all participants attempted to find the answer on their cards.

The results determined that the intervention has the potential to improve measures of functional performance, body weight, BMI, and resting diastolic BP. Significant changes in health knowledge were not detected; although approaching statistical significance, lower body flexibility and systolic BP were not improved. There were limitations to this study. First, the number of participants was small. Second, a control group did not participate in the original Bingocize&#x000ae; 1.0 program, so it is difficult to determine the novelty of the effect of the Bingocize&#x000ae; 2.0 program.</p><p>The use of data-based exercise training principles for the exercise component of the intervention along with high adherence and retention rates may have contributed to the significant improvements in functional performance. These results are consistent with other studies that have found improvements in strength, flexibility, balance, and mobility, as well as reductions in risk of falling, when using similar multimodal training programs (<xref rid="bibr12-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Pahor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Seco et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Because caloric intake and composition were not directly manipulated in this study, the significant reductions in body weight, BMI, and resting diastolic BP were unexpected. It is difficult to achieve significant decreases in these variables without changes in diet and increases in overall energy expenditure (<xref rid="bibr1-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Benton, Whyte, &#x00026; Dyal, 2011</xref>). Participants increased overall energy expenditure and possibly changed their dietary intake and composition. During and after presentation of the nutrition information, the participants did inform the session leader of using the information to change their dietary habits. Regardless of the mechanisms responsible, the results of the intervention are consistent with a large body of evidence supporting reduced chronic disease risks in older adults after improvements in BP and body mass (<xref rid="bibr4-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Chodzko-Zajko et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The lack of significant improvements in health knowledge was surprising. Although anecdotal, many of the participants indicated learning and utilizing the health information in their daily lives throughout the intervention. We anticipated the program would improve the domains measured by the HEIQ&#x02122;. However, it is likely the participants did improve their knowledge of the topics presented during the intervention. These improvements were not detected because the HEIQ&#x02122; was likely not a valid measure of the health knowledge presented during the intervention. Constructing a measure using the actual information presented during the intervention would be a more valid way to access changes in health knowledge. For example, <xref rid="bibr5-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Clifford, Pandit, and Agness (2014)</xref> successfully used a self-constructed pre and posttest survey instrument to assess the effectiveness of a trivia-based game to improve knowledge of antibiotic use in older adults and found improvements in knowledge of antibiotic use and knowledge of the symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections.</p><p>It is also possible modifications in the presentation of the health topic materials during the program are necessary for significant improvements in the domains measured by the HEIQ&#x02122; to occur. Spending more than 2 weeks on each health topic, redesigning the bingo cards, and/or expanding upon the answers to the questions are some of the changes that may result in significant improvements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section11-2333721415613201"><title>Conclusion</title><p>As the population grows older, effective, low-cost EDDP programs will be imperative (<xref rid="bibr14-2333721415613201" ref-type="bibr">Rula et al., 2011</xref>).

The lack of significant improvements in health knowledge was discouraging, but future research is needed to determine a more valid measure of health knowledge and/or more effective strategies for enhancing the health education portion of the program.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dr. Crandall has a financial interest in the Bingocize program.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The authors received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2333721415613201"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
