attracted considerable interest in neurorehabilitation, given their ability to influence neuroplasticity. As tDCS has been shown to modulate event-related desynchronization (ERD), the neural signature of motor imagery detected for neurofeedback, a combination of the techniques was recently proposed. One limitation of this approach is that the area targeted for stimulation is the same from which the signal for neurofeedback is acquired. As tDCS may interfere with proximal electroencephalographic (EEG) electrodes, in this study our aim was to test whether contralateral tDCS could have interhemispheric effects on the spectral power of the unstimulated hemisphere, possibly mediated by transcallosal connection, and whether such effects could be used to enhance ERD magnitudes. A contralateral stimulation approach would indeed facilitate co-registration, as the stimulation electrode would be far from the recording sites.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty right-handed healthy volunteers (aged 21 to 32) participated in the study: ten assigned to cathodal, ten to anodal versus sham stimulation.

Both techniques can indeed promote neuroplasticity, thus boosting recovery when paired with a standard rehabilitation protocol [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].</p><p>tDCS is a noninvasive brain stimulation technique that consists of delivering a low-intensity direct current (usually 1-2mA in 35cm<sup>2</sup> electrodes) for a limited amount of time (10-20 minutes), through a pair of electrodes, at least one of which is placed on the scalp [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is well established that tDCS induces polarity-dependent excitability modulations, with anodal stimulation increasing and cathodal stimulation decreasing cortical excitability [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The modulation of cortical excitability influences neuroplasticity, which can eventually enhance motor recovery [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>As regards motor imagery (MI), its use in neurorehabilitation was proposed given the technique&#x02019;s ability to recruit approximately the same areas as overt movement, regardless of the residual level of motor control [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The reiterated engagement of the motor system induced by MI training is designed to promote the neuroplasticity of the area, thus enhancing recovery [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, as motor imagery is a purely mental task, it has recently been shown that a better rehabilitation outcome can be achieved when the practice is guided by a dedicated Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and a neurofeedback system in particular, as this closes the loop by providing appropriate feedback to the user.</p><p>Generally speaking, a BCI is a system that records neural activity and translates it into a control signal for a particular device (e.g. robotic arm, machine, computer) [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In addition to being used for communication or control purposes [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], BCIs have recently emerged in the context of neurorehabilitation also [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], where they are employed to decode the neurophysiological features associated with attempted movements or motor imagery to give feedback to the user accordingly (neurofeedback). At a cortical level, the neural signature of motor imagery is the event-related desynchronization (ERD) of sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) in the motor area contralateral to the movement [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. By detecting the ERD and providing contingent feedback to the patient, the BCI objectifies the motor network engagement and encourages the desired modulation of cortical rhythms, thus guiding the practice while keeping the user engaged and motivated [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Even though tDCS and neurofeedback-guided MI training are usually employed independently of each other, a combination of the two has recently been suggested [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The purpose of the combination would be to produce an ERD enhancement by means of tDCS, to facilitate BCI control [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>Several recent studies have shown that tDCS can modulate the motor imagery-induced ERD [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Most of them agree that anodal stimulation increases the strength of the ERD in the stimulated area [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], while cathodal stimulation decreases it [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It was therefore suggested that anodal tDCS could be used as a conditioning tool to enhance neurofeedback-guided MI training [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>One limitation of the approach described above is that the target area for stimulation is the same from which the ERD should be recorded to provide neurofeedback. However, since tDCS may induce artifacts in the EEG locations proximal to the stimulation electrode [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], it is not possible, at least with a traditional 2-channel tDCS device, to perform neurofeedback training <italic>during</italic> stimulation, unless the stimulation electrode is placed in a non-optimal site, which could decrease the efficacy of tDCS [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This situation is typically solved by performing tDCS stimulation first, followed by neurofeedback training [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, provided that the tDCS after-effects are sustained for a limited amount of time [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], this necessitates starting neurofeedback as quickly as possible right after stimulation. Furthermore, it has been suggested that the timing of stimulation is important for motor skill learning [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. If it were possible to find an experimental setup to facilitate EEG-tDCS co-registration, e.g. by placing the stimulation electrode far enough from the recording ones, this would simplify the application of tDCS to neurofeedback training in both the research and clinical contexts. This would also allow characterizing the tDCS effects not only after but also during stimulation, as in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>As a first aim, we investigated the feasibility of an approach where tDCS is applied during neurofeedback-guided MI training not to the ipsilateral, but to the contralateral motor cortex. This would allow simplifying the experimental setup, as the stimulation electrode would be placed far from the EEG recording sites. Our idea was to test whether it was possible to produce an enhancement of the motor imagery-induced ERD on the target motor cortex by exploiting the phenomenon of interhemispheric inhibition [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We hypothesize that tDCS may influence the ERD on the contralateral motor cortex with an opposite sign with respect to the ipsilateral modulation, i.e. that cathodal stimulation would bring about facilitation while anodal stimulation would produce an inhibition of contralateral ERDs. Since this is the first time contralateral tDCS is examined with regard to its rehabilitative potential, we applied our protocol to healthy users.</p><p>In addition to testing the feasibility of our approach to enhance neurofeedback-guided MI training, we also aimed at clarifying the remote effects of tDCS on contralateral EEG rhythms. Indeed, there are only a few studies that marginally address this issue, particularly during motor imagery, and their results are not fully consistent or comparable given the different experimental setups [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In Notturno et al. [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], where the local and remote effects of tDCS were evaluated during a finger tapping task, an increase in bilateral ERD in the alpha band was observed after anodal stimulation, while there were no effects caused by cathodal or sham (i.e. unreal) stimulation. In Lapenta et al. [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], an opposing effect of tDCS between hemispheres emerged over the ERDs induced by motor imagery. Conversely, in Wei et al [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], anodal stimulation of the right motor cortex increased the ERD of both left (ipsilateral) and right (contralateral) hand motor imagery. Finally, Roy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Baxter et al. [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] did not find stimulation to have an effect on contralateral ERDs.</p><p>In regard to the first aim of this study, i.e. testing the feasibility of contralateral tDCS for neurorehabilitation, we hypothesized a situation of single-hand motor imagery training, guided by a dedicated neurofeedback system. The motor imagery task was repeated before, during, and after stimulation, so that the contralateral tDCS effects could be characterized over time.

Ten out of twenty subjects received cathodal versus sham stimulation, while the other ten underwent anodal versus sham. All participants were blinded to their stimulation condition. The two rounds of experiments were separated by at least 24 hours, but they were always completed within a week (with a median value of the interval of 2 days). The order of real and sham stimulations was randomized and counterbalanced in each group, to compensate for the learning effect when averaging across subjects.</p><p>tDCS was delivered by a battery-driven, constant-current stimulator (neuroConn GmbH, Ehrenbergstr, Ilmenau, Germany) through a pair of round, water-soaked sponge electrodes (16 cm<sup>2</sup>). We set a current intensity of 0.7mA and a stimulation time of 15 minutes, with 20s ramp up and 25s ramp down in addition. Under the sham condition, the current was supplied for only 60s (20s ramp up, 15s of stimulation and 25s ramp down), just to mimic the physical tingling sensation at the beginning of stimulation.</p><p>The selected stimulation parameters are justified in the following lines. We chose a stimulation time of 15 minutes to make sure that tDCS effects outlasted the end of stimulation for a sufficient time to complete the experiment.

Subjects were assigned the goal of reaching the top of the screen in the shortest possible time (i.e. to produce a strong ERD), or at least to keep the cursor on a stable direction towards the top (i.e. to produce a stable desynchronization). In order to encourage the spontaneous desynchronization pattern of the user, the ERD was computed using the pair of subject-specific locations and frequency bands that best showed SMR modulation. The software therefore included two modules: one for calibration (without feedback), and one for online operation (with feedback). The two modules are detailed in the following subsections.</p><p>Both calibration and neurofeedback were organized into runs, and the runs into trials. The calibration and neurofeedback runs consisted of fifteen and ten trials, respectively.</p><p>Each trial began with the word &#x0201c;relax&#x0201d; appearing on the screen. After 2 seconds, the word &#x0201c;ready&#x0201d; was displayed, together with a warning tone and the appearance of the cursor at the bottom of the screen. Starting from second 3, the subject was asked to perform the MI task (left hand grasping) for a fixed time of 4s during system calibration (no feedback) and until the cursor reached the top (or with an 8s timeout, after which the cursor disappeared, see section 2.5.2) during online operation. The trials ended with 5 more seconds of rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193004.g002">Fig 2</xref>).</p><sec id="sec012"><title>2.5.1 Calibration</title><p>The features controlling cursor motion, the visual feedback, were selected through a short calibration phase. The calibration module included an automated artifact rejection algorithm, implemented as in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The algorithm marked the trials as outliers if their 25-40Hz power in the active period (0-7s) was higher than three standard deviations from the grand mean of this condition. The algorithm iteratively recomputed both the grand mean and the standard deviation after each outlier rejection, and stopped when no more trials matched the condition to be rejected [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>After each calibration run, the system displayed the total number of rejected trials, therefore it was possible to evaluate if the remaining ones were sufficient for feature selection. As soon as fifty clean trials were collected, the software launched an executable MATLAB file to perform the offline analysis of the data.

After segmenting the trials into overlapping 1s epochs by shifting a 1s-Blackman-Harris-window by 0.125s, we computed the power spectrum by means of a modified periodogram, and extracted from each epoch the power values in the 8-30Hz range with 2Hz bins. We considered 8-30Hz to be a reasonable range for SMR modulation, and the choice was inspired by the work in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], where feedback features covered both the alpha and the beta bands. We labeled as &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d; the epochs in the 0-2s trial period and as &#x0201c;MI&#x0201d; the ones in the 3-7s period. In order to highlight the most discriminating features of the two conditions, the determination coefficient <italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> was computed for every channel and frequency bin, as in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

The candidate locations were investigated further through time-frequency analyses and ERD time-courses, both averaged across trials. The two locations and frequency bins that best showed the spontaneous ERD were manually selected after visualization. We always selected a pair of contiguous electrodes and, if different, contiguous frequency bins. The ERDs in the selected channels would be linearly combined to form a single control signal. The weights of the linear combination were also determined manually during calibration. To guarantee better protection against the repositioning of the EEG cap between experimental days, we always tried to choose similar or identical weights for the two locations. If the ERD was significantly more evident in one of the two selected locations, we imbalanced the coefficients up to 0.6 and 0.4 in favor of the channel showing the stronger ERD.

Our initial hypothesis was that tDCS could exploit interhemispheric inhibition, i.e. that contralateral cathodal stimulation could result in facilitation of ERD on the unstimulated hemisphere, while contralateral anodal stimulation could result in inhibition.</p><p>As discussed more thoroughly in section 4.1, the analysis of ERDs did not confirm our hypothesis, at least in the case of cathodal stimulation: our results indeed suggest that, while contralateral ERDs are reduced during anodal stimulation, there is no symmetric facilitation for cathodal stimulation.</p><p>Even though ERD results suggest that contralateral tDCS is not applicable in the context of rehabilitation, spectral power analysis (see section 4.2) revealed the impact of both stimulation polarities on the cortical rhythms of the unstimulated hemisphere. The discussion on spectral power results complements and completes the previous discussion on ERD, suggesting that not only anodal but also cathodal tDCS can impact the rhythms of the unstimulated hemisphere, although the effect is not task-specific.</p><p>Finally, section 4.3 discusses the limitations of the study and the generalizability of the findings to a patient population.</p><sec id="sec023"><title>4.1 tDCS effect on ERDs</title><p>Statistical analyses highlighted significant <italic>time</italic> effects and <italic>time&#x000d7;stimulation</italic> interactions in both the anodal and cathodal groups, while no significant <italic>stimulation</italic> effects were found. However, when interpreting ERD results, it should be taken into consideration that the experiments were performed with feedback, so it is reasonable to expect a familiarization effect, both within- and between- sessions. Due to the within-session familiarization, an ERD tendency to increase their magnitude over time could be expected; the between-session effect, on the other hand, might cause the baseline ERD value at the beginning of the second day to be stronger for each subject compared to the first, provided that the participant has undergone an entire neurofeedback training session. In order to smooth the potential bias between baseline ERDs when averaging across subjects, making it possible to highlight the effect of stimulation, we designed the experiment so that the order of real and sham stimulation was counterbalanced within each group. The absence of main <italic>stimulation</italic> effects is encouraging in this sense, as it means that there was not a significant bias between real and sham simulation conditions. Lack of significant differences in every post-hoc comparison of baseline ERDs (<italic>pre-stim</italic> vs <italic>pre-sham</italic>) is further encouraging, and allows us to consider the results of comparisons at other time-levels (<italic>during-stim</italic> vs <italic>during-sham</italic> and <italic>post-stim</italic> vs <italic>post-sham</italic>) more reliable.</p><p>Turning now to the significant <italic>time</italic> effect found in both stimulation groups, we suggest it could be easily ascribable to the within-session familiarization, indeed the minimum desynchronization values tended to strengthen over the course of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193004.g004">Fig 4</xref>). However, the significant <italic>time&#x000d7;stimulation</italic> interaction reveals the possibility of an additional role of stimulation. When observing ERD trends in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193004.g004">Fig 4</xref>, it can be seen that there is one case where the increasing ERD trend is not followed, which is the real stimulation condition in the anodal group, especially in the alpha band. The case referred to is indeed the only one where, while <italic>post-sham</italic> ERDs are significantly stronger than <italic>pre-sham</italic> (so the within-session learning effect is still present in the group in the unreal stimulation condition), <italic>post-stim</italic> ERDs are not different from their baseline condition. We interpret the result by hypothesizing that anodal stimulation might have reduced contralateral ERD and this compensated for the familiarization effect, which did not manifest itself. The significant difference between the <italic>post</italic> conditions of real and sham stimulations further supports this point of view.</p><p>We interpret the results as follows: while in the cathodal group ERD behavior is not influenced by stimulation of the homologous contralateral region (indeed both the <italic>stim</italic> and <italic>sham</italic> ERDs show the same increasing tendency), anodal stimulation inhibits the generation of contralateral ERDs, particularly in the alpha band.</p><p>Our results on alpha-ERDs are consistent with the initial hypothesis that modulation over the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation has an opposite sign with respect to direct stimulation. Indeed, as previous studies have shown that anodal tDCS strengthens the motor imagery alpha-ERDs in the stimulated region [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we suggest that the same stimulation has an opposing effect when applied over the contralateral side. An opposing effect of tDCS on ERD between hemispheres was also found in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while our results are in partial disagreement with those found in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, in both [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] the feedback was encoded into a left-right cursor movement, controlled by the difference in power between electrodes in opposite hemispheres during left versus right hand motor imagery, while we gave feedback on ERD in subject-specific electrodes and bands and in a single-hand motor imagery design. Furthermore, in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] a different stimulation setup was tested (they used HD-tDCS). Overall, although both studies mentioned involve BCI-guided motor imagery with feedback, the differences in the experimental paradigms and setups may explain the discrepancy in the outcomes.</p><p>We hypothesize that enhanced activation of the left (dominant) motor cortex by means of anodal stimulation may have inhibited the right motor cortex, thus reducing the generation of ERD. Interhemispheric inhibition between motor cortices is a well-known effect [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], thought to be mediated by transcallosal connections [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Several studies have shown the possibility of modifying interhemispheric balance through noninvasive stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Nevertheless, whether or not tDCS is able to directly influence transcallosal connections is still up for debate [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Although our results seem to support this point of view, it cannot be excluded that interhemispheric modulation is mediated by subcortical structures. Indeed, the loops involved in the generation of alpha-ERDs are both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and it has recently been shown that tDCS can have effects on subcortical structures too, like the thalamus or the caudate nucleus [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Given these premises, it cannot be excluded that at least part of the long-distance effect between hemispheres is subcortical in nature. Finally, since we used a contralateral supraorbital reference, there could be a direct influence of the current flow between electrodes, which could marginally affect the ipsilateral circuits of the unstimulated hemisphere [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>].</p><p>While we found reduced alpha-ERD generation by anodal stimulation, we did not find a symmetrical facilitating effect of cathodal stimulation. Our results indeed suggest that cathodal stimulation on one hemisphere does not influence the behavior of ERDs in the unstimulated one. However, anodal and cathodal stimulations have not always been found in the literature to have symmetrical effects [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. To give an example, Notturno et al. showed that, while anodal stimulation increased movement-related alpha-ERDs in the stimulated motor cortex, neither sham nor cathodal stimulations had any effect [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We can comment that our results are in line with theirs, although mirrored to the other hemisphere. Overall, this asymmetry in the transmission of the tDCS stimulus may be supported by a model like the one in Ursino et al. [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Although not specific for interhemispheric communication, the model in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] supports the hypothesis that it is not guaranteed that the transmission of information between two cortical areas is symmetrical with respect to the type of input (inhibitory or excitatory), due to the non-linear properties of the neuronal cortical circuits. Generally speaking, the development of models to interpret the tDCS-induced modulations on cortical rhythms and their transmission between functionally related areas, e.g. specifically between motor cortices, would be useful to improve our understanding of tDCS and to guide its application. For this purpose, a model like the one in Mangia et al [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], which already integrates interhemispheric connection between motor cortices and simulates the phenomenon of ERD/ERS induced by motor imagery, could be a good starting point to capture and interpret the additional role of tDCS.</p><p>To sum up, our results suggest that alpha-ERDs in the target motor cortex can be influenced by contralateral tDCS in a polarity-specific manner. In particular, while cathodal stimulation does not induce a global effect, anodal stimulation seems to reduce contralateral ERD.</p></sec><sec id="sec024"><title>4.2 tDCS effect on spectral power</title><p>The results discussed in the previous section suggest that contralateral tDCS is not applicable in the context of BCI training. However, a second, more general aim of this work was to contribute to the understanding of the impact of tDCS on EEG rhythms between hemispheres. This section, which discusses the results of power spectral analysis, complements and completes the previous discussion on ERDs, by showing that not only anodal but also cathodal stimulation can affect contralateral EEG rhythms.</p><p>In line with previous research involving the stimulation of motor-related areas [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], we found that tDCS mainly influences the power in theta and alpha bands.</p><p>In regard to the theta band, we generally found power increments occurring during stimulation, regardless of stimulation type and task condition. However, since the effects tended to disappear after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193004.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and given the localization mainly close to the stimulation sites (C3 and Fp2), we suggest that this is a direct current effect. For the same reasons, we suggest that the alpha-power increase occurs during cathodal stimulation over central electrodes of the same type. This interpretation is in line with previous works [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] describing the tDCS artifact as a low-frequency power increase in the electrodes near the stimulation sites. Notably, the higher frequency component of the disturbance may be due to ongoing small voltage shifts of the stimulator to maintain a constant current despite the little changes in electrode-skin impedances [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In regard to more distant electrodes, the alpha-band spectral power analysis interestingly revealed both a polarity-specific and, in the anodal group, a task-specific effect of stimulation. Overall, we found that cathodal stimulation decreased contralateral alpha power, while anodal stimulation tended to increase it. Moreover, in the anodal group the power increase only appeared during motor imagery, leaving the reference condition unaffected.</p><p>The EEG rhythms in the alpha band have historically been considered resting rhythms for the brain [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] or, more recently, related to active inhibition and timing of processes [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. In the sensorimotor cortex, it has been suggested that the alpha rhythm reflects the cortico-thalamic idling rhythm, when no somatosensory input is processed and no motor output is generated [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. As the alpha rhythm desynchronizes with movement [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], reflecting activation of the area, synchronized alpha activity has also been related to active inhibition (for example, in situations where a response must be avoided, or non-related task areas have to be silenced) [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Given these premises, the widespread increase in alpha power seen in the post-anodal phase during motor imagery can be interpreted as a more inhibited state of the right motor cortex. We further hypothesize that this increase only manifests itself when the motor cortex is actively recruited, i.e. only during motor imagery, which explains why the &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d; state is unaltered. This behavior is in line with the findings of Notturno et al. [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], suggesting that only cathodal stimulation influenced the pre-trial resting condition, while it was unaffected by anodal stimulation.</p><p>With respect to ERD analysis, spectral power analysis gives some additional insights into the effect of cathodal stimulation also. Indeed, if the ERD outcomes indicate that cathodal stimulation does not affect the contralateral side, the latter analysis suggests that not only anodal, but also cathodal stimulation has long-distance effects, which is in line with previous research [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Overall, cathodal stimulation was linked to a decrease in alpha power in the right hemisphere, which may be interpreted as enhanced activation. However, although slighter, we found a similar effect in the beta bands. Furthermore, the effects were not task-dependent in this case, i.e. they were not altered by motor cortex recruitment during motor imagery, so the results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>A final interesting result of spectral power analysis concerns the overall continuity of the effects during and after stimulation. If we exclude the spectral power increase observed in the theta band and in the central electrodes of the alpha band in the cathodal group, which we previously ascribed to a direct current effect, we can indeed observe that the activation pattern in the <italic>post</italic> condition is generally the same as in the <italic>during</italic> condition. This result is in line with the work of Mangia et al. in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], indicating that the tDCS-induced alterations begin in the very first minutes of stimulation.</p><p>Altogether, spectral power results corroborate the hypothesis that anodal stimulation of the left motor cortex increases inhibition of the contralateral one. Indeed, the widespread increase in alpha power, reflecting a more inhibited state, only manifests itself when the motor cortex is actively recruited during motor imagery. In regard to the cathodal group, power data analyses add the information that not only anodal, but also cathodal stimulation has a long-distance effect, although it does not appear to influence ERD generation.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>4.3 Limitations of the study and generalizability to a patient population</title><p>One potential limitation of the study design is the presence of feedback, which has introduced a familiarization effect whereby the investigated variable, the ERD, was not stable over time. Also, the reinforcement of each participant in a slightly different band by selection of the subject-specific frequencies with spontaneous SMR modulation could have increased the variability of the data. On the other hand, feedback is important to keep the participant engaged and motivated, and its absence does not guarantee stabilization of ERDs, as boredom and lack of concentration can occur after a while and affect performance. In addition, as the particular aim of this study was to test the applicability of the setup with respect to its rehabilitative potential, we preferred using the neurofeedback-guided motor imagery training paradigm as a starting point, to evaluate the adjunctive role of stimulation. Even though both the within- and between-subject learning effects were taken into consideration when interpreting and discussing the results, it is possible that a different setup, e.g. with or without different feedback, could have led to slightly different results.</p><p>A final point we would like to discuss is the generalizability of our findings to a patient population. In particular, as this was a pilot study on healthy controls, we suggest it is not entirely correct to conclude that the same null-effect would appear in a patient population. First of all, a possible ceiling effect in SMR control could have manifested itself in healthy users. Furthermore, differences in brain physiology, e.g. the interhemispheric imbalance after stroke [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or the plastic reorganization of the brain, could modify the outcomes when translating to patients. For example, interhemispheric imbalance in stroke patients might result in contralateral cathodal tDCS having a beneficial effect on ERDs of the unstimulated hemisphere, as has been seen in motor recovery [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], by inducing relief of inhibition exerted by the contralesional side, not evident in healthy subjects. Therefore, although our findings would suggest not following the contralateral cathodal tDCS approach in the context of neurofeedback-guided motor imagery training, it cannot be excluded that a similar experimentation in stroke patients might lead to a slightly different outcome.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>5 Conclusion</title><p>Both spectral power and ERD analyses suggest that anodal tDCS of one motor cortex results in inhibition of the contralateral one. Assuming the effect of anodal tDCS to be excitatory in the stimulated cortex, this outcome would confirm our initial hypotheses that: i) the ERDs on the target motor cortex may be modulated by contralateral anodal stimulation and ii) this modulation has an opposite sign with respect to the stimulated hemisphere (which is in line with the phenomenon of interhemispheric inhibition).</p><p>Unfortunately, we did not find a symmetrical ERD enhancing effect through contralateral cathodal stimulation, which suggests that this setup is not applicable in the rehabilitation context (although differences in brain physiology and especially interhemispheric imbalance might lead to a non-null effect in the stroke patient population). Nevertheless, spectral power results suggest that not only anodal, but also cathodal stimulation can induce long-distance effects on the contralateral motor cortex. Altogether, our results support some recent findings, as in [<xref rid="pone.0193004.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], indicating the possibility of tDCS modulation being transmitted between functionally related cortical areas. We further suggest that the development of models to interpret the tDCS-induced modulations on cortical rhythms would be useful to improve understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of the technique and to guide its application.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec027"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0193004.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Electrodes, bands and weights used for each subject for the composition of the control signal.</title><p>The table shows the electrodes, bands and weights chosen for each subject after calibration for the composition of the control signal.
