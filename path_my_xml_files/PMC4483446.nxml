constraint-induced therapy (mCIT) combined with mental practice (MP) on patients with
chronic stroke. [Subjects] The subjects were 26 patients with chronic stroke. [Methods]
Patients were randomly assigned to the mCIMT + MP group or the MP group. All subjects were
administered mCIT consisting of (1) therapy emphasizing affected arm use in functional
activities 5 days/week for 6 weeks and (2) 4 hours of restraint of the less affected arm 5
days/week. The mCIT + MP subjects received 30-minute MP sessions provided directly after
therapy sessions. To compare the two groups, the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT),
Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after stroke (FM), and Korean version of Modified
Barthel Index (K-MBI) were performed. [Results] Both groups showed significant improvement
in ARAT, FM, and K-MBI after the interventions. Also, there were significant difference in
ARAT, FM, and K-MBI between the two groups. [Conclusion] mCIT remains a promising
intervention. However, its efficacy appears to be enhanced by use of MP after mCIT
clinical sessions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Mental practice</kwd><kwd>Motor imagery</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>During mental practice (MP), physical activities are mentally rehearsed, usually in the

The same muscular<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and neural structures<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>
subserve both physical and mental practice, enabling MP to offer similar benefits to
rehabilitation in patients with stroke. For example, MP can be used as a method of acquiring
additional practice attempts in rehabilitation settings<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, especially when physical activity is not possible due to severe
impairment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In stroke rehabilitation
settings, the addition of MP to repetitive, task-oriented training regimens significantly
increases affected arm use<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and function
in subacute<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> and chronic patients<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this was also reported in a recent, randomized controlled
trial<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) is an outpatient-based, task-oriented
training protocol that increases affected arm use and function at all stage after a
stroke<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. During mCIMT, affected arm use is emphasized in 2 ways, each
administered during a 6-week period: (1) Patients participate in half-hour task-oriented
training sessions occurring 3 days/week that emphasize affected arm use. Shaping is also
applied during the therapy sessions, in which subjects are verbally encouraged to perform
progressively more difficult components of the activity. (2) Patients practice activities of
daily living (ADLs) with the affected arm for 5 hours/day every weekday.</p><p>Given the success of MP when combined with other task-oriented training regimens, this
study examined whether the addition of MP, provided directly after clinical mCIT sessions,
increases the mCIT treatment effect. We hypothesized that subjects receiving mCIT and MP
would exhibit lager reductions in affected arm functional limitation and impairment than in
those receiving mCIT only.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>SUBEJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Volunteers were recruited in a local rehabilitation hospital. A researcher screened
volunteers using the following study criteria derived from previous mCIT research: (1)
history of no more than one stroke; (2) ability to actively extend at least 10&#x000b0; at the
metacarpophalangeal joints of each digit and actively extend 20&#x000b0; at the wrist; (3) stroke
experienced &#x0003e; 6 months before study participation; (4) a score &#x02265; 24 on the Korean version
of Mini Mental Status Examination, and (5) affected arm nonuse, defined as a score &#x0003c; 2.5
for the amount of use scale of the Motor Activity Log. The researcher also applied the
following exclusion criteria: (1) excessive spasticity at the affected arm joint and (2)
excessive pain anywhere in the affected limb.</p><p>The researcher examined the following 3 outcome measures: the Action Research Arm Test
(ARAT)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, the 66-point upper extremity
section of the Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Motor Recovery after stroke (FM)<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the Korean version of the Modified
Barthel Index (K-MBI). The ARAT is a 19-item, 57-point test divided into 4 categories
(grasp, grip, pinch, and gross movement), with each item graded on a 4-point ordinal scale
(anchored by 0=can perform no part of the test; 3=performs test normally). It has high
intrarater (r<sup>2</sup>=0.99) and retest (r<sup>2</sup>=0.98) reliability and
validity<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. The FM assesses impairment using a 3-point ordinal scale (anchored
by 0=cannot perform; 2=can perform fully). It offers impressive test-retest reliability
(total=0.98 to 0.99; subtest=0.87 to 1.00)<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>, interrater reliability, and construct validity. The K-MBI is a
10-item, 100-point test, with each item graded ordinal scale with a given number of points
assigned to each level. The range of the score of the K-MBI is 0 to 100, with a higher score
implying more independence in ADLs. The K-MBI has high validity (r<sup>2</sup>=0.94) and
reliability (r<sup>2</sup>=0.97). The main study goal was to compare difference in motor
outcomes associated with participation in the 2 interventions.</p><p>One week after screening and signing consent forms approved by the local Institutional
Review Board, all subjects were administered the outcome measures. All of the instruments
were administered by a research assistant with 5&#x02005;years of experience in using the measures.
After this testing session, the subjects were then randomly assigned to one of 2 groups
using a random number table: (1) mCIT (n=13); or mCIT with MP administered directly after
the mCIT clinical sessions (mCIT + MP; n=13).</p><p>Each subject began a regimen of 30-min sessions of individualized therapy administered 5
times/week for 6 weeks by the same therapist. Approximately 25 minutes of the therapy
concentrated on use of more affected limb in the ADLs listed in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Audiotape sequence and when tape was used</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tape<break/>No.</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Functional task described</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">When<break/>administered</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Reaching for and grasping an object</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weeks 1, 2</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Proper use of pencil or pen</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weeks 3, 4</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Turning a page in a book</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weeks 5, 6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>. Approximately 5 minutes of therapy was spent on the range of motion of the
more affected limb as needed. Shaping techniques were used with the ADLs to encourage motor
learning and increase the difficulty of the tasks in proportion to the subject&#x02019;s
abilities.</p><p>During the same 6 weeks, the subject&#x02019;s unaffected hands and wrists were restrained every
weekday for 4 hours identified as a time of frequent arm use. The hands and wrists were
restrained using holding mitts with Velcro straps around the wrist (Sammons Preston). Logs
were kept to document device use time as well as activities performed during restraint
hours.</p><p>In addition to mCIT participation, subjects randomly assigned to the mCIT + MP group also
engaged in MP sessions. These 30-minute sessions were held directly after the clinical mCIT
sessions in a quiet treatment room. MP subjects received the appropriate MP intervention
corresponding to the week of therapy in which they were currently engaged (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). All MP interventions were administered
with audiotapes that were consistent in terms of content and duration with the MP tapes
described by Page and colleagues<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
content of the tapes covered ADLs that subjects were also practicing during mCIT clinical
sessions and consisted of (1) approximately 5 minutes of guided relaxation exercises; (2) 15
to 20 minutes of guided motor imagery, in which the subject was instructed to imagine
himself/herself performing each component of each ADL; and (3) 5 minutes of refocusing into
the room. For example, when mentally practicing reaching for a cup, the subject was taken
through the visual image of reaching for the object from the first-person perspective, as
well as the sensations associated with reaching for it (e.g. the feeling of extending the
elbow and fingers and the feeling of the object in their hand). The scripts for the tapes
were read by and occupational therapist with over 6&#x02005;years of clinical experience. Subjects
were instructed to not mentally practice in environments other than those that were part of
this study. All subjects were assessed immediately after the 6-week interventions. The ARAT,
FM, and K-MBI were administered by the same examiner who had performed the pre-test
assessments and was blinded to group assignment. The researcher emphasizes that both groups
received the same amount of time with the occupational therapists, i.e., during the mCIT
only because the MP intervention was self-administered with an audiotape.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Applying the inclusion criteria, 38 subjects were screened for this study, with 12 excluded

test could not be satisfied. Thus, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Mann-Whitney U test
were applied and revealed no significant differences between the groups in mean age and mean
time since stroke. The pre-intervention ARAT, FM, and K-MBI scores also did not
significantly differ between the groups.</p><p>After the interventions, the subjects in both groups exhibited significant increases in the
scores of the ARAT, FM, and K-MBI. Qualitatively, all subjects reported using their more
affected limbs for the ADLs listed in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> as
well as new ADLs such as grooming and dressing. Comparison of the scores between the pre-
and post-intervention assessments revealed that the mCIT + MP group exhibited a mean
increase of +15.00 points on the ARAT, +8.00 points on the FM, and +11.69 points on the
K-MBI. Subjects in the mCIT only group displayed a mean increase of +12.23 points on the
ARAT, +4.23 points on the FM, and +6.31 points on the K-MBI. Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank
test, the mCIT + MP group revealed a significant improvement at the post-intervention
assessments with regard to the ARAT (p&#x0003c;0.05), FM (p&#x0003c;0.05), and K-MBI (p&#x0003c;0.05). The
control group also showed significantly improvement in the ARAT (p&#x0003c;0.05), FM (p&#x0003c;0.05),
and K-MBI (p&#x0003c;0.05). There were statistically significant differences in the changes in
the ARAT (p&#x0003c;0.05), FM (p&#x0003c;0.05), and K-MBI (p&#x0003c;0.05) between the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Modified constraint-induced therapy is an approach encouraging affected arm use through
participation in clinical practice sessions. Given the efficacy of MP when combined with
other promising approaches, the current study examined the efficacy of MP when combined with
mCIT.</p><p>Consistent with previous mCIT studies<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, all subjects exhibited sizable changes in
the outcome measures. These motor changes were clinically significant, conveying ability to
perform skills. As noted earlier, MP elicits neural and muscular activations that are
similar to those exhibited during physical performance of a task. Thus, the author
hypothesized that participation in a mCIT and MP would provide more practice attempts for
the affected cortical areas than mCIT only. This increased practice would be behaviorally
manifested in mCIT + MP subjects exhibiting lager functional limitation reductions
(reflected by increased ARAT scores), decreased impairment of the more affected arm
(reflected by increased FM scores), and larger increases in activities of daily living skill
(reflected by increased K-MBI scores) than in subjects receiving mCIT only. Consistent with
the author&#x02019;s hypothesis, the mCIT + MP subjects exhibited significantly larger changes in
the scores of the ARAT, FM, and K-MBI than mCIT only subjects (<xref rid="tbl_003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Patients&#x002bc; ARAT, FM, and K-MBI scores before and after the interventions</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="3" align="left" colspan="1"/><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">ARAT</th><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">FM</th><th colspan="3" align="center" rowspan="1">K-MBI</th></tr><tr><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th><th colspan="3" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Change</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Change</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Pre</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Post</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Change</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">mCIT+MP (n=13)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.8 (1.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.8 (1.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.0 (0.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.6 (3.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">41.6 (3.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.0 (1.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71.4 (5.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.1 (5.3)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.7 (2.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">mCIT (n=13)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">27.3 (1.1)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.5 (2.0)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.2 (1.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.4 (2.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.6 (2.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.2 (0.6)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">75.2 (5.9)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">81.5 (4.4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.3 (1.3)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean (SD). &#x0201c;Change&#x0201d; refer to mean change in score</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>).

The author
hypothesizes that the combination of mCIT and MP participation provided substantially more
practice opportunities and more opportunities for neural plasticity to occur than
participation in mCIT only. The preponderance of other studies showing effects of MP would
seem to argue for the validity of the data reported here. Nonetheless, the small size and
lack of assessment of fidelity of the MP intervention (other than the subjects telling the
researcher that they adhered to the intervention) are possible study limitations.</p><p>In future studies, this study should be replicated with a larger group of subjects. Also
future researchers should consider examining such changes using neuroimaging.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>YW</given-names></name><name><surname>Nam</surname><given-names>KS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effect of mental training on the balance control ability
