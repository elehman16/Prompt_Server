Tremblay [2008]). When a value below the limit of detection [&#x0003c;0.01 IUPM peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)] was obtained, an imputed value of 0.01 was used to perform statistical analyses. Briefly, PBMCs were resuspended at a concentration of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells per milliliter in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Sigma), penicillin (50 U/mL) (Gibco, Burlington, ON), streptomycin (50 mg/mL) (Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada), <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (2 mM) (Gibco), HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) buffer (10 mM) (Gibco), and recombinant human interleukin 2 (100 U/mL) (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). Six 5-fold PBMC dilutions ranging from 25 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> to 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> PBMCs were made.

Overall, the vaccine regimen had no demonstrable impact on the size of the viral reservoir as measured by viral outgrowth assay.</p><p>Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based quantification of cell-associated HIV-1 DNA is the most common technique for measuring the size of the viral reservoir<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> because of the relative simplicity of this method,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> the viral outgrowth assay is currently considered the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; for measuring cells harboring latent virus able to replicate.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The use of this assay in this viral reservoir substudy is, therefore, one of the strengths of this substudy.

However, the addition of gag-stimulated CTLs to the cell cultures did result in the death of infected CD4 T-cells.</p><p>We acknowledge that the small number of individuals who participated in this substudy is one of its limitations. Unfortunately, the complexity and demands of the substudy precluded the recruitment of large numbers of participants. However, the small number of participants did not likely prevent the observation of a vaccine effect because there was not even a trend toward decreased viral reservoir size in response to vaccination. Furthermore, these disappointing results are consistent with those of other trials of therapeutic vaccine candidates tested in effectively treated participants. As a next step, novel therapeutic vaccines containing immunogens capable of inducing functional CTL responses to HIV epitopes will need to be developed.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> When combined with pharmacological agents that reverse HIV latency, these next generation therapeutic vaccines could play a critical role in reducing the size of the viral reservoir.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Annie Chamberland and Mohamed Sylla for processing the blood samples and for performing the viral outgrowth assays, and St&#x000e9;phanie Matte for enrolling participants.</p><p>The authors would also like to thank Dr Johnson Wong for the kind gift of CD3/CD8-bispecific monoclonal antibody.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Canadian HIV Trials Network (CTN 173).
