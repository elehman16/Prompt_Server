Secondary outcomes included remission, Drug Attitudes Inventory (DAI), and EuroQoL quality of life scale. We present interim analyses of 3 month data with general linear and logistic regression models, clustered by centre and adjusted for baseline scores and demographics.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Recruitment time, now finished, was extended to reach target sample size, so 12 month data are incomplete. 258 were allocated to PSI or TAU. 18 dropped-out before baseline assessment: 240 entered the modified intention to treat analysis (PSI 121, TAU 119). After PSI, 71% were followed-up at 3 months; after TAU, 80%. No baseline variable significantly predicted this attrition.</p><p>Webpages covering illness and treatment had 244&#x02013;290 hits each. Only 24% of the PSI group set up SMS text reminders. At least 70% attended motivational interviewing, 77% of these for all sessions. Mean California Patient Alliance Scale item score was 5.2 (95% Confidence Interval, CI, 5.0, 5.3; score 1&#x02013;7 poor-good).</p><p>Mean baseline SOFAS (SD) for the PSI group was 62 (14); for TAU 62 (15). General linear modelling of 12 week data included baseline CRS and drug attitudes: marginal mean SOFAS after PSI was 65.3 (CI 62.6, 68.0) and after TAU 61.4 (CI 59.3, 63.4; p0.025; standardised effect size Glass&#x02019; &#x00394;=0.41). Median (IQR) compliance score was 6 (5,7) at baseline for PSI and 6 (6,7) for TAU; and 6 (5,7) at 3 months in both groups (ordinal logistic regression, p0.36).</p><p>In secondary analyses 3 month DAI did not differ significantly between PSI and TAU (marginal means 13.5 v 11.5, bootstrapped p0.164). EuroQoL wellbeing score was significantly better after PSI (marginal means 76.0 v 69.1, bootstrapped p0.003) and remission was significantly commoner (72 v 54%, binary logistic regression p0.007). No analysis result was sensitive to probability weighted adjustment for drop out.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Interim analyses indicate that immediately after PSI social function and wellbeing improved significantly and remission was commoner. Adherence and DAI did not differ significantly. Either PSI&#x02019;s immediate benefits were non-specific or adherence measures failed to capture its effect. Longer term effects are unclear until definitive analyses planned before 2018.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="1"/></counts></article-meta></front></article>
