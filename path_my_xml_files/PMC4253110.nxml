Exploring the mechanical properties of the root canal surface that includes predentin and its underlying newly formed dentin in immature teeth is challenging due to the required metallographic preparation of dentin to perform any valid traditional mechanical test such as flexural strength, microhardness, or nanohardness. Recently, a new BioDent indenter was suggested to measure the indentation properties of bone, as well as root canal dentin surfaces without the need for any metallographic preparation using a technique known as reference point indentation (RPI).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The RPI approach relies on a reference probe, which stays on the hard tissue surface, and a test probe, which slides relative to the reference probe while indenting the measured hard tissue. Some parameters obtained from BioDent indenter in bone studies were suggested to correlate with and predict energy to fracture obtained through traditional mechanical testing.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of intracanal antibiotic medicaments used in endodontic regeneration and EDTA on the microindentation properties and hardness of root canal dentin surfaces and polished radicular dentin using the RPI technique and a traditional microhardness technique, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>BioDent experiment</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Ten immature human mandibular premolars previously stored in 0.1% thymol at 4&#x000b0;C were used within 6 months of extraction after obtaining Indiana university Institutional Review Board approval to use human teeth (IRB number; 1305011353). The inclusion criteria were the absence of caries, root cracks, or restorations. Furthermore, each immature tooth had to have at least a 1 mm-diameter opening at the apical foramen with two-thirds of the root formed. Each tooth was decoronated, and two 4 mm root dentin cylinders were obtained from the coronal and middle thirds of each root utilizing a water-cooled low-speed diamond saw (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL, USA). The pulp tissue was extirpated with a barbed broach without touching the root canal surface. Four specimens were obtained from each root by sectioning each cylinder longitudinally across the maximum diameter of the root canal into two specimens without touching the root canal dentin surface.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Treatment procedure</title><p>A TAP was prepared by mixing USP-grade antibiotic powders compounded of equal portions of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline (Champs Pharmacy, San Antonio, TX, USA) with sterile water (1 g/mL). A DAP was prepared by mixing USP-grade antibiotic powders compounded of equal portions of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin (Champs) with sterile water (1 g/mL). The four specimens obtained from each root were randomly assigned to three treatment groups (TAP + EDTA, DAP + EDTA, and only EDTA) and one Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) control group. Then, specimens were placed in a 2 mL conical sample cup (Fisher Scientific, Florence, KY, USA) containing 0.15 mL of one of the treatment pastes or HBSS for the EDTA and control groups. Thus, the root canal dentin surface of each specimen in the antibiotic groups was covered with 0.3 mm layer of the treatment paste. The containers were stored at 37&#x000b0;C with an approximately 100% relative humidity for 4-week. After that, the specimens were taken out and rinsed thoroughly with sterile water for 30s.

However, polishing root canal dentin would remove the superficial predentin layer as well as the underlying newly formed inner radicular dentin with higher tubular density. Therefore, trying to study the indentation properties of the intact root canal surface without metallographic manipulation would be more representative of the actual clinical situation. This study proposes a novel direct mechanical test to characterize the intact root canal dentin surface after exposure to antibiotic medicaments and EDTA solution. A traditional microhardness mechanical test was also performed in this study on polished radicular dentin to compare the magnitude of hardness reduction in both approaches. However, no statistical correlation was performed between the two types of hardness due to the different nature of the examined dentin (unpolished intact dentin versus polished dentin). Dentine hardness property has been related to other mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity, compressive strength and tensile strength.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Indeed, a recent investigation observed that a significant reduction in root fracture resistance after 3 months intracanal treatment with DAP and TAP was proceeded by a significant reduction in dentin microhardness after 1-month treatment with the same medicaments.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, the percentage reduction in estimated dentin hardness from the RPI experiment were significantly higher in DAP + EDTA (53%) and TAP + EDTA (58%) treated dentin compared to EDTA-treated dentin (26%). Furthermore, the percentage reduction in hardness of DAP + EDTA and TAP + EDTA-treated dentin reported in this study was higher than 4-week DAP, and TAP treated dentin reported in a recent study using the same RPI technique, which was 40% and 50%, respectively.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] This indicates that the use of antibiotic intracanal medicaments followed by EDTA irrigation have an additive effect on the reduction of dentin hardness. This could be explained by the ability of EDTA to chelate calcium and cause superficial dentin demineralization as well as the acidic nature of antibiotic medicaments and their ability to demineralize dentin.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In this study, the percentage reduction in hardness reported using RPI of both EDTA-treated dentin (26%) and DAP + EDTA (53%) treated dentin were higher than the percentage reduction in Vickers hardness, which was 14% for EDTA-treated dentin and 39% for DAP + EDTA treated dentin. This could be explained by the ability of the RPI technique to test the root canal surface dentin which is expected to be weaker due to the high density of dentin tubules in this area and the presence of predentin. On the other hand, the percentage reduction in hardness reported using RPI of TAP + EDTA (58%) treated dentin were lower than the percentage reduction in Vickers microhardness using a traditional experiment, which was 70% for TAP + EDTA-treated dentin. The inability of the RPI technique to detect more reduction in microhardness for TAP + EDTA treated dentin compared to the Vickers microhardness technique could be explained by the severe dentin erosive effect caused by the highly acidic nature of TAP. A recent study has shown that 4-week dentin treatment with TAP followed by EDTA caused an average surface loss of 67 &#x003bc;m.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The estimated hardness values obtained from first-cycle ID depends mainly on the depth of penetration of the test probe into dentin in relative to the reference probe. The presence of surface loss on the measured surface after treatment may greatly decrease the first cycle ID and thus affect the magnitude of the estimated hardness. This might be considered as one of the limitations of the RPI technique when used to measure the effect of solutions/medicaments with high erosive potential on a hard tissue. The above reason could also explain the inability of the RPI technique to significantly differentiate between DAP + EDTA and TAP + EDTA treated dentin. A significant difference was detected between DAP + EDTA and TAP + EDTA treated dentin when Vickers microhardness was used. The significantly lower Vickers microhardness of TAP compared to DAP in the current study could be explained by the relatively low pH of TAP compared to DAP[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] as well as the presence of minocyclin in TAP, which was suggested to chelate calcium and demineralize dental hard tissues.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Additional indentation properties are obtained from the RPI technique by applying repetitive loading.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Therefore, 10 indentation cycles were used in the current study as an attempt to obtain more quantitative variables regarding the mechanical behavior of the treated dentin. The total ID variable reported in this study showed the same significant trends to first cycle ID and the estimated hardness, which might be considered as another reliable variable for differentiating between various dentin treatments. The IDI of TAP + EDTA and DAP + EDTA-treated dentin was significantly greater than EDTA-treated and control dentin. Recent studies on bone have shown a significant correlation between IDI and modulus of toughness estimated by three-point bending mechanical tests[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] as well as crack growth toughness.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, IDI of TAP + EDTA and DAP + EDTA treated dentin were not significantly different from each other, nor were EDTA-treated and control dentin. This indicates that the IDI variable was less sensitive in detecting significant differences after various dentin treatments compared to first cycle ID and total ID.</p><p>In the current study, 1 g/mL of TAP and DAP were used since these are the concentration required to create a pasty consistency that can be applied into the infected immature root canal.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Some concerns have been raised regarding the use of these relatively high concentrations during endodontic regeneration. These concerns include the negative effects of TAP and DAP on the mechanical properties of radicular dentin[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and direct or indirect cytotoxic effects of TAP and DAP on human stem cells of the apical papilla[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and human dental pulp cells.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] The American Association of Endodontists has recommended the use of low concentrations of the antibiotic medicaments.[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] However, nondiluted TAP is still the most commonly used medicaments in the majority of the recently published clinical studies[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and there is no clinical evidence supporting the efficiency of low concentrations of antibiotic medicaments in endodontic regeneration. The use of lower concentrations of these antibiotic medicaments might be a good approach to minimize their negative effect on the mechanical properties of radicular dentin. However, further studies are required to support this suggestion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Both polished and intact root canal dentin treated with antibiotic pastes followed by EDTA had significant increases in indentation properties and significant reduction in microhardness compared to untreated control dentin and EDTA-treated dentin.

The currently used clinical endodontic regeneration protocols that include intracanal application of TAP followed by EDTA irrigation may cause a significant reduction in hardness of radicular dentin ranging from 58% to 70%.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
