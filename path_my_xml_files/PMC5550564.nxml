Ketogenic diets seem to minimise or supress some of these responses. The aim of this study was to determine the timeline over which changes in appetite occur during progressive WL with a ketogenic very-low-energy diet (VLED).</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects/methods:</title><p>Thirty-one sedentary adults (18 men), with obesity (body mass index: 37&#x000b1;4.5&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) underwent 8 weeks (wks) of a VLED followed by 4 wks of weight maintenance. Body weight and composition, subjective feelings of appetite and appetite-related hormones (insulin, active ghrelin (AG), active GLP-1, total PYY and CCK) were measured in fasting and postprandially, at baseline, on day 3 of the diet, 5 and 10% WL, and at wks 9 and 13. Data are shown as mean&#x000b1;s.d.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>A significant increase in fasting hunger was observed by day 3 (2&#x000b1;1% WL), (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), 5% WL (12&#x000b1;8 days) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and wk 13 (17&#x000b1;2% WL) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Increased desire to eat was observed by day 3 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and 5% WL (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Postprandial prospective food consumption was significantly reduced at wk 9 (16&#x000b1;2% WL) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01). Basal total PYY was significantly reduced at 10% WL (32&#x000b1;8 days) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Postprandial active GLP-1 was increased at 5% WL (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) and CCK reduced at 5 and 10% WL (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01, for both) and wk 9 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Basal and postprandial AG were significantly increased at wk 13 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001, both).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>WL with a ketogenic VLED transiently increases the drive to eat up to 3 weeks (5% WL). After that, and while participants are ketotic, a 10&#x02013;17% WL is not associated with increased appetite. However, hunger feelings and AG concentrations increase significantly from baseline, once refeeding occurs.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide and is associated with negative public health consequences and large socioeconomic costs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> A weight loss (WL) between 5 and 10% of baseline weight, if sustained, can have large health benefits by preventing or improving several obesity-related risk factors and comorbidities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Even though this can be achieved in the short-term with lifestyle interventions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> most adults will experience weight regain in the long term.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup></p><p>Maintaining lost weight is physiologically challenging, as diet-induced WL is associated with compensatory responses on both sides of the energy balance equation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> These responses are driven by a cross talk between the gut and the brain, leading to an increase in appetite and reduction in satiety,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> concomitant with an overall reduction in energy expenditure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> These mechanisms can reduce WL rate and increases the risk of relapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup> An increase in ghrelin plasma concentration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> and a reduction in the concentration of several satiety hormones, such as peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> and cholecystokinin (CCK)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> has also been reported with diet-induced WL.</p><p>To our knowledge, no studies to date have determined how appetite is affected with progressive WL. With a WL of only 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;kg being shown to increase subjective feelings of hunger,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> and a WL of 0.8&#x02009;kg associated with an increase in postprandial total ghrelin and a reduction in subjective feelings of fullness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> it is not surprising that adults find WL maintenance extremely hard. However, when carbohydrates and/or energy (using a very-low-energy diet (VLED)) are restricted sufficiently to induce ketosis, the increase in appetite seen with WL appears to be absent.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> This has contributed to the generalised idea that ketogenic diets are easy to follow. Most of the studies looking at the impact of WL induced with ketogenic diets on appetite have, nevertheless, been done in females<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> and none has investigated how long time does it take for appetite suppression to occur under ketogenic diets. Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to assess the timeline over which changes in both subjective feelings of appetite and appetite-related hormones are activated during WL with a ketogenic VLED. A secondary aim was to assess if males and females respond differently.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy adults with obesity (30&#x0003c;BMI &#x0003c;45&#x02009;kg&#x02009;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) were recruited via newspaper advertising serving the community of Trondheim, Norway. The study was approved by the regional ethics committee (Ref., 2012/1901). The study was registered in ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT01834859), and conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants provided written informed consent before commencement.</p><p>Participants were required to be weight stable (&#x0003c;2&#x02009;kg body weight change over the last 3 months), not currently dieting to lose weight, and with a sedentary lifestyle (not engaged in strenuous work or in regular brisk leisure time exercise more than once a week or in light exercise for more than 20&#x02009;min per day in more than 3 times per week). Due to the known effect of phase of menstrual cycle on appetite<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref></sup> females had to be postmenopausal or taking hormonal contraceptives.

Previous studies looking at the impact of an acute period of energy restriction on appetite in people with normal weight and overweight (ranging from 1 to 4 days; between 60 and 85% energy restriction and inducing a WL between 0.8 and 2.4&#x02009;kg) report an increase in feelings of hunger (desire to eat and PFC), both in the fasting and postprandial state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> Interestingly, these were not accompanied by changes in either AG,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> total ghrelin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref></sup> or GLP-1,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref></sup> which is in line with our findings.

The different hormone fraction, lower BMI, lower energy intake and different sex distribution compared to our study probably accounts for some of these differences. However, in our study sex responses were apparent. Males (which would be more easily comparable with Pasiakos and colleagues study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup>), displayed no changes in AG.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> Unfortunately, none of the previously mentioned studies measured ketosis during WL.</p><p>After 5% WL (12&#x000b1;8 days), feelings of hunger and desire to eat in fasting remained elevated, GLP-1 AUC had increased significantly and CCK AUC was significantly reduced.

Diepvens <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref></sup>, where females with overweight experienced an 11% WL with a VLED, reported a significant reduction in basal concentration of AG and no changes in CCK or GLP-1 concentration (either fasting or postprandial). Similar to us, Soenen <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> reported a significant reduction in basal concentration of PYY after a 6% WL (4 weeks VLED).</p><p>A recent meta-analysis by Gibson <italic>et al.</italic> reported that losing weight with a ketogenic diet is associated with a reduction in hunger and increase in fullness feelings. All but one of the studies included in the analyses had average &#x003b2;-HB plasma concentration around 0.50&#x02009;mmol&#x02009;l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> It is surprising that hunger feelings in fasting in our study were increased on day 3 and 5% WL, but not at 10% WL, even though &#x003b2;-HB concentration did not differ from 5% WL. The reasons for this mismatch between &#x003b2;-HB concentration and subjective appetite feelings are unknown. However, it can be that participants got used to feeling hungry and that this perception therefore was attenuated overtime. Moreover, a recent review has suggested that other factors such as free fatty acids, reactive oxygen species and microbiota may also play a role.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref></sup></p><p>At week 9, with a 16&#x000b1;2% WL and ketosis, no changes in subjective feelings of appetite were seen, with the exception of PFC AUC, which was reduced compared to baseline in all participants and females. Basal active GLP-1 was significantly reduced in males and GLP-1 AUC was increased in females, while CCK AUC was reduced in all participants and males. Only a few studies have looked at the impact of a WL&#x0003e;10% under ketosis on appetite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup> In the systematic review and meta-analysis from Gibson <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup>, a significant increase in fullness, and decrease in hunger feelings were reported while ketotic, with a WL ranging from 5 to 12.5&#x02009;kg. After 4 weeks of weight stabilisation and without ketosis, the only significant changes observed were increased hunger feelings in fasting (in all participants and females) and increased basal and postprandial concentration of AG.</p><p>Sumithran <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref></sup>, in a similar WL intervention, reported no changes in subjective feelings of appetite and a significant decrease in basal active GLP-1, but different from our study a significant decrease in basal PYY and CCK, and a significant decrease in postprandial concentration of PYY at week 9 under ketosis. After 2 weeks of weight stabilisation and no ketosis, appetite feelings were increased. Both basal and postprandial concentration of AG were also increased, which is in line with our findings. Opposite to our findings, both basal active GLP-1 and CCK plasma concentration, and postprandial PYY and CCK concentration were reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> This discrepancy may be due to differences in the duration of the weight stabilisation period and/or lack of power. It is possible that more than 2 weeks of weight stabilisation are needed for the concentration of satiety hormones to normalise. Another study by Chearskul <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup> with an 8-week VLED (429&#x02009;kcal per day) in 12 males with obesity who experienced a 15% WL, did not report any changes in hunger or satiety feelings, or CCK concentration, either fasting or postprandial, immediately after the intervention, while in ketosis. However, 1 week later and without ketosis, a significant reduction in postprandial CCK was described (opposite to our study where no changes were seen). Again, differences in the duration of the stabilisation phase might have impacted on the results. In a recently published study, Iepsen <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> reported a significant increase in fasting and postprandial total ghrelin, and PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> and postprandial concentration of total GLP-1 after a 17% WL induced with an 810&#x02009;kcal per day diet over 8 weeks when participants were out of ketosis. Differences in the hormones&#x02019; fractions measured may account for some of the differences.</p><p>The increased hunger feelings and AG plasma concentrations seen after refeeding (week 13) in the present study may have important implications regarding WL outcomes. A recent study has reported that the increase in appetite seen with WL was three times larger than the corresponding reduction in total energy expenditure, highlighting the important role the feedback control of energy intake may have on long-term maintenance of a reduced body weight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref></sup></p><p>Throughout the study period, a mismatch was apparent between subjective appetite feelings and anticipated relevant appetite-related hormones. Among others, there was an increase in hunger on day 3 (2&#x000b1;1% WL), despite no changes in appetite hormones except for insulin, and 5% WL, despite an increase in GLP-1 AUC and a reduction in CCK. Even though this mismatch can derive from lack of power, it is well known that the appetite control system is extremely complex and subjective feelings of appetite are not always correlated with the concentration of appetite-related hormones.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref></sup> Pre-lunch plasma concentrations of total ghrelin and PYY were also found not to be associated with lunch energy intake in healthy women.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref></sup> Moreover, a recent review by Holt <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref></sup> concluded that self-reported appetite ratings of appetite cannot reliably predict subsequent energy intake.</p><p>As previously described, some sex differences were noted in both subjective feelings of appetite and appetite hormones with progressive WL. The fact that males, as opposed to females, reported no increase in hunger throughout the study (despite increased AG at week 13 (16&#x000b1;2% WL)) is surprising. Females were found to have a more sensitive neuronal response to food-related visual cues, which can contribute to the sex differences reported in the present study. Moreover, in our study, females had overall higher fullness AUC, and overall higher basal and AUC for AG, while males had overall higher hunger, desire to eat and PFC AUC. This is in line with previous findings showing that females have a higher satiating response to meals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref></sup> and lower ratings of hunger and PFC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref></sup> It needs to be acknowledged, nevertheless, that with the VLED used in this study, males had a much larger energy deficit per day compared with females, which resulted in a larger overall absolute WL, and this might have contributed to the sex differences reported.</p><p>A strength of this study is its design; the fact that multiple measurements were undertaken during progressive WL under ketosis, and after a period of weight stabilisation and no ketosis. This is important, given that ketosis is thought to modulate appetite.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> Moreover, subjective and objective aspects of appetite were assessed, both in fasting and after a meal. Compliance with the intervention was monitored throughout and was excellent. The choice of time points is also a strength, given that it allowed to evaluate the impact of minimal, but significant WL (achieved at day 3), 5 and 10% WL, considered necessary to achieved health benefits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> and large WL (16&#x02013;17%) under ketosis vs no ketosis, on appetite outcomes. It is also a strength that we have adjusted for the increased risk of finding statistically significant differences by chance alone (by using Bonferroni adjustment for multiple time comparisons and the Benjamini&#x02014;Hochberg method for multiple outcome variables).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> A limitation of this study is that it may be underpowered to examine sex differences.</p><p>This study has important practical implications for patients, clinicians and researchers alike. Opposite to previous reports that the drive to eat is suppressed while under a ketogenic diet,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref></sup> we have shown a transitory increase in hunger from baseline up to 3 weeks on a ketogenic VLED, which then disappear and only come back after refeeding (and no ketosis). This information is of importance because it can influence patients&#x02019; expectations and adherence to VLEDs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Progressive WL with a ketogenic VLED induces a transient increase in fasting hunger feelings up to 5% WL (3 weeks), despite no changes in AG and an increase in active GLP-1 AUC. A WL between 10 and 17% under ketosis is not associated with increased appetite feelings or AG plasma concentration, despite reduced fasting concentration of total PYY and CCK AUC. Increased hunger and AG plasma concentration return with refeeding (no ketosis) and weight stabilisation. Sex seems to modulate some of the changes in appetite seen with WL, however, larger studies powered to detect sex differences are required to confirm these findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank all participants for their time and commitment, Hege Bj&#x000f8;ru and Sissel Salater (at the ObeCe, Clinic of Surgery, St. Olav University Hospital) for support with screening and blood collection, Turid Follestad for helping with statistical analysis and Ingrid Hals for support with lab work (both at the Department of Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, NTNU).
