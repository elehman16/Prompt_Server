Our results do not exclude a more profound negative impact of individualized treatment compared to standard, possibly caused by higher doses and extended treatment duration in the individualized group.

The impact of the disorder is comparable with other stressful life events and chronic diseases, like diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In part, the reduction in HRQL is due to the mental components of HRQL. With regard to these mental components, patients aware of their diagnosis have a more reduced HRQL than those who are unaware [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, many HCV patients have a previous or ongoing addiction and/or psychiatric problems, reflected in lower HRQL. In addition, patients with hepatitis C are stigmatized in society and the majority of the population of hepatitis C patients has a lower social economic status compared to the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>The reduction of HRQL is probably also due to physical and psychiatric symptoms as a direct consequence of this chronic infection and its sequelae (such as cirrhosis). The chronic inflammation is believed to signal the brain and to give rise to neurovegetative symptoms (e.g. malaise and fatigue) and to amongst others depression and concentration difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Possibly, also the brain itself is infected by HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Finally, treatment of chronic HCV with (peg)interferon-alpha ((PEG)IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) further diminishes HRQL due to its side-effects. The introduction of PEGIFN provided a significant improvement over standard IFN, with the result that the decrease of HRQL during treatment with PEGIFN is less than with standard IFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In case of successful treatment (obtaining a sustained virological response (SVR)) an improvement of HRQL-scores is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>In the Ditto-study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] a dynamically individualized treatment schedule depending on the on-treatment response was compared to a standard combination therapy with PEGIFN alfa-2a (180 &#x003bc;g qw) plus RBV (1000-1200 mg qd) for 48 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The primary aim of the Ditto study was to improve the SVR rate by individualizing the treatment schedule, but this could not be established.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Treatment allocation of patients with chronic hepatitis C according to initial virologic response pattern in the Ditto study</bold>.

The ethical review boards of the participating centers approved the study. After randomization, 134 patients received standard treatment and 136 patients were treated according to an individualized treatment schedule depending on the response at week 4 and 12 of treatment. 216 patients completed the treatment per protocol and 249 patients completed the end of follow up. At t = 0 HRQL was measured in 192 patients (not every center participated in the HRQL-analysis) and at follow up (24 weeks after completion of therapy) in 128 patients. In 120 patients, HRQL could be assessed at both time points.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>This phase III, open-label, randomized, multicenter trial was conducted by the DITTO-HCV study group between February 2001 and November 2003 at 9 centers in France, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The Short Form (SF)-36 Health Survey was used to measure HRQL. The SF-36 generates a profile of HRQL outcomes by measuring health across eight different dimensions: physical functioning, role limitation because of physical health, social functioning, vitality, bodily pain, mental health, role limitation because of emotional problems and general health. Responses to each question within a dimension are combined to generate a score from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates "good health". The eight multi-item subscales were also converted into a physical component summary scale and a mental component summary scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Demographic (such as age, gender, and income in Euros) and disease related factors were assessed before start of treatment. At the moment the SF-36 was completed at follow up both patients and the treating physician were unaware of the response to the treatment because HCV-RNA testing results were not known yet, however non-responders were aware of their (positive) HCV-RNA status at relevant time points during treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><sec><title>Power calculation</title><p>The HRQL-analysis was part of the main study which was powered on significant differences in SVR-rates between standard and individualized treatment.

As might be expected, younger patients had a better performance compared to older patients, especially on the physical components of HRQL. Surprisingly, cirrhotic patients had a better performance than non-cirrhotic patients, having significantly higher scores on several dimensions of the SF-36, mostly on mental components. Higher income in Euros had a weak positive effect on the physical component summary scale and role limitation because of physical health scale of HRQL, with a correlation coefficient of 0.30 (p = .003) and 0.23 (p = .002) respectively. Finally, HRQL differed among the different participating centers: the mental component summary scale and the dimensions physical functioning, role limitation because of physical health, general health, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning and mental health were all significantly different between the participating centers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Determinants of Health Related Quality of Life on t = 0 and course of Health Related Quality of Life</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th align="left">Subscale</th><th align="left" colspan="2">t = 0</th><th align="left">P-value</th><th align="left" colspan="2">Course<break/>(follow up -

Main determinants of HRQL in this study were the severity of liver disease (non-cirrhosis vs. cirrhosis), age, gender and participating center and - to some extent - response to treatment. With regard to the severity of the liver disease, patients with cirrhosis did better compared to those without cirrhosis. We are unable to explain this difference.</p><p>In our study almost all dimensions of the SF-36 did not change regardless of response, indicative of a satisfying recovery of patients after cytokine-based therapy. However, a significant increase was found on the subscale general health despite a therapy-induced worsening of the subscale physical functioning. This improvement was seen in patients with both SVR and relapse, whereas non-responders showed a decrease in general health. In our study, interestingly the relapsers who were ignorant of treatment effect when filling in the questionnaire, had a far more higher score on general health compared to the non-responders who were aware of their previous non-response to therapy. This underlines the mental aspects of the impact on HRQL in this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The observed recovery in HRQL is in line with previous studies reporting an improvement on (almost) all different dimensions of the SF-36 after a successful treatment with PEGIFN and RBV compared to baseline scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The presence of cirrhosis did not influence the course of HRQL during treatment, but patients with a cirrhosis had higher scores on some, mostly mental, dimensions of the SF-36 at t = 0 and at follow up, which is in contrast with earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis were excluded to participate in the study, but still we cannot explain this difference. Higher age was associated with a decrease in HRQL, according to literature data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Men and women differed in the course of HRQL with an increase on scores for men on several dimensions and women experiencing a decrease. These differences between men and women were also significant in a multivariate analysis for all dimensions except for general health. In the general population, men report a higher HRQL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], a finding possibly of relevance for our findings. But also, therapy with PEGIFN and RBV might have a more intense and more prolonged impact on females. Studies show more severe anemia in women during treatment with PEGIFN and RBV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As anemia plays an important role in HRQL during antiviral treatment this could be one of the explanations for the observed difference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. With the fixed doses of PEGIFN women may be treated with higher doses of PEGIFN per kg, which may contribute to more side-effects and a lower HRQL during treatment and at 24-weeks follow-up. To our knowledge, only one study found sex differences in recovery, with males doing slightly worse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>HRQL at baseline was found to be differing between the participating centers (in this case different countries/cultural regions). In the study by Ware et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] a similar observation was made. Although much attention has been devoted to assure the comparability between different cultures and languages, this observation suggests that studies from different countries concerning side effects (for instance decrease of HRQL, but also psychopathology) should be interpreted with caution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>An important limitation of this study is the large number of variables in relation to the number of participants and the many different treatment schedules. Also the relative high number of drop-outs with data of 192 patients at baseline and of 128 patients at follow up could be of importance, however non-responders or relapsers were not significantly more non-compliant compared to responders (data not shown). In retrospect an additional time point at the end of treatment would have given more insight.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion: our findings support the observation, that in general patients exposed to PEGIFN-based treatment do recover to their pre-treatment level of baseline, six months after completion of antiviral therapy or even surpass that level. This underlines again the safe profile of this intensive treatment, irrespective of the used dosage and/or duration in this study. Before treatment and after treatment with PEGIFN in patients chronically infected with HCV health related quality of life is mostly influenced by presence of cirrhosis, age, gender, participating center (or country) and response to treatment. Also, awareness of response status to therapy seems important.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>This study was supported by the European Community (QLK2-2000-00836), Hoffmann La-Roche and Maxim Pharmaceuticals.</p><p>In addition and in relation to this study, the authors would like to disclose the following:</p><p>Geert Bezemer, nothing to disclose</p><p>Arthur R.
