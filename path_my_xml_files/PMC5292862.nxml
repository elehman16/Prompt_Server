All patients had a radial arterial line for pressure monitoring and arterial blood sampling. Arterial blood samples were taken for blood gas analysis (using ABL800 blood gas analyzer) and calculating the PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> to assess the degree of severity of ALI/ARDS. Patients were anesthetized by propofol 2% 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg intravenous (IV) and intubated after relaxation with atracurium 0.4&#x02013;0.6 mg/kg IV followed by propofol infusion (5&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g/kg/min) through a syringe pump or midazolam (0.02&#x02013;0.1 mg/kg/min) infused intravenously in 50 ml crystalloid solution. Daily interruption of continuous sedative infusion was considered at a fixed time every morning to allow for accurate neurological assessment. Atracurium was continuously infused as (0.3&#x02013;0.6 mg/kg/h) for relaxation and proper measurement of respiratory mechanics. Patients were ventilated with Nellcor Puritan Bennett 840 ventilator system (USA). Ventilator was set on volume-controlled mode with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg (predicted body weight) and respiratory rate that kept carbon dioxide tension between 35 and 45 mmHg. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) was set at 1.0 during the study period. Inspiration: Expiration time ratio was set as 1:2. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set either 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O above the lower inflection point or 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O in the absence of the lower inflection point (protective mechanical ventilation strategy).[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>This was a 3-day study in which every patient's baseline measurements obtained before budesonide (or placebo) nebulization were compared with measurements obtained 1 h after nebulization in both groups.

The PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio was calculated from the measured PaO<sub>2</sub> and the inspired oxygen concentration. Vital signs measurements including mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and arterial oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry were monitored regularly every 30 min.</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1; were analyzed at baseline (prenebulization) and 72 h after nebulization in both groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Nebulized budesonide</title><p>Prepared as 1 mg ampoule enveloped in aluminum foil (2 ml suspension available as Pulmicort Respules<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>)[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] to be used in a pressurized nebulizer (not used in ultrasonic nebulizers) the ampoule was gently shaked and then squeezed into the nebulizer.

It also induces vasoconstriction, inhibits mucosal edema, reduces cell exudation, and prevents airway remodeling.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Compared to systemic glucocorticoids, budesonide nebulization has the following advantages; high concentration primarily in the lungs, high hepatic clearance, and high glucocorticoid receptor affinity. During nebulization, the nebulizer unit breaks the liquid into micro-particles, which are directly inhaled into the lower respiratory tract and rapidly absorbed by the pulmonary mucosa, thus increasing the local drug concentration.</p><p>Studies in asthma have shown that inhaled steroids with an extra-fine particle size (around 1 &#x000b5;m) easily reaches the distal airways[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] where they have a greater effect on lung mechanics and symptoms than conventionally sized particles (around 5 &#x000b5;m), which are preferentially deposited in larger airways. Modern nebulizers are now capable of producing particles of this optimal size.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Because inflammation occurring in ARDS is predominantly on the alveolar side of the interstitial space,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] it is reasonable to expect that the terminal airways and the alveoli would be more accessible to inhaled rather than intravenous drugs.</p><p>This pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of budesonide make it a valuable adjuvant for patients with ALI/ARDS on mechanical ventilation as the disease, in its early stages, is characterized by the presence of the acute phase response which is a series of complex neuro-immunologic reactions that lead to release of cytokines and other immunologically activated proteins in an attempt to restore homeostasis.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] These inflammatory mediators play a cardinal role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and also responsible for the extra-pulmonary organ failure.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>Accordingly, nebulized budesonide can obtund the sequelae of the acute phase response and reduces alveolar inflammation. In addition, it inhibits airway inflammation, alleviates edema, inhibits remodeling and promotes suctioning which maintains pulmonary function during mechanical ventilation. At the same time, it reduces the adverse events associated with systemic corticosteroid administration such as increased blood glucose level, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, bone demineralization, perforated peptic ulcer, and altered immunity.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] So, it can act as a pulmonary protective agent during mechanical ventilation for ALI/ARDS patients.</p><p>Ju <italic>et al</italic>. in a randomized controlled study evaluated the effect of preoperative budesonide nebulization on inflammation in thoracotomy patients receiving single lung ventilation and revealed that preoperative budesonide nebulization reduced the peak airway pressure and plateau pressure, increased pulmonary compliance, inhibited inflammation and finally improved pulmonary function.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>There is only one study of inhaled steroids for the prophylaxis of ARDS in humans.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Sixty-three patients inhaled 880 &#x000b5;g fluticasone every 12 h for 12 weeks from the start of chemotherapeutic regimen known to cause pulmonary toxicity. Compared with 45 historical controls, delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome was reduced from 73% to 35% (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0003). The severity of illness was less than in ARDS, but this, at least, suggests inhaled steroids may protect against a pulmonary insult.</p><p>Jansson <italic>et al</italic>. reported leucocyte/neutrophil elevation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and edema in both lungs after intrathecal lipo-polysaccharide administration of 0.5 mg/ml/kg in the 4<sup>th</sup> h in a murine model of ARDS.
