with massage between Thai traditional and standardized physical therapy (TPT and SPT) in
older people with knee osteoarthritis (KOA). [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-one subjects
with KOA (aged 50&#x02013;85 years) in two selected villages were randomly assigned into the TPT
or SPT programs. Seventeen TPT subjects received Thai exercise with traditional massage,
and 14 SPT individuals performed strengthening exercise with Swedish massage. Both
programs consisted of a class with supervision plus home self-care for 8 weeks; the
subjects then managed home self-care for 1&#x02005;year. [Results] After 2 months, the six-minute
walk test (6MWT), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC), and
SF-36 testing showed significant improvement in both groups, but the improvement of the
TPT group was greater. After 1year, only the score for the 6MWT was greater in the TPT
group than in the SPT group. [Conclusion] The TPT program yielded better results for the
6MWT, but, both programs had beneficial effects on the pain, function, and QOL of
middle-aged and older patients with KOA in the community setting.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Six-minute walk test</kwd><kwd>Bodyweight-based exercise training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is the most common joint disease in middle-aged and older people.
Pain is the main symptom that leads to limitation in the patients&#x02019; abilities such as the
ability to walk, stand up, and climb stairs, and dependency in daily living activities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. This disease leads to poor quality of life
(QOL) and is a significant burden on health-care services<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The primary goal of treatment in KOA is reducing pain and improving
functional capacity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Non-pharmacological
treatment, physical therapy (PT), and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), which
includes massage<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, alternative
exercise<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, thermotherapy<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and acupuncture<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, play an important role in health care for patients with
KOA. The use of CAM in developed countries appears to be increasing as awareness increases.
It may have been that use of CAM increased with socioeconomic status<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Currently, alternative exercises including yoga, Tai Chi,
and aquatic programs are models of exercise therapy for patients with KOA<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Strengthening and aerobic exercise are
beneficial for improving KOA-related symptoms in terms of pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and physical function<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In Thailand, a form of Thai exercise that utilizes a wand is popular among elderly people
and is a body weight-based form of resistance exercise; however, the intensity of this
exercise can be increased by lifting the wand in upper limb exercise or can be decreased by
using the wand to support the body. Our previous study shows that Thai exercise with a wand
can improve QOL<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This exercise with a
wand tends to increase muscle strength, which can be beneficial for pain improvement;
however, the evidence regarding this is not clear. This exercise might be a better
therapeutic form for reducing pain in KOA patients when combined with Thai massage because
it has been shown to reduce the pain in patients with back pain<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> and scapulocostal syndrome<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Home- and class-based programs are some of the most suitable treatments for elderly people
in the community<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nonetheless, a
previous study found that patients carried out a home-based program just for the initial
phase and subsequently did not maintain a self-care program<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thereby, a home-based program along with a class-based program
supervised by physical therapists might provide confidence for patients to help in
management of knee symptoms by themselves. However, there is no evidence concerning whether
or not Thai exercise with traditional massage can effect the pain, walking ability, and QOL
in patients with KOA. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a
class- and home-based program using Thai exercise with traditional massage and the long-term
follow-up in the form of a home program on pain, walking ability, and QOL in middle-aged and
older patients with KOA in a suburban community.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled trial with a field-based assignment. The subjects
were patients with KOA aged 50&#x02013;85 years from two selected villages with similar
socioeconomic statuses in a suburban community of Khon Kaen Province, Thailand. These two
villages are small, and travel within them is difficult. Additionally, they were found to be
in need of health promotion for people with KOA. A simple randomization was used to allocate
each village into either the TPT or SPT program. The protocol and informed consent form were
approved by the Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee for Human Research.</p><p>The diagnosis of KOA was confirmed for each patient based on their medical history report
and a physical examination performed by physical therapists based on the clinical criteria
of the American College of Rheumatology (1986)<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The inclusion criteria consisted of pain in the knee and three of
the following conditions: 1) aged at least 50&#x02005;years of age, 2) less than 30&#x02005;min of morning
stiffness, 3) crepitus on active motion, 4) bony tenderness, 5) bony enlargement, and 6) no
palpable warmth of the synovium. The subjects who met the inclusion criteria were asked to
join and had to sign an informed consent form before participation. All individuals were
able to walk and were assessed for all measurements. Each of them received standard medical
management of KOA from a local primary care unit.</p><p>The exclusion criteria consisted of diagnosis of KOA caused by other diseases, such as
rheumatoid arthritis, or gouty arthritis or any accident/sports, contagious diseases,
uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes mellitus, neurological deficits, or psychological
symptoms. Subjects who were unable to perform standing and walking, or had received a knee
replacement and those whose doctors advised against massage and exercise due to an
underlying disease were also excluded. Twenty-four patients in the Thai physical therapy
(TPT) group and 20 patients in standard physical therapy (SPT) group were assessed for their
eligibility to participate in the study. Thirteen subjects were excluded for failing to meet
the inclusion criteria. The remaining subjects, 17 in the TPT group and 14 in the SPT group,
fulfilled the above criteria and agreed to participate in the study.</p><p>The TPT and SPT programs consisted of two phases. The first phase include class-based TPT
and SPT group intervention programs at an appointed public indoor area in each village, and
these programs were also associated with a home program. All subjects were asked to attend
their group class, which was supervised by a researcher, three days/week. Additionally, they
were recommended to follow their program at home at least two days/week for eight weeks. The
second phase was performing the actual home self-care program with TPT or SPT alone, at
least three times/week for twelve months. To extend the benefits of the home program,
subjects received the booster session once a month during the first three months.
Researchers incorporated content into each booster session to stimulate subject education
and awareness regarding self-management, which included physical activity and exercise
planning, and discussion of other related problems.</p><p>In the TPT group, exercise with a wand consisted of six exercises that were based on a past
study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> that emphasized exercise in the
muscle of the quadriceps and hamstrings. Concentric and eccentric isotonic contraction are
applied with different positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Thai exercise with a wand in the TPT group (left) and strengthening exercise in the
SPT group (right)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-26-139-g001"/></fig>). These exercises are suitable for the knee joints and low impact. Each exercise was
performed five times/session, two sets/day, and this was increased every two weeks until
reaching 40 times/session. In the Thai massage session, the massage method used pressure on
muscle lines of the quadriceps, hamstrings, tibialis anticus, and calves. To apply deep
pressure, one or two thumb pads or the side of an elbow tip was used in some cases.
Superficial heating with Thai herbs, containing 10 ingredients consisting of camphor,
Kurkumin, lemon grass, and turmeric leaves, in a bag was applied to various areas of both
upper and lower leg muscles and to cover the knees. In the SPT group, six progressive
strengthening exercises for the quadriceps and hamstring muscles based on a past study were
used<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each exercise was performed 10
times/session, 2 sets/day, and the resistance was increased every two weeks (0.5 to 2&#x02005;kg).
The increase in load was flexible and depended on the subject&#x02019;s requirements. Swedish
massage consisted of superficial and deep stroking, and kneading or stroking various muscles
of both the upper and lower leg. Additionally, a superficial heating bag filled with hot
water was placed on the same areas. All subjects were suggested to perform the 30-minute
exercise program, receive the 30-minute massage, and receive the 15-minute superficial
heat/cold care whenever they might normally use an ice pack for acute or subacute knee pain.
All outcomes were measured at baseline and at 2, 5, 8, and 14months. The primary outcome was
the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The secondary outcomes included functional capacity
evaluated by the Thai versions of the Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index
(WOMAC) and quality of life (Thai Short Form-36, SF-36). The 6MWT was used for evaluating
subjects&#x02019; walking capacity by measuring the distance walked during a defined period. The
Thai 5-point Likert version of the WOMAC<sup>TM</sup> 3.1 Index that was selected included
24 items grouped into 3 dimensions: pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items), and function (17
items). The SF-36 is a health-related quality of life (QOL) instruments that contains two
dimensions, physical health (PH) and mental health (MH) (each range, 0&#x02013;100). Adherence to
the home program was assessed on a 5-point scale (1 time/wk = almost never, 2 times/wk =
occasional adherence, 3 times/wk = regular adherence, 4 times/wk = often
adherence, &#x02265; 5 times/wk = very often)<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
All data are presented as means &#x000b1; SD. Outcomes were analyzed using repeated measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for evaluating differences within groups, and analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) was used for evaluating differences between groups. In the ANCOVA, the
baseline values for all outcome variables in the posttest were adjusted for baseline
differences. A p value &#x0003c; 0.05 was used as the criterion for statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The physical characteristics of all subjects are shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Subject characteristics</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristics</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SPT group (n = 14)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">TPT group (n = 17)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Sex; male/female (n)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/13</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)<sup>#</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.8&#x000b1;8.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">67.8&#x000b1;6.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(Range)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(53 to 84)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(52 to 76)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)<sup>#</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">153.6&#x000b1;7.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">153.5&#x000b1;6.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)<sup>#</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61.7&#x000b1;6.5</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">62.3&#x000b1;11.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body mass index-BMI

WOMAC, and SF-36 scores after 2 months of treatment and lower detraining effects on the 6MWT
distance at 1&#x02005;year after TPT as compared with the SPT group. Before the programs, the data
for baseline characteristics, the main outcome, and other outcomes among the two groups were
not significantly different. No significant difference was seen in most of the outcome
measures when comparing the adjusted post-training means of the TPT and SPT groups after 2
months of treatment; however, the mental and global dimension SF-36 scores demonstrated
significant improvement in the TPT group (p&#x0003c; 0.05). After 1&#x02005;year, physical and mental
health SF-36 scores gradually worsened in both groups. However, the 6MWT distance in the TPT
group was significantly higher than in the SPT group at the 5th and 14th months
(p&#x0003c;0.05).</p><p>This study showed improved distances of about 20% and 9% in the 6MWT in the TPT and SPT
groups after2 months of treatment. The subjects in the TPT group seemed to have more
improvement when compared with the SPT group. This might be explained by the following
reasons. Firstly, Thai massage provides manual compression of deep tissues that may release
muscle tension<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> and increase blood flow,
leading to relief of pain and increased ROM<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of the current study are in agreement with a previous
study that demonstrated that modified Thai therapeutic massage could reduce pain and
increase knee function in patients with primary KOA<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, superficial heat applied via a Thai herb bag may yield some
effects that decrease pain and inflammation<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Another reason might be that Thai traditional therapy is familiar
to subjects who live in Thailand. From the observation of the researchers, the TPT subjects
were obviously interested in their class-based group. The training methods in the TPT
program seemed to suit the local Thai culture more than the SPT program. Incidentally, there
was an active leader in the TPT group who may have continually induced other subjects to
stay with the program. This could have affected the adherence to the exercise class in the
TPT group, causing it to be more than that in the SPT group, which had no group leader.</p><p>A strong point of this study was that all subjects in the two groups completed
participation in their classed-based programs; that is, there were no dropouts. This may
have been due to the flexibility the supervisor had with regard to arrangement of the
program. However, the compliance in performing the home-based program as recorded in their
exercise log books showed that the TPT subjects performed the program more regularly than
the SPT subjects, which resulted in better improvements in the TPT group. During the home
self-care program, the percentage of TPT subjects who performed their own program in keeping
with the criteria of at least 2 days/week for 8 weeks was higher than that of the SPT group.
For all of the above reasons, the TPT program tended to yield a better improvement within
the group in terms of pain, walking ability, and QOL than the SPT program in patients with
KOA who lived in these communities. Although the SPT program showed less improvement, we
speculate that if subjects could have accepted the unfamiliar program and regularly
practiced it for a long time, this program would certainly have had more impact. Most Thai
people in rural communities believe that Thai traditional massage and hot herbal bags
influence pain reduction and that body movement increases for a long time. This may well be
a psychological effect. One&#x02019;s belief in one&#x02019;s own ability to perform tasks is also
associated with higher adherence and better outcome<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Home- and class-based exercise programs have shown benefits with regard to functional
abilities in daily activities in elderly individuals<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. It has been shown that weight-bearing exercise can increase muscle
strength<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, neuromuscular control<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>, and proprioception of the lower
extremities<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thai exercise with a
wand is a low-impact resistance exercise in which the individual&#x02019;s own body weight is used
and is progressively performed with repetitive bouts. From the recorded diaries, TPT
subjects had approximately 40% more exercise adherence than SPT subjects. In addition, the
subjects in the SPT group utilized a lower target load with mostly open-kinetic exercise as
compared with the TPT group for body weight-bearing strength training. These might be the
reasons for less training effects in the SPT group. No supervision of the home-based
programs resulted in reduced exercise adherence in both groups. However, greater exercise
adherence was reported in the TPT group, probably due to more familiarity. It also resulted
in a decline in the 6MWT distance in both groups. However, at the 5th and 14th months, the
6MWT distances in the TPT group were significantly better than in the SPT group due to more
exercise adherence in the TPT group.</p><p>There were some limitations of the present study. Firstly, the sample size of the two
groups was smaller than that the researchers desired, 23 subjects/group. In addition, the
statistical power was 0.3. Thus, increasing the number of subjects may produce a stronger
study. Secondly, there was relatively lower compliance with the home-based program in the
SPT subjects than in the TPT subjects. There is a possibility that the subjects in the SPT
group were not aware of the benefits of the program and that they felt uncomfortable
performing self-care with Swedish massage or strength training with a load, although all
subjects in the SPT and TPT groups commented that it was not fun to perform the program
alone in their homes. Lastly, due to its nature as a community trial, it was impossible to
blind the outcome assessors.</p><p>The current study was designed to be class based in order to promote self-efficacy
expectations, and booster sessions were added to investigate maintenance in a prolonged
program. Exercise self-efficacy was the only variable to significantly predict adherence to
exercise during follow-up<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study, the physical and mental health perception outcome variables tended to
improve, but it was found that waking ability had decreased. Perceptions of personal
efficacy have typically been identified as important predictors of exercise adherence and
other health outcomes<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. A future study
should provide role play to enhance perceptions of personal efficacy in older patients with
KOA and the utility of self-efficacy as a predictor of exercise maintenance over time. The
results of this study demonstrated that the TPT program yielded better results in the 6MWT,
although both programs had beneficial effects on the pain, physical function, and QOL in
middle-aged and older patients with KOA in the two communities. Also, it seems that belief
in traditional alternative treatments seems to influence self-efficacy in older people in
rural communities.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients who participated in this study. The study was
