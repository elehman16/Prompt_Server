compression therapy on venous blood flow, refilling time, pain level, and quality of life
in women with varicose veins. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-eight females with varicose
veins were selected and randomly allocated to a control group, and experimental group.
Maximum and mean venous blood velocities, the refilling time, pain by visual analog scale
and quality of life by Aberdeen Varicose Veins Questionnaire were measured in all patients
before and after six weeks of treatment. Both groups received lower extremity exercises;
in addition, patients in the experimental group received sequential pneumatic compression
therapy for 30 minutes daily, five days a week for six weeks. [Results] All measured
parameters improved significantly in both groups, comparison of post treatment
measurements between groups showed that the maximum and mean blood flow velocity, the pain
level, and quality of life were significantly higher in the experimental group compared
with the control group. On the other hand there was no significant difference between
groups for refilling time. [Conclusion] Sequential pneumatic compression therapy with the
applied parameters was an effective modality for increasing venous blood flow, reducing
pain, and improving quality of women life with varicose veins.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Varicose veins</kwd><kwd>Pneumatic compression therapy</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Varicose veins are a common progressive medical condition with widely ranging estimates of
prevalence that will steadily worsen<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
veins become dilated (greater than 3&#x02005;mm) with twisting and bulging due to weakness of their
walls or valves, which usually occurs in the superficial veins of the lower extremities<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Half of the adult population has the
stigmata of minor venous disease<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and
about 25% of the population has lower extremity varicose veins<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The prevalence of varicose veins is greater in women (26&#x02013;32%) than
in men (10&#x02013;40%)<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Varicose veins are more than an esthetic problem. They often affect individual&#x02019;s physical
appearance, and quality of life and may also result in lost time from work and lost wages.
Insurance companies may be hesitant about paying for their treatment<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Symptomatic varicose veins are not a life threatening condition, but the condition is
usually progressive and may result in leg ulcer. The treatment of leg ulcers is intensive
and very expensive. A non-healing ulcer can require prolonged primary care, and it&#x02019;s the
odor may lead to social exclusion. It is very difficult to predict which patient with
varicose veins will develop a leg ulcer. However, it has been estimated that about half of
venous leg ulcers are the result of varicose veins<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Varicose veins management can range from conservative treatment to surgical approaches, all
of which have different advantages, disadvantages, and long-term outcomes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are three main reasons for management
with these approaches. The first is prevention of complications, such as edema, bleeding,
eczema, lipodermatosclerosis, and leg ulcers<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>, the second is relief of complaints caused by varicose veins, such
as heaviness, tired legs, and cramps, and the third is the importance of cosmetic
appearance. Many patients only find their way to a phlebologic clinic because their varicose
veins are cosmetically disturbing, and this may affect patients&#x02019; quality of life<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Chronic diseases such as varicose veins have an important impact on a patient&#x02019;s quality of
life (QoL)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Different studies have confirmed that treatment of venous disease
improved QoL<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The Aberdeen Varicose
Veins Questionnaire (AVVQ) is a disease-specific questionnaire that measures QoL for
patients with varicose veins<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
questionnaire, designed in 1993, consists of 13 questions related to all aspects of the
problem of varicose veins<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Vascular compression therapies that include elastic wraps, elastic stockings, and
intermittent pneumatic compression devices are the mainstay of conservative treatment for
varicose veins. Other conservative treatments include drugs, lifestyle changes, exercise,
and massage. Surgical treatment is reserved for severe or medically refractory varicose
veins<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) devices composed of sleeve- or boot-shaped
chambers that fill with air and electrical pumps with gauges that provide intermittent
compression to the lower extremities. The compression force may be applied either uniformly
to the calf using a single chamber device or through a series of chambers inflated in a
sequential manner from the ankle to thigh to achieve venous emptying<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> which is termed sequential pneumatic compression
(SPC).</p><p>The efficacy of IPC in the treatment of varicose veins is well documented<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. It reduces venous stasis by promoting venous blood flow<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup> and it stimulates fibrinolytic
activity<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. It had been found to be an effective modality for treatment for
venous ulceration<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Measurement of QoL is a comprehensive assessment of the effect of such a treatment
intervention for varicose veins on patients to determine if the treatment results provides
improvement. A new combined QoL and clinical instrument is needed to validly assess and
compare the outcomes of venous treatments<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of SPC therapy
on venous blood flow, refilling time, pain level, and QoL of women with varicose veins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The study protocol and designed were approved by the Local Ethics Committee of the Faculty
of Physical Therapy, Cairo University. Fifty-five women with bilateral varicose veins were
investigated at the vascular outpatient clinic of El Kasr El Ainy Teaching Hospital and
National Heart Institute. Patients were enrolled in the study if they had a symptomatic
varicose veins (clinical severity class C2 according to the CEAP classification, a
comprehensive classification system) of the lower limb (pain, soreness, burning, aching,
throbbing, heavy legs, cramping, muscle fatigue, and/or night cramps) over a period of at
least six months<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients were
required to have an educational level sufficient to allow them to read and understand AVVQ
in English independently without any help. Patients were excluded if they were pregnant or
breastfeeding; had any local leg condition interferes with sleeve wear, such as dermatitis,
vein ligation, gangrene, or recent skin graft; had severe leg arteriosclerosis or any other
ischemic vascular disease; had massive leg edema or pulmonary edema from congestive heart
failure; had a suspecting existing or previous venous thromboembolism; had an extreme leg
deformity or size (thigh circumference &#x0003c;55&#x02005;cm or &#x0003e;71&#x02005;cm); or had medical disorders
such as diabetes<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients were
excluded if they could not read and understand the AVVQ in English on their own.
Twenty-seven patients were excluded from the study because of venous thromboembolism (9%,
5/55), size of the leg (16.3%, 9/55), and diabetic limitations (23.6%, 13/55), and the
remaining 28 patients were enrolled.</p><p>This study was a randomized control trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig.
1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow chart for design of study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-1981-g001"/></fig>). The patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria and provided a written informed
consent were randomly divided into two groups by using sealed envelopes. Thirteen patients
were allocated to the control group, and fifteen patients were allocated to the experimental
group. The sample size was calculated based on previous studies<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. A power
analysis with &#x003b1;=0.05 and power=80% determined that a group size of 15 was adequate to
demonstrate a 25% change in the venous blood velocity, refilling time, and pain level
between the groups.</p><p>The Venous system of the lower extremities of the patients was examined by duplex
ultrasound (ProSound SSD-4000, Hitachi Aloka Medical, Ltd., Japan) in order to measure the
maximum and mean venous blood velocities in centimeters per second (cm/sec) and the
refilling time in seconds. A Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to measured pain level, and
the AVVQ was used to measured QoL of all patients in both groups before and after six weeks
of treatment. All measurements were performed in a similar fashion at the same time of the
day for both groups to reduce variability.</p><p>Venous blood velocity was measured by ultrasonographic imaging performed by the same
radiologist. Each subject was placed in the supine position for a minimum of five minutes
before the evaluation and baseline venous velocities were recorded in cm/sec. Maximal and
mean venous blood velocities were obtained from the common femoral vein cephalad to the
saphenofemoral junction, and the refilling time was also measured. The angle of insonation
of the ultrasound scan beam with the vein was 60 degrees<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. All measurements were repeated three times, and the mean was used
for analysis.</p><p>Pain level was measured by VAS. The VAS is 10&#x02005;cm horizontal line with one end described as
no pain (0&#x02005;cm) and the other end described as the worst pain (10&#x02005;cm). The distance between
the extreme left of the scale (no pain) and the subject&#x02019;s mark was measured to the nearest
millimeter. High levels of reliability and validity have been reported for the VAS<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The AVVQ consists of questions relating to all aspects of the problem of varicose
veins<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. The questionnaire has a section in which patients can indicate
diagrammatically the distribution of their varicose veins. There are other questions
relating to pain severity, ankle edema, ulcers, compression therapy use, and limitations on
daily activities, as well as questions on the cosmetic effect of varicose veins. The
questionnaire is scored from 0 (no effect) to 100 (severe effect)<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The AVVQ
therefore fulfilled all attributes necessary for an instrument to be used as a measure of
health outcome and QoL<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The patients
were requested to fill in a copy of this questionnaire on day zero and then again at the end
of the six weeks. Grading of the answers was performed according to the manual for the
AVVQ.</p><p>Patients in both groups received a physiotherapy program that consisted of lower extremity
exercises, which included gluteal and quadriceps isometric exercises, active hip and knee
flexion/extension, ankle dorsiflexion/ plantar flexion, and straight leg raising. The
patients were instructed to perform ten repetitions of each exercise three times a day, five
time per week for six weeks<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In addition, patients in the experimental group were treated with an SPC device (EUREDUC
TPO5, Japan). Each of the lower extremities was treated for thirty minutes daily, five days
a week for six weeks. The device had three separate chambers, one over the distal calf, one
over the proximal calf, and one over the distal thigh, that inflated sequentially. It was
adjusted to apply a pressure of 65, 55, and 45 mmHg respectably in a distal to proximal
direction for 12 seconds followed by 2.4 seconds of non-compression to allow venous
refilling.</p><p>Statistical analyses were carried out using PASW Statistics for Windows, Version 18.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Normality of the data was assessed using graphical methods,
including the frequency distribution on a histogram and normal Q-Q plot. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests were used as a confirmation. Descriptive data were
expressed as the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) for demographic characteristics of patients.
The Independent t-was used to test for significant difference between mean values of two
groups of normally distributed variables. Mann-Whitney U test was used to test difference
between mean values of two groups of non-normally distributed variables. The Paired t-test
(for normally distributed data) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for non-normally distributed
data) for paired data were applied with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). A difference was
considered significant if the p-value was &#x0003c;0.05. Statistical analysis included only
patients with both pre- and post-treatment values.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The baseline characteristics of the patients are summarized in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Baseline characteristics of the patients</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control group<break/>(n=13)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Experimental group<break/>(n=15)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">p-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (years)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">43.4 &#x000b1; 4.35</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.3 &#x000b1; 4.80</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.390</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">83.6 &#x000b1; 6.47</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">84.5 &#x000b1; 6.57</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.627</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160.0 &#x000b1; 5.02</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">158.9 &#x000b1; 2.92</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.518</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">32.65 &#x000b1; 1.9</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.5 &#x000b1; 2.82</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.924</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Data represent the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation. n: number; BMI: body mass index</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>.

the quality of patient life<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. For
accurate evaluation of treatment outcomes, QoL, and clinical aspects must be assessed<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There was no available published research about the impact of SPC on clinical aspects and
QoL of varicose veins patients. This study was designed as an initial study to investigate
the effects of SPC therapy on venous blood flow, pain level, and QoL in women with varicose
veins.</p><p>The gold standard for diagnosing varicose veins is ultrasound examination. It is ideal for
optimal visualization of anatomy, hemodynamics, the diameter of the veins, and reflux time
which can be measured accurately<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Varicose veins patients previously showed a reduction in QoL compared with the general
population, and this discrepancy was significantly improved at 6 weeks after surgey<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The AVVQ is a valid measure of quality of
life for patients with varicose veins<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The National Health Service in the United Kingdom, has been collecting AVVQ scores for
varicose vein surgeries since 2009, and the results have been correlated with both EuroQol
five dimensions questionnaire (EQ-5D) and EQ VAS scores; as a result, the AVVQ has been
found to be a sensitive tool for assessing disease burden in varicose vein patients<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the Netherlands, a similar study
matched AVVQ scores with 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scales and showed a strong
correlation between the AVVQ and generic QoL outcomes<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The data obtained in this study revealed that the measured parameters, maximum, mean blood
flow velocity, refilling time, pain level, and QoL were improved significantly in both the
control and experimental groups. Comparison of the posttreatment measurement values between
the groups revealed that the maximum and mean blood flow velocity, pain level, and QoL were
significantly higher in the SPC group compared with the control group, while no significant
difference was observed between groups for refilling time.</p><p>The significant results found in the control group could be related to the effect of
exercise on the venous system. Regular exercise such as walking, biking, and swimming has
beneficial effects that maximize calf pump function. The calf musculature functions as a
&#x0201c;peripheral heart,&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;poor ejection fraction&#x0201d; associated with poor leg conditioning
results in progressive edema and increased varicose veins symptoms. A regular exercise
program can improve the overall &#x0201c;ejection fraction,&#x0201d; resulting in symptom improvement<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, all patients performed lower limb exercises; these exercises result in blood
being pumped back to the heart from the thigh, calf muscles, and veins in the arch of the
foot. A strong calf and thigh muscles promote healthy blood circulation and minimizes vein
disease<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>IPC is generally a painless and non-invasive technique with proven efficacy as a valuable
adjunct in the management of patients with venous, lymphatic, and arterial disease<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The current study proved that IPC has significant effects on venous blood flow based on the
following physiological effects. IPC increases the velocity of venous return and reduces the
amount of blood inside the veins at any time through stimulation of endothelial cell
production of nitric oxide and creates shear stress on the walls of blood vessels, which is
the probable physiologic mechanism for enhanced nitric oxide production. Increased nitric
oxide production inhibits platelet aggregation and neutrophil adherence, both of which play
important roles in the creation of secondary hypoxic injury. Nitric oxide is also a
neurotransmitter that can influence vascular tone, thereby increasing blood flow<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. Delis et al., found that IPC applied to thefoot and calf produced
maximal venous emptying from the leg<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The SPC therapy used in this study delivers sequential graded compression; that is, at any
time, the pressure in any chamber is higher than the adjacent most proximal one. There is
evidence of distal blood trapping and incomplete calf vein evacuation as a result of uniform
compression<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. SPC allows greater
venous blood clearance or less stasis and prevents reversed pressure gradient and blood
trapping during uniform compression.</p><p>Pain develops in varicose vein patients as a result of increased tissue tension caused by
swelling. Therefore, if swelling is minimized pain will be reduced. Compression therapy
counteracts venous hypertension by facilitating venous return toward the heart, improving
venous pump function and lymphatic drainage. It reduces edema by increasing the local
hydrostatic pressure and lowering the superficial venous pressure, preventing the leakage of
fluids and macromolecules, improving cutaneous blood flow, and therefore decreasing
pain<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>These results are in agreement with the study of Kakkos et al.<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup> who revealed the hemodynamic superiority of sequential
compression compared with other compression device<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Figueiredo et al.<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>, found that use of IPC improves blood flow when applied in legs or
thighs. Other studies have consistently concluded that all intermittent compression systems
produce changes in femoral vein velocity. At pressures of around 40 mmHg, the typical
maximum velocities achieved with calf and/or thigh compression would be 35&#x02013;60 cm/sec with
augmentations (maximum velocity during compression compared with maximum velocity at rest)
of around 50&#x02013;250%<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Assessment of the QoL status at baseline and on completion of the six-week active study
period using the AVVQ showed that SPC can significantly improve the QoL of patients by
improving venous blood flow and reducing pain. Physical functioning, bodily pain, vitality,
and social functioning all improved significantly within six weeks of treatment with SPC.
The aspects of QoL measured by the AVVQ are known to be impaired in patients with varicose
vains<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. SPC improves these aspects of
life. On the other hand, the exercise brings about minimal changes in QoL.</p><p>A limitation of this study was its small sample of patients due to the required educational
level for patient who had to be able to read and understand the AVVQ in English
independently without any help. As there are no valid Arabic versions of the AVVQ available,
it is necessary to conduct translation, cultural adaptation, and validation to produce an
Arabic version of the AVVQ.</p><p>In this study, women with varicose veins were treated with SPC along with regular lower
limbs exercise, five days/week for six weeks. SPC therapy emerged as an effective treatment
in the management of varicose veins, offering a clinically significant improvement in both
venous blood flow and pain. These benefits were paralleled by significant improvements in
all evaluated aspects of quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Professor Samia A. Elkady and Professor Ahmed Sabry for their
