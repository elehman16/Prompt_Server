Mogens Schou pioneered the study of lithium for prophylaxis of the recurrent mood disorder and encouraged its greater use. In an effort to further address the appropriate role of this drug, the multiple assets of lithium beyond its well-known antimanic effect are reviewed, and a brief summary of its side effects is outlined. It appears that lithium has positive effects in depression and suicide prevention, cognition, and reducing the incidence of dementia. It increases the length of telomeres and has positive effects in prevention of some medical illnesses. Lithium side-effect burden, especially its association with end-stage renal disease, may be less than many have surmised. New data indicate the importance of long-term prophylaxis after a first manic episode to lessen episode recurrence, allow cognition to recover to normal, and prevent various aspects of illness progression. After a first manic episode, 1 year of randomized treatment with lithium was superior to that of quetiapine, suggesting the importance of having lithium in the treatment regimen. Given the highly recurrent and progressive course of bipolar disorder sometimes even in the face of conventional treatment, the role and enhanced use of lithium deserves reconsideration.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Mogens Schou was passionate about the use of lithium and compassionate about patients using lithium to better their lives. It was a great honor for this author to receive an award from the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) in Schou&#x02019;s name, and I would like to take up his call for the greater use of lithium as a way of improving peoples&#x02019; lives. Schou himself said that &#x02018;for me every single patient whose life was changed radically, out weighs any honors or awards.&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grof, 2006</xref>).</p><p>So why does one of the oldest drugs in our pharmacopeia need a new pitch? Like Schou and many others, I believe lithium is underutilized, particularly in the United States. Many residents and young practitioners are not taught about the details of its use and may not be knowledgeable about some of its properties. Schou, who died in 2005, would have wanted this commentary to update lithium&#x02019;s range of positive effects and to reinfuse enthusiasm about its greater use.</p><p>Here, I summarize some of the assets of lithium beyond its well-known antimanic properties. Some of these are well documented, and several are new, preliminary, but nonetheless highly intriguing and of great potential clinical value. The current status of lithium-related side effects is briefly summarized, as there appear to be many misperceptions about its tolerability and toxicity. An attempt is made to integrate the potential role of lithium into the evolving recommendations for earlier and more effective pharmacoprophylaxis of bipolar disorder.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The recent literature is reviewed to selectively highlight various aspects of lithium&#x02019;s wide spectrum of clinical effectiveness. Side effects are briefly noted. This brief summary of lithium&#x02019;s assets, side effects, and mechanisms of action is not meant to be comprehensive or referenced in detail, but only to emphasize some of lithium&#x02019;s unique properties, general tolerability, and multiple mechanisms of action. How lithium might fit into the new recommendations for pharmacoprophylaxis after a first manic episode is discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Some of the Assets of Lithium</title><sec><title>Lithium prevents depressions as well as manias</title><p>It is important to note that British naysayers and critics (Sheppard and Blackwood) said that lithium&#x02019;s use was based on a shaky foundation. Not only did Schou perform the critical studies to validate the efficacy of lithium in bipolar disorder, lithium continues to have the best record in long-term prophylaxis among a variety of agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baastrup and Schou, 1967</xref>). Its acute and prophylactic antimanic effects are amply demonstrated, and recent meta-analyses document its prophylactic antidepressant effects as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Severus <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Acute and prophylactic effects in unipolar depression</title><p>A wealth of data indicate that compared with placebo, lithium acutely enhances the effects of antidepressants. Less well known is the strength of the data in the prophylaxis of recurrent unipolar depressive episodes and the prevention of suicide in this population as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Saleh <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). These authors recommend lithium prophylaxis in unipolar depressed patients after &#x02018;the occurrence of 2 episodes of depression within 5 years&#x02026; particularly in severe depression with psychotic features and high suicidal risk&#x02026;. In some cases, lithium prophylaxis may be recommended after a single episode of depression that is severe with high suicidal risk and continued life-long.&#x02019; In addition, in a new study in 123&#x02009;712 individuals hospitalized for a unipolar depression, prospective follow-up for a mean of 7.7 years revealed fewer rehospitalizations in those treated with lithium, whereas, surprisingly, those treated with either antidepressants or atypical antipsychotics did not show this reduced risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tiihonen <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lithium has antisuicide effects, even in minute levels in the drinking water</title><p>Lithium has the best data to support its antisuicidal effects when used in therapeutic doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abou-Saleh <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldessarini <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Toffol <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). However, miniscule but higher concentrations of lithium in the drinking water are associated with lower rates of suicide in the general population compared with locales with lesser amount of lithium. These findings have now been documented in more than a half dozen studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vita <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). One study reported a lower incidence of crimes, suicides, and arrests for drug use in adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schrauzer and Shrestha, 1990</xref>). Now a new study from Japan indicates higher levels in the water supply are associated with lower rates of depression and interpersonal violence in adolescents in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ando <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lithium may reduce risk of dementia</title><p>Clinical use of lithium is associated with a lower incidence of dementia in old age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kessing <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nunes <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Moreover, excellent lithium responders have preserved cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rybakowski and Suwalska, 2010</xref>). Lithium-treated patients have better visual memory than nonlithium patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bersani <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Quartini <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition, minute doses of lithium (150&#x02009;mg/day) exceed placebo in slowing the rate of cognitive deterioration over 1 year in elderly women with mild cognitive impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Forlenza <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>). Positive effects of micro doses of lithium have been reported in Alzheimer&#x02019;s dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nunes <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lithium has neurotropic and neuroprotective effects</title><p>Lithium is associated with increases in hippocampal and cortical volume. This is likely based on its ability to increase neuroprotective factors BDNF and BCl-2 and decrease apoptotic (cell death factors) BAX and P53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malhi <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rowe and Chuang, 2004</xref>). It increases neurogenesis and gliogenesis. In animal models, lithium lessens the size of lesions associated with AID neurotoxicity, ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, traumatic brain/spinal cord injury (TBI/SCI), Huntington&#x02019;s disease (HD), Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), fragile X syndrome (FXS), Parkinson&#x02019;s disease (PD), retinal degeneration, multiple sclerosis (MS), alcohol-induced degeneration, Down syndrome, spinocerebellar ataxia-1, and irradiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lithium increases telomere length</title><p>Lithium increases the length of telomeres whose preservation is necessary for maintaining both physical and psychiatric health. Lithium&#x02019;s effects on telomeres occurs as a direct result of increasing the activity of the telomere elongation enzyme&#x02014;telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martinsson <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). The longer one is on lithium, the more normal the telomere length becomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Squassina <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). Telomeres are shortened by childhood stressors, greater numbers of depressive episodes, and implacable anger, whereas they are lengthened by exercise, a good diet, mindfulness/meditation, and having positive and altruistic goals in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blackburn <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Epel <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lithium decreases incidence of some medical illnesses</title><p>Lithium may decrease the incidence of some neurological disorders such as seizures, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and dementia NOS, as well as myocardial infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prosser and Fieve, 2016</xref>).

Moreover, if side effects such as tremor do occur at usual &#x02018;therapeutic&#x02019; levels, doses can be reduced to below one&#x02019;s side-effect threshold, especially as many of lithium&#x02019;s clinical effects can be seen at lower levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Post, 2016c</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Post and Leverich, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Although lithium can lower thyroid hormone levels, increase TRH, and induce hypothyroidism in &#x0223c;15% of individuals, this is easily corrected by thyroid hormone supplementation.</p><p>Lithium has been linked to deterioration in renal function evidenced by increasing creatinine levels and decreases in gl<bold>o</bold>merular filtration rate (GFR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta and Khastgir, 2016</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tondo <italic>et al</italic> (2017)</xref> followed 512 bipolar patients and reported that lithium tended to begin to decrease estimated GFR (eGFR) after 10&#x02013;15 years and risk of low values typically required 30 years of treatment, although no patient went on to end-stage renal failure requiring dialysis. They cited risk factors for decreased eGFR as longer lithium treatment, lower lithium dose, higher serum lithium concentration, older age (starting lithium at age &#x02a7e;40 years), medical comorbidity, and low initial baseline eGFR. However, recent reviews suggest that increased creatinine and low GFR may be related to episodes of toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clos <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), are seen just as often in patients maintained on anticonvulsants, and are not unique to lithium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kessing <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the results of lithium discontinuation on those with elevated creatinine levels are ambiguous, although duration of lithium use and age appear to be risk factors for reduced GFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bocchetta <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>). Use of minimum effective doses and careful monitoring is typically recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gupta and Khastgir, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Although lithium can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus because of its block of antidiuretic effects (ie, inhibition of vasopressin effects at the level of adenylate cyclase), these can be moderated by amiloride and potentially by the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor acetazolamide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedford <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Groot <italic>et al</italic>, 2016</xref>). On a positive note, lithium can prevent or reverse the hyponatremia induced by carbamazepine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brewerton and Jackson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joffe <italic>et al</italic>, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vieweg <italic>et al</italic>, 1987</xref>). Lithium via its effects on colony-stimulating factor (CSF) can reverse the benign white cell suppression of carbamazepine mediated by its inhibition of CSF(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramlinger and Post, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Lithium can be associated with increases in serum calcium, sometimes related to the induction of secondary hyperparathyroidism by an adenoma. This can be worked up by measurement of parathyroid hormone, imaging of the parathyroid glands, and treated (if necessary) by surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Norlen <italic>et al</italic>, 2014</xref>).

Lithium is a medal ion Li+ whose radius is close to that of sodium Na+ and many of its actions resemble those of calcium Ca++. Although it was initially thought that an understanding of lithium&#x02019;s mechanism of action would reveal the neuropathology underlying bipolar disorder, the panoply of its proposed actions has precluded this proposition. At the same time, the fact that lithium is such a &#x02018;dirty drug&#x02019; with a multiplicity of actions (on neurotransmitters, receptors, second messengers, kinases, transcription factors, and genes) may be important to its diverse therapeutic effects, as the sheer numbers of its actions may lead to the reregulation of multiple pathways and abnormalities in bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malhi <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rowe and Chuang, 2004</xref>).</p><p>It is of interest that lithium appears to work best in those with: classical presentations of bipolar disorder; a positive family history of a mood or bipolar disorder; euphoric, rather than dysphoric, mania; and discrete episodes and clear well intervals. It works less well in those with rapid cycling or multiple episodes before starting treatment, and in those with an anxiety or substance comorbidity, or mood incongruent delusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Post and Leverich, 2008</xref>). Those with a sequence of depression&#x02013;mania&#x02013;well interval (DMI) respond less well than those with a pattern of MDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koukopoulos <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). Several biochemical predictors of response have been reported, and confirmation of these is eagerly awaited.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion: lithium&#x02019;s role in new clinical recommendations</title><sec><title>Intensive Prophylactic Treatment after a First Manic Episode</title><p>New data have changed the traditional recommendations for prophylaxis in bipolar disorder after several episodes to intensive, long-term prophylaxis after a first mania, although this is not yet uniformly into most treatment guidelines. The recommendation is based on the following principles.</p><p>There is increasing recognition that inadequately treated bipolar disorder can run a progressively deteriorating course (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kessing and Andersen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Post, 2016a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2017</xref>). There is increased behavioral reactivity (sensitization) to the recurrences of stressors, mood episodes, and bouts of substance abuse, and there is cross-sensitization among each of these with the others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Post and Kalivas, 2013</xref>). Epigenetic alterations appear to underlie each type of sensitization, based on long-lasting chemical alterations in DNA, histones, or microRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Post, 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kessing and Andersen (2017)</xref> systematically review the literature on illness progression and find considerable evidence for an association between the number of episodes in unipolar and bipolar disorder and: risk of recurrence; decreased probably of recovery; increased severity; a lowering of the threshold for stressors to precipitate episodes; and a progression of cognitive deficits.</p><p>Thus, it is imperative to initiate treatment in the most expeditious manner possible to prevent the dysfunction, disability, morbidity, and mortality that all too often accompanies bipolar disorder, and often occurs as a function of the number of prior episodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kessing and Andersen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Post <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Proper treatment from the outset appears critical to minimizing the impact of bipolar illness on one&#x02019;s psychological and medical health. Recommendations for long-term prophylaxis starting with the first manic episode are based on the empirical data of three recent studies noted below, as well as the theoretical rationales noted above.</p><p>(1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessing <italic>et al</italic> (2013)</xref> reported that comprehensive specialty clinic treatment resulted in many fewer relapses than treatment as usual (TAU). Such specialty treatment involved hospital transition counseling, illness education, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, mood monitoring, and early symptom recognition. When this was initiated on a randomized basis for 2 years compared with TAU, the outcome in those with specialty treatment was superior to TAU not only for these 2 years, but also for the next 4 years even though all patients returned to TAU after 2 years, suggesting that the clinic patients had learned to manage their illness better (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessing <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>). &#x02018;One must conclude that initial intensive and comprehensive treatment can change the course of bipolar disorder and make it a more benign illness.&#x02019;</p><p>(2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yatham <italic>et al</italic> (2017)</xref> reported that cognitive deficits seen after a first mania improve over the next year only if there are no further new mood episodes. Cognitive deficits increase as a function of the number of mood episodes, either depressions or manias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kessing and Andersen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Post <italic>et al</italic>, 2012</xref>). Deficits start after a first mania and are not remediated if further episodes occur within the first year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yatham <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). The message is clear: one must prevent further episodes even after a first mania to protect cognition and its association with dysfunction and other aspects of illness progression.</p><p>(3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berk <italic>et al</italic> (2017)</xref> reported on the comparative efficacy of a year of randomized treatment with either lithium or the atypical antipsychotic quetiapine after a first episode. Compared with quetiapine, the outcome in those randomized to lithium was superior on all measures, and the differences became apparent and increasingly so in the past 6 months of the first year. This included: all aspects of mania and depression; functioning; cognition; and brain imaging measures of white matter volume. Thus, it would appear prudent for lithium to be included in the long-term treatment regimen if at all possible, based not only on the data of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berk <italic>et al</italic> (2017)</xref>, but the multiple other assets of lithium summarized above.</p></sec><sec><title>Earlier Recognition of Children in the United States at High Risk for Early-Onset Bipolar Disorder</title><p>Recent data indicate that in the United States, youngsters are at a higher risk of a childhood-onset (&#x0003c;13 years of age) bipolar disorder and its related conditions and comorbidities than those from Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and multiple other European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Post <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>). This appears based to a large extent on a greater burden of multiple generation genetic vulnerability and increases in adversity in childhood, possibly along with a host of other variables including poor diet, obesity, and the like. Early-onset illness is associated with a longer duration of delay to first treatment, and both early onset and treatment delay are risk factors for a poor outcome in adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Post <italic>et al</italic>, 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2010</xref>). Much of the current treatment of childhood-onset bipolar disorder leaves much to be desired. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geller <italic>et al</italic> (2010)</xref> reported that 37% of the children (average age 11 years) with a <italic>bona fid</italic>e research diagnosis of bipolar disorder never received any of the consensus recommended treatments over an 8-year follow-up in the community. Those who did receive lithium did the best and had the highest rates of remission.</p><p>We are not necessarily suggesting greater use of lithium in children with bipolar disorder the United States, even though recent studies confirm its efficacy in mania (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Findling <italic>et al</italic>, 2015</xref>), as the necessary comparative studies have not been performed to inform optimal treatment. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geller <italic>et al</italic> (2012)</xref> found superiority of an atypical antipsychotic over either lithium or valproate in childhood bipolar disorder. Nonetheless, better recognition of the substantial incidence of childhood-onset bipolar disorder in the United States and earlier initiation of appropriate psychosocial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Miklowitz <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>) and pharmacological treatment may be life saving.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Lithium is underutilized in the treatment of bipolar disorder, especially in the United States compared with the Netherlands and Germany (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Post <italic>et al</italic>, 2011</xref>), and likely many other European countries. Disappointingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldessarini <italic>et al</italic> (2007)</xref> revealed in 7760 adults with a new-onset bipolar disorder diagnosis in a general practice in the United States that patients were rarely treated with lithium (7.5%), any mood stabilizer (24.6%), or an antipsychotic (10.7%), but were given antidepressants, which are not recommended, 49.8% of the time. In an epidemiological survey, 80% of adolescents meeting criteria for a bipolar spectrum disorder were not in treatment of any kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Merikangas <italic>et al</italic>, 2010</xref>).</p><p>We do not know for sure whether greater use of lithium in adults with bipolar disorder in the United States would help render the illness more benign, but it is clear that early expert treatment is a good place to start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kessing <italic>et al</italic>, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2014</xref>). In concert with new treatment research and public health efforts, it is hoped that early recognition and treatment may begin to ameliorate some of the devastation of multigenerational transmission of bipolar disorder in the United States and around the world. It would appear that greater consideration of the use of lithium for prevention of unipolar and bipolar disorder and their associated high risks of suicide and increased medical mortality is indicated. This is a message that Mogens Schou promulgated throughout his extraordinary clinical and scientific career, and now even more data exist to support this conclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding and disclosure</title><p>RMP declares no conflict of interest that is directly pertinent to the topic of this article, although he has been a speaker for Astra Zeneca, Sunovion, Validus, and Takeda in the past year.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Comments on lithium from Robert M.
