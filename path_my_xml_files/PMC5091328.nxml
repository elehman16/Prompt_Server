We determined the safety and efficacy of the TLR-9 agonist DNA-based immunomodulatory sequence 0150 [DIMS0150] in ulcerative colitis [UC] patients refractory to standard therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 131 patients with moderate-to-severe active UC were randomized to receive two single doses of the oligonucleotide DIMS0150 [30 mg] or placebo administered topically during lower GI endoscopy at baseline and Week 4. The primary endpoint was clinical remission, defined as Clinical Activity Index [CAI] &#x02264;4, at Week 12. Secondary endpoints included mucosal healing and symptomatic remission of key patient-reported outcomes [absence of blood in stool and weekly stool frequency &#x0003c;35].</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>There was no statistical significant difference between the groups in the induction of clinical remission at Week 12, with 44.4% in the DIMS0150 group vs. 46.5% in the placebo group. However, the proportion of patients who achieved symptomatic remission was 32.1% in the DIMS0150 group vs. 14.0% in the placebo group at Week 4 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.020], and 44.4% vs. 27.9% at Week 8 [<italic>p</italic> = 0.061]. More patients on DIMS0150 compared with those on placebo had mucosal healing [34.6% vs. 18.6%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.09] and histological improvement regarding the Geboes score [30.9% vs. 9.3%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0073] at Week 4. Significantly more patients on DIMS0150 were in clinical remission with mucosal healing at Week 4: 21% vs. 4.7% in the placebo group [<italic>p</italic> = 0.02]. DIMS0150 was well tolerated, and no safety signals compared with placebo were evident.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Therapy with the topically applied TLR-9 agonist DIMS0150 is a promising and well-tolerated novel therapeutic option for treatment-refractory, chronic active UC patients, warranting further clinical trials.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words:</title><kwd>Toll-like receptors</kwd><kwd>ulcerative colitis</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Ulcerative colitis [UC] is characterized by a superficial, continuous mucosal inflammation, which is predominantly limited to the large intestine.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;3</xref></sup> A proportion of patients do not respond to available therapies, thereby becoming treatment refractory and requiring surgical intervention, i.e. proctocolectomy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;5</xref></sup> Therefore, novel treatment strategies are needed. The pathogenesis of UC is poorly understood, but current understanding implies that UC is an immune-mediated condition resulting from the dysregulated balance between commensal enteric flora and the gut-associated immune system.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> It is commonly assumed that failure to regulate protective cell-mediated immune responses can result in sustained activation of the mucosal immune system.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">One of the ways that a host discerns foreign from self-antigen is through pattern recognition receptors [PRRs], which recognize specific molecular patterns of pathogens.<sup><xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> These include Toll-like receptors [TLRs], which act as innate receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns in commensal bacteria. They thus play a pivotal role in mucosal wound healing by controlling the process of epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> TLR-9 recognizes exclusively bacterial DNA by serving as a ligand for its CG [CpG] motifs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> These CpG sequence motifs, composed of unmethylated CpG dinucleotides, have been identified as the immunostimulatory component of bacterial DNA.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The ability to modulate both mucosal healing and the immune system makes the CpG motif an attractive therapeutic target. TLR-9 activation has been shown to prevent development of mucosal inflammation and promote wound healing in several models of experimental colitis; however, there was also some controversy in the beginning because some authors proposed a CpG-dependent contribution to the perpetuation of chronic intestinal inflammation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;16</xref></sup> In UC patients, a positive correlation between the severity of endoscopic and histological inflammation and TLR-9 expression could be found.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">DNA-based immunomodulatory sequence 0150 [DIMS0150] [Kappaproct<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, cobitolimod] is a single-stranded DNA-based synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide [ODN] that contains an unmethylated CpG motif, which activates TLR-9 in target cells such as intestinal T and B lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells [APCs], with potent induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 [IL-10] and type I interferons.<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Although administration of DIMS0150 did not meet the pre-specified endpoint in a previous small clinical study in steroid-refractory UC patients, clinical benefit could be observed regarding sustained clinical efficacy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Similar observations were made in treatment-refractory UC patients within a compassionate use program.<sup><xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>

Calculation was done by the Chi-square test and using the statistical software Nquery 6.0. Sample size calculation revealed that 67 plus 33 subjects were needed, plus 20 subjects [20%] because of dropout. The intention-to-treat principle was used to define the primary analysis population, the Full Analysis Set [FAS], which consisted of all randomized patients that received at least one dose of the study drug [active or placebo], and who had at least one post-randomization eligible value of the efficacy endpoint. The safety population included all patients in the study who received treatment with at least one dose of the study drug. For the efficacy analyses, missing data was replaced using the last-observation-carried-forward [LOCF] method, where appropriate, i.e. for data in the induction phase, 0&#x02013;12 weeks.

Secondary categorical efficacy variables were evaluated using the same statistical approach as that described for the primary efficacy endpoint, except for time-to-event endpoints, which were presented using Kaplan&#x02013;Meier curves and analyzed using the log rank test. The continuous efficacy endpoints of the IBDQ and SF36 subdomains were analyzed using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with regard to the mean change from baseline, and with treatment group and baseline CAI as fixed factors. The statistical hypothesis tested was OE = 1 for the primary endpoint and the secondary categorical endpoints. Further, the hypothesis to be tested did not differ between treatment arms with respect to the mean change from baseline in the continuous efficacy endpoint. The FAS population was used as the primary analysis population. All tests were two-sided, and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

However, these findings are based upon use of an outcome measure that is no longer accepted by regulatory authorities.</p><p content-type="indent">By contrast, in an exploratory analysis using criteria that reflect the two items [stool frequency and rectal bleeding] used in the patient-reported outcome 2 [PRO2] score,<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> DIMS0150 therapy caused statistically significant improvements in symptomatic remission at Weeks 4 and 8 compared with the placebo, with enhanced mucosal healing at Week 4 and statistically significant findings for combined clinical and endoscopic remission at Week 4. These items are the three currently favored items of the Mayo score [stool frequency, rectal bleeding, and endoscopic finding], as they exclude the rather subjective influence of the clinician&#x02019;s impression of the patient&#x02019;s disease status [Physicians Global Assessment].<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> It is very likely that the use of the CAI score to define the primary endpoint in the study was not sensitive enough regarding changes in relevant clinical symptoms, and it excludes indispensable endoscopic assessment.</p><p content-type="indent">Another likely reason that the primary endpoint clinical remission was missed is that there was a too long interval between the last treatment dose at Week 4 and the assessment at Week 12. An additional likely contributor was an unexpectedly high rate of clinical remission in the patients treated with placebo, potentially caused by concomitant steroid therapy.</p><p content-type="indent">The exploratory analysis also showed that DIMS0150 therapy caused significant improvements in histological disease activity at Week 4 compared with placebo, as assessed by the Geboes score. Athough the Geboes score is a widely used instrument to measure disease activity, this index is not validated, and therefore the observations have certain limitations. In the future this can be overcome by using validated scoring systems for ulcerative colitis, e.g. the Nancy histological index recently published by Marchal-Bressenot <italic>et al.</italic>
<sup><xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">There was some evidence that patients in the DIMS0150 treatment group had a greater reduction in their steroid dose throughout the study compared with the placebo group, thus possibly showing some steroid-sparing effect of DIMS0150. There was also evidence that the rate of colectomy at 5 months was lower in the DIMS0150 group compared with the placebo group, although low patient numbers mean these data must be treated with caution. These considerations require that our secondary and exploratory analyses be given serious consideration, in a limited hypothesis-generating role. They suggest that benefit may be detectable at earlier time points, especially if endoscopic changes are included.</p><p content-type="indent">The CAI score contains a large number of outcome measures that are currently considered to introduce subjectivity to the score, or which [in the case of extra-intestinal manifestations] introduce bias because they cannot apply to most patients.<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Restricting the symptom analysis to key symptoms [such as bowel frequency and bleeding] that are currently considered reliable and which are similar to those in the Mayo score and PRO-2 assessment, resulted in significant differences between the groups. These analyses provide exploratory evidence for the generation of new hypotheses that DIMS0150 treatment would be superior to placebo if administered according to a different protocol, using measures that are currently regarded as more valid than those that we have used.</p><p content-type="indent">Importantly, DIMS0150 treatment was safe and well tolerated. There were no significant SAEs or deaths during the study. The topical application of DIMS0150 clearly adds to the safety profile of DIMS0150, as no systemic uptake of the medication could be observed. In regard to other possible treatment options in refractory UC, systemically given antibodies are associated with multiple AEs [e.g. opportunistic infections and immunogenic reactions], so topical application in UC represents an attractive route of administration regarding therapeutic efficacy with limited systemic AEs.</p><p content-type="indent">Among the concepts used to build new therapeutic compounds, the antisense ODN approach is gaining increased attention in the field of IBD. The systemic administration of alicaforsen [targeting intracellular adhesion molecule-1, which mediates the recruitment of leukocytes to the inflamed mucosa] was not effective in Crohn&#x02019;s disease,<sup><xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> but ameliorated signs of active UC upon topical application.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> In a recently performed Phase 2 trial in Crohn&#x02019;s disease patients, the oral antisense ODN mongersen, which targets the intracellular protein SMAD7 that inhibits transforming growth factor [TGF-]-&#x000df;1, demonstrated high efficacy in inducing clinical remission in patients with active disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">We think the hypothesis that enhancement of mucosal healing and anti-inflammatory properties mediated via TLR9 makes the oligonucleotide DIMS0150 a safe first-in-class therapeutic agent that is worth testing in a future improved trial. As well as basing the primary endpoint upon measures that are currently considered more valid than those used here, such a trial could use a different time from final dose to assessment of the primary endpoint.</p><p content-type="indent">In conclusion, therapy with the topically applied TLR-9 agonist DIMS0150 did not reach the defined primary endpoint of induction of clinical remission at Week 12 in active moderate-to-severe UC patients in the present study. However, statistical significant improvements in clinical remission with mucosal healing and symptomatic remission at earlier time points imply that activation of TLR-9 has a therapeutic potential in patients with UC. Subsequent studies are warranted to further identify the therapeutic potential of topically applied DIMS0150 in therapy-refractory patients with chronic active UC, thereby broadening the data regarding the application of ODN in the field of IBD.<sup><xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup>
