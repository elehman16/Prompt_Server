The trial has been performed according to the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki Ethical Principles for medical research in pediatrics, and it was registered at the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02442128).</p><p>Children with a history of malignant hyperthermia, gastroesophageal reflux, anticipated difficult intubation, cardiorespiratory disease, respiratory tract infection in the previous 2 weeks, neurological or neuromuscular disease, known sensitivity to the drugs used, and children who refused to undergo an inhalational induction or in whom intravenous (IV) access had already been inserted were excluded from the study. All patients fasted 6 h for solid food and 4 h for clear liquids preoperatively and underwent a detailed preoperative preparation. EMLA cream was applied to the skin over a visible vein on the dorsum of both hands of all patients 1 h before surgery, and all patients were premedicated with 0.3 mg/kg oral midazolam (maximum dose of 12 mg) 30 min before induction. Children who refused to take oral midazolam were excluded from the study. No IV line was inserted and children were allowed to watch cartoon movies during their stay in the holding area.</p><p>Upon arrival at the operating theater, standard monitoring was used throughout the study, including noninvasive blood pressure, temperature, electrocardiogram, and pulse oximetry. Expired concentrations of sevoflurane, carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and oxygen during the study were continuously monitored using gas analyzer of the anesthesia workstation (a Datex Capnomac airway gas monitor, Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland).</p><p>After preoxygenation for 3 min with 100% oxygen, anesthesia was induced by a circle system with sevoflurane (Aesica Queenborough Ltd., for Abbott Laboratories Ltd., UK) in 100% oxygen (6 L/min) through a facemask, with a gradual increase of sevoflurane concentration with every single breath to a maximum of 6 vol%. Initially, patients breathed spontaneously and the facemask ventilation was then gently manually assisted when they became apneic using a 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O inspiratory pressure to maintain oxygen saturation above 95% and an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> between 35 and 40 mmHg.</p><p>After loss of consciousness and the eyelash reflex, the inspired concentration of sevoflurane concentration was reduced to 3% and IV access was secured in all children using a 22-G cannula sited on the dorsum of a hand.</p><p>The allocated children were randomly assigned using a computer-generated random number table technique to one of two groups: Group I (administered with 2 mg/kg propofol preceded by 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl, <italic>n</italic> = 45) and Group II (administered with 3 mg/kg propofol preceded by 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl, <italic>n</italic> = 45). All syringes with study drugs were prepared and diluted with saline to the total volume 10 ml by an independent investigator who was not participated in any other part of the study.</p><p>In both groups, fentanyl was first administered IV over 30 s followed by propofol over 20 s. Ninety seconds after administration of propofol, laryngoscopy and oral tracheal intubation with an appropriate-sized noncuffed tracheal tube was performed using a suitable-sized Macintosh laryngoscope by a second, an experienced unbiased anesthetist (one of the authors) who enters the anesthetic room when the child was asleep and unaware of the patient's randomization group. Caution was taken to avoid touching the carina during intubation process.</p><p>Each study drug was administered by an observer who was completely blinded to the study and to the group allocation of the child, and also, the attending anesthesiologist who intubated patients, recorded all parameters, and graded the airway conditions remained blinded to the study drug given and the master codes were held by a person who did not participate in the observation.</p><p>The quality of tracheal intubating conditions was evaluated according to the previously described scoring system proposed by Viby-Mogensen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Five factors were considered for assessment: jaw relaxation, ease of laryngoscopy, vocal cord position, coughing, and patient movement as excellent (1), good (2), or poor (3).

Once the trachea was intubated, a few breaths were delivered manually to assure tracheal placement of the endotracheal tube.

The doses of propofol were chosen owning to the concept that doses &#x0003c;2 mg/kg in children seem likely to only partially suppress cough reflex.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] We suggested that an increase in the propofol dose from 2 to 3 mg/kg improved the degree of coughing significantly which may be attributed to the apneic, and the suppressive effect of propofol on upper airway reactivity and the muscle tone,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] whereas the beneficial effect of fentanyl is mainly related to the depressant effects on laryngeal reflexes, and its antitussive effect so that it blunts the pressor responses and prevents the bucking during tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In the current study, although both doses of propofol along with fentanyl were associated with a significant decrease in MAP following induction, this fall was within clinically acceptable limits and the usual increase in HR following tracheal intubation was significantly less in patients who received 3 mg/kg propofol. We did not find the doses of propofol to be associated with any episode of severe bradycardia or hypotension. The incidence of hypotension could be partially attributed to many factors, including variations of circulatory effects in anesthetic agents, volume status of the child, and presence of surgical stimulation. However, this study was conducted in healthy children and might not be well tolerated in some sick children.</p><p>A various scoring system for assessing intubating conditions have been used in previous studies.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] However, we used the scoring system of Viby-Mogensen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] which included limb movements for better assessment. The key reason for the discrepancy of our results from those results in previous studies might be related to the different study designs: patient population, sample size, premedication given, type of adjuvant induction agents, doses, the timing and sequence of drug administration, and finally the subjective criteria used to evaluate the quality of intubating conditions by different assessment scores.</p><p>In the current study, excellent intubating conditions were chosen to be our primary outcome based on the results of Mencke <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who suggested that laryngeal morbidities such as postoperative hoarseness and vocal cords sequelae could be attributed to less than excellent intubating conditions. A report by Combes <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] demonstrated that tracheal intubation without neuromuscular blocking agent is associated with more frequent adverse postoperative upper airway symptoms and adverse hemodynamic events if laryngoscopy and intubation are attempted under inadequate conditions. In the present study, we did not report any significant airway complication associated with the used techniques.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Limitation</title><p>First, no control group (receiving only sevoflurane) was included in this study design as sevoflurane induction alone produces inadequate intubating conditions. Second, potential limitation was that we did not compare sevoflurane group with a muscle relaxant as some procedures were cochlear implant surgeries and others were short procedures precluding the use of a muscle relaxant. Finally, premedication may contribute to the quality of intubating conditions, and the results of the current study might be quite different in other unpremeditated children. However, all of our patients received the same premedication with oral midazolam; therefore, we do not consider the premedication to be a relevant factor of intubating conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that the administration of 3 mg/kg propofol preceded by 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl provides a higher proportion of excellent intubating conditions compared with 2 mg/kg propofol preceded by 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl during sevoflurane induction in healthy, premedicated children without muscle relaxants. We recommended the use of this regimen where tracheal intubation is necessary but muscle relaxing agents is undesirable.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Financial support and
