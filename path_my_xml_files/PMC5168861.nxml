Their effectiveness varies. The program &#x02018;Beyond Good Intentions&#x02019; (BGI) is based on proactive coping and has proven to be (cost-) effective in achieving reductions in BMI and blood pressure in screen-detected type 2 diabetes patients up until nine months follow-up. However, its long-term effectiveness in people already known with diabetes is lacking. In addition, its (cost-) effectiveness might increase if people who are likely not to be benefit from the program are excluded in a valid way. Therefore it was aimed to investigate the long-term effects of the educational program BGI on cardiovascular risk, quality of life and diabetes self-management behaviour in a pre-selected group of patients known with type 2 diabetes up to 5&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Randomised controlled trial with 2.5&#x000a0;year follow-up.

With the use of a self-management screening tool (SeMaS) their potential barriers of self-management due to depression and/or anxiety will be determined. Based on the results of the SeMaS selection patients will be randomised (1:1) to the BGI-group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;53) or the control-group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;53). In addition to receiving usual care, patients in the BGI-group will follow the 12-week theory-based self-management program and a booster session a few months thereafter. The control-group will receive care as usual. The primary outcome is change in Body Mass Index after 2.5&#x000a0;years follow-up. Secondary outcomes are HbA1c, lipid profile and systolic blood pressure, (diabetes) quality of life, level of physical activity, dietary intake and medication adherence and proactive coping. Cost-effectiveness will be based on total use of health care resources during the entire study period. Difference between groups in change over time will be analysed according to intention-to-treat analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>By differentiating between patients who will and those who are likely not to benefit from the educational program, a more (cost-) effective self-management program might be designed, also on the long-run.</p><p>

People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are expected to take more and more responsibility in this, but for many of them self-management is difficult to incorporate in daily life and not all patients will possess the necessary skills for this. The motivation to initiate changes in behaviour is often present, but patients do not know what needs to change or maintain the achieved behavioural lifestyle when barriers are encountered. We developed the Beyond Good Intentions (BGI) program to enhance the ability of patients to act upon their intentions. It is based on the theories of self-regulation and proactive coping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], assuming that people should control and direct their actions in order to meet their goals. Pro-active coping refers to efforts undertaken in advance of a potentially stressful event to prevent or modify its form before it occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. BGI has proven to be effective in patients with screen-detected T2DM up until 9&#x000a0;months follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Based on a computer-based simulation model to project long-term health benefits and cost-effectiveness, BGI was among the four diabetes self-management programs worldwide, with a minimum follow-up of 12&#x000a0;months, with the best cost-effectiveness ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, real, not modelled, long-term data on (cost-) effectiveness of BGI are lacking and also its effectiveness in people who are known with T2DM and not screen-detected, is unclear.</p><p>Group based educational programs for diabetes self-management can improve blood glucose, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and the requirement of blood glucose lowering drugs; however, the long-term results were varying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In Italy, non-insulin-treated T2DM patients known with diabetes for at least 1&#x000a0;year were randomised to either group or individual care in a hospital-based setting. After 4&#x000a0;years clinical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes were better in the group based treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In the DESMOND trial, greater improvements in weight loss and smoking cessation were found in the intervention group at 1-year-follow-up, but at 3-year-follow-up this effect was no longer apparent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In general, completers of a diabetes self-management intervention study are significantly more highly educated than dropouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This indicates that interventions to improve self-management should be tailored to different categories of patients. The &#x02018;one size fits all&#x02019; principle in diabetes education research is outdated. To estimate a priori the chance of successful self-management of a patient, the self-management screening tool (SeMaS) can be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. With SeMaS possible barriers for self-management due to depression and/or anxiety can be detected. Both depression and anxiety can interfere with the effectiveness of a self-management program at that moment for a particular person and should be dealt with before following the program. Besides, individuals with already high self-management capabilities are likely to have no additional benefit from an educational course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesise that by differentiating between patients who may and those who may not benefit from a self-management program, a more (cost-) effective self-management education program can be designed which is also effective on the long-run. Therefore, the aim of the current study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness and long-term effects of the educational program BGI on cardiovascular risk, quality of life and diabetes self-management behaviour in a preselected group of known T2DM patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Setting</title><p>In Dutch primary care, most patients (80&#x02013;85%) are treated within disease management programs, contracted by so called care groups.

All patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be informed about the possibility to follow a group-based diabetes self-management education program with pre-selection (see further), emphasising that they will be only offered an educational program they are likely to benefit from. People can indicate on a response card whether or not they want to receive oral information about the study. If yes, a research team member will give the patient a telephone call to discuss the study. If the patient is informed and understands the information, informed consent will be completed. Once the patient has given informed consent the pre-selection will take place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Pre-selection</title><p>The pre-selection procedure to assess a patient&#x02019;s capabilities of self-management will be performed with the use of the SeMaS, a self-management screening tool which is validated in T2DM patients and sent to the patients home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The SeMaS is a 27 item questionnaire covering self-management abilities of five psychosocial domains [locus-of-control (3 items), self-efficacy (2 items), social support (1 items), coping (9 items), anxiety (4 items) and depression (3 items)], three skills items (computer, group and self-care) and two other items including perceived burden of disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. All separate items range from 0 to 3 on a 4-point Likert scale (locus-of-control, self-efficacy, coping, skills items) or from 0 to 2 on a 3-point Likert scale (social support, anxiety, depression). For all items higher scores represent higher capability, except for those in the anxiety and depression domain where higher score represent more barriers. The perceived burden of disease is scored on a visual analogue scale from 0 to 10. Patients with high scores on the domains anxiety (score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;4 from total 8) and/or depression (score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;3 of total 6) will be excluded during the pre-selection. Those patients first need to deal with their mood disturbance before they are able to improve their self-management skills. Patients without barriers for self-management, so with maximal self-management capacity (highest possible scores for the locus-of-control, self-efficacy, social support, coping and for anxiety&#x000a0;&#x02264;4 and for depression&#x000a0;&#x02264;3) were also excluded, since they would not benefit from the educational course. The general practitioner (GP) will be informed about the SeMaS scores of all participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients who are eligible after the pre-selection will be randomised (1:1) based on computer-generated random numbers, with sealed, opaque, sequentially numbered allocation envelopes. All patients entering the trial receive a random number from the coordinating research centre (Julius Center). Each number corresponds to either &#x02018;BGI course&#x02019; (BGI-group) or &#x02018;no BGI course&#x02019; (control-group). As patients will attend a course in the intervention group, it is not possible to blind participants for the treatment allocation. Patients from the same practices and general practitioners will attend a different course, so no large cluster-effect is expected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Intervention: beyond good intentions (BGI)</title><p>This study elaborates on the existing self-management program BGI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It lasts 12&#x000a0;weeks and consists of one initiating 30-min individual session and four 2.5-h group sessions. In addition, one booster-session is given a few months after the last group session. The course structure is as follows:</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Individual session</title><p>The patient&#x02019;s knowledge, attitudes and ambivalence with regard to diabetes management will be discussed. For this purpose the &#x02018;Diabetes Profile&#x02019; was specifically designed to help patients gaining insight in the risk factors associated with their diabetes. With a colour scheme, from green to red, their risk for long-term complications is presented. Patients are encouraged to set goals to work on. The trained practice nurse (see further) discusses glycaemic control, BMI, blood pressure and lipids profile with the patient. Patients are asked to formulate a first goal before the first group session and will receive the educational material that will be discussed during the group sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Group sessions</title><p>The group sessions are held in groups of six to ten participants and take place every two to three weeks in a location nearby the patients&#x02019; homes. The first three sessions will cover topics that are relevant for all patients: physical activity, healthy diet and medication adherence (what do guidelines tell, why it is important to follow these guidelines and how to do it, what are known barriers in this respect, what might facilitate compliance, followed by individual goals to improve). In the fourth session patients will be able to work on a personally relevant goal.</p><p>Every group session starts with the introduction of the topic, patients are asked to share their opinions, emotions and experiences regarding the topic. Subsequently, patients write their own individual action plan, according to the proactive coping five-step plan:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Step 1: Formulate a concrete and attainable goal.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 2: What are necessary conditions and possible barriers?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 3: What may be alternative strategies for crossing these possible barriers?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 4: Formulate the final plan: what, how, where, and when?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Step 5: Indicate how the progress will be evaluated and when you are satisfied, the plan is discussed with the group to improve the final plan.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>During the weeks in between the groups sessions patients will practice with their individual action plane, which will be evaluated during the next meeting.</p><p>In case of diabetes-related questions, patients are encouraged to collect additional information by themselves, e.g. on the Internet or by referring them to another professional like a physiotherapist or dietician. This way, patients are encouraged to take responsibility for their disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Booster session (evaluation)</title><p>In this session the past months will be discussed and goals will be evaluated.

For the current study a minimum sample size of 88 (44 per group) is required to achieve 80% power to detect a difference of 0.77 in a design with 6 repeated measurements of BMI (weight is measured every three months as part of usual diabetes care) having a AR (1) covariance structure when the standard deviation is 1.7, the correlation between subsequent observations on the same subject is 0.70, and alpha 0.05. With an expected drop-out rate of 20%, we need to include a total of 106 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>The efficacy analysis will be performed by intention-to-treat analysis, including all patients from whom a follow-up assessment is available. If necessary a multiple imputation technique will be used for missing data. The primary outcome will be analysed by using Generalized Estimated Equations (GEE) for repeated measures, with baseline BMI as covariate and time, intervention and the interaction of time and intervention as fixed variables. The secondary outcomes will be analysed with ANCOVA on the change from baseline to follow-up. In addition differences in characteristics (e.g. age, sex, education level) of participants and non-participants will be evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Cost-effectiveness</title><p>Lifetime costs and health effects (based on the EQ&#x000a0;5D) will be estimated using a modified probabilistic diabetes model. This validated model has been used before and is described in more detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In brief, the model simulates the natural history of type 2 diabetes and calculates costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for Dutch T2DM patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The model includes a health state for cardiovascular disease (CVD; myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral arterial disease), microvascular complications (end-stage renal disease, retinopathy and neuropathy), uncomplicated type 2 diabetes and death. The model computes the occurrence of the above-mentioned diabetes-related complications and the excess mortality due to diabetes. Based on the estimated events and prevalence of complications, it computes diabetes-related lifetime medical costs and QALYs.</p><p>To calculate lifetime costs and outcomes, each health state is assigned a value in terms of medical costs and utility (health-related quality of life), and this value is multiplied by the prevalence of the health states over time.</p><p>In addition to the model input data described above, medication costs of glucose-lowering drugs, anti-hypertensive medication and cholesterol-lowering drugs used during the total follow-up period will be included in the cost calculation. Costs of the BGI-course and total health care resources (including consultations of the dietician) use during the whole study period will also be included in the cost calculation. These costs will be extrapolated to estimate lifetime medication costs, assuming that the cost difference between the BGI-group and the control-group remains constant over time.</p><p>The model will calculate two lifetime health outcomes (life years, QALYs) and costs for each patients (discounted and undiscounted). To correct for confounding and improve model estimates of the difference in outcome between the BGI-group and the control-group, the following baseline covariates will be used: age, sex, duration of diabetes, history of cardiovascular disease, smoking, HbA1c, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL cholesterol.</p><p>The primary outcome of the cost-effectiveness analyses will be the cost-effectiveness of BGI versus control, expressed as the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), calculated by dividing the incremental costs by the incremental QALYs or incremental life years. Uncertainty surrounding the cost-effectiveness ratios as calculated from the model will be expressed using a cost-effectiveness plane. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve will be created to determine whether implementation of BGI is cost-effective given different thresholds of willingness to pay for a QALY (e.g. a threshold of &#x020ac; 20.000 per QALY).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Discussion</title><p>In diabetes self-management education the &#x02018;one-size-fits-all&#x02019; approach is not very effective. Not all patients will possess the necessary self-management skills. While a certain motivation and perseverance may be needed to change one&#x02019;s behaviours, successful maintenance ultimately depends on one&#x02019;s ability to anticipate and deal with a wide range of potential stressors that challenge diabetes management and long-term health. This is the central tenet of proactive coping, a self-regulatory model which describes the steps people take in pursuit of their long-term goals. From our previous research we know that proactive coping may be a better predictor of good long-term self-management than either intentions or self-efficacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The current study will add knowledge about the program in three different aspects: its 2.5&#x000a0;year (cost-) effectiveness and the impact of pre-selection of patients. This knowledge will be of importance, because to deal with the global diabetes epidemic, cost-effective self-management education programs that are also effective on the long run are needed.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ADDQoL</term><def><p>Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BGI</term><def><p>beyond good intentions</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVD</term><def><p>cardio vascular disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-5D</term><def><p>Euro QoL 5D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EQ-VAS</term><def><p>Euro QoL visual analog scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DOH</term><def><p>De Ondernemende Huisarts</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QALY</term><def><p>quality-adjusted life years</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PASE</term><def><p>physical activity scale for elderly</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PDMI</term><def><p>proactive diabetes management inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PoZoB</term><def><p>Praktijkondersteuning Zuidoost Braband</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDSCA</term><def><p>summary of diabetes self-care activities measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SeMaS</term><def><p>self-management screening tool</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>short-form 36</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SGE</term><def><p>Stichting Gezondheidscentra Eindhoven</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T2DM</term><def><p>type 2 diabetes mellitus</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>GEHMR is the principle investigator of the trial.
