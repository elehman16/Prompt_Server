Our studies, and those of others, have demonstrated that OPN contributes functionally to aggressive cell behavior, tumor progression and metastasis. Although OPN is not tumor-specific, its potential as a tumor marker has been described in many malignancies, including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>When measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC), OPN expression in breast cancer tissue has been documented both in tumor cells and infiltrating host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In a cohort of 154 patients with lymph node negative breast cancer, we reported that OPN immunopositivity in tumor cells, using a semi-quantitative IHC scoring system, was significantly associated with decreased disease-free and overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similarly, Rudland&#x02019;s group reported an association between OPN positivity and poor prognosis in early breast cancer, also using a semi-quantitative IHC scoring system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Using an ELISA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) that we previously developed and clinically validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we demonstrated that compared with levels in healthy women, or patients who had completed treatment for primary breast cancer, plasma OPN levels in women with metastatic breast cancer were elevated and associated with worse survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In the mid-1990s, we initiated a series of studies in early and metastatic breast cancer to further explore the potential of OPN as a biomarker in tumor tissue and blood. We have already reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] the results of one prospective study, which confirmed our earlier results and showed that 99/158 (63%) of women at first presentation with metastatic breast cancer had elevated levels of plasma OPN, and in multivariate analysis elevated OPN was associated with worse overall survival (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03).</p><p>Thus, elevated OPN levels in both tumor tissue and blood are well-documented to be associated with poor outcome in the setting of metastatic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, much less is known about the prognostic significance of OPN in early breast cancer or when OPN levels rise during breast cancer progression. We thus identified the Mammary (MA).14 phase III clinical trial from the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group (NCIC CTG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], as an opportunity to address these questions. MA.14 provided us with a source of blood and breast tumor tissue samples along with reliable patient data, from women with hormone responsive early breast cancer in the context of a well-controlled clinical trial. We hypothesized that there would be a relationship between baseline tumor and plasma levels of OPN, that both would have prognostic value in early breast cancer, and that breast cancer recurrence would be associated with elevated plasma OPN levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>NCIC CTG MA.14 clinical trial</title><p>In September 1996, the NCIC CTG opened a phase III clinical trial (MA.14) evaluating the survival benefit of a somatostatin analogue, octreotide Long-Acting Release formulation (LAR), added to tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early stage hormone responsive breast cancer. Collection of serum, at baseline and several time-points thereafter, for assay of multiple metabolic markers of insulin resistance, was an integrated secondary objective. All patients enrolled in the MA.14 trial provided written informed consent before participation, and ethics approval was obtained by all participating centers, as previously detailed in the primary trial report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. For our OPN correlative study, a protocol amendment in November 1998 allowed us to add serial plasma collection for OPN, and we also were permitted to access primary tumor paraffin blocks/slides for OPN IHC studies. Postmenopausal women with operable early breast cancer (T1-3, N0, M0) stratified by hormone receptor status were eligible for the MA.14 trial. Tamoxifen 20&#x000a0;mg/day was given for five years in both arms, and octreotide LAR 90&#x000a0;mg intramuscularly (IM) monthly was given for two years in the experimental arm. Modifications in design related to octreotide LAR toxicity are described in the main trial report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Recruitment started in September 1996, and the trial closed in August 2000 with the accrual of 667 women.</p><p>Despite excellent preclinical rationale for the anti-tumor actions of somatostatin analogues, small clinical studies showing breast cancer regression and evidence of greater suppression of insulin-like growth factor by octreotide added to tamoxifen, there was no significant benefit for the combination in terms of event-free survival (HR (hazard ratio) 0.93, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.62), relapse free survival (HR 0.84, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.31) and overall survival (HR 0.97, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.86) at a median follow-up of 7.9&#x000a0;years. Five-year event-free survival for all patients was around 78%. There was no evidence of any significant differences in OPN levels by treatment arm, at any time points and, thus, in our OPN analyses we present data combined from both arms of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample collection</title><p>The plasma sample collection was initiated in November 1998. As this was more than two years after study recruitment started (September 1996), reduced numbers of patients and samples were available at some time points. Plasma samples were shipped at ambient temperature to a central lab by overnight courier, where they were promptly frozen at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until being shipped frozen to the London Regional Cancer Program laboratory for ELISA assessment. Prior to initiation of plasma collection for the MA.14 trial, in a pilot study to assess the potential effect of this collection/storage process, we assessed OPN plasma levels from eight blood samples maintained at room temperature for 4 vs. 24, 48 or 72&#x000a0;hours, and found that measured values did not differ with time at room temperature. The total number of plasma samples available for OPN assays was 2,540, with 624 (94%) of 667 patients having plasma collected at some time. The time-points for collection and numbers of available patients and samples are summarized in Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Primary statistical analyses utilized all samples at each time point, but some exploratory analyses examined data from paired samples for recurrent and non-recurrent patients. Prognostic analyses examined baseline IHC and plasma OPN effects on multiple survival outcomes. To maximize inclusion of patients in these investigations and given the low likelihood of tumor recurrence (2 in 388 patients) in the first four months after randomization, we combined pre-randomization and four-month results, giving a &#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d; assessment of OPN in 388 (58%) of 667 patients. When there were multiple assessment results for a patient during the pre-randomization and four-month time-points, they were averaged to yield a baseline OPN plasma value. For measurement of tumor tissue OPN, it was possible to obtain primary tumor blocks/slides for OPN IHC in 462 (69%) of 667 patients accrued to MA.14. In total, 647 (97%) of patients had either measurement of OPN in primary tumor (by IHC), or one or more measurements of plasma OPN (by ELISA).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Available samples</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Total accrual</bold></th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th><th align="left"><bold>667 patients</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td colspan="3" align="left" valign="bottom">Total patients with samples for OPN analyses<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;Plasma<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- baseline/4&#x000a0;m<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">388 (58%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">- any time<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">624 (94%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;Tumor tissue for IHC<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">462 (69%)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total number plasma samples<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2,540<hr/></td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" align="left" valign="bottom">Timing - plasma samples/number of patients<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;Baseline (pre-randomization)<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">314/301<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;m<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">374/361<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;m<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">396/391<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;12&#x000a0;m<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">406/401<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;16&#x000a0;m*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">33/29<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;24&#x000a0;m<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">540/487<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;36&#x000a0;m<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">206/159<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;48&#x000a0;m*<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">29/29<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;m<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">220/211<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">&#x02003;&#x02003;&#x000a0;Recurrence</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td><td align="left">22/20</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*later protocol amendment eliminated these sample collections.

Volunteer donors were hospital staff who contributed blood samples for the purpose of establishing normal levels of various blood components, including OPN. The only data collected on these individuals were sex and age.</p></sec><sec><title>OPN analytic methods</title><p>OPN was measured in plasma samples by ELISA (Human Osteopontin EIA Kit, catalogue #ADI-900-142, Enzo Life Sciences, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This assay uses two monoclonal antibodies whose epitopes have been defined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It should be noted that one of these antibodies recognizes an epitope that is destroyed by thrombin cleavage and, thus, the ELISA can be used with plasma but not with serum. Samples from MA.14 were measured in duplicate and from healthy women in triplicate, and the values for each sample were averaged.</p><p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples were assessed for OPN expression by IHC using an immunoperoxidase technique, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The primary antibody used was the monoclonal antibody mAb53 (Enzo Life Sciences, catalogue #ADI-905-629). Biotinylated secondary antibody was from the LSAB2 kit (Dako, Burlington, ON, Canada). Stained slides were evaluated by light microscopy in a blinded fashion by two pathologists (ABT, WAK).</p><p>Tumor cell staining for OPN was determined as a continuous variable of the percentage of cells staining (regardless of intensity), as well as using two different semi-quantitative systems. The first was the non-linear system of Allred <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], which assigns proportion and intensity scores as follows: proportion as the estimated fraction of tumor cells staining (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;none; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x0003c;1/100; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;1 to 10%; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;10% to 1/3; 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;1/3 to 2/3; 5 = &#x0003e;2/3, and intensity as the estimated average staining of tumor cells (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;none; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;weak; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;strong). The Allred score is then the sum of proportion and intensity scores (0 for negative staining and 2 to 8 for positive staining ranges). The second, H-scoring system of McCarty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] is a linear system which quantifies the proportion of tumor cells in each intensity category (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no staining; 1&#x02009;=&#x02009;weak; 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate; 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;strong). The percentage of weakly stained cells is multiplied by 1, the percentage of moderately stained cells by 2, and the percentage of strongly stained cells by 3; the total of these three categories then gives the H-score (from 0 to a maximum of 300). As OPN staining of tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells (histiocytes and T-lymphocytes) is generally intense in nature, semi-quantitation of proportion of inflammatory cells staining was performed using a 0 to 3+ system, such that 0&#x02009;=&#x02009;no staining of tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells; 1+&#x02009;=&#x02009;scattered OPN positive tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells, 2+&#x02009;=&#x02009;moderate numbers of positive tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells; and 3+&#x02009;=&#x02009;numerous positive tumor infiltrating inflammatory cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition of MA.14 endpoints</title><p>The primary end point of MA.14 was event-free survival (EFS); secondary end points were relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

For aim 4) we utilized clinical windows to group individual patient OPN values: (a) baseline (pre-randomization/4&#x000a0;months); (b) recurrent cases (Period 1: 8&#x000a0;months after randomization to 18&#x000a0;months prior to recurrence; Period 2: &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;months from recurrence until collection stopped), (c) non-recurrent cases (baseline/4&#x000a0;months; any other time).</p><p>In the 90 healthy women, mean plasma OPN was 28.4&#x000a0;ng/ml, median 26.3 and range 11.8 to 109. The upper 97.5% cut-point was 95&#x000a0;ng/ml.

The values obtained in this larger sample of healthy women are consistent with results from our previous cohort of 35 pre- and post-menopausal healthy women, median OPN 47&#x000a0;ng/ml), range 22 to 122 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

At that time, OPN as a potential tumor marker in breast cancer fit into the category &#x0201c;+&#x0201d; on the Tumor Marker Utility Grading System (TMUGS) proposed by Hayes <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], defined as &#x0201c;sufficient data are available to demonstrate that the marker correlates with the biologic process and/or biologic endpoint related to the use and that the marker results might affect favourable clinical outcome for that use. However, the marker is still considered investigational and should not be used for standard clinical practice&#x02026;&#x0201d;. In July 1997, we had opened a prospective clinical study evaluating the prognostic value of measuring serial OPN levels in women with metastatic breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The current study was intended to be complementary, and extend our investigations to early breast cancer taking advantage of the infrastructure of an existing prospective clinical trial that included collection of primary tumor blocks, and serial blood samples. The design of this correlative study meets the criteria for Level II evidence in the system proposed by Hayes <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] for &#x0201c;Levels of evidence for grading clinical utility of tumor markers&#x0201d;, which outlined a scale of I to V, with Level I providing the best evidence. In 2005 (and updated in 2012), McShane <italic>et al</italic>. published a paper entitled &#x0201c;Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and although this MA.14 correlative study was designed several years earlier, we have endeavored to follow these recommendations in reporting our results.</p><p>In our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], tumor cell OPN IHC staining above an optimized cut-point using the Allred scoring system was significantly associated with decreased DFS and OS in univariate analysis, but only with decreased OS in multivariate analysis (including patient age, menopausal status, tumor size, grade hormone receptor status and p53 positivity). Similarly, Rudland&#x02019;s group has reported that OPN positivity in breast tumor tissue (defined as &#x0003e;5% cells staining by IHC), in women with operable Stage I and II breast cancer, was associated with shorter survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In multivariate analysis, our current study shows no significant association between tumor cell OPN expression, scored in several different ways, and any survival outcome. These findings differ from our previous pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and those of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The MA.14 trial is larger than previous studies, and recruited a uniform population of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors. In previous studies all patients were diagnosed before 1996 (sometimes as far back as 1972) when recruitment started for the MA.14 trial. Better systemic treatments in the modern era, which are associated with steadily improving survival in women with early breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], may have reduced the adverse effects of OPN in primary tumors, accounting for the discrepancy between studies. In addition, the patients in this study are all postmenopausal, most are ER or PR positive, and all received tamoxifen. It is possible that OPN may not have the same prognostic significance in this subgroup of patients. In particular, little is known about how tumor cell OPN expression is affected by estrogen antagonists, although it is known that the OPN promoter can respond to both estrogen receptor alpha and estrogen-related receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. If OPN is indeed down-regulated by tamoxifen use, its prognostic impact in this patient population may have been negated by the therapy.</p><p>In our first study of plasma OPN in 35 healthy female volunteers, the median level was 47&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L (47&#x000a0;ng/ml) with a range 22 to 122&#x000a0;ng/ml, with no significant differences in premenopausal versus postmenopausal women, or according to menstrual status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In 44 women who had completed treatment for early breast cancer at least six months earlier, the range of values was similar, 15 to 117&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L, but the median level was higher at 60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The mean baseline OPN level of 46.0&#x000a0;ng/ml in MA.14 is very similar to the median level we reported for healthy women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We have also shown a similar range of OPN values in 26 healthy male volunteers, median 56&#x000a0;ng/ml, range 26 to 98, using the same ELISA system (Thoms <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], Supplemental file, Table 3a in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]). As all baseline samples for MA.14 were taken within 12&#x000a0;months of primary surgery (for those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy), or within 6&#x000a0;months (no chemotherapy), and this was a population at relatively low risk for recurrence, it is likely that these baseline OPN levels represent a true disease-free (or microscopic residual) state. The 44 women in our pilot study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] were clinically disease-free after treatment for early breast cancer, but blood for OPN was taken at variable intervals (months to years) after the primary diagnosis. These women were not followed subsequently to determine if and/or when they suffered relapse, with the possibility that some had active subclinical recurrence, which may account for the higher median OPN level (60&#x000a0;ng/ml) compared with healthy volunteers. Thus, in MA.14 it is not necessarily surprising that the mean OPN level of 60.7&#x000a0;ng/ml observed during the recurrence period, for women who developed recurrence, is similar to that found in non-recurrent patients in our pilot study.</p><p>In our current study of 90 healthy women, the maximum plasma OPN level was 109&#x000a0;ng/ml, and in healthy male volunteers it was 98&#x000a0;ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In our first study of healthy female controls, the maximum OPN value was 122&#x000a0;ng/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Based on the highest value we have seen in normal controls (122&#x000a0;ng/ml), elevated baseline OPN levels were only seen in 3 of 388 (0.8%) of the women in MA.14. It is interesting that these three patients were in Group B and did not develop recurrence during the follow-up period of the trial. Thus, our results do not suggest that baseline plasma OPN is a useful prognostic marker in this patient population. Our results further did not find an association between levels of OPN in plasma at baseline and tumor tissue in this cohort, perhaps due to the finding that the vast majority of baseline plasma OPN values were not elevated above normal levels.</p><p>However, serial assays in MA.14 have provided some intriguing hints about OPN as a marker of recurrence/metastasis. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, a higher median and upward spread of OPN levels are seen in Group F patients, those with recurrence during the recurrence period, in comparison to the same patients prior to recurrence (Groups C and D). Several patients in Group F had very high OPN levels (maximum 563&#x000a0;ng/ml). We speculate that high OPN levels during follow-up in some Group E patients, without documented recurrence, could in fact represent recurrence as yet undetected clinically. Elevated plasma levels of OPN are associated with poor prognosis in patients with metastatic breast cancer. The present study suggests that baseline OPN plasma levels in postmenopausal patients with hormone responsive early breast cancer receiving tamoxifen may not have the same prognostic value. However, the elevated plasma OPN levels seen in some patients post-baseline suggests that serially monitoring of OPN levels may be of use as an early indicator of relapse.</p><p>Our OPN study has several strengths. There were strong preclinical and some clinical data supporting our interest in exploring OPN as a clinical biomarker in breast cancer in the metastatic setting, but its role in early stage disease was relatively unexplored. The patient population accrued to the MA.14 trial was well defined, and details are given in the final trial report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Multiple patient and tumor prognostic factors were collected, and could be entered in multivariate analyses. Our assays are well validated and reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. We developed pre-specified hypotheses, and a correlative study plan that was compatible with the trial protocol. The results of our IHC and plasma OPN assays were provided to the NCIC CTG MA.14 study statistician (JWC), who developed the detailed statistical plan and performed the analyses.</p><p>Our current study also has several limitations - the relatively short duration of sample collection (five years) at a time when improved treatments for breast cancer may have delayed or even prevented relapse; wide spacing of samples after the first year (every 12&#x000a0;months); and the small numbers of samples (22 in 20 patients) actually obtained at the documented time of relapse. After definitive treatment of primary breast cancer, loco-regional recurrence and/or metastasis will be subclinical for a variable period of time (depending on aggressiveness) before the date of recurrence is documented for trial outcomes. Thus, we defined a recurrence time window (samples collected up to 18&#x000a0;months before recurrence) which expanded the number of available samples for statistical purposes, but may have blunted the comparison of OPN levels between baseline and recurrence. Additionally, the ELISA used here, although clinically validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], may detect only a subset of total blood OPN, for example, not proteolytic fragments of OPN or OPN bound to Factor H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Finally, this trial provides no information about plasma OPN levels before removal of primary breast cancer, as all women had undergone definitive surgery before entering the MA.14 trial and providing their first blood sample. The timing of the baseline samples may also explain the lack of correlation between primary tumor expression of OPN and mean baseline plasma OPN level.</p><p>Our hypothesis that there would be a relationship between baseline tissue and plasma levels of OPN was not supported by our data. Given that blood OPN levels can come from many sources (tumor tissue, remodeling vasculature, inflammatory cells and bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]), and vary with the timing of baseline samples post-resection of primary breast cancer, this finding is perhaps not surprising. Similarly, our hypothesis that tissue and plasma levels would have prognostic value in early breast cancer was not supported in multivariate analysis. This difference from previous studies may be due to improved overall prognosis for women with early breast cancer associated with better adjuvant treatments. In addition, or alternatively, the difference may be related to the specifics of the present population (postmenopausal, mainly ER/PR positive, receiving tamoxifen) and the possible estrogen-sensitivity of the OPN promoter. Finally, the elevation of OPN in post-baseline plasma samples, found in both recurrent and non-recurrent patients (some of whom might have recurred at a later date), suggests that there may be a role for serial measurement of plasma OPN to monitor for recurrence, in the setting of early breast cancer. This latter idea is worthy of further study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Elevated levels of osteopontin (OPN) protein in plasma or tumors from metastatic breast cancer patients have been associated with poor survival. OPN thus has been proposed as a biomarker of breast cancer progression. However, little was known about its prognostic significance in early breast cancer. Here, we measured OPN in tumor tissue and serial plasma samples from hormone responsive patients with early breast cancer enrolled in the MA.14 trial. In multivariate analysis neither plasma nor tumor OPN provided prognostic information. Thus, tumor or plasma OPN levels may be of limited prognostic value in postmenopausal hormone responsive early breast cancer, although this would need to be confirmed on a broader patient population. However, our finding of elevated plasma OPN in post-baseline samples of a small number of patients suggests that further studies exploring OPN plasma levels around the time of recurrence would be worthwhile.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>EFS: Event-free survival; ELISA: Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; HR: Hazard ratio; IHC: Immunohistochemistry; NCIC CTG: National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group; OPN: Osteopontin; OS: Overall survival; RFS: Relapse-free survival; TMUGS: Tumor Marker Utility Grading System.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>AFC received in-kind research support and royalties from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc., for sale of OPN antibody products.
