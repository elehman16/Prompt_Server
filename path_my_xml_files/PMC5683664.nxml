This report details an observational study examining the association between phone service and quitline utilization and cessation among Ohio Appalachian adults willing to quit smoking and enrolled in a cessation trial from 2010 to 2014. A secondary analysis was conducted with data obtained from smokers enrolled in the Ohio Tobacco Quitline arm of a group randomized trial (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;345). The intermediate outcome variables included number of calls, cumulative total call length, average call length, verified shipments of NRT, and 24-hour quit attempt. The primary outcome measure was biologically confirmed 7-day point prevalence abstinence from tobacco at 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months post treatment. Participants with LL service, on average, made almost one more call to the quitline and spoke 17.2&#x000a0;min longer over the course of treatment than those with CPO service. Those with LL service were more likely to receive a second 4-week supply of NRT. Phone service status was not associated with average quitline call length, receiving at least one NRT shipment, having made one quit attempt at the end of treatment, or biochemically confirmed abstinence at 3, 6, or 12-month follow-up. Participants with LL services completed more counseling calls, accrued a longer cumulative length, and received more NRT when compared with CPO service participants. However, type of phone service did not deter abstinence outcomes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>More calls for those with landline (LL) compared to cell only (CPO) phone access</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Cumulative treatment call time higher for those with LL compared to CPO access</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Receipt of 2nd 4-wk NRT supply more likely for those with LL compared to CPO access</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Average quitline call length was not related to LL vs. CPO phone service access.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Abstinence 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months post-baseline were similar by LL vs. CPO phone access.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>Telephones</kwd><kwd>Cell phones</kwd><kwd>Appalachian region</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014</xref>). Though smoking prevalence has declined over the last fifty years, 16.8% of US adults continue to smoke cigarettes (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al., 2015</xref>). Cigarette smoking increases the risk of heart disease, respiratory disease, and cancer (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014</xref>). Quitting smoking lowers these risks, and those who quit by the age of 35&#x000a0;years have similar long-term risks as never smokers (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Doll et al., 2004</xref>). The majority of U.S. adult smokers want to quit, and in 2013, approximately two thirds of smokers had made a serious quit attempt in the past year (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Lavinghouze et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite decreased use in the overall population, smoking prevalence disparity has increased between socially advantaged and disadvantaged populations (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al., 2015</xref>). Today, tobacco use is concentrated among historically marginalized populations within the United States (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al., 2015</xref>). The burden of tobacco related health disparity is felt more intensely among the most vulnerable, including lower socioeconomic status populations, along with racial and ethnic minorities (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">US Department of Health and Human Services, 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Jamal et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis and Wardle, 2011</xref>). This increase in tobacco attributable health disparity is fueled by the differential rate at which vulnerable sub-populations are able to access cessation intervention and successfully achieve tobacco abstinence (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jarvis and Wardle, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Tobacco telephone quitlines are successful tools for smoking cessation, especially in reaching broad populations of users (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lien et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Giskes et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al., 2013</xref>). Since the turn of the century, telephone quitlines have been advocated for widespread use due to the availability of telephones even among populations living in isolated areas where medical services, including access to trained cessation specialists, are limited and among those with low socioeconomic status (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Fiore et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>). Quitlines that offer multiple proactive calls and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) are the most effective (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al., 2013</xref>). Increased number of calls and intensity of use relate to higher quit success; however, most individuals do not utilize the quitline to the full extent (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lien et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al., 2013</xref>). As quitlines are positioned to deliver effective cessation treatment to marginalized populations, with potential to help curb further growth of tobacco attributable health disparities in these communities, it is important to understand barriers for utilizing quitline services in populations where access to other cessation services are limited.</p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has highlighted the need to ensure free telephone quitline accessibility to vulnerable populations with higher concentrations of tobacco use (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2004</xref>). One model, endorsed recently by the tobacco control community (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Tobacco Control Research Priorities Working Group of the NCI Board of Scientific Advisors, 2016</xref>) for use to identify novel behavioral components to enhance smoking treatment engagement and effectiveness with vulnerable populations, is the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation Behavioral (COM-B) System (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2011</xref>). The COM-B System, as it would apply to tobacco cessation with vulnerable populations, posits that <italic>capability</italic> (psychological and physical capacity to engage in cessation) and <italic>opportunity</italic> (physical and social factors that make cessation possible or prompt it) impact 1) <italic>behavior change</italic>, <italic>directly</italic>, and 2) <italic>behavior change through motivation</italic> (both reflective and automatic processes) to maintain effective engagement with cessation treatment necessary to achieve and maintain cessation (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2011</xref>). Use of the COM-B System framework offers a unique opportunity to uncover the physical and social context of engagement in smoking cessation for members of populations where smoking prevalence remains high despite smokers' willingness and desire to stop smoking and engage effective treatment (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Sorensen et al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Sorensen et al., 2003</xref>). This type of investigation allows us to uncover why, despite offering effective and free telephone-based cessation services, individuals from vulnerable populations motivated to quit, in particular, are still under-utilizing quitlines.</p><p>Limited research is available that explores the capability and opportunity for accessing quitline cessation services in low-income and rural communities. One exception is the work of Sheffer and colleagues who identified that access to a phone for quitline services impacted &#x0003e;&#x000a0;1/3 of their study participants in a community-based participatory project in the Arkansas' Mississippi Delta, a region with a high concentration of rural, poor, African-American residents (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Sheffer et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Sheffer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Since telephones are the means by which quitline services are utilized, it is important to question if individuals from high tobacco prevalence populations have access to phone service which will allow them to fully utilize the effective treatment offered by quitlines. One issue that could impact quitline utilization is phone service access type. In 2009, 22.9% of US households had cell phone only service (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg and Luke, 2012</xref>), while in 2015, it more than doubled to 48.3% (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg and Luke, 2016</xref>). With this shift to cell phone only use, especially among low-income individuals (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg and Luke, 2016</xref>), access to effective treatment offered by quitlines should be further examined. A recent study reported that among individuals with restricted calling plans (e.g. Medicaid-issued phones), a robust use of the quitline could consume 22%&#x02013;34% of the 250 monthly minutes available (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>No known study has examined whether type of phone service impacts quitline utilization, quit attempts, and sustained cessation. The aim of this study was to examine the association between phone services (cell phone only (CPO) vs. land line (LL)) and cessation outcomes among Ohio Appalachian adults willing to quit smoking and enrolled in a trial utilizing the Ohio Tobacco Quitline to deliver cessation treatment. Given that the Ohio Appalachian region is home to more Medicaid recipients than the rest of the state, and that poverty also impacts a higher concentration of residents in this region (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey, 2015</xref>), we believed that phone access could impact quitline utilization and, therefore, cessation outcomes, even among residents of the region interested in quitting smoking. It was hypothesized that participants with CPO service would have fewer calls, lower cumulative total call length, and lower average call length with quitline cessation counselors and would receive fewer shipments of NRT. It was also hypothesized that participants with CPO service would be less likely to make a quit attempt by the end of cessation intervention, and would be less likely to be abstinent 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months post cessation intervention enrollment.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study overview</title><p>To examine the association of CPO versus LL phone service and phone-based cessation treatment and outcomes, an observational study using secondary analysis was conducted with data obtained from participants enrolled in the Ohio Tobacco Quitline arm (called here forth the Quitline cohort) of a recently published group randomized cessation trial (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Wewers et al., 2016</xref>).

Eligible participants: 1) were age 18 or older; 2) self-reported combustible tobacco daily use; 3) resided in a participating county; 4) had no NRT contraindication; 5) were non-pregnant, if female; 6) agreed to participate in study protocol; 7) wanted to quit smoking in the next 30&#x000a0;days and 8) provided written informed consent. Enrolled participants completed a baseline in-person interview with a county-specific interviewer, hired and trained by research staff. Next, and unique to the Quitline cohort, participants met with the community health worker who explained the study protocol, including how to access the Ohio Tobacco Quitline for cessation assistance. Quitline services were administered by National Jewish Health&#x000ae; through a contract with the Ohio Tobacco QuitLine. Treatment, based on evidence-based best practice guidelines for telephone cessation intervention, included up to five proactive cognitive-behavioral telephone counseling calls and unlimited reactive calls from a trained Quitline counselor and free NRT (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>). Twenty-one milligram patches for daily use were distributed by the Quitline in two 4-week shipments following study protocol&#x02014;the first shipment was disbursed via surface mail following the first counseling call, and the second shipment 4&#x000a0;weeks later following at least a second counseling call. All NRT shipments were approved by research staff, after verifying continued study enrollment. Follow-up in-person interviews were conducted at 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;month post baseline by the same county-specific interviewer who conducted the baseline survey. All cessation counseling and NRT was delivered between baseline and the 3-month follow-up interview. Participants received a gift card in the amount of $25 at the completion of both the baseline and the 12&#x000a0;month follow-up interviews, and a $10 gift card at the completion of both the 3 and 6&#x000a0;month follow-up interviews.

However, if the variance of the random effect for county was estimated to be zero, a multivariable linear regression for continuous outcome variables and multivariable logistic regression for binary outcome variables were run instead.

To assess if limited service among the CPO users impacted findings, this process was repeated, and final models were built using both the two and four categorical level phone service variables.

Eighty percent of the Quitline cohort completed a 3&#x000a0;month follow-up interview, 78% at 6-months, and 85% at 12-months. During the course of cessation treatment, sample participants called the quitline on average 2.8 times, with an average call length of 17&#x000a0;min and an average cumulative call length of 46&#x000a0;min and 30&#x000a0;s. Sixty-eight percent of participants completed at least one call and received a 4-week supply of NRT; 36% completed at least two calls and subsequently received a second 4-week NRT shipment. Nearly 77% of participants made a quit attempt by the end of treatment. For the entire sample, biochemically confirmed abstinence increased slightly from 8.5% at both 3 and 6-month follow-ups, to 10.7% at 12-months. Among participants reporting no past 7&#x000a0;day tobacco use, abstinence was evaluated by saliva cotinine in 88.8% of all cases. Expired air carbon monoxide was only used for tobacco abstinence confirmation in 6.7% of all cases because the participant was unable to provide a sufficient amount of saliva, and in 4.5% of cases because the participant was using NRT at the time of interview and saliva collection.<table-wrap id="t0010" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Outcome distribution for total sample &#x00026; unadjusted and adjusted regression models assessing cell phone only (CPO, referent group) vs. landline phone access (LL) on smoking cessation intermediate and ultimate outcomes.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0010">Table 2.</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Outcome variable</th><th>Total sample (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)<hr/></th><th colspan="3">Unadjusted regression model<hr/></th><th colspan="4">Adjusted regression model<hr/></th></tr><tr><th>mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD<break/>(n)</th><th>&#x003b2; (difference in means)</th><th>95% CI</th><th>p</th><th>&#x003b2; (difference in means)</th><th>95% CI</th><th>p</th><th>Variables included in adjusted model</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Number of calls with QuitLine counselor<xref rid="tf0035" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>2.82&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.51<break/>(n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)</td><td>1.12</td><td>(0.603, 1.63)</td><td>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001</td><td>0.807</td><td>(0.284, 1.33)</td><td>0.0026</td><td>Age</td></tr><tr><td>Cumulative total call length in minutes with QuitLine counselor<xref rid="tf0035" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>46.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;45.2<break/>(n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)</td><td>22.6</td><td>(13.4, 31.8)</td><td>&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001</td><td>17.2</td><td>(7.93, 26.5)</td><td>0.0003</td><td>Age, household size</td></tr><tr><td>Average call length in minutes with QuitLine counselor<xref rid="tf0035" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></td><td>17.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.31<break/>(n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;286)</td><td>1.37</td><td>(&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.107, 2.85)</td><td>0.069</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="9">&#x02028;&#x02028;</td></tr></tbody></table><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Outcome variable</th><th>Total sample (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)<hr/></th><th colspan="3">Unadjusted regression model<hr/></th><th colspan="4">Adjusted regression model<hr/></th></tr><tr><th># (%)<break/>(n)</th><th>OR</th><th>95% CI</th><th>p</th><th>OR</th><th>95% CI</th><th>p</th><th>Variables included in adjusted model</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sent at least one NRT shipment<xref rid="tf0040" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref></td><td>240 (67.8%)<break/>(n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)</td><td>0.722</td><td>(0.455, 1.15)</td><td>0.17</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td>Sent two NRT shipments<xref rid="tf0045" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td>129 (36.4%) (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)</td><td>1.99</td><td>(1.28, 3.11)</td><td>0.0025</td><td>1.72</td><td>(1.08, 2.73)</td><td>0.022</td><td>Age</td></tr><tr><td>Made at least one quit attempt by end of intervention<xref rid="tf0045" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td>173 (76.9%) (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;225)</td><td>0.635</td><td>(0.330, 1.22)</td><td>0.17</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td>Biochemically confirmed abstinence at 3&#x000a0;months<xref rid="tf0045" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td>30 (8.5%) (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)</td><td>1.81</td><td>(0.822, 3.99)</td><td>0.14</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td>Biochemically confirmed abstinence at 6&#x000a0;months<xref rid="tf0045" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td>30 (8.5%) (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)</td><td>1.14</td><td>(0.537, 2.43)</td><td>0.73</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td><td>&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td>Biochemically confirmed abstinence at 12&#x000a0;months<xref rid="tf0045" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref></td><td>38 (10.7%) (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;354)</td><td>1.07</td><td>(0.546, 2.11)</td><td>0.84</td><td>0.908</td><td>(0.453, 1.82)</td><td>0.78</td><td>Marital status</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Sample comprised of Ohio Appalachian adults willing to quit smoking and enrolled in a cessation trial from 2010 to 2014.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0035"><label>a</label><p id="np0035">Presentation of findings from linear regression model; correlation by county not present in mixed linear model.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tf0040"><label>b</label><p id="np0040">Presentation of findings from generalized linear mixed model, accounting for the correlation by county.

The first hypothesis was partially supported as participants with LL services completed more counseling calls and accrued a longer cumulative length, when compared to CPO service participants. There was no difference in average call length by phone service group. The second hypothesis stating that biochemically-confirmed abstinence at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months would be greater among LL service participants was not supported. While quit rates were modest, it is encouraging that type of phone service did not deter abstinence outcomes. Of concern, only 36% of participants completed a sufficient number of calls to qualify for the second shipment of NRT. Smith and others (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) have recommended that counseling calls emphasize the importance of pharmacotherapy as a way to enhance sustained abstinence.</p><p>This study was not without limitation. First, our findings have limited generalizability given study participants lived in the Ohio Appalachian region. Although there may be other social and contextual factors unique to this rural region impacting utilization of quitlines, as there was in the Arkansas' Mississippi Delta (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Sheffer et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Sheffer et al., 2011</xref>), the proportion of wireless only households among our participants is similar to what is found in other rural regions of the United States. According to the National Health Interview Survey, in the calendar half-year of July&#x02013;December 2015, 43.1% of adults living in a non-metropolitan statistical area reported residing in a wire-less only household&#x02014;compared to the 46.3% we found in Ohio Appalachia (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Blumberg and Luke, 2016</xref>). Although it warrants further investigation, it is plausible to believe that phone access status may function similarly in relationship to quitline utilization in other rural US regions as it did here. Second, we are unable to make causal inferences about the relationship between phone access and quitline use and cessation due to the study design.</p><p>Finally, when modeling using the 4-category phone service variable, we had a small number of participants in the &#x02018;limited CPO&#x02019; group. As with the 2-category variable, in unadjusted regression models the relationship between the 4-category phone access variable was significant for the number of calls and cumulative call length, and was not significant for sent at least one NRT shipment, made at least one quit attempt and the 3 biochemically confirmed abstinence time points. However, only 8.2% of the overall Quitline cohort reported limited cell phone access, and as such we had small cell sizes and were underpowered to run adjusted regression models. Therefore, we decided to only model and report phone access using the 2-category variable here. However, future quitline studies should consider adding survey items that measure limited phone service characteristics in order to determine if limited phone access impacts telephone quitline services utilized and cessation achieved, even when services and pharmacotherapy are offered for free. As others have suggested (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bernstein et al., 2016</xref>), CPO service providers should explore supporting a form of quitline call exemption as one way to promote utilization among low-income smokers.</p><p>This study found that even among residents of Appalachia motivated to quit smoking, cell-phone only phone access may limit engagement in effective telephone cessation treatment. As such, it can be viewed as a measure of physical capacity, a type of capability (according to the COM-B System), limiting treatment access by phone. This occurred by means of fewer calls and shorter cumulative call length with telephone cessation treatment counselors, and through reduced access to NRT (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Stead et al., 2013</xref>). Other capabilities and opportunities impacting quitline service engagement among those living in the region, in particular those with limited phone service, deserve further investigation (e.g. lapse in cell phone coverage in certain geographic areas, lack of access to chargers, etc.). These modifiable conditions, if addressed in the course of treatment, may facilitate more intensive utilization of quitline services among this vulnerable population.</p></sec><sec id="s0090"><title>Declaration of interests</title><p>There are no competing interests.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Benowitz</surname><given-names>N.L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernert</surname><given-names>J.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Caraballo</surname><given-names>R.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Holiday</surname><given-names>D.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Optimal serum cotinine levels for distinguishing cigarette smokers and nonsmokers within different racial/ethnic groups in the United States between 1999 and 2004</article-title><source>Am.
