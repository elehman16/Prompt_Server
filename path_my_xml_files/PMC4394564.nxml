Virtual Field Trips (VFTs) using interactive whiteboards to explore virtual scenes are a potential method of converting sedentary class-time into physically active teaching. This pilot aimed to assess the effects of a developed VFT on physical activity and learning in primary-school children.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Participants (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;85) were randomly assigned to a) a 30-minute physically active London 2012 Olympics-themed VFT, or b) a 30-minute sedentary version of the same VFT. Activity was measured using GT1M Actigraphs, content recall was assessed with a quiz and user evaluations were gained from teacher and pupil questionnaires.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Pupils in the active VFT displayed significantly less sedentary time (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), and significantly more light (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), moderate (p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) and vigorous physical activity (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) than sedentary VFT pupils. No differences in content recall were found between intervention groups: suggesting that adding physical activity into classroom teaching may not compromise attainment. High acceptability was found in teachers and active VFT students rated their session significantly higher than sedentary pupils (p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.002).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This one-day pilot provides early evidence of the ability of VFTs to convert sedentary academic time into active time.

Children additionally do not perform more activity outside school hours to compensate for this inactivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], leading to an inherently inactive lifestyle and children unable to reach the recommended 60&#x000a0;minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise (MVPA) a day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Current school inactivity is also undoubtedly a contributor to high rates in childhood obesity: with 33.3% of children currently overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Urgent action is needed to make school-time more active.</p><p>Schools are an important setting to promote physical activity (PA), allowing a large number of children to be exposed to interventions over a long period of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Although found to be largely effective in increasing active time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], school PA interventions are often difficult to implement. They frequently involve securing time for PA outside of academic lessons, making them difficult for teachers to implement around academic priorities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Integrating physical activity into educational time within classroom environments is one potential way of minimising such barriers for teachers and schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Physically active lessons are one way of doing this: promoting understanding of curriculum concepts via physical actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such interventions emerge from the Social Ecological model, which recognises health behaviours such as physical activity as determined by both intrapersonal behavioural factors and interrelationships between individuals and wider social, physical and policy environments such as school peer-groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Projects such as Take 10! [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and Physical Activity Across the Curriculum (PAAC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] integrate activity into short sessions of Maths, English and Social Sciences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. An example activity would be recalling multiplication tables whilst skipping or running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Significantly improved PA levels have been found following physically active lessons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], with corresponding improvements in educational outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These findings are supported by a wealth of other research finding physical activity to improve cognitive outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], on-task behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in children.</p><p>Classroom technology has untapped potential as a source of physical activity. With over 70% of classrooms now featuring interactive whiteboards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], Virtual Field Trips (VFTs) using these multi-modal devices may be viable as a physically active lesson format. VFTs allow pupils to interact with virtual maps, landmarks and objects to gain multi-modal information and facilitate multiple learning styles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Until now VFTs have been entirely sedentary and mostly restricted to development for university-level study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, given the inherently explorative and geographical nature of VFTs, they seem prime candidates as physically active lessons for school-aged children. Children could &#x02018;cycle&#x02019;, &#x02018;run&#x02019; or &#x02018;fly&#x02019; on-the-spot through virtual scenes embedded with educational elements whilst still being in their classroom. No research has yet assessed the potential of school-based VFTs to improve children&#x02019;s physical activity levels.</p><p>This pilot study investigated the effects of a one-off Olympic-themed VFT on pupil&#x02019;s physical activity.

A London 2012 Olympics theme was chosen for the trip, due to the event&#x02019;s recent and inherently active nature. Using the Interactive Whiteboard, the session involved navigating through various Olympic venues to discover more about their associated sporting events and was developed by the principal researcher (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Existing 3D models of Olympic buildings made by other Google Earth users were used, with place marks, facts and multimedia content added using HTML. Questions related to sports hosted at each site were indicated with bold font. Both groups completed the session instead of a Topic (geography or history) lesson. Both VFTs featured the same building-specific information; however the intervention trip also included activity prompts in bold font to promote simulated exercises relating to each location. Intervention pupils stood throughout the 30-minute session, completing prompted activities such as running the 100&#x000a0;m finals on-the-spot in the Olympic Stadium or flapping their arms when &#x02018;flying&#x02019; to the next location. Sedentary VFT participants were seated throughout the session and completed no related activities.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Example of developed Olympic-themed Virtual Field Trip with activity prompt.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="12889_2015_1706_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Demographics</title><p>A questionnaire pack was sent to parents requesting their child&#x02019;s gender, ethnicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] and whether they had watched the London Olympics at a venue or on television.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Anthropometry</title><p>Weight was assessed by the lead researcher to the nearest 0.1&#x000a0;kg (Weight Watchers 8961U electronic scales, Milton Keynes, UK) and height to the nearest mm (2 metre tape measure).

Participants had anthropometric measurements taken on the morning of the study. The 30-minute VFT was delivered after the school lunch break, allowing one hour of post-VFT activity measurement time for this pilot. Post-VFT content recall and process evaluation forms were provided after the session. The session was delivered by the class teacher following a short briefing from the researcher. Pupils were blinded to their study condition but teachers were not to allow them to deliver their allocated session effectively. Ethical approval was granted from University College London. Consent was obtained from participating children and their parents, as well as teachers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Actigraph data was downloaded immediately after each study day using ActiLife software version 6.0 (Actigraph, LLC, Fort Walton Beach, Florida).

Pulsford cut-points are calibrated from free-living as opposed to treadmill activities in children: reflecting the sporadic movements initiated by children and targeted to be elicited during VFT participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Accelerometer data was then extracted to SPSS (version 19; Chicago, SPSS Inc.) for analysis.</p><p>Missing demographic data was evident in parent questionnaires (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6, 5.1%) and missing pupil VFT evaluations (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5, 4.25%). Pairwise deletion of missing activity was hence used to retain maximal data. Descriptive statistics of demographics, activity levels, post-VFT quiz learning outcome and VFT teachers and pupil evaluations were performed. Pearson chi-squared tests were used to assess demographic differences. One-way ANOVAs were used to assess differences in outcomes between intervention, school and demographic groups. Independent <italic>t</italic> tests were used to assess axes recordings across VFT groups. Multiple regressions were completed for post-VFT quiz learning outcome and sedentary, light, moderate and vigorous activities during the VFT period. Activity intensities of school day activity outside of VFT sessions were used in the VFT activity regression analysis. Dummy coding was used for categorical variables of ethnicity, BMI category and teacher. Backward stepwise entry was used, with all variables entered first before removing those non-significant. Models producing the greatest amount of explained variance from adjusted R<sup>2</sup> were reported.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Participants</title><p>Of the eighty five participants, 47.1% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) were allocated to the active, intervention VFT condition. 58.8% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;50) were male, 56.5% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;48) were white, 25.9% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) were Asian or Asian British and 5.9% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5) were Black or Black British. 20% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;17) were obese and 8.2% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) were overweight. 8.6% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) had attended a London 2012 Olympics event at an official venue and 87.7% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;71) had watched the Olympics on television.

To the authors&#x02019; knowledge, it is the first study to examine VFTs as physically active classroom sessions. The aims were to assess the impact of this pilot VFT on physical activity and content recall as a learning outcome, as well as assessing pupil and teacher evaluations.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Physical activity during VFT</title><p>Accelerometer data found that the active VFT intervention group engaged in significantly less sedentary time and more light, moderate and vigorous activity during the VFT than the sedentary group. Multiple regression analysis also found VFT condition to be a positive significant predictor of all PA intensities during the VFT. However, although pupils in the active intervention group were standing and visibly active throughout the session, 63.9% of the active group&#x02019;s VFT activity was still recorded as sedentary. Such standing, on-the-spot activity clearly does not comply with officially defined sedentary behaviour: energy expenditure&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;1.5 metabolic equivalents and a sitting or reclining posture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Although a thorough review of published child cut-points was performed to identify the most suitable available cut-points; accelerometers still detected the majority of active VFT activity as sedentary. This review found no cut-points specifically calibrated for non-locomotor, on-the-spot movements. Consequently, Pulsford cut-points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] were selected as they feature calibration of sedentary through to VPA intensities and via non-treadmill, self-paced activity. Recording of active VFT time as sedentary is likely a consequence of accelerometers&#x02019; insensitivity in measuring non-ambulatory movements, such as cycling and on-the-spot movement in comparison to accelerating, travelling movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p><p>Given health and safety considerations in classroom environments, it is difficult to expect high amounts of MVPA during VFT sessions. Although MVPA was low (only 4.2% of the active VFT session), sedentary time was reduced in active VFT participants and largely replaced with objectively recorded light activity. Emerging research is investigating the benefits of converting school sedentary time to light activity time, via examples such as standing desks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Accordingly, future VFT research could instead aim to displace sedentary with light intensity activity as a minimum. Behaviour change techniques such as goal setting and rewards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] or gamification elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] could be applied in future VFT research to potentially add sustained activity improvement.</p><p>No significant differences were found between genders and ethnicities. Larger-scale research is needed to see if VFTs are effective at increasing activity in girls and ethnic minorities, who frequently demonstrate lower PA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>School day physical activity</title><p>Whole school day activity did not significantly differ according to VFT condition: suggesting the session did not affect overall day activity levels. This may have been due to the afternoon timing of the session, as pupils&#x02019; activity was only recorded for around an hour after the VFT. Sample size for assessing activity during a typical school due was reduced as two classes were permitted extended play post-VFT by their teachers due to good weather. No participants with typical post-VFT teaching achieved &#x02265;60&#x000a0;minutes MVPA during the school day, much lower than found in recent research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. As activity was only recorded during school time, it is unknown if VFT condition was associated with any differences in after-school leisure activity. As in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], girls were found to be more sedentary than boys across the school day. Although girls engaged in equal VFT activity to boys, a gender bias is still evident in their lower overall school PA. Further study is needed to assess if VFTs as a novel physically active lesson can improve PA in girls.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Content recall</title><p>Post-VFT content recall was assessed as another secondary outcome in this pilot study. There were no significant differences in post-VFT quiz results between intervention groups: suggesting no detrimental effects from the active VFT. This suggests that active VFTs could be integrated into teaching curriculum to improve physical activity and without compromising academic attainment. As there was no non-VFT control group, it is unknown if scores would have been lower or higher in classes without a novel VFT experience. Other studies have similarly found in-class activity sessions to cause neither deficit nor improvement to academic performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. However the majority of evidence from reviews indicates positive associations between physically active class sessions and learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>A potential ceiling effect was noted with high scores across participants. Although questions were provided across a range of difficulties, the recent nature of the Olympic subject matter may not have sufficiently challenged students. No pre-VFT questionnaire was provided to assess existing Olympic knowledge, as the primary outcome of this study was on feasibility rather than learning outcomes. However, future iterations should include a pre-assessment to better assess the impact of VFT on the learning outcome.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Participant evaluations</title><p>Experiences of the principal researcher and evaluations of teachers and pupils identified active VFTs to be feasible in this study. Pupils in the active VFT condition rated sessions significantly better than those in the sedentary condition. The novelty of the active session as opposed to the more typical, seated class format of the sedentary VFT may have increased pupil enjoyment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. A range of teacher evaluations were found, with ratings from middling to upmost success. The highest ratings were given by a physically active VFT teacher who rearranged the class layout to allow more movement. Previous physically active classroom sessions have been delivered at-desk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, early evidence found here suggests that this extra effort may provide a more successful active VFT session for both teacher and pupils. Improvements of VFT software and class layout changes will be considered in the development of future sessions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Accelerometers provided usable data and were acceptable by 97.6% participants in this pilot. However Pulsford et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] cut-points used recorded the majority of active VFT group time as sedentary, despite participants standing and engaging in on-the-spot activity throughout. There is currently an absence of calibrated cut-points for on-the-spot activity. Future VFT research should be aware that accelerometers may record much of standing time as sedentary. Researchers could consider using non-ambulatory movement measurement devices such as inclinometers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] if budgets allow.</p><p>Accelerometry data was only available for one day in this pilot study, meaning a novelty factor may have been present. Activity of reluctant or conversely over-enthusiastic pupils in this single session may have been less accurate results than measurement after multiple sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Future, longitudinal study will explore whether the increased activity seen here can be maintained over more regular active VFTs. In this study, sessions were provided immediately after lunch-breaks, providing only around an hour of post-VFT activity assessment. Additionally, two classes were permitted extended post-VFT play by their teachers. This further reduces the ability of this pilot to understand the effects of VFTs on subsequent activity in typical teaching. Further study should provide VFTs earlier in the school day and set clear expectations for typical teaching to be otherwise enforced by teachers. The provision of VFTs longitudinally would also allow clearer assessment of their impact on activity during regular teaching arrangements. To be effective as PA interventions they must reduce sedentary time and sustain activity over repeated sessions without leading to compensation effects in subsequent reduced activity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This pilot research found active VFTs to be feasible for primary-school classrooms. An Olympic-themed VFT elicited reduced sedentary time and increased light, moderate and vigorous physical activity compared to a sedentary version. However, there was scope for improvement of VFT technology. These findings provide preliminary evidence into the potential of VFTs in primary-school classes. Longitudinal research is needed to assess whether VFTs can reduce sedentary time and improve PA in a larger sample and over a prolonged period of sessions.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>VFT</term><def><p>Virtual field trip</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVPA</term><def><p>Moderate to vigorous activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PA</term><def><p>Physical activity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CPM</term><def><p>Counts per minute</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>NS, ODW &#x00026; ES obtained funding for the research.
