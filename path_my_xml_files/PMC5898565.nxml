The use of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for the trigger of oocyte maturation is effective in the prevention of OHSS although it may result in a lower pregnancy rate. The use of adjuvant low dose human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) at the time of trigger or at the time of oocyte retrieval may improve pregnancy rates. The goal of this dual trigger study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the use of low dose hCG administered at the time of GnRH agonist trigger or 35&#x000a0;h later as well as the potential impact on pregnancy rates. The population will consist of 82 women undergoing IVF treatment who are at risk of developing OHSS. This study will be a single center prospective randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial. The randomization schedule will be administered by the Investigational Drug Services of the University. After controlled ovarian stimulation, induction of oocyte maturation will be achieved using a GnRH agonist and patients will be randomized to receive either low dose hCG 1000 IU at the time of trigger and placebo at oocyte retrieval (Study group) or placebo at the time of trigger and hCG 1500 IU at the time of oocyte retrieval (Control group). The main outcomes will be live birth rates and incidence of OHSS. Two ancillary studies will include a quality of life survey and serum assessment of independent corpus luteum function.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>OHSS</kwd><kwd>GnRH agonist trigger</kwd><kwd>Dual trigger</kwd><kwd>Low dose hCG</kwd><kwd>PCOS</kwd><kwd>IVF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction and background</title><p id="p0010">OHSS is an iatrogenic complication of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) which may result in significant morbidity, psychological distress and rarely mortality. The use of a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist for induction of final oocyte maturation in ovarian stimulation cycles utilizing GnRH antagonist for pituitary suppression has proven to be an effective method of preventing the risk of OHSS development <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This is due to the short half-life of the endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge resulting in early corpus luteolysis <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.</p><p id="p0015">Unfortunately, some studies have also reported lower pregnancy rates after GnRH agonist trigger as compared to cycles using hCG trigger <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The reported lower pregnancy rates are more likely explained by impaired endometrial receptivity due to defective corpus luteun (CL) function. Optimal luteal phase steroidal supplementation after GnRH agonist trigger is important due to the strong evidence of abnormal luteal phase serum estradiol (E<sub>2</sub>) and progesterone (P) profiles <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Most studies have utilized a suboptimal steroidal supplementation; therefore we have previously reported an aggressive luteal phase support along with close monitoring of serum steroid levels after GnRH agonist trigger, which has resulted in excellent ongoing pregnancy rates <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. However, in a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent GnRH agonist trigger, we found that patients with peak E<sub>2</sub> level &#x0003c;4000&#x000a0;pg/mL had a significantly lower clinical pregnancy rate than those with peak E<sub>2</sub> level over 4000&#x000a0;pg/mL despite aggressive luteal phase steroidal supplementation for all patients <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. This therefore suggests that optimal conception rates are not achieved for all patients despite aggressive supplementation and a certain group of patients may still have lower conception rates.</p><p id="p0020">It has been shown that the use of adjuvant low dose hCG ranging between 1000 and 2500 IU at the time of GnRH agonist trigger will rescue some of the corpora lutea consequently improving pregnancy rates <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Griffin et al. showed that a fixed standard low dose hCG of 1000 IU is effective in optimizing pregnancy rates without increasing the risk of OHSS in women with peak E<sub>2</sub> of &#x0003c;4,000&#x000a0;pg/mL <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. The use of hCG 1500 IU at the time of oocyte retrieval in patients at risk of OHSS development has shown optimal pregnancy rates in several studies <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. However, there have been concerns regarding the high risk of OHSS using this protocol <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We believe that a lower dose of adjuvant hCG at the time of GnRH agonist trigger will be adequate to induce enough corpora lutea development in order to support the luteal phase but low enough to prevent the development of OHSS. However, there has not been a study directly comparing the pregnancy rates between the two different approaches.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Research design and study population</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p id="p0025">This study is a single center prospective randomized double-blind clinical trial involving patients at high risk of OHSS development undergoing COH using GnRH antagonist cycles.

Neither the patients nor the clinicians will be aware of the type of adjuvant hCG administration because of the use of placebo.

There are no randomized trials evaluating the optimal timing and dose of adjuvant low-dose hCG administration that will result in excellent conception rates without affecting the risk of significant OHSS development.</p><p id="p0035">In this study, we also developed several secondary research hypotheses: 1) Incidence of OHSS will be higher after adjuvant hCG 1500 IU administered 35&#x000a0;h after agonist trigger; 2) Patients who received dual trigger with GnRHa and hCG will have a better quality of life; 3) adjuvant hCG 1500 IU 35&#x000a0;h after agonist trigger will result in higher levels of independent markers of CL function such as 17-hydroxy progesterone (17-OH P) and prorenin. Evaluation of independent markers of CL function in the luteal phase and early pregnancy will help determine differences in CL rescue and also give further evidence as to whether endogenous hCG rise of pregnancy rescues the CL.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Study population and inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p id="p0040">Subjects aged &#x02265;18 years and &#x0003c;40 years of age, with a normal FSH of &#x0003c;10 mIU/mL and have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) as defined by the Rotterdam consensus guidelines, or&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;12 antral follicles in at least one ovary, or AMH&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;3.5&#x000a0;ng/mL are eligible for the study.

It will be the first study to directly compare the two protocols in high responders undergoing IVF treatment. There are several unique qualities of this trial. These include the double-blind nature of the trial thereby limiting any bias from study personnel, the fact that the randomization schedule will be performed and administered by the IDS who are independent of the study as well as the inclusion of different secondary hypotheses.</p><p id="p0245">In a previous study evaluating the use of GnRH agonist trigger for the prevention of OHSS <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, we included assessment of all patients in the midluteal phase for the development of OHSS in terms of symptoms, ultrasound measurements of ovarian volume and electrolytes. In this study we kept the midluteal phase evaluation as an opportunity to evaluate patients for mild or moderate OHSS as well as to instruct patients to call if they developed any new symptoms. However, we opted to eliminate the serum electrolyte evaluation for all patients since we found it not useful for patients with mild or moderate OHSS.</p><p id="p0250">In our previous retrospective study evaluating the use of dual trigger to prevent OHSS <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, the patients mixed the low dose hCG for trigger at home and administered it. In this study, the low dose hCG as well as placebo will be prepared by the pharmacy, thereby reducing the risk of a medication error.</p><p id="p0255">Based on the recommendations from the IRB and the DSMB, we will establish a database for the pregnancy outcomes. A pregnancy outcome form will be completed for each subject enrolled in the clinical study after delivery. The pregnancy outcome form will contain maternal and neonatal outcome data for the antepartum, intrapartum and postpartum periods (complications, birth defects, etc.). We also included a questionnaire regarding the quality of life measures after trigger of oocyte maturation to monitor patients' well-being after the use of the two protocols to evaluate safety.</p><p id="p0260">The incorporation of secondary hypotheses will provide further insight into the use of these protocols. Although previous studies have attempted to evaluate the independent function of the corpus luteum after GnRHa trigger, none have used truly independent markers of CL function <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Certain factors such as 17-OH P and prorenin, have been identified as independent markers of corpora lutea function and may serve as important factors to identify the extent of CL rescue in the luteal phase and early pregnancy following adjuvant low dose hCG administration after GnRH agonist trigger. The placenta has little 17-alpha hydroxylase enzyme activity; therefore circulating levels of 17-OH P are a marker of corpus luteum activity. Moreover, circulating levels are not affected by exogenous P administration. In early pregnancy, the levels of 17-OH P rise, marking the activity of the CL. By the 10th week of gestation, the levels return to baseline levels, confirming that the placenta has little 17-alpha hydroxylase activity. Prorenin is the inactive precursor of renin and maternal levels increase about ten-fold during early pregnancy as a result of hCG stimulation <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In addition to prorenin being secreted by the CL, it is also expressed in the gestational sac <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> as well as the chorion, amnion and placenta <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, there is little evidence that fetal or uterine prorenin contributes to the maternal circulation. Furthermore, low levels were observed in a pregnant patient with primary ovarian failure <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Therefore, measurement of circulating 17-OH P and prorenin during the luteal phase and early pregnancy will help elucidate further the effect of GnRH agonist trigger on CL function.</p><p id="p0265">One of the main limitations of this study is that the choice of control group and calculation of sample size in this study was based on a previous study by Humaidan et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, but there are some differences between the two protocols. Our study used IM Progesterone in the luteal phase for all patients whilst the study by Humaidan only used crinone vaginal supplementation. The decision to use the Humaidan et al. study (2010) was because it is one of the only few studies that was randomized using adjuvant hCG 35&#x000a0;h after GnRHa trigger. We also desired to use a similar type of luteal phase supplementation in both study arms of our study. Moreover, it is believed that the adjuvant hCG administration after GnRHa trigger may be more important in restoration of optimal luteal phase than the type of progesterone used.</p><p id="p0270">We hope to complete the collection and analysis of the data to allow recommendation for the choice of protocol in order to help prevent the development of OHSS while maintaining adequate CL function to optimize pregnancy rates.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Funding source</title><p id="p0275">This study was supported in part by an educational investigator initiated unrestricted grant from <funding-source id="gs1">Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme (MSD) Corp., Roseland, New Jersey.
