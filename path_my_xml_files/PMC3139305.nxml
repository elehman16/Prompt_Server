After obtaining written consent from patients, they were randomly divided by a computer-generated code into two groups of 25 each, group I and group II. Patients having any abnormality of the spine, skin infection, local cellulites, coagulation disorders, allergy to LA, neurological disorders, etc, were excluded from the study. Patients in Group I served as control group and received 2.5 ml (12.5 mg) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Group II patients received 1.5 ml (7.5 mg) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine +0.1 ml (5 &#x003bc;g) sufentanil + 0.9 ml normal saline to make a total volume of 2.5 ml. The study solutions were prepared by an anesthesia technician who was given written instructions but was not aware of the study details. Patients were kept fasting for at least six hours preoperatively and received tablet Ranitidine 150 mg and tablet alprazolam 0.25 mg one night before and 2 hours before on the morning of surgery with a sip of water.</p><p>In the operation theatre, baseline pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were observed and recorded for every patient. A good intravenous access was secured with a large bore cannula and preloading was done with Ringer Lactate solution in doses of 10 ml/kg of body weight.</p><p>Epidural injection was administered to patients on a horizontal table in the sitting position in L3-4 inter-vertebral space with 18G Tuohy needle and a catheter was secured at 4-5 cm into the epidural space. Subarachnoid block was performed with 26G spinal needle at L4-5 space and drugs were injected after establishing a clear and free flow of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Immediately after injecting the drug, patients were turned to supine position. The level and onset of sensory analgesia was checked with bilateral pin prick method and quality of sensory block was assessed using a visual analog scale for pain measurement (0 - no distress to 10 - unbearable distress). Motor blockade was checked using Bromage scale before and after surgery. (Grade 1 - free movement of legs and feet, grade 2 - just able to flex knees with free movement of feet, grade 3 - unable to flex knees, but with free movement of feet, and grade 4 - unable to move legs or feet).</p><p>Parameters like pulse rate (PR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), respiratory rate (RR), and pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>) were observed continuously and recorded every 5 min for the first 30 min after giving subarachnoid block, thereafter every 10 min throughout the surgery. Hypotension was defined as a fall in SBP of greater than 25% of base value or SBP less than 95 mm of Hg in the first 20-30 min after giving the block and was treated with increments of injection Ephedrine 5 mg. Supplemental oxygen (3 L/min) was given to every patient through a venturi mask during the surgery. Side effects like nausea, vomiting, pruritis, etc were observed for and recorded on the performa. Postoperatively, patients were administered analgesia on demand through epidural catheter with 0.125% plain bupivacaine 8 ml during each top-up.

These factors can cause overdosing of intravenous and inhalational anesthetic agents and, consequently, a increased incidence of side effects of these agents.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] At the molecular and cellular level, cardiac morphological changes include decrease in the number of myocytes, decrease in connective matrix tissue, and increase in left ventricular wall thickness, all of which result in decreased cardiac contractility, increased action potential time, and decreased coronary perfusion.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] Similarly, aging-induced cardiovascular alterations, autonomic changes, and consequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance may produce exaggerated and intense hemodynamic fluctuations, including hypotension and bradycardia. On the other hand, due to age-related decrease in the volume of CSF and relative increase in the density of CSF, there occurs a greater diffusion of LA solution leading to wider block extension during neuraxial anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] The surgical and anesthetic stress causes exaggerated sympathetic activation, an increase in catabolic hormones and hypermetabolism in the elderly. These result in delayed emergence, increased fatigue, prolonged recovery, intestinal paralysis, decreased splanchnic perfusion, and numerous other complications, leading to a higher incidence of perioperative morbidity and death.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]</p><p>A spinal block given to a high-risk patient must provide anesthesia of high quality and with adequate duration in order to avoid the negative effects of any additional anesthesia. Intraoperative hypotension following spinal anesthesia can be deleterious, especially in the geriatric population with limited cardiorespiratory reserve. It has been suggested that a combination of opioids and LA administered intrathecally has a synergistic analgesic effect characterized by enhanced somatic analgesia without an effect on the degree and level of LA-induced sympathetic or motor block.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>The demographic profile of our patients is comparable to the profile of various other similar studies, except for the age group, which was higher in our study. This is quite important in the context that we intended to study the dose reduction of LA and addition of low-dose sufentanil with the main aim of providing hemodynamic stability in geriatric patients, as this subset of population demonstrates exaggerated hemodynamic responses to various anesthetic techniques.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>The mean pulse rate showed no remarkable difference in either groups throughout the study period, which establishes the efficacy of sufentanil in providing stable heart rate on intrathecal use similar to the earlier observations by various researchers.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Patients who received intrathecal sufentanil had a significantly lower mean systolic blood pressure during the first 15 minutes and a lower mean diastolic blood pressure for the first 5 minutes, which stabilized after that and remained stable throughout the study period in both groups. However, the overall incidence of hypotension was significantly higher in the non-sufentanil group (44%) as compared to sufentanil group (8%), with a consequent higher use of ephedrine in this subset of population. Similar observations were the hallmark of earlier such studies, except for minor variations.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>However, in the present study, the number of patients requiring treatment for hypotension was 44% in the control group, whereas Olofsson <italic>et al</italic>. treated 88% patients for hypotension in their control group. The higher incidence of hypotension in their study might be because of the different criteria for defining hypotension (decrease in SBP&#x0003e;25% from the baseline or SBP&#x0003c;100 mm Hg.). Our criteria for hypotension was defined as decrease in SBP&#x0003c;95 mm Hg or 25% decrease from the baseline. The overall observed hemodynamic stability was comparatively better in patients who received small doses of intrathecal bupivacaine and sufentanil. This can be attributed to the low-dose combination of LA and sufentanil in providing a potent synergistic analgesic effect. Yet, intrathecal opioid neither by itself nor in combination with LA causes any further depression of efferent sympathetic activity. Therefore, it is possible to enhance sensory blockade without altering the degree of sympathetic blockade, and hence a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension.</p><p>The time to reach peak sensory block was significantly shorter in group II (6.66 &#x000b1; 1.44) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) as compared to group I (8.68 &#x000b1; 1.37), though no statistically significant difference was found at the onset of adequate analgesia, MMCS, and time to S<sub>2</sub> segment regression between both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). In the present study, surgical anesthesia was adequate in all patients of both groups and never required supplementary epidural anesthetic doses through epidural catheter during the surgical procedure. The level of analgesia was also adequate in both groups, as shown by Visual Analogue Scale of pain measurement, which was zero at every assessment throughout the observation period. The results are quite similar to the earlier studies with minor variations here and there.</p><p>Statistical analysis showed a highly significant difference in the mean duration of motor block in both groups (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). This was noted because the study group had less intense motor block with 32% of cases having grade III block and 68% of cases having grade IV block than control group, which has 4% of cases having grade III block and 96% of cases having grade IV block. The block was of shorter duration in the study group than in the control group. However, in the study group, the degree of motor block was adequate for the procedure and surgeons&#x02019; satisfaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>The results have re-established the synergistic effect of opioid and LA, whereby the quality and duration of sensory block is increased, while degree and duration of motor block is shortened. Therefore, the time to recovery and ambulation decreases, thereby reducing the incidence of deep vein thrombosis. Intrathecal opioids are associated with several known side effects. The incidence of pruritis attributable to opioids ranges between 20 and 80%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] In our study, 12% patients had pruritis in the sufentanil group. The lower incidence of pruritis can be explained on the basis that we used a lower dose of sufentanil. However, none of the patient required any treatment.</p><p>Neuraxial opioids carry the risk of respiratory depression, especially in elderly patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] Respiratory depression after administration of more lipid-soluble agent sufentanil may develop within 30 min of subarachnoid injection. Earlier onset of this condition might be an advantage as compared to the delayed respiratory depression induced by intrathecal morphine since the patient is still in the operating room and well under the anesthesiologist's supervision. But in our study, none of the patients in the sufentanil group had respiratory depression or a lower recording of O<sub>2</sub> saturation. There have been cases of respiratory depression and apnea after intrathecal sufentanil in laboring women.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] However, in most of these studies, the patient had either received previous parenteral opioid or a dose of intrathecal sufentanil 10 &#x003bc;g or more. We did not come across any case of respiratory depression or apnea after administration of 5 &#x003bc;g intrathecal sufentanil. The possible reason may be that we did not give any parenteral sufentanil in our study, nor did we use a dose of sufentanil larger than 5 &#x003bc;g.</p><p>Another common side effect of intrathecally administered opioid is nausea and vomiting.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] However, none of our patients had nausea or vomiting, which is again possibly is due to the lower dosage of intrathecal sufentanil. Shivering is also a common complication during spinal anesthesia in elderly patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] It is known to increase oxygen consumption, ventilation, and cardiac output, which can result in significant morbidity in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve. In the present study, 28% in the control group had shivering, whereas none of the patients in the study group had any such episodes.</p><p>Similar findings have been reported by earlier studies in patients who underwent transurethral resection of prostate (TURP) under spinal anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] The studies have reported 30% incidence of shivering in the control group, while 5% patients experienced shivering in the bupivacaine and fentanyl group. Addition of fentanyl to low-dose bupivacaine has been shown to decrease the incidence of shivering during spinal anesthesia in elderly patients. Our results have also established that addition of even low-dose intrathecal sufentanil to a lower-dose bupivacaine also decreases the incidence of shivering.</p><p>A number of studies have used sufentanil intrathecally in lower limb surgery. In our study, we found that bupivacaine 7.5 mg plus sufentanil 5 mg provides stable hemodynamics and satisfactory anesthesia than the conventional dose (12.5 mg) of bupivacaine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The present work studied the comparative evaluation of adding sufentanil to low dose of bupivacaine with the conventional dose of bupivacaine in elderly patients undergoing lower limb surgery under combined spinal epidural anesthesia. The study has established that the dose of LA can be safely and significantly lowered by 40% with the addition of low-dose sufentanil, thereby avoiding hemodynamic fluctuation and providing a stable peri- and post-operative period in the geriatric population. In addition, the duration of sensory analgesia is prolonged and the postoperative requirement for the epidural top-up is also decreased.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
