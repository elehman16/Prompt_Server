For cancer patients of working age, one challenge is their return to work. Returning to work is important as work contributes to personal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and economic well-being, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and is associated with the quality of life of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Unfortunately, not all cancer patients are able to return to work successfully. A meta-analysis demonstrated that the risk of unemployment was 37&#x000a0;% higher for cancer patients than healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Moreover, interventions primarily aimed at improving cancer patients&#x02019; return to work are rare, especially those that have been studied in randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Therefore, we developed an intervention on the return to work of cancer patients and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>We developed this intervention based on previous studies that had employed effective interventions for enhancing the return to work of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], and we developed this intervention in collaboration with various stakeholders involved in the return-to-work process of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. An early intervention is most appropriate, as longer periods of sick leave often cause patients return to work to be more difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. For the delivery of an early intervention, a hospital-based intervention is most appropriate, as most cancer patients do not have contact with their supervisor or occupational physician during the early phases of their cancer treatment and physician&#x02019;s advice seems to be influential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The hospital-based work support intervention was developed consistent with the Dutch social security system and carried out in the Netherlands. As return to work is influenced by the institutional context of a country, it is important to understand this context. In short, in the Netherlands, a sick-listed employee receives at least 70&#x000a0;% of their wage, which is paid by the employer. Both the employer and the employee have responsibilities for the return-to-work process. The sick-listed employee cannot be fired due to his/her illness during the first 2&#x000a0;years of sickness absence (Improved Gatekeeper Act).</p><p>Performing a process evaluation is important for interpreting the findings of an innovative intervention because the effectiveness partially depends on how well the intervention was implemented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Consequently, process evaluation results can be used to further develop the intervention by improving the intervention itself and/or the intervention implementation.</p><p>Process indicators should be measured at each level that could have an influence on the implementation process of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. For instance, intervention exposure occurs in this study on two levels: at the level of cancer patients who received the intervention, and that of nurses who received training for delivering the intervention.</p><p>Linnan and Steckler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] proposed the following key process indicators for studying the intervention implementation: recruitment, context, reach, intensity of the intervention delivered, intensity of the intervention received, and fidelity. In this study, we distinguish between the process indicators that address how well the intervention was delivered and received (intensity of the intervention delivered, intensity of the intervention received (exposure), and fidelity) and those that address how the intervention was appreciated by the various stakeholders (intensity of the intervention received satisfaction), to whom the findings apply (recruitment, reach), and under what conditions the findings can be applied (context). We made these distinctions because the primary aim of the trial was to identify effectiveness of the intervention. The process indicators that address how well the intervention was delivered and received can help us to interpret our findings related to effectiveness, and we therefore considered these the most important process indicators. The remaining process indicators could be helpful when implementing the intervention for usual care on a wider scale. In summary, the objective of this study was to perform a process evaluation of a hospital-based work support intervention for cancer patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This process evaluation was part of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of a hospital-based work support intervention on the return to work and quality of life of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Patients who were willing and eligible to participate were randomised to either the intervention group and received the hospital-based work support intervention or to the control group and received care as usual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Six hospitals in the Netherlands participated in the study. The medical ethics committee of the Academic Medical Center approved of the study. The local medical ethics committee of each participating hospital advised positively about feasibility of the study in their hospital.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer, who were between 18 and 60&#x000a0;years of age, had paid work at the time of diagnosis, were on sick leave, had been treated with curative intent, and who had been treated at one of the participating hospital departments were eligible to participate. Treatment with curative intent was defined as an expected 1-year survival rate of approximately 80&#x000a0;%. We excluded patients, who were not adequately able to speak read, or write Dutch, who had a severe mental disorder or other severe co-morbidity, or those for whom the primary cancer diagnosis had been made more than 2&#x000a0;months ago. Patients signed informed consent forms prior to their inclusion in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Hospital-Based Work Support Intervention</title><p>The hospital-based work support intervention began a few weeks after patients were included in the study and was spread over a maximum of 14&#x000a0;months. The hospital-based intervention involves delivery of patient education and support at the hospital integrated into usual psycho-oncology care and involves improvement of the communication between the treating physician and the occupational physician. In addition, the research team asked patient&#x02019;s occupational physician to organise a meeting with the patient and the supervisor to make a concrete gradual return-to-work plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. A nurse who delivered psycho-oncological care in normal cancer care delivered patient education and support at the hospital in 4 meetings of 15&#x000a0;min each. Nurses received a half-day training course in which the intervention protocol was simulated. In addition, three letters were sent to the occupational physician to enhance the communication: two from the treating physician and one from the nurse. The key aspects of the hospital-based work support intervention were the patient education and support at the hospital and the sending of information to the occupational physician. In the Netherlands, patients must give their consent to allow medical information to be sent from a treating physician to an occupational physician, which was requested by the nurse during the first meeting. The research team only informed occupational physicians about diagnosis and cancer treatment of patients who gave consent providing medical information to their occupational physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Process Evaluation</title><p>In accordance with the key process indicators that had been proposed by Linnan and Steckler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], we measured the following aspects: recruitment, context, reach, intensity of the intervention delivered, intensity of the intervention received, and fidelity.

Only patients assigned to the intervention group were included in this process evaluation, as patients assigned to the control group received care as usual only. Patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire 14&#x000a0;months after randomisation, which were sent to patients&#x02019; home with a free return envelope enclosed. Nurses reported on each patient assigned to the intervention group after each meeting. Nurses that delivered the intervention to at least five patients were asked to fill in a questionnaire after the study was completed, which were sent to nurses&#x02019; work with a free return envelope enclosed (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4).</p><p>The response rate of patients to the questionnaire was 75&#x000a0;% (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;49).

Two factors were considered important during the research period: type of cancer diagnosis and occupation of the health care professional who delivered the patient education and support at the hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Reach</title><p>Reach was measured to identify to what extent the target population participated in the study and to identify if our procedure to reach patients was feasible. Reach was expressed as the proportion of cancer patients that did participate in the study compared to all cancer patients that were found eligible to participate. Furthermore, we registered age of the cancer patients who did and did not want to participate in order to identify if our findings apply to all age groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Intensity of the Intervention Delivered</title><p>We measured the proportion of the intervention that was actually delivered compared to the intervention protocol as intensity of the intervention delivered for patients who started with the intervention. For each patient in the intervention group, intensity of the intervention delivered was measured as the number of meetings that were held, the number of meetings face-to-face, and their duration. We protocolised the delivery of 4 meetings of at least 10&#x000a0;min each of which at least two meetings were face-to-face unless a patient reached sustainable return to work before the intervention was completed. At least one initial meeting for all patients was protocolised regardless of work resumption. In case a patient was unable to complete the intervention due to medical reasons (i.e. cancer recurrence), we considered the intervention as delivered according to the protocol. In addition, drop-out of hospital departments and nurses was recorded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Intensity of the Intervention Received (Exposure)</title><p>We measured exposure to the intervention as the extent to which the intervention was received as intended by measuring whether patients complied with the advice that was provided (yes or no). For each type of advice offered, an open-ended question was directed to patients, whereby patients could provide their source of motivation for not complying with the advice. We considered compliance with 50&#x000a0;% of the provided advice as sufficient. In addition, patient drop-out (yes or no) and their reason for dropping out, as well as the characteristics of the patients (e.g. educational level and income) were recorded in order to identify whether compliance applied to the entire population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Intensity of the Intervention Received (Satisfaction)</title><p>Satisfaction with the intervention was assessed at both nurse and patient level.</p><p><italic>Nurses&#x02019; satisfaction with the training:</italic> Nurses&#x02019; satisfaction regarding the training they had received for delivering the intervention was measured and all questions (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) were open-ended questions.</p><p><italic>Nurses&#x02019; perceived feasibility of the intervention:</italic> Nurses were asked whether they thought that the intervention was applicable in practice and whether they encountered barriers when applying the intervention in practice and how to best overcome these barriers in the future.

They were also asked which portion of the intervention they considered most useful and which not, and for which population of cancer patients. All questions (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14) were open-ended questions.</p><p><italic>Patients&#x02019; satisfaction with the intervention:</italic> Patient&#x02019;s were asked about their satisfaction with each intervention component, the timing of each intervention component, the duration of the intervention, and the competence of the nurse and the occupational physician. Furthermore, if the intervention fulfilled their expectations, the perceived burden, and whether the timing of the intervention was adequate were also assessed, using 3- and 4-point Likert scales as well as open-ended questions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Fidelity</title><p>Fidelity refers to the extent to which the intervention content was carried out according to the protocol. We measured fidelity by assessing performance of nurses and occupational physicians based on the intervention protocol, i.e. protocol adherence. Six performance indicators were established a priori based on the intervention protocol. An independent researcher assessed protocol adherence by scoring each indicator as either sufficient or insufficient, or not applicable. All performance indicators were weighted equally, yielding a maximal sum score of 6.</p><p>The first two performance indicators assessed nurses&#x02019; performance and were assessed based on the reports that the nurses completed after each meeting with a patient. The first performance indicator addressed whether the quality of meetings between the nurse and the patient was adequate. The second performance indicator addressed whether nurses delivered sufficient information to a patient. The third and fourth performance indicators assessed whether medical information was sent to the patient&#x02019;s occupational physician (yes or no) and a score was assigned if this had taken place. The fifth and sixth performance indicators assessed occupational physicians&#x02019; performance on the basis of nurses&#x02019; reports. The fifth performance indicator assessed whether the occupational physician organised a meeting with the patient, patient&#x02019;s supervisor, and him/herself, and the sixth performance indicator assessed whether a return-to-work plan was draw-up in collaboration with the patient, patient&#x02019;s supervisor, and the occupational physician.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All quantitative data were analysed with descriptive statics using PASW version 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

The open-ended question responses indicated that some nurses (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) would have preferred to receive the training material before the start of the training and that some nurses thought the period between the training and the start of the intervention was too long (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2).</p><p>All nurses (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) were satisfied with the intervention protocol and stated that it provided a clear overview of the content of the intervention. In general, nurses (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) believed that the intervention was feasible to carry out in practice and that the burden associated with the delivery of the intervention was manageable. Nevertheless, the following barriers for applying the intervention to practice were mentioned: (1) delivering the intervention for patients who did not receive usual psycho-oncological care; (2) delivering the intervention by telephone; and (3) integrating the intervention into usual care. For the first barrier, nurses mentioned (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3) that the intervention was not as feasible to deliver to patients who did not receive usual psycho-oncological care. This situation may have occurred for patients, who did not receive follow-up care at the hospital, but for the delivery of the intervention in these cases, an extra consultation was planned or meetings were held by telephone.</p><p>Second, delivering the intervention by telephone was perceived as less feasible because it was time consuming to reach patients by telephone and it was difficult to assess the patient&#x02019;s situation and gain patient&#x02019;s trust over the telephone. Third, nurses (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) stated that the intervention should have been integrated into usual care according to the following adaptations: (1) meetings needed to be planned at the right time and for the proper length of time; (2) all meetings should have been face-to-face; and (3) to be able to deliver all meetings face-to-face it may mean that the intervention should be handed on to another health care professional who would be able to conduct longer follow-up consultations.</p><p>Although all nurses (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) believed that most patients benefited from the intervention, some nurses expected (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2) the intervention to be only moderately effective because they felt that their advice and support may not have uniquely impacted the return to work of cancer patients, as these patients typically arrange their return to work at the workplace with their supervisor and occupational physician. However, nurses (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4) did consider the intervention to be useful for all cancer patients of working age.

A total of 47&#x000a0;% of all eligible patients participated (reach) and nurses delivered patient education and support according to the protocol in 85&#x000a0;% of the cases (fidelity). In 100&#x000a0;% of the cases, at least one letter was sent to the occupational physician (fidelity) and in 10&#x000a0;% of the cases, the meeting with the patient, the occupational physician, and the supervisor took place (fidelity). We found that a hospital-based work support intervention was easily accepted into usual psycho-oncological care but that it was difficult to involve the occupational physician. Overall, patients were highly satisfied, and nurses found the intervention to be feasible.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The strength of our study was the thorough analysis of the process indicators at the department, nurse, and patient level, which was based on a previously established framework for process evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>One limitation of our study was that we did not include occupational physicians in the data collection process. However, the key aspects of the hospital-based work support intervention were both the patient education and support delivered by a nurse at the hospital, and communication with patient&#x02019;s occupational physician concerning patient&#x02019;s diagnosis and treatment. Because earlier research had shown that occupational physicians appreciated receiving this type of information from the hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and because half of the occupational physicians in this previous study indicated that the information had influenced their rehabilitation efforts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], we thought that assessing these aspects in the current study was not necessary.</p><p>Another limitation of our study was the method that was used to measure fidelity. We measured fidelity by scoring performance indicators based on self-reports of nurses and we do not know how valid these self-reports are in comparison to independent observations. Thus, bias could have been introduced by the recording of socially desirable answers in the reports. However, independent observation may have introduced another form of bias as well, as nurses may have performed differently if they knew they were being observed. Another limitation of the study was the potential for recall bias, as the participants&#x02019; compliance and satisfaction with the intervention were assessed at the end of the follow-up period. However, we could not have evaluated these aspects directly after the consultation, because this may have influenced the effect of the intervention in cases in which the patient did not receive the information during the consultation but rather received the information as during the response to the questionnaire. Finally, selection bias may also have occurred, as not all patients responded to the questionnaire. We do not know whether reasons for not completing the questionnaire were related to patient satisfaction or compliance with the intervention. Therefore, it is possible, that these results represent either an overestimation or underestimation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Comparisons with the Literature</title><p>Nieuwenhuijsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] studied the feasibility of an intervention for cancer patients consisting of enhanced provider communication and patient education. In comparison to this study, our study demonstrated similar level of patient satisfaction with the 10-steps of advice, whereas we found a bit lower percentage of patient compliance with the advice provided. We assume that this discrepancy was caused because some of theses advices had become common practice.</p><p>Almost 50&#x000a0;% of eligible patients participated in our study, which was considered an adequate result because it should be taken into account that participants had been diagnosed with cancer only a few weeks before the start of the study and therefore experienced higher levels of insecurity. Similar response rates were reported for the inclusion of recently diagnosed cancer patients in a life-style intervention trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. For other types of patients and for other types of interventions, higher response rates have been reported. One Dutch study found a higher reach for patients with low back pain in a trial aimed at preventing work disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, this response rate was likely overestimated because it was not based on all of the eligible patients who were invited to participate. Based on our value of reach and the opinions of patients, we can infer that work is a relevant topic for cancer patients also already early in the course of their disease. We also assume that under conditions of regular care rather than trial conditions; reach would further improve, as patients in these conditions do not have to decide about all the extras of a trial such as meeting with a researcher for informed consent and filling in questionnaires.</p><p>Other comparable trials for work support interventions among cancer and other patients have also reported the results of process evaluations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These evaluations measured the adherence of occupational physicians to the intervention protocol. Verbeek et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] reported an adherence rate that varied from 3&#x000a0;% to 78&#x000a0;% regarding the provision of advice to cancer patients about their return to work. Nieuwenhuijsen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] reported that only 10&#x000a0;% of the patients received optimal care when their absence from work was a result of mental health problems. Rebergen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] reported that, on average, adherence of physicians was 50&#x000a0;%, with a maximum adherence score of 20. For our intervention, average adherence of nurses was 85&#x000a0;%, and this result was very good in comparison to these studies. Although these previous studies reported on protocol adherence of occupational physicians and we reported on protocol adherence of nurses, both of these groups were the healthcare providers who delivered the work support intervention, and the results are therefore comparable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Interpretations of Findings</title><p>Our study showed that the various health care contexts (e.g. cancer diagnosis or type of health care professional) did not influence the intervention implementation. This finding indicates that our intervention could be successfully adapted to various health care contexts, provided that some form of psycho-oncological care is available. This means that our intervention might be successfully adapted to other countries, despite the variation between the social security systems. However, the content and timing of the intervention should be adapted to each social security system.</p><p>The intensity of the present intervention delivered was high and was also concurrent with what we protocolised. Few drop-outs were noted, and nurses were able to extend their consultation to deliver the intervention. In contrast, the number of patients who did not start with the intervention was higher than anticipated, which was mainly caused by the fact that those patients did not receive usual psycho-oncological care from nurses who delivered the intervention. For these patients, nurses encountered problems and either and extra consultation was required or the intervention had to be delivered completely over the telephone. Nurses considered this form of delivery to be less effective and more difficult. We believe that this situation would be remediated if the intervention could be implemented over a wider scale, which would provide usual psycho-oncological care to all patients and better integrate the intervention with patient care.</p><p>Patients and nurses were in general very satisfied with the various intervention components and found that the timing of the intervention components was appropriate. However, encouraging the occupational physicians to organise a meeting between the patient, the supervisor and him/herself in order to draw-up a return-to-work plan proved difficult, which was likely the result of not actively involving the occupational physician into the hospital-based work support intervention.</p><p>As expected, patient compliance with each type of advice provided was high. Only patients with a temporary employment contract that could not be extended were unable to comply with the delivered advices, as they no longer had an employer/occupational physician.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Implications for Further Research and Practice</title><p>In terms of clinical practice, this study demonstrated that psycho-oncological care can address the work concerns of cancer patients at an early treatment phase as well as during follow-up, according to the reported satisfaction of patients and nurses who provided the intervention. However, for further improvement, nurses suggested the following adaptations: 1) meetings should be planned at the right time for the proper length of time; 2) meetings should be conducted face-to-face; and 3) to be able to deliver all meetings face-to-face it may mean that the intervention should be hand on to another health care professional who have longer follow-up consultations in usual cancer care.</p><p>Our study was restricted to breast and gynaecological cancer patients. However, nurses who delivered the intervention indicated that all cancer patients of working age would likely benefit from this type of intervention. Thus, evaluation studies of patients with other types of cancer are needed.</p><p>It proved difficult to involve the occupational physician and the supervisor in the intervention. As these individuals are relevant to return to work of cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], further research is required to increase their involvement. Due to the relatively low prevalence of cancer at the workplace and because most contacts during early phases of treatment are with health care professionals at the hospital, we believe that it would be difficult to organise a workplace-based intervention. However, methods to involve the workplace in the intervention should be extended, for example involving the occupational physician and the supervisor may be achieved by the sending of coded emails instead of letters to decrease the barrier to reach each other. However, patient&#x02019;s privacy should be guaranteed at all times.</p><p>Because patients with a temporary employment contract could not comply with the advices provided, the intervention should be adapted for patients with this type of employment by assessing the specific needs and concerns of this population. This approach is especially important, as patients with a temporary employment contract have a higher risk of becoming unemployed in comparison to patients with a permanent employment contract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and because the labour market is changing towards a higher frequency of temporary employment contracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the cancer patients for their participation.
