Timing and delay of initial administration of effective antimicrobial therapy is an important predictor of survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is hypothesized that appropriate prehospital-initiated intravenous, broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy will reduce the delay of administration and will reduce mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>One hundred and ninety-eight patients meeting the criteria for septic shock on initial clinical presentation prehospital were randomized to receiving broad-spectrum intravenous antimicrobial therapy and fluid per guided protocol or to receiving intravenous fluid only.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Out of 198 septic shock patients, 99 received prehospital antimicrobial therapy. Blood cultures were taken prior to administration. Both groups were comparable in all aspects. There were 83 male and 26 female patients in the test group, and 79 male and 20 female patients in the control group (<italic>P = </italic>0.021). Mean age was 67.9 &#x000b1; 10.5 years in the test group and 63.8 &#x000b1; 11.0 years in the control group (<italic>P = </italic>0.186). The APACHE II score in the test group and in the control group was statistically not significant (<italic>P = </italic>0.661). In the test group 28%, compared with the control group 53%, of patients had community-acquired pneumonia (<italic>P = </italic>0.083). The mean intensive care stay in the test group was 6.8 &#x000b1; 2.1 days and in the control group it was 11.2 &#x000b1; 5.2 days (<italic>P = </italic>0.001). The first antimicrobial administration after emergency department admission time in the control group was 3.4 &#x000b1; 2.6 hours (<italic>P = </italic>0.02). The 28-day mortality rate was significantly reduced to 42.4% (test group) compared with 56.7% in the control group (<italic>P </italic>= 0.049, OR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.32 to 1.00).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The adjuvant treatment of patients with a guided prehospital-initiated broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy with intravenous fluid reduces the delay in antimicrobial administration and significantly reduces the 28-day mortality rate in patients with septic shock.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Duration of hypotension before initiation of effective antimicrobial therapy is the critical determinant of survival in human septic shock</article-title><source>Crit Care Med</source><year>2006</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>1589</fpage><lpage>1596</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1097/01.CCM.0000217961.75225.E9</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16625125</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Miner</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name><etal/><article-title>Presentation, time to antibiotics, and mortality of patients with bacterial meningitis at an urban county medical center</article-title><source>J Emerg Med</source><year>2001</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>387</fpage><lpage>392</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S0736-4679(01)00407-3</pub-id><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11728765</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref></ref-list></back></article>
