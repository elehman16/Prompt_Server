To reap the benefits from exercise the most appropriate level of intensity must be determined, the level of intensity ranging from low, low to moderate to hard (vigorous).</p><p>This study is aimed to 1. To investigate and evaluate 3 subjective rating scales. The Borg scale, the Combined Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) + FACES Dyspnea Rating Scale (FACES) and the Likert scale, during hard (vigorous) exercise. 2. To compare the effectiveness of the Borg scale and Combined Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) + FACES Dyspnea Rating Scale during the hard (vigorous) intensity exercise. This study uses a descriptive methodology.</p><p>The sample group was 73 medical personnel that were leading an inactive life style, volunteers from Phramongkutklao Hospital. Participants were randomly divided into 3 groups. Group 1, those to report using the Borg Scale, group 2 using NRS + FACES, and group 3 to subjectively assess the intensity of the exercise using the Likert scale during a treadmill Exercise Stress Test (EST) using the Bruce protocol. The upper limit of the intensity in the study was equal to 85% of the maximal heart rate of all participants. The subjective reporting of the experienced level of dyspnea was undertaken immediately after the completion of exercise.</p><p>The average age of participants was 23.37 years old. The 26 participants reporting using the Borg scale had mean Borg scale score of 13.46+1.77, a mode score of 15. The 24 participants reporting intensity levels through NRS +FACES had a mean NRS + FACES score of 6.83+1.09 and mode on the NRS + FACES scale equal to 7. The Likert scale group evaluated 23 participants with a mean Likert scale score of 2.74. That is those choosing Levels 2 and 3 were 6 (26.9%) and 17 participants (73.95%), respectively. Comparing the two groups with the Borg scale at equal to or greater than 15 and NRS + FACES greater than or equal to 7 using a Chi-square test showed that there were no statistical significant differences at <italic>p</italic> = 0.084. Using Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficient it was found that the subjective rating of intensity in the 3 different groups was not statistically significantly related to heart rate at 85% of maximal heart rate (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e; 0.05). NRS + FACES, the evaluation of the intensity of exercise at the hard (vigorous) level, was not statistically significantly different from the Borg scale.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>dyspnea rating scale</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>vigorous intensity</kwd><kwd>Borg scale</kwd><kwd>Numerical Rating Scale</kwd><kwd>FACES</kwd><kwd>Likert scale</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Exercise contributes to health benefits by controlling diseases in the metabolic syndrome group, including diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders and obesity. It is helps to prevent and reduce the mortality rate from coronary heart disease and decreases the risk of falling in the elderly (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Pollock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Mazzeo, 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Laskowski et al., 2012</xref>). There are 4 important components of prescription for exercise to be effective (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Pollock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>). These are known by the acronym &#x0201c;FITT&#x0201d;, F = frequency, I = intensity, T =Type and another T = time or duration. In the literature many recommendations have been made and accepted. The Review of Physical Activity Recommendation in 1995, requires that it is necessary to &#x0201c;accumulate 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most days.&#x0201d; which has later been adjusted to include vigorous (hard) intensity aerobic, physical activity. It was recommended that to reach the moderate/vigorous level people should accumulated 150/75 minutes per week, and increase to 300/150 minutes, respectively (<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">Oja et al., 2010</xref>) to obtain the additional benefits.</p><p>The Overload principle says to reap the health benefits from exercise it is important to have an optimum level of intensity that is suitable for minimum duration of exercise each other (<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">Laskowski et al., 2012</xref>). Thus these 2 components, intensity and duration are inversely proportional (<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Pollock et al., 1998</xref>). The Physical Activity Guideline for Americans suggests that to achieve the minimum goal of exercise for health, that should be accomplished by moderate intensity, aerobic exercise while the Center of Disease and Control (CDC) recommends that &#x0201c;Low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise can and should be given to most people&#x0201d;. In case of the heavy intensity exercise, the exerciser should be carefully considered and evaluated himself before starting the activity (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Among 4 components of exercise prescription, the intensity seems to be the most important leading factor because the risks of complications (adverse events) may occur during exercise and they are exactly associated with the level of intensity. For healthy people those complications such as sudden cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and musculoskeletal injury are rarely mentioned (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Philipps et al., 2012</xref>). So exercise at a higher intensity than vigorous (hard) level, which referred to as very hard intensity, is not to be recommended as it could lead to an increase in various risks of morbidity and complications.</p><p>Intensity is &#x0201c;How hard the body needs to work to perform an activity &#x0201c;. It has two aspects 1) <italic>Absolute Intensity</italic>, the rate at which the body uses oxygen or MET (Metabolic equivalent) and 2) <italic>Relative intensity</italic> measured objectively as percent of maximal heart rate, percent of heart rate reserve, percent of VO2max and subjectively through Rate Perceive Exertion (RPE) self reporting as Borg scale (<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">Borg, 1987</xref>), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Likert scale (<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">Philipps et al., 2012</xref>). These subjective indicators are named &#x0201c;subjecting rating scales&#x0201d; that imply the feeling of &#x0201c;what he thinks and is doing&#x0201d; and can provide 3 benefits as measurement, prescription and prediction for exercise intensity (<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Burkhalter, 1996</xref>).</p><p>Exercise higher than the moderate level is defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> (<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">Tipton et al., 2006</xref>), that shows vigorous (hard) intensity, has a Rate Perceived Exertion (RPE) on the Borg scale of 14-16. In case that RPE is higher than 16 the level of the exercise is very hard. Evidences of the exercise for health and benefits in metabolic syndromes obviously do not recommend exercise at the very hard level due to an increase the risk of mentioned adverse events, so the RPE of 16 was the upper limit of exercise prescription.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Show relative intensity of exercise and RPE separated by levels of intensity from moderate to maximal</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intensity</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%VO2 reserve or %Heart Rate reserve</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">%Heart Rate max</th><th align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RPE</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Moderate</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40-59</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55-69</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12-13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Vigorous(Hard)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60-84</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70-89</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14-16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Very hard</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;85</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0003e;90</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17-19</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Maximal</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Many studies of exercise intensity based on subjective rating scales, including Borg scale, Visual analogue scale and Likert scale have been done to measure the level of pain and intensity of exercises such as the study by <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Harms et al. (1986)</xref> found no statically significance between the Borg scale and the VAS scale when using them to measure pain in the elbow of 8 people. Thus, we can use the Borg scale and Visual Analog Scale to assess the level of pain caused by the load weight on elbows. A study by <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al. (1999)</xref> tested Borg scale, VAS and Likert scale to assess the degree of exercise intensity at a vigorous level as 60-70% of VO2max, has found that the VAS is the most suitable subjective rating scale for reproducibility of breathlessness and general fatigue during exercise. VAS is also the most sensitive measure of the breathlessness while Borg scale is the most sensitive for assessing general fatigue. <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">Capodaglio et al. (2001)</xref> investigated the relationship between VAS and Borg CR10 while doing an arm crank exercise and found that VAS increases in a linear relationship with workload. Whereas, the Borg CR10 (0 -10 fixed point-scale) found a slight increase together with workload and was significantly associated with heart rate and blood lactate. <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Ueda et al. (2006)</xref> studied the 4 scales of VAS (VAS 1-VAS 4) to measure the intensity of the exercise by both pedaling and running. The results support the 4-point scale of VAS as very useful to monitor the exercise intensity for both activities. Additional, results of the VAS1 and VAS2 for pedaling were statistically significantly higher than running, while at VAS3, subjects clearly felt leg pain greater than arm pain during arm cranks. At VAS4, running had breathing difficulty nearly the same as heart pain whereas pedaling had breathing difficulty much more than heart pain.</p><p>A study by <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">Morris et al. (2007)</xref> compared the Verbal Numerical Rating Scale (VNRS) and VAS to assess the level of dyspnea in both younger and older subjects while performed treadmill walking. These 2 rating scales were used twice a day in the first and second day. The results stated that VNRS are reliable throughout the exercise and recovery, and that the VAS significantly decreased on the second day in accordance with the constant higher VNRS than VAS on subjects in both groups. Finally, it is appropriate to satisfactorily use both the VNRS and VAS as a Rating scale to measure symptoms of dyspnea.</p><p>Thus, the importance of exercise intensity in the prescription of exercise should always be consistent with duration and frequency, and is the first consideration for any subject especially in vigorous intensity exercise that needs a risk assessment of the individual, observations and surveillance for adverse events. So this brought about our motivation to study subjective rating scale during vigorous intensity exercise.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>The participants had an average age between 22-23 years old, so youthfulness may have led to the less underlying disease, but would not be both the metabolic syndrome and musculoskeletal system that hinder or affect exercise.</p><p>NRS + FACES pain is a rating scale that often used to assess the subjective feeling of pain, especially in children. In the traditional model of Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale (WBFPRS), which summarizes the results from various studies <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Tomlinson et al. (2010)</xref> found the advantages in WBFPRS more than in other faces pain rating scales, in that they included adequate psychometric properties, quick and simple to use, required minimal instruction, most preferred by children of any age, and having vivid changes which showed pain on the face. For the purpose of this study the tool was adapted to combine a numerical rating scale 0-10 as it could address pain feeling better than the original which only had 6 faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Nevertheless, the traditional Borg scale is the dyspnea rating scale that has worldwide recognition (Borg, 1987). Borg scale has alternatively ever been used as a pain rating scale by <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">Harms et al. (1986)</xref> who found that both Borg scale and Visual Analogue Scale can be truly used to assess the level of pain caused by the weight load on the elbow.</p><p>In other studies, VAS can alternately be used as the dyspnea rating scale, Rate Perceived Exertion and furthermore to find out its relationship with heart rate and work load. The study of <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">Muza et al. (1990)</xref> revealed that VAS was close associated with Borg scale and the coefficient of variation was similar to the feeling of intensity of breathing during exercise in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease. <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">Neely et al. (1992)</xref> found a significant correlation between VAS, BorgCR10 and blood lactate, heart rate during exercise with a bicycle ergometer in healthy subjects.</p><p>Capodaglio et al. (2001) found that VAS increased in a linear relationship with the increasing workload. The study of <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">Ueda et al. (2006)</xref> found that 4-point VAS is exactly useful to monitor exercise intensity in both running and pedaling.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> showed the Borg scale and NRS + FACES such that when 85% of maximal heart rate was reached the 2 rating scales showed no significant differences. It is clear that the NRS + FACES scale was of such accuracy to measure exercise intensity as well as the Borg scale. Two results according with the study were <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">Tangugsorn et al. (1998)</xref> who found in normal population that the 2 pain rating scales such as VAS and Borg scale can certainly be used to validate the severity of exercise and corroborated <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">Grant et al. (1999)</xref> whose study showed the VAS had more sensitivity to measure changes in dyspnea than Borg scale significantly.</p><p>This study once used assessment of 3 rating scales at 85% of maximal heart rate. It did not evaluate each level of exercise intensity from mild (low), moderate intensity and more. However, the results of the Exercise Stress Test for all participants had been certified by a good experienced cardiologist and verified all normal hemodynamic responses without abnormal signs or symptoms.</p><p>Furthermore, the result also showed it was inappropriate to use Likert scale to assess exercise intensity or dyspnea rating because all of the participants (100%) were underestimated their real dyspnea, that was being at level 4 of the Likert scale. The reason may be the only 5-level-rating Likert scale that seemed to be inadequate to evaluate dyspnea thus this meant too much breadth of range of scale may lead to lower specificity of assessment.</p><p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>, the 3 rating scales did not correlate with the target heart rate at 85% of maximal heart rate significantly. This may be due to the method of study not to evaluate the rating scales at any points of the vigorous intensity within the range of 70-89% of maximal heart rate, but only one point at 85% of maximal heart rate. Even though, rating at hard (vigorous) intensity range is truly also available from 14-16 in Borg scale level and NRS + FACES scale at 7-10. These may be the significant factors influencing the rating scales in this study not significantly correlate with heart rate.</p><p>Recommendations for future research are: 1) To address NRS + FACES at all levels of exercise intensity from low, moderate, hard (vigorous) and find out the correlation between NRS + FACES and heart rate response 2) To study the NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) compared with NRS + FACES at all levels of exercise intensity 3) To study the NRS and / or NRS + FACES compared with BorgCR10 at all levels of exercise intensity.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>6. Conclusion</title><p>The use of NRS + FACES to assess the hard(vigorous) intensity exercise specified at 85% of maximal heart rate on treadmill walking saw no significant difference from the Borg scale (NRS + FACES at level 7 and the Borg scale at 15) whereas, the Likert scale is not sensitive enough to assess the intensity of dyspnea.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>Firstly, I would like to express my thanks to the residents of Subspecialty Training Unit of Medical Cardiology, the outpatient unit of the Medical Cardiology Department of Phramongkutklao hospital and also the Sirindhorn Heart Center, Thailand.
