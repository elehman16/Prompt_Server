challenging. There is a critical need for study designs with the desirable
characteristics of assay sensitivity, low placebo response, reliable pain
recordings, low cost, short duration of exposure to test drug and placebo,
and relevant and recruitable population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>We designed a proof-of-concept, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,
crossover study in patients with post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain
(PTNP) to evaluate whether such a study design had the potential to detect
efficacious agents. Pregabalin, known to be efficacious in neuropathic pain,
was used as the active analgesic. We also assessed physical activity
throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Twenty-five adults (20&#x02013;70 years of age) with PTNP for &#x02265;3
months entered a screening week and were then randomized to one of the two
following treatment sequences: (1) pregabalin followed by placebo or (2)
placebo followed by pregabalin. These 2-week treatment periods were
separated by a 2-week washout period. Patients on pregabalin treatment
received escalating doses to a final dosage of 300 mg/day (days
5&#x02013;15). In an attempt to minimize placebo response, patients received
placebo treatment during the screening week and the 2-week washout period.
Average daily pain scores (primary endpoint) were significantly reduced for
pregabalin versus placebo, with a mean treatment difference of &#x02212;0.81
(95% confidence interval: &#x02212;1.45 to &#x02212;0.17;
<italic>P</italic> = 0.015).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>The efficacy of pregabalin was similar to that identified in a large,
parallel group trial in PTNP. Therefore, this efficient crossover study
design has potential utility for future proof-of-concept studies in
neuropathic pain.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pregabalin</kwd><kwd>post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain</kwd><kwd>randomized crossover trial</kwd><kwd>placebo response</kwd><kwd>actigraphy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuropathic pain (NeP), caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory
system,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-jpr-5-243">1</xref> may be difficult to
treat owing to its persistence, resistance to standard analgesics, and the
involvement of multiple mechanisms in the peripheral and/or central nervous systems.
Patients with NeP present with remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity across the major
NeP syndromes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-jpr-5-243">2</xref> The variety of
sensory abnormalities in those patients may, in part, explain the challenge of
designing effective clinical trials with high sensitivity and specificity.</p><p>Traditionally, efficacy studies have focused on patients considered to represent
relatively homogeneous NeP populations, such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) or
painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and used parallel group study designs.
However, recruitment of patients with PHN, who tend to be elderly, has become
increasingly challenging because of greater uptake of the varicella-zoster
vaccine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-jpr-5-243">3</xref> and competing
recruitment demands from clinical studies. Patients with DPN, although more easily
recruited, tend to have relatively high rates of concomitant medical conditions,
variable glycemic control, and multiple therapeutic interventions. The resultant
polypharmacy renders patients with DPN a less than ideal NeP population in which to
investigate a novel agent, as there may be limited information concerning safety and
drug&#x02013;drug interaction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-jpr-5-243">4</xref></p><p>A chronic NeP condition that has been less studied in pharmacological trials is
post-traumatic peripheral neuropathic pain (PTNP) following damage to peripheral
nerves due to accidental or surgical injury. Given the many possible circumstances
giving rise to PTNP, overall prevalence estimates are lacking. However, estimates
exist for certain etiologies; for instance, chronic post-surgical pain is common and
such patients may be a good target population for proof-of-concept studies. The
estimated incidence of chronic postoperative pain after some surgical procedures
ranges from 5%&#x02013;50% depending on the operative
procedures.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-jpr-5-243">5</xref></p><p>Variability observed in placebo response in numerous trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-jpr-5-243">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-jpr-5-243">7</xref>
has been another issue that challenges NeP studies. This has led to a propensity for
large sample sizes in initial proof-of-concept/efficacy studies. To address these
issues, a number of studies have used crossover designs in various NeP populations
and have demonstrated some efficacy with smaller sample sizes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-jpr-5-243">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-jpr-5-243">10</xref> An analysis of study characteristics influencing trial outcomes and
placebo response in heterogeneous clinical trials suggest that parallel group
designs are associated with higher placebo response rates.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-jpr-5-243">11</xref> However, there is a lack of published literature
that allows the assessment of placebo response and assay sensitivity of crossover
versus parallel group designs for the same active drug in the same population of
patients with NeP. In this study, we examined whether a crossover study design, with
the addition of placebo administration during screening and the washout period,
minimizes placebo response and optimizes assay sensitivity to an active drug whose
efficacy was established in a parallel group study.</p><p>The study assessed the utility of a daily time-locked pain score (using
Actiwatch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Score<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jpr-5-243">12</xref> [Philips Respironics, Murrysville, PA]) in an attempt
to improve reliability and reduce study costs. The Actiwatch also enabled an
investigation of actigraphy as an exploratory endpoint. Actigraphy, an objective
measure of physical activity, has been widely used to assess sleep and circadian
rhythms.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-jpr-5-243">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-jpr-5-243">14</xref> However, there has been limited

pain specialist and persistent for &#x02265;3 months following the traumatic
event, were recruited at four sites: two in Canada and two in Sweden. Patients
with NeP not as a result of trauma &#x02013; trigeminal neuralgia, central pain
(due to cerebrovascular lesions, multiple sclerosis, and/or traumatic spinal
cord injuries, including spinal surgery), complex region pain syndrome type I,
phantom limb pain, radiculopathy, DPN, or PHN &#x02013; were excluded from this
study. Patients with any other coexisting pain that could not be discriminated
from PTNP, in the opinion of the patient or clinician, or who had depression or
any other medical conditions that would impair their ability to participate in
the study were excluded. Patients with creatinine clearance &#x02264; 60
mL/minute or a positive urine illicit drug screen were also excluded. Women who
were breastfeeding or pregnant were excluded and women of childbearing potential
were required to use reliable contraception. In addition, patients who had
previously failed to respond to pregabalin (&#x02265;300 mg/day), were
intolerant to &#x02265;300 mg of pregabalin, or who had previously failed to
respond to gabapentin (&#x02265;1800 mg/day) were excluded from the study.</p><p>Randomization criteria required patients to have discontinued and washed out of
prohibited medications, including medications to relieve PTNP (ie,
antidepressants, anticonvulsants/antiepileptics, opioids, selective serotonin
and dual reuptake inhibitors, long-acting benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants, and
topical analgesics), for specific washout periods before initiating the
screening week. Patients were required not to initiate or change ongoing
nonpharmacological therapies (eg, acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical
neural stimulation); however, regular daily use of medications to treat stable
conditions was allowed, provided that the medication was not prohibited and was
kept constant throughout the study. In addition, patients taking nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors were permitted to remain
on these for the duration of the study, provided the doses were stable and
expected to remain so for the duration of the study. Stable low-dose codeine was
the only exception to a prohibition on opioids, with a maximum daily dose of 32
mg permitted and a maximum weekly dose not exceeding 128 mg, provided the doses
were stable and expected to remain so for the duration of the study.</p><p>Pain was rated on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 = no pain to 10
= worst possible pain). Patients were required to have at least four
daily pain scores over the 7-day screening period prior to randomization and to
have an average score of &#x02265;4. To examine the potential heterogeneity of
the recruited PTNP population, a full medical history and cause of trauma were
recorded, along with responses at screening to the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4)
questionnaire,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-jpr-5-243">26</xref> but these
were not used as randomization criteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>This was an international, multicenter, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, crossover study. The trial is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> (identifier NCT00654940). Enrollment began on
May 5, 2008 and the last patient&#x02019;s last visit was on February 10, 2009.
The protocol was reviewed and approved by institutional review boards and the
study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good
Clinical Practice guidelines, and local laws and regulations. All patients gave
written informed consent prior to any study related procedures being conducted,
including any necessary washout period required for prohibited medications.
After the screening week, eligible patients were randomized to one of two
treatment sequences &#x02013; pregabalin administered twice daily (BID) followed
by placebo or placebo followed by pregabalin BID &#x02013; by means of a
computer-generated, pseudorandom code (blocking by site to try and ensure the
balance of sequences within a site). These 2-week treatment periods were
separated by a 2-week washout period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-5-243">Figure 1</xref>). For the pregabalin treatment period, all patients began
with pregabalin 75 mg on the evening of day 1, which increased to 150 mg/day on
days 2 and 3, 75 mg in the morning and 150 mg in the evening on day 4, and 300
mg/day on days 5&#x02013;15. In addition, patients received placebo treatment
(single-blind) during the screening week and 2-week washout periods. For the
screening period, washout period, and placebo treatment arm, all placebo
capsules were matched to pregabalin.</p></sec><sec><title>Efficacy assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean pain score for each treatment period
calculated from the daily pain scores of the last 7 days of treatment, with a
required minimum of at least four daily pain scores. Baseline pain score was
defined as the mean of the last seven pretreatment pain scores. If less than
seven pain scores were recorded at baseline, the available scores were used to
determine the mean. If less than seven scores were recorded post-baseline, the
available scores were used to determine the endpoint mean pain score. Pain over
the last 24 hours was rated daily upon rising from bed. The Actiwatch Score
device was worn on the wrist and pre-programmed to allow patient-initiated entry
of daily pain scores on an 11-point numeric rating scale.</p><p>Two exploratory secondary endpoints were also included in this study. The
Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-jpr-5-243">27</xref> questionnaire was completed on the following
scheduled visits to the clinic: day 1, week 2, week 4, and week 6. The
self-administered NPSI includes ten different pain symptom descriptors (eg,
burning, stabbing, electric shock) and two temporal items, and allows for
discrimination and quantification of five distinct clinically relevant
dimensions of NeP. Actigraphy data were captured throughout the study using the
Actiwatch Score, which contains an accelerometer that allows an objective
measure of physical activity by monitoring body motion during sleep and waking
hours. These devices were worn continuously throughout the study and the data
related to total, average, and peak activity were downloaded during clinic
visits. Actigraphy data were calculated as described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-jpr-5-243">12</xref> The values used in the
analysis were the mean activity score for each treatment period calculated from
the daily activity scores of the last 7 days of treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Tolerability and safety assessments</title><p>All spontaneously reported and observed adverse events (AEs) were recorded at
each clinic visit. Standard clinical laboratory tests, blood pressure and heart
rate, triplicate electrocardiograms, and urine drug testing were conducted at
screening. In addition, all female patients of childbearing potential were given
a pregnancy test at screening. A general physical examination also was performed
at both screening and follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data analysis</title><p>The primary comparison was between pregabalin and placebo treatments. The study
was designed to detect a difference in means (pregabalin&#x02013;placebo) of at
least &#x02212;1.0 (negative numbers indicating superiority of pregabalin over
placebo). A total of 16 patients completing the study would achieve at least
80% power for the primary comparison. Assuming a 30% drop-out
rate, the study had to randomize 24 patients. The primary analysis was based on
the full-analysis set (FAS) population, and a mixed analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA) model was fitted, accounting for the patient as a random effect, the
period and treatment as fixed effects, and the baseline scores (for each
treatment period) introduced as inter- and intrapatient covariates. The
interpatient covariate was the patient&#x02019;s mean baseline values (the mean
of each patient&#x02019;s period 1 and period 2 baseline values) and the
intrapatient covariate was the difference between the patient&#x02019;s baseline
measurement for the specific period and his/her mean baseline. Taking into
account that patients may have recorded more than one response per day, an
algorithm was applied to reduce the score to one pain score per day. The first
daily score recorded after 4 am was chosen as the daily pain score in the study.
The adjusted treatment difference (pregabalin&#x02013;placebo) was reported
together with the corresponding standard error (SE) and 95% confidence
interval (CI). For sensitivity, the primary analysis was repeated using a
per-protocol (PP) population that included only those patients who completed the
study with no major protocol deviations. NPSI was analyzed using a mixed effects
ANCOVA and was based on the FAS population. The period and treatment were fitted
as fixed effects, the patient was fitted as a random effect, and the baseline
was fitted as two covariates. The treatment comparison was between pregabalin
and placebo. The adjusted treatment difference (pregabalin&#x02013;placebo) was
reported together with the corresponding SE and 95% CI. Data were
summarized for NPSI total score and the five clinically relevant dimensions of
NeP. Patient activity was collected hourly for the following variables: peak,
average, and total activity. These were then divided into day (8 am&#x02013;8
pm), morning (8 am&#x02013;2 pm), afternoon (2 pm&#x02013;8 pm), and night (1
am&#x02013;5 am), and analyzed as for the primary endpoint.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Patients</title><p>In total, 28 patients were screened, with 25 patients meeting the randomization
criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-5-243">Figure 2</xref>). One patient
withdrew because of nausea and abdominal pain (during placebo treatment) and one
patient withdrew consent during the washout between treatment periods. These two
withdrawn patients and the 23 patients who completed the study comprised the FAS
population. There were 20 patients, determined prior to unblinding, who
completed the study with no major protocol deviations and were included in the
PP population. In addition to the two patients who discontinued, one patient was
&#x0003c;80% compliant with medication, one patient had recorded
excessive daily pain scores, and one patient had less than four pain scores
during screening.</p><p>In total, 11 males (20&#x02013;60 years of age) and 14 females (28&#x02013;70
years of age) were randomized into the study and their baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics, including screening pain intensities, were similar in
the two randomized treatment sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-5-243">Table 1</xref>). Surgery was the assigned cause of PTNP
for most patients (n = 19), followed by accident (n = 3) and
fracture (n = 3).</p></sec><sec><title>Primary efficacy endpoint</title><p>The mean baseline pain score for period 1 was approximately 6.0 in both the
pregabalin/placebo (n = 13) and placebo/pregabalin (n = 12)
sequences, while the mean baseline pain score for period 2 was 5.3 in both
sequences. Negligible decreases from baseline in mean pain scores were seen with
placebo treatment (least squares mean [SE] values of 0.03
[0.216] for the FAS population and 0.14 [0.249]
for the PP population). Pregabalin significantly reduced mean pain scores at the
end of treatment compared with placebo for both FAS (<italic>P</italic>
= 0.0152; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-jpr-5-243">Figure 3</xref>) and
PP (<italic>P</italic> = 0.0087) populations. At the end of treatment,
the mean difference between pregabalin and placebo was &#x02212;0.81
(95% CI: &#x02212;1.45 to &#x02212;0.17) for the FAS population and
&#x02212;1.07 (95% CI: &#x02212;1.84 to &#x02212;0.31) for the PP
population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-5-243">Table 2</xref>). There was
no evidence of any treatment carryover effect from period 1 when looking at the
baseline pain scores in period 2. Accounting for the overall reduction in pain
across the study (less pain in the second period than the first) by fitting a
period effect showed that the treatment effect, pregabalin&#x02013;placebo
difference, was consistent across the sequences and periods, and there was no
evidence of any treatment by period interaction or carryover.</p></sec><sec><title>Exploratory secondary endpoints</title><p>Actigraphy activity data were summarized by day (8 am&#x02013;8 pm), morning (8
am&#x02013;2 pm), afternoon (2 pm&#x02013;8 pm), and night (1 am&#x02013;5 am).
Average activity during the morning demonstrated the most apparent treatment
effect with pregabalin, although this was not statistically significant at the
two-sided 5% level, with a treatment difference of 44.2 (95% CI:
&#x02212;4.48 to 92.92; <italic>P</italic> = 0.07). This was equivalent
to an improvement of approximately 10.5% over placebo. Of the 25
randomized patients with investigator-diagnosed PTNP, only one patient had less
than four positive responses to the 10-item DN4 questionnaire, with this patient
reporting positive responses to burning pain, tingling, and
investigator-reported touch hypoesthesia. Patient-reported type of pain on the
DN4 questionnaire included the following: burning (80%), tingling
(76%), pins and needles (76%), electric shock (68%),
numbness (64%), itching (36%), and painful cold (24%).
Investigator-reported induction of hyperalgesia included touch (72%),
pricking (72%), or brushing (48%). There was no significant
difference between pregabalin and placebo on the NPSI total score or any of the
five distinct clinically relevant dimensions of NPSI (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Tolerability and safety</title><p>In total, 42% of patients reported treatment-emergent AEs during the
placebo treatment periods and 46% of patients reported
treatment-emergent AEs during the pregabalin treatment periods. All AEs were
mild or moderate and there were no severe AEs. One patient withdrew owing to
nausea and abdominal pain during a placebo treatment period. The most common
treatment-emergent AEs were dizziness with six events reported during the
pregabalin treatment periods and one event during the placebo treatment period;
nausea with four events reported during the pregabalin treatment periods and
three during the placebo treatment periods; and somnolence with three events
reported during the pregabalin treatment periods.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>As novel agents are sought to address the high medical need presented by patients
with NeP, there is a concomitant requirement to develop robust study designs able to
reliably detect efficacious agents. In addition, there is a need to identify an
alternative NeP population for early proof-of-concept/efficacy studies other than
the traditional PHN and DPN patient populations. Finally, the potential for variable
placebo responses, whether in initial proof-of-concept/efficacy studies or larger
Phase III/IV trials, continues to be a challenging aspect of randomized controlled
analgesic studies.</p><p>In this simple two-way crossover study with placebo administration during screening
and washout periods and just 25 patients, we have efficiently detected a significant
treatment effect with pregabalin in patients with PTNP. The reduction in pain
intensity observed in this current study (&#x02212;0.81 [95% CI:
&#x02212;1.45 to &#x02212;0.17]) is similar to that obtained in a recently
completed large PTNP parallel group&#x02013;designed study (&#x02212;0.62
[95% CI: &#x02212;1.09 to &#x02212;0.15]) comprising 254
patients,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-jpr-5-243">25</xref> and is comparable
with the efficacy signals seen in a variety of NeP populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-jpr-5-243">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-jpr-5-243">24</xref> There was no evidence of carryover, meaning the effect of a treatment
in the first period affecting the results of the second period. However, there was a
reduction in pain over time throughout the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-jpr-5-243">Figure 3</xref>), which is typically observed in both
parallel group and crossover pain studies. Notably, the reduction in pain between
the end of period 1 and the baseline of period 2 was greater in the placebo-treated
patients than in the pregabalin-treated patients. The reason for this observation is
unclear. A possible explanation is that on placebo there was a general reduction in
pain over time, but this reduction was greater for the patients on pregabalin. When
the patients on pregabalin were switched to placebo during the washout period they
returned towards the placebo time course and, hence, the reduction in pain after
pregabalin was less than after placebo during the washout. This would be equivalent
to a return to baseline if there was no reduction in pain on placebo. The lower
baseline values in period 2 than period 1 were accounted for in the analysis by
incorporating a period effect. If a future study lasts longer with more periods,
then there could be a further reduction in pain, which reduces the window that a
treatment effect can be seen. Care should be taken if extending the study design to
three or more periods.</p><p>The crossover study design presented here is relatively straightforward, without the
need for patient enrichment strategies, extensive screening, or run-in phases.
Therefore, this study design facilitates enrollment of a small number of patients
and had a minimal withdrawal rate. This is in contrast to the enriched-enrollment
randomized withdrawal design that requires enrollment of a larger number of patients
to the titration period, with only a small number of them entering
randomization.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-jpr-5-243">28</xref></p><p>In order to assess the maximal sensitivity of the current study and to maximize
subject retention, we excluded patients who had previously failed to respond to
pregabalin or gabapentin or were intolerant to a low dose of pregabalin. An
advantage of this approach is that failure to detect efficacy would indicate lack of
utility of the study design clearly. A disadvantage is that the generalizability of
these results may be limited because of a potential selection bias from the
exclusion criterion.</p><p>Recruitment rates from the four sites demonstrated that future
proof-of-concept/efficacy studies could be readily supported using this same general
design and patient population, and it represents a potential reduction in the number
of sites generally required to support similar numbers of patients with PHN or DPN.
Additionally, the response on the DN4 questionnaire indicated that the patients
suffered from NeP and that the DN4 is a reliable tool for the inclusion of patients
with PTNP in future studies.</p><p>Perhaps the most striking result, after the clear demonstration of a statistically
significant treatment effect with pregabalin, was the very low placebo response
observed with this particular study design. In recent years, there has been an
increase in the number of chronic pain clinical trials, in which the treatment being
evaluated did not differ significantly from placebo in the primary efficacy
measure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jpr-5-243">29</xref> It was suggested
that it was due to excessive response rates in the placebo groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-jpr-5-243">29</xref> As indicated previously, in
seeking to identify a study design that more efficiently evaluated the potential
efficacy of novel analgesic agents in NeP, we sought to introduce elements that
might diminish the placebo response. Therefore, patients received matching placebo
during screening and during the two washout periods. We observed minimal changes
from baseline in mean pain score during placebo treatment in each treatment period,
which resulted in an overall low placebo response. With this design, the patients
know that they will receive both treatments but are blinded to the specific time
when treatments are changed; therefore, this may help overcome the patients&#x02019;
expectation that leads to placebo responses.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-jpr-5-243">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32-jpr-5-243">32</xref> It is difficult to determine with certainty whether the addition of
placebo during baseline and washout contributed to the minimal placebo response.
Directly addressing this question would require randomization to a parallel study
group that did not receive placebo during the baseline and washout period, which
would significantly increase the complexity of the investigation. The current study
provided a pragmatic assessment of a placebo reduction strategy.</p><p>We have attempted to identify selective or preferential effects of pregabalin on the
different dimensions of NeP based on responses of the NPSI questionnaire, but found
no significant difference between pregabalin and placebo on the NPSI total score or
any of the five distinct clinically relevant dimensions of NPSI. Larger studies
would be required to confirm any differential effects of pregabalin on NeP symptom
dimensions.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the utility of the Acti-watch Score in collecting
patients&#x02019; daily pain score. The first pain score entered after 4 am was
taken as the daily pain rating over the last 24 hours (upon rising from bed) for all
patients. Therefore, the use of the Actiwatch Score device or a similar device to
record daily pain scores, in a time-related manner, appears to be practical, and in
such small studies may provide a clear advantage over the set-up costs of other
systems, such as automated phone services. Furthermore, when patients with chronic
pain were evaluated for compliance by using a paper diary instrumented to track
actual diary use, it was found that although patients submitted diaries indicating
90% compliance, the electronic records indicated that actual compliance was
only 11%, suggesting a high level of faked compliance.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jpr-5-243">33</xref> However, the study showed that there was high
compliance with electronic diaries with enhanced compliance features.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-jpr-5-243">33</xref> The poor compliance or even faked
compliance with paper diaries has important implications for the validity of the
data. The Actiwatch Score device is a convenient system to collect pain ratings and
may reduce the inaccuracies associated with ratings that rely on summaries of daily
experiences in paper diaries based on memory.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-jpr-5-243">34</xref></p><p>The Actiwatch Score device not only captured daily pain scores, but also enabled the
exploratory secondary analysis of actigraphy data. None of the components
demonstrated a significant treatment effect with pregabalin; however, the largest
treatment effect was seen with average activity in the morning, with an improvement
over placebo of approximately 10.5%. One study in patients with NeP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20-jpr-5-243">20</xref> reported an increase in daytime
activity (assessed via actigraphy) with a reduction in pain scores; however, as this
was not a blinded study, it was difficult to interpret these results. Although the
actigraphy results in our study were not significant, they indicated that it is
worth further investigation. A larger study will be required to confirm the validity
of these results.</p><p>In conclusion, this study describes a two-way crossover design that allowed efficient
assessment of the efficacy of the active treatment, pregabalin, in a relatively
small PTNP patient population. There was a fairly low placebo response, which may be
related to the utilization of placebo during both the screening/run-in and washout
phases between the treatment periods of this crossover design. In addition, the
utility of the Actiwatch Score device to capture pain scores has been confirmed, and
there is an indication that future studies should explore activity as a relevant
endpoint in NeP. Finally, the results described here indicate that similar study
designs of patients with PTNP, an alternative NeP population to patients with PHN
and DPN, may represent a more efficient way to evaluate the potential efficacy of
novel analgesic agents in future proof-of-concept/efficacy studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank the co-investigators Dr Michael O&#x02019;Mahony (Sarnia,
