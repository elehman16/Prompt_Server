program in patients with chronic low-back pain caused by lumbar disc hernia (LHNP).
[Subjects and Methods] In total, 34 subjects were allocated randomly to the study (n=18)
and control groups (n=16). In the study group, dry needling was applied using acupuncture
needles. The control group performed a home exercise program in addition to hot pack,
TENS, and ultrasound applications. Pain was assessed with the short form of the McGill
Pain Questionnaire. The number of trigger points and their pressure sensitivity were
evaluated with a physical examination (palpation). The Beck Depression Inventory was used
to assess depression. The Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale was used to assess fear of movement.
[Results] In the study group, the calculated Cohen&#x02019;s effect sizes were bigger than those
in the control group in terms of pain, trigger point-related variables, and fear of
movement. Effect sizes for reducing depressive symptoms were similar in both groups.
[Conclusion] These results suggest that dry needling can be an effective treatment for
reducing pain, number of trigger points, sensitivity, and kinesiophobia in patients with
chronic low-back pain caused by lumbar disc hernia.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Dry needling</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Low-back pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Low-back pain is a common health problem worldwide and a major cause of job-related
disability, affecting employee job performance and healthcare costs. About 60&#x02013;80% of adults
experience low-back pain at some point in their lifetimes<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The vast majority of patients experience low-back pain for
mechanical reasons. A herniated lumbar disc is one of the most common causes of chronic
low-back pain.</p><p>When the pain lasts for more than 3 months, it is considered chronic. Lumbar disc hernia
(LHNP), a common reason for chronic low-back pain, is characterized by particular findings,
such as pain, paravertebral muscle spasm, losses of strength, and hypoesthesia, during the
course of the disease. It causes social and financial problems as well as health problems.
Many psychosocial elements play a role in making the problem chronic. Cognitive, behavioral,
and emotional aspects of the condition gain importance as the disease becomes chronic<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Depression and other mental symptoms are involved, and the continuous nature of the pain
creates a vicious cycle by increasing the risk for mental disorders such as depression<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Fear avoidance is an important psychosocial
variable among the patients that have this disability. It is accepted that individual and
psychological factors as well as beliefs and behaviors related to pain play important roles
in low-back pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Trigger points (TPs) are defined as hyperirritable points in a taut band of skeletal
muscles that create pain and cause reflected pain when they are palpated<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. TPs are clinically classified as active and
latent. Active TPs are spontaneously painful, and they cause reflected pain that produces
symptoms when they are palpated. In contrast, latent TPs do not create pain spontaneously,
but they are a source of reflected pain when palpated. When active TPs are compared with
latent TPs, chemical pain mediators are more in active TPs<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The dry needling (DN) technique developed by Gunn is a treatment method that is used
frequently for chronic pain<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The DN
technique, applied to TPs, reduces the number and the sensitivity of TPs related to the
pain. According to Dommerholt<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, DN has
effects such as acute decreases in local, reflected, and widespread pain, restoration of
joint range of motion and muscle activation, and rapid normalization of active myofascial TP
chemistry. DN can reduce peripheral and central sensitization. A Cochrane review concluded,
&#x0201c;DN appears to be a useful adjunct to other therapies for chronic low-back pain&#x0201d;<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, DN performed on TPs in patients
suffering from chronic low-back pain may be effective in reducing TP sensitivity. However, a
meta-review concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support DN<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of this study was to compare the
effectiveness of DN versus a classical physiotherapy program (CPT) on pain, TPs, TP
sensitivity, depression, and kinesiophobia in patients with chronic low-back pain caused by
LHNP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This single-blind, randomized controlled trial was carried out between November 2015 and
January 2016 at the Eastern Mediterranean University Faculty of Health Sciences Department
of Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation. An <italic>a priori</italic> power analysis was
conducted using the G*Power software (ver. 3.1.9.2). Assuming a two-tailed Wilcoxon signed
rank test at the 0.05 significance level with a statistical power of 80%, this analysis
showed that 15 subjects would be required for each group. Considering the risk of dropouts,
this sample size was increased by 20% in each group, and the final sample size was
determined to be 18 subjects in each group.</p><p>Subjects between the ages of 35 and 70&#x02005;year who reported low-back pain lasting at least 3
months, had been diagnosed with LHNP, and had at least one active TP that could produce
symptoms were included in the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1502-g001"/></fig>). Those with LHNP who showed neurological symptoms, had any orthopedic problem in the
lower extremities or low-back region, had sacroiliac joint problems, were diagnosed with
lumbar spondylolisthesis, had any neurological, rheumatic, or oncological problem, had
received any physiotherapy less than 6 months earlier, had received any corticosteroid
treatment or taken oral medication, and those with a needle phobia were excluded.</p><p>Approval was obtained from the Eastern Mediterranean University Ethics Committee. Written
informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><p>In total, 34 subjects agreed to participate and were separated in two groups using Random
Allocation Software in one block (p&#x0003c;0.05 was accepted)<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Randomization was conducted by a person not involved in the study.
DN and classic massage (DN + M) was applied to the first group, and the second group was
treated with hot-pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), ultrasound, and
an at-home exercise program.</p><p>All assessments were made before treatment and on the last day of treatment by the same
evaluator/physiotherapist (BHT), who was blinded to the treatment groups. Participants&#x02019;
sociodemographic characteristics such as age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), marital
status, and term of education were recorded.</p><p>The Short Form McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) visual analog scale (VAS) was used to
determine the pain level, the primary outcome measure<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subjects were asked to place an X to indicate the level of pain
they were experiencing on a 10-cm scale, where 0 indicates no pain and 10, the worst level
of pain. The distance between the marked point and the beginning of the line was recorded as
the level of the pain felt.</p><p>The sensory and affective characteristics of pain in the lower back and of total pain point
were assessed using SF-MPQ, whose validity and reliability in Turkish has been shown<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The questionnaire contains a total of 15
descriptors (4 affective and 11 sensory) which are rated on an intensity scale: &#x0201c;0&#x0201d;=none,
&#x0201c;1&#x0201d;=mild, &#x0201c;2&#x0201d;=moderate, &#x0201c;3&#x0201d;=severe. Additionally, the level of the pain felt was measured
using the VAS.</p><p>Numbers of active and latent TPs on the gluteus medius, quadratus lumborum, multifidus, and
lumbar erector spinae muscles were determined in both groups according to Simons et al.; the
reliability of this approach was shown by Gerwin et al<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Three separate methods,
direct finger pressure, flat palpation, and pinch palpation, were used in the examination.
The first two methods were chosen for TPs in the superficial muscles, and the third was used
for TPs in deep muscles<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. To determine
TP sensitivity in the stated muscles, perpendicular pressure was applied on the TP at the
taut band with the thumb. The sensitivity levels were recorded using a ranking from 0 to
2<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, where &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; indicates that thumb
palpation results in increased intensity in the TP area, but there is no pain; &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; indicates
that the intensity is increased, and the patient reports pain when asked; and &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; indicates
that pain intensity is increased, and the patient spontaneously notes the pain when pressure
is applied. The TP sensitivity scores in each muscle were summed, and the total was recorded
as the TP sensitivity.</p><p>The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was used to determine depression levels<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup> The BDI is composed of 21 items, each of
which includes four choices that are used to distinguish depression from other
psychopathological conditions and to determine the level of depression. Each item is scored
from 0 to 3. Thus, the highest BDI score is 63, and the lowest is 0. Higher scores indicate
higher levels of depression. The validity and reliability of the BDI in Turkish have been
reported<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Fear of movement was assessed using the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (TSK). The scale is
composed of 17 questions that assess fear related to movement. Scores on this scale range
from 17 to 68 based on a four-point Likert scale (&#x0201c;1&#x0201d; means strongly disagree and &#x0201c;4&#x0201d; means
strongly agree). Higher scores indicate kinesiophobia<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reliability of the scale in Turkish has been shown<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>DN was performed on active and/or latent TPs in the gluteus medius, quadratus lumborum,
multifidus, and erector spinae muscles of the subjects in the study groups without local
anesthetic. These muscles were chosen for different reasons. Active TPs occur frequently in
the gluteus medius and quadratus lumborum muscles, and although the multifidus muscle,
located deeper, is one of the fundamental stabilizers, it has been insufficiently assessed
as an important cause of pain<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gluteus
medius and quadratus lumborum testing occurred with patients in a side-lying position,
whereas patients were positioned lying face down for the multifidus and erector spinae
muscles. The needles were applied at a 90&#x000b0; angle for the multifidus, quadratus lumborum, and
gluteus medius muscles, and at 45&#x000b0; for the erector spinae muscles. After the TP was located,
the skin was cleaned with alcohol, and needling was performed. Thin, stainless steel needles
of 0.25 &#x000d7; 0.40&#x02005;mm and 0.30 &#x000d7; 0.60&#x02005;mm were used to the TP using the injection technique
described by Travel and Simons<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
needles were kept in place for 20&#x02005;min; at the 10th minute, the needle was rolled to enable
re-stimulation. The treatment was applied twice per week for six sessions in total. The
treatment was applied by a physiotherapist (SG) with a certificate in dry needling at TPs
and 2&#x02005;years of clinical experience.</p><p>To reduce pain and relieve muscle spasm, classic (Swedish) massage was applied to the
low-back region in the study group. With the patient lying prone, massage was administered
to the erector spinae, latissimus dorsi, and gluteal regional muscles in the low back.
Stroking and kneading methods were used. Each method was repeated three times. The massage
lasted up to 10&#x02005;min.</p><p>In the control group, we applied a hot-pack for 20&#x02005;min to increase the local circulation,
enhance relaxation of muscles with TPs, and decrease the tension at TPs<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Control group subjects received burst TENS to the lumbar region paravertebrally using
reusable silicone rubber electrodes. The electrode dimensions were 5 &#x000d7; 5&#x02005;cm. The Chattanooga
Intelect TENS (E) 77720 machine was used. The pulse width was set at 100 &#x000b5;sn, pulse
frequency was 2&#x02005;Hz, cycle time was 0.5&#x02005;s, and the strength of the flow was increased until
visible muscle contraction was achieved. If muscle contraction was lost during the session,
the amplitude was increased again. The period of treatment was six sessions of 25&#x02005;min
each.</p><p>Constant ultrasound was applied paravertebrally to the low back region in subjects in the
control group using an Enraf-Nonius Sonopuls 492 ultrasound device. The skin was cleaned
before applying the coupling gel. The treatment was applied at 1&#x02005;MHz frequency and
1.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup> power for 6&#x02005;min per day (3&#x02005;min each on the right and left sides) over
10 sessions, using a complete direct contact method. A 5-cm ultrasound head was used.</p><p>The following exercises were assigned to the control group as an at-home exercise program.
The patients were asked to exercise twice per day, completing three sets of each exercise,
each with 10 repeats. Exercises are shown below.</p><p>&#x02022; Posterior pelvic tilt</p><p>&#x02022; Stretching lumbar extensors</p><p>&#x02022; Stretching hip flexors</p><p>&#x02022; Anterior and posterior pelvic tilt exercises combined with head movements in a crawling
position to strengthen the back and abdominal muscles</p><p>Statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS software (ver. 20.0). Whether the data
were normally distributed was assessed with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The results are
given as mean (&#x00078;&#x00304;) &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD), with numbers and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for continuous data. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used in intra-group
comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U-test in comparisons between groups and independent samples,
and comparisons of percentages were made using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and/or Fisher&#x02019; Exact
Test. The marginal homogeneity test was used to test differences in intervals in dependent
variables. For the output of the primary and secondary results, Cohen d effect sizes were
calculated using the following formulae:</p><p><disp-formula>d=(&#x00078;&#x00304;1 &#x02212;&#x00078;&#x00304;2) / S<sub>pooled</sub>,</disp-formula></p><p><disp-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-1502-e001.jpg"/>.</disp-formula></p><p>The size of the effect was interpreted as d=0.2, small; d=0.5, medium; and d=0.8,
large<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>. Values of p&#x0003c;0.05 were
considered to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In total, 18 individuals each participated in the study and control groups. However, two

program for treatment of low-back pain as measured by pain level, which was analyzed as the
primary outcome measure. The application of DN + M was more effective in decreasing scores
on SF-MPQ, the number of TPs, total sensitivity of TPs, depression, and kinesiophobia, which
were secondary outcome measures.</p><p>CPT is one of the conservative methods used in the treatment of low-back pain<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. There have been studies on the effects of
various exercise methods and manual treatments for the treatment of low-back pain, and a
program consisting of hot-pack, TENS, ultrasound, and at-home exercises is used frequently
in our country under the CPT program. There are conflicting publications on the
effectiveness of modalities such as hot and cold pack applications and ultrasound<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although no studies have strongly
supported the use of TENS for chronic low-back pain, it is included in some treatment
guidelines<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, in some
clinical guidelines, it is noted that multimodal treatment approaches are required for the
treatment of chronic low-back pain<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, we found that pain, depression, and the fear of movement in the patients
having chronic low-back pain due to LHNP could not be decreased with the CPT program.
However, the qualities of pain and the number and sensitivity of TPs were improved.</p><p>Mechanical problems cause increased muscle activity by creating tissue damage and
inflammation, and they may eventually cause muscle spasms. All of the muscles located in the
lumbar region function in ensuring lumbar vertebral stability. The most important muscle for
lumbar segmental stability is the multifidus. Cornwall et al. stated that spasm or atrophy
in the multifidus muscle can cause local and reflected pain<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The erector spinae muscles, where spasm is frequently seen, and
the multifidus muscles, which can cause reflected pain and which plays an important role in
lumbar stabilization, were chosen for DN treatment as well as gluteus medius and quadratus
lumborum muscles, in which active TPs are seen in chronic low-back pain according to
T&#x00117;llez-Garc&#x000ec;a et al<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>TPs can be deactivated through many methods, such as ischemic compression, stretching<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>, and cold spray with stretching<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. TENS and needling have also been
reported<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, needling was stated to be the best method for the
treatment of chronic TPs<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. DN performed
on TPs is recommended as a significant treatment choice for patients with chronic low-back
pain, according to the Cochrane Collaboration<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The DN technique acts to mechanically disrupt sensory or motor components of nerve endings
that contribute to abnormal elements of muscle contractions, which in turn affect activity
in the area of TPs. Taut bands of muscle fibers that can be palpated and overstimulation of
sensory nerves are reduced by this disruption. Overstimulation of sensory nerves is
responsible for the reflected pain and local sensitivity. The temporary damage to the muscle
fibers created by the needle causes the release of local intracellular potassium. This
prevents depolarization of nerve fibers where extracellular potassium reaches a sufficient
amount<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although it is considered
that therapeutic effect is created with pain-modulation mechanisms, such as local endorphin
release and the gate control theory, it is mainly related with counter irritation mechanisms
of irritation that cause inhibition of neuroplastic changes that develop with central
sensitization at the dorsal horn cells in spinal cord<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that TP injection reduces pain and increases the normal range
of joint motion, exercise tolerance, and circulation in patients with radiculopathy-origin
chronic myofascial pain and patients suffering from chronic pain due to other
etiologies<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kalichman and
Vulfsons<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup> recommended DN because it is
an inexpensive, easy to learn, low risk, and minimally invasive treatment method. DN shows
an effect after the first session. Recovery in symptoms is usually seen with a program of
five or six sessions applied once per 2 days<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, such recovery was seen in the DN + M group
following a program composed of six sessions, which resulted in reductions in the pain
level, qualities of pain, number of TPs, TP sensitivity, depression, kinesiophobia, and
clinical effects, with the exception of depression, As there was no overlap in the
confidence intervals in terms of the pain level, qualities of pain, number of TPs, or TP
sensitivity, these findings support our conclusions.</p><p>Garvey et al.<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>, studying 63 patients
with low-back pain due to TPs, found no significant differences among the DN, lidocaine,
lidocaine + steroid injection, and vapoolant spreys + acupuncture groups. However, DN was
preferable. DN therapy was superior to sham DN therapy in chronic low-back pain; however,
its effect was found to be temporary in the randomized cross-over study carried by Itoh et
al<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. TENS was compared with DN and
laser treatments, and the results showed that DN was more efficient, with benefits lasting
for 4 weeks<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Although measurements were made after treatment in the present study, it was impossible to
assess long-term effectiveness because follow-up visits were not carried out. This is an
important limitation of our study.</p><p>Chronic low-back pain due to LHNP causes stress and may cause psychological disorders by
affecting personal abilities<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some
reports have suggested that psychological disorders such as depression and fear of movement
are common in patients with chronic low-back pain and that identifying and beginning
treatment at an early stage can prevent the problem from becoming chronic and prevent a poor
prognosis<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pre- and post-treatment results of this study indicate that DN + M can be considered more
effective than CPT for reducing depression and kinesiophobia, although, no statistically
significant difference in depression was found between the groups after treatment, and the
95% CIs overlapped.</p><p>In Ay et al.<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref><sup>)</sup>, local anesthetic
injection methods were compared clinically with DN. Improvement in depression scale scores
was seen in both groups after treatment, but the difference between the groups was not
statistical significant. In another study, Altinda&#x0011f; et al.<xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the efficacy of DN and local anesthetic injection and
found that both treatment methods were effective in improving pain and quality of life, but
neither showed any effect on depression.</p><p>Although the reduction in kinesiophobia was significantly greater in the DN + M than in the
CPT group after treatment, the 95% CIs overlapped and the clinical effectiveness was small.
Thus, the DN + M program has limited clinical efficacy. Kinesiophobia is the most important
predictor of pain-related disability in patients with chronic pain<xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, when it considering that chronic pain may have
cognitive and behavioral implications, such as fear of movement, and this may make the
situation more difficult and may cause disability, even a modest clinical effect due to DN
may be important.</p><p>A study by T&#x00117;llez-Garc&#x000ec;a et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>
compared DN with DN plus neuroscience education. The authors performed DN only on active TPs
in the quadratus lumborum and multifidus gluteus medius muscles in their study. Although
this study differs from ours in terms of application methods, the effects of DN on pain and
kinesiophobia were similar. The reduction in kinesiophobia, or fear of movement due to pain,
may be attributable to reductions in pain and in the number and sensitivity of TPs with the
DN + M program.</p><p>One limitation of our study is that it had no control group that was subjected to no
treatment. Although the improvements seen with the DN + M program were superior to those
with the CPT program, it is impossible to know whether the improvements in both groups were
caused by the nature of each intervention. Hence, the results should be interpreted
cautiously. Second, exercises to be given on disc pathologies should be specific to the
patient. If the same exercises are given the standard forms, this may have affected the
inhibition of pain. However, for the control group, we used a conventional treatment program
routinely used in our country. For this reason, we did not use specific exercises for the
control group.</p><p>Third, as there was no follow-up period, it is impossible to estimate how long the
improvements lasted. Thus, studies using short- and long-term effects of treatment programs
including DN + M are required in the future.</p><p>Results of this single-blind, randomized controlled study showed significant differences in
the effects of DN + M compared with CPT program in terms of pain and the number and
sensitivity of TPs in patients with chronic low-back pain due to LHNP. Both treatment
programs had similar, modest effects on depression. Although the DN + M treatment program
was more effective in reducing pain-related fear of movement, its clinical effect was small
to medium. DN technique is useful in the management of the low back pain patients with disc
herniation because of all these results. Although the total number of subject participated
was small, the minimal statistical requirement was satisfied with significance between the
study group and control group. Further studies are needed to find the long lasting effect
and indication, limitation of the DN to the low back pain after disc herniation. To increase
confidence in the conclusions, double-blind, randomized controlled studies are needed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>For referring patients, we thank Famagusta State Hospital Chief Physician Dr. Ahmet &#x000d6;zde&#x0015f;
