FPC donates iron directly to transferrin, bypassing the reticuloendothelial system and avoiding iron sequestration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Two identical Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (CRUISE 1 and 2) were conducted in 599 iron-replete chronic hemodialysis patients. Patients were dialyzed with dialysate containing 2 &#x000b5;M FPC-iron or standard dialysate (placebo) for up to 48 weeks. Oral or intravenous iron supplementation was prohibited, and doses of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents were held constant. The primary efficacy end point was the change in hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration from baseline to end of treatment (EoT). Secondary end points included reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHr) and serum ferritin.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In both trials, Hgb concentration was maintained from baseline to EoT in the FPC group but decreased by 0.4 g/dL in the placebo group (P &#x0003c; 0.001, combined results; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2&#x02013;0.6). Placebo treatment resulted in significantly larger mean decreases from baseline in CHr (&#x02212;0.9 pg versus &#x02212;0.4 pg, P &#x0003c; 0.001) and serum ferritin (&#x02212;133.1 &#x000b5;g/L versus &#x02212;69.7 &#x000b5;g/L, P &#x0003c; 0.001) than FPC treatment. The proportions of patients with adverse and serious adverse events were similar in both treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>FPC delivered via dialysate during hemodialysis replaces iron losses, maintains Hgb concentrations, does not increase iron stores and exhibits a safety profile similar to placebo. FPC administered by hemodialysis via dialysate represents a paradigm shift in delivering maintenance iron therapy to hemodialysis patients.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anemia</kwd><kwd>erythropoiesis-stimulating agent</kwd><kwd>ferric pyrophosphate citrate</kwd><kwd>hemodialysis</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="gfv277_s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In patients with hemodialysis-dependent Stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD-5HD), iron needs are increased because of elevated erythroid iron requirements resulting from the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) and dialysis-associated blood losses, including frequent blood sampling and overt or occult gastrointestinal bleeding [<xref rid="GFV277C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="GFV277C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. At the same time, iron supply is suppressed by the chronic inflammation of renal failure, which stimulates hepatic production of the systemic iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin [<xref rid="GFV277C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="GFV277C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. To counterbalance increased iron losses and hepcidin-induced sequestration of iron, most hemodialysis patients are currently administered intravenous (IV) iron [<xref rid="GFV277C5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Intravenous iron may increase the risks of inflammation, oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, immune deficiency and bacterial infections [<xref rid="GFV277C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and further exacerbate iron sequestration.</p><p>Ferric pyrophosphate citrate (FPC, Triferic&#x02122;) is a carbohydrate-free, water-soluble, complex iron salt that was first demonstrated to deliver iron via dialysate in 1999, allowing maintenance of hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration and iron balance while reducing the need for IV iron by about 80% [<xref rid="GFV277C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>FPC is added to liquid bicarbonate concentrate at the clinic. The bicarbonate concentrate with FPC subsequently mixes with acid concentrate and water in the hemodialysis machine to generate dialysate containing 2 &#x000b5;M iron. FPC crosses the dialyzer membrane, enters the blood, donates its iron directly to transferrin and is rapidly cleared from circulation. This provides for iron utilization for erythropoiesis and avoids iron sequestration within reticuloendothelial macrophages [<xref rid="GFV277C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="GFV277C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], thereby avoiding hepcidin-induced iron sequestration.</p><p>The <underline>C</underline>ontinuous <underline>R</underline>eplacement <underline>U</underline>sing <underline>I</underline>ron <underline>S</underline>oluble <underline>E</underline>quivalents (CRUISE 1 and 2) studies tested the hypothesis that FPC administered via dialysate can sustain iron delivery for erythropoiesis and is more effective than placebo in maintaining Hgb concentration in hemodialysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="gfv277_s2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Two identical, prospective, randomized, single-blind (patients blinded to treatment assignment), placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase 3 studies were conducted at 88 study locations in the United States and Canada from March 2011 to July 2013.</p><sec id="gfv277_s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The studies consisted of a screening period, followed by three sequential stages (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ndt/gfv277/-/DC1">Supplementary data, Figure S1</ext-link>): Stage 1, run-in (1&#x02013;4 weeks, no study drug treatment); Stage 2, randomized treatment (single-blind treatment for up to 48 weeks; assessment of primary end point) and Stage 3, open-label treatment (long-term safety study; results not reported here).</p><p>Patients who met criteria for entry into Stage 2 were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to dialyze during every hemodialysis session with FPC dialysate (2 &#x000b5;moles [110 &#x000b5;g] iron/liter) or placebo (standard dialysate).

No clinically meaningful differences were observed between groups in the incidence of TEAEs of special interest [data not shown].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="gfv277_s4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The primary objective of these studies was to demonstrate that FPC administered via dialysate is more effective than placebo in maintaining Hgb concentration in chronic hemodialysis patients. FPC maintained Hgb from baseline to EoT, and the primary efficacy end point of the mean change in Hgb from baseline to EoT favored FPC by 0.4 g/dL (P &#x0003c; 0.001). This observed magnitude of difference in Hgb concentrations between the two groups was constrained by the study design, which limited changes in Hgb in all patients to within predefined safe upper and lower limits. Since the ESA dose was clamped and iron supplementation was prohibited during the randomized treatment stage, the CRUISE study design allowed completion of the randomized treatment stage and transition to the open-label stage if a patient required a protocol-mandated change in anemia management (Hgb &#x0003c; 9.0 or &#x0003e;12 g/dL or ferritin &#x0003c;100 &#x000b5;g/L).</p><p>The study population was iron-replete at the time of enrollment as reflected by an average serum ferritin level of about 500 &#x000b5;g/L. In hemodialysis patients, serum ferritin concentrations reflect the magnitude of body iron stores and the effects of chronic inflammation secondary to renal failure. Because neither group had evidence of significant changes in inflammation based on lack of significant change in CRP during the course of the study, changes in serum ferritin most likely reflected changes in body iron stores. The placebo group experienced decline in serum ferritin due to depletion of iron stores, as a consequence of ongoing uremic- and hemodialysis-associated losses. FPC generally conserved serum ferritin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GFV277F2">2</xref>b), indicating that FPC effectively replaced the uremic and gastrointestinal losses that average about 5&#x02212;7 mg iron per hemodialysis treatment. Fewer FPC-treated patients than placebo-treated patients required a protocol-mandated change in anemia management for a serum ferritin &#x0003c;100 &#x000b5;g/L (3 versus 13% respectively, P &#x0003c; 0.001; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ndt/gfv277/-/DC1">Supplementary data, Table S2</ext-link>), indicating that, in actual clinical practice, only a small proportion of patients receiving FPC are likely to experience iron losses that exceed the supply from FPC-iron and will require occasional additional supplementation with IV iron. Notably, with regular administration of FPC, the average serum ferritin level did not exceed baseline values, demonstrating that patients did not develop iron overload. Therefore, maintenance of iron therapy using FPC prevents depletion of iron stores, without causing iron overload, in iron-replete hemodialysis patients.</p><p>The intradialytic increase in serum iron and concomitant decrease in UIBC (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GFV277F3">3</xref>) indicate uptake of FPC-iron by available binding sites on transferrin. The substantial elevation in TSAT during dialysis indicates a greatly increased proportion of diferric transferrin. Diferric transferrin transports twice as much iron as the monoferric form and has a higher affinity for the transferrin receptor, thereby enhancing the efficiency of iron delivery to erythroid precursors [<xref rid="GFV277C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The FPC-iron bound to transferrin is cleared rapidly from the circulation, with TSAT returning to baseline by the next dialysis [<xref rid="GFV277C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This is in contrast to IV iron, which is approved for periodic repletion of iron stores in iron-deficient hemodialysis patients. Intravenous iron in 50&#x02212;100 mg doses is often infused over a few minutes, generating non-transferrin-bound iron, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction [<xref rid="GFV277C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="GFV277C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>TEAEs, including serious TEAEs, were similar in the groups (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ndt.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ndt/gfv277/-/DC1">Supplementary data, Table S7</ext-link>) and were consistent with those anticipated in CKD-5HD patients. Measurement of indicators of inflammation (CRP) and nutrition (albumin, transferrin) showed no significant changes in the FPC group. The numerical imbalance in the number of deaths in the FPC and placebo groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="GFV277F1">1</xref>) is likely secondary to a relatively small sample size since the mortality rate for FPC (6.5 deaths/100 patient-years of exposure [PYE]) in the pooled phase 2 and 3 studies (&#x0003e;1400 patients, representing 780 patient-years of exposure) is similar to the placebo rate (7.2/100 PYE) from recent controlled studies [<xref rid="GFV277C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Neither anaphylaxis nor an increase in the frequency or severity of IDH was observed with FPC. Other IV iron complexes have been rarely associated with hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid reaction and angioedema, which may be associated with the carbohydrate moiety [<xref rid="GFV277C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. FPC is a carbohydrate-free iron salt, which may account for the lack of anaphylactic reactions to date.</p><p>Although demonstrating that FPC-iron administered via dialysate is able to maintain Hgb concentration, our studies have limitations. Our data may not be generalizable to all types of patients on maintenance hemodialysis. For example, patients with larger blood losses may develop iron deficiency and require supplemental administration of IV iron for repletion of stores. Furthermore, this study did not reflect current clinical practice, which is characterized by frequent ESA dose adjustments and supplemental IV iron to maintain Hgb. These changes had to be prohibited in this study to isolate the effects of FPC on Hgb and demonstrate that the placebo group could develop iron-restricted erythropoiesis while FPC maintained Hgb concentrations.</p><p>In conclusion, our studies demonstrate that regular administration of FPC during hemodialysis by addition to the hemodialysis solution is well tolerated and effectively replaces ongoing dialytic and uremic iron losses, thereby maintaining iron balance and Hgb concentration.
