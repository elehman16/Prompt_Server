CWP has been defined as the presence of pain in the right and left side of the body, above and below the waist combined with axial pain, lasting for at least three months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The prevalence of CWP in the general populations has been estimated to be between 3&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and 9&#x000a0;% among men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and between 6.5&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and 16&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] among women. CWP has been shown to be associated with being older, being an immigrant, being in a lower socio-economic class, having a lower educational level and having a family history of chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A subcategory of patients with CWP who have more severe symptoms fulfils the criteria of fibromyalgia (FM).</p><p>Substantial fatigue is common among patients with CWP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], and fatigue has been found to be associated with pain, psychological distress, limited physical performance and decreased working capacity in patients with chronic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Fatigue, pain and sleep disturbances in men with FM tend to be higher than those in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] but lower than those in women with FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Aberrations in the physiological pain-processing mechanism, such as central sensitisation, interact with psychological and environmental factors in the development and maintenance of pain and tenderness in CWP and FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. There is limited knowledge on the cause of fatigue in patients with CWP and FM; however, it has been suggested that their fatigue could be partly explained by central sensitisation as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The symptoms associated with CWP and FM can be controlled to some degree with pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Different types of exercise have been shown to have positive effects on several symptoms and the physical capacity of patients with FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In addition, exercise is commonly known to enhance general health, which facilitates coping with pain, fatigue and other common symptoms of FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However, patients with chronic pain associated with aberrations in the central pain mechanisms have shown a dysfunctional response to exercise in the form of increased general pain sensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Patients with FM have also been found to lack pain inhibition during muscle contractions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>Aerobic exercise, such as pool exercise or Nordic walking, has a positive impact on pain, global well-being and physical function in women with FM and CWP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Resistance exercise has been found to improve muscle strength, overall health and current pain intensity in a recent study of women with FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p>Most studies of patients with CWP concern female patients only or a mix where men are in the minority, and the knowledge regarding the effects of all types of exercise on men with CWP is insufficient, especially the impact of exercise on fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], which was the reason for initiating the present study.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of resistance exercise and pool exercise in temperate water on multidimensional fatigue, symptoms of depression and anxiety, isometric force, pain and health-related quality of life in men with CWP. The results of the present pilot study may be valuable for the planning of future exercise studies in men with CWP and FM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a parallel randomised controlled trial that aimed to compare the effects of a 12-week pool exercise programme in temperate water with a 12-week resistance exercise programme in men with CWP. Initially, the study plan was to recruit 20 patients to each group. Due to difficulties in recruitment, only 17 patients were recruited to each group. The authors therefore decided to continue the study as a pilot study.</p><p>The primary outcome was fatigue, which was assessed in multiple dimensions with the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). The secondary outcomes were symptoms of anxiety and depression and isometric forces of shoulder abduction, knee extension, knee flexion and hand grip. The exploratory outcomes were pain intensity, the number of pain localisations and health-related quality of life. The outcomes were assessed at the study start and after 12&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>The inclusion criteria were male patients, aged 18 to 60&#x000a0;years, with CWP according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients who had experienced widespread pain for at least three months were classified as having CWP. The exclusion criteria were the inability to understand Swedish; severe psychiatric or somatic disorders, such as other rheumatic diseases, neurologic conditions, cancer, clinically confirmed depression or panic disorder; or having participated in resistance exercise or pool exercise at a physical therapy clinic during the preceding six months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Recruitment</title><p>The patients were recruited in a municipality of approximately 50 000 inhabitants in western Sweden from five primary health care centres that covered the whole municipality. Men with the diagnoses of unspecific pain or FM between 2005 and 2007 were identified by searching all patient records in the five primary health care centres and were consecutively recruited in 2008.</p><p>A total of 493 subjects in the patient records had a diagnosis of unspecific pain or FM and were thus contacted by mail with information about the randomised trial. Seventy-four of these patients replied by telephone or e-mail. Further telephone screening resulted in the exclusion of 37 patients because they did not meet the inclusion criteria (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;33) or refrained from participating (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4).</p><p>The remaining 37 patients and two additional patients with FM who were recruited consecutively were invited to the examination for the study. Five of these 39 patients were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria or refrained from participating (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Participants&#x02019; flow</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13102_2016_54_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>
</p><p>Thirty-four patients were allocated by block randomisation to one of the two intervention group programmes. A statistician prepared sequentially numbered sealed envelopes and created the allocation sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A person who was not involved in the examinations opened the envelopes and informed the patient about the treatment group to which he had been randomised. The final number of patients included in the randomised trial was 34, with 17 in the pool exercise group and 17 in the resistance exercise group (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

<italic>The pool exercise programme</italic> comprised 50-min sessions in groups of six to eight patients twice a week for a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks in 33&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C water, supervised by a physiotherapist. The session included aerobic exercise for endurance, strength, flexibility, coordination and relaxation.</p><p>The patients were instructed to exercise at their own rhythm and to modify the exercises individually with respect to thresholds of pain and fatigue. During the 12-week study period, they were encouraged to increase intensity and resistance with or without water equipment. The intensity during the pool exercise session was assessed with the rate of perceived exertion (RPE, 6&#x02013;20) on the Borg&#x02019;s scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] on two occasions at intervention weeks 8 and 11.</p><p>
<italic>The resistance exercise programme</italic> was performed twice a week for 12&#x000a0;weeks with free weights and resistance machines in groups of approximately eight to ten patients, supervised by a physiotherapist.</p><p>The session lasted approximately one hour and included exercise for all four limbs and the back and trunk using dynamic exercises with eccentric, concentric and isometric muscle actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>A standardised protocol for resistance progress was applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].

No difference was found for change in fatigue between the groups. MFI general fatigue decreased significantly over time within the resistance exercise group, and a tendency towards improvement in MFI general fatigue was found in the pool exercise group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.051). Physical fatigue and reduced motivation were significantly improved over time in the pool exercise group, which is in line with previous studies where the MFI-20 reduced motivation subscale has improved in groups engaging in aerobic exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>The resistance exercise group improved in isometric forces of right arm shoulder abduction and knee flexion in both legs of men with CWP compared with the pool exercise group. The mean values of isometric force of the right arm shoulder abduction and knee flexion in both legs increased from baseline to post-test between 21&#x000a0;% and 34&#x000a0;% in the resistance exercise group. This result is similar to the expected improvement in resistance exercise in untrained and moderately trained healthy individuals; that is, an improvement in muscle strength of approximately 40&#x000a0;% and 20&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>].</p><p>HADS-A and the physical component summary of the SF-36 improved significantly over time within the pool exercise group. The decrease in HADS-A agrees with a previous study where anxiety improved after a 20-week pool exercise programme in female patients with FM and CWP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The mean difference in the SF-36 PCS between baseline and the 12-week examination was 4.3 (SD 6.1), which has been suggested to be a clinically relevant increase in chronic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>].</p><p>No significant change in pain intensity during the intervention period was found, but both groups showed significantly fewer pain localisations after 12&#x000a0;weeks of exercise, which indicates an improvement in pain regardless of the type of exercise. Previous research has shown that the distribution of widespread pain tended to decrease over a period of 11&#x000a0;years in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. However, because the time between examinations in the present study was only 12&#x000a0;weeks, the results indicate that both pool exercise and resistance exercise probably contributed to the decrease in pain spread. The pool exercise programme followed the design of a previous study of women with CWP and FM that showed a within-group improvement in multiple dimensions of fatigue and between-group improvement in MFI reduced motivation and other health-related aspects after a 20-week pool exercise period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The programme provided the possibility to individually adjust the exercise to perceived pain and fatigue, and the patients appeared to increase their self-rated exertion during the 12-week study period.</p><p>The resistance exercise programme was designed in line with programmes in previous studies of resistance exercise in women with FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and according to recommendations for resistance exercise in healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The present study included resistance exercises with free weights and machines, which are both considered to be effective for increasing strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. All of the patients in the resistance exercise group did not manage to progress in their exercise according to the recommended standardised protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] due to pain and soreness during and after exercise. However, no patient in the resistance exercise group dropped out of the study programme due to exercise-induced pain. Despite the small sample size and difficulties in increasing the exercise load for a few patients in the resistance exercise group, the present study showed significant improvements in strength, in line with previous studies of resistance exercise in women with fibromyalgia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Light loads that can be lifted approximately 15&#x02013;25 repetitions have also been shown to increase strength in moderately trained healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Measures of isometric force are standardised, and higher values of isometric force in the back, legs and hand grip have been shown to be significantly associated with higher global health status and lower psychological distress in patients with FM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>].</p><p>There is a scarcity of studies investigating the effects of treatments on men with CWP. Thus, there are no recommendations regarding choice of exercise for men with CWP, which was the reason for conducting the present pilot study. The results of the present study can be used for the determination of sample size in future studies of men with CWP.</p><sec id="Sec36"><title>Limitations</title><p>The present study was designed for 20 patients in each group, and due to difficulties with recruitment and drop-outs, only 15 versus 12 patients were analysed at the 12-week examination. This increases the risk of type 2 error because the groups in the present study might not have been sufficiently large to be able to find significant differences between the groups in terms of the change in fatigue.</p><p>Although the randomisation was performed according to protocol, the resistance exercise group showed significantly lower mental aspects of health-related quality of life and also a tendency towards higher pain intensity at baseline than the pool exercise group. This discrepancy might have caused unequal possibilities for improvement in the two groups but in favour of the pool exercise group because women with FM and CWP who have lower levels of pain intensity and psychological distress have been suggested to improve more by exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The eight patients who dropped out appeared to report more severe fatigue and pain intensity, which might make the results less representative for patients with more severe symptoms. However, only one of the eight reported increased pain to be the reason for discontinuing the intervention. The participants in the present study were recruited by mail with information about the study. This recruitment method could have attracted persons with a positive attitude towards exercise, which might have influenced the magnitude of improvement as well as the compliance to the exercise programme. The same recruitment method was used for both groups; thus, the recruitment method would not have affected the outcome in the group comparisons.</p><p>Another limitation of the study is that one of the authors supervised the exercise sessions. However, the conditions were equal in the two groups because the same author supervised both groups. When the data were analysed, the identities of the patients were coded, which minimised the risk that the author&#x02019;s possible pre-understanding would affect the interpretations of the results.</p><p>Several outcomes were included in the study as we were interested in different aspects of health. The subscales of the MFI-20 were the primary outcomes and were analysed first, followed by the secondary and exploratory outcomes. Many comparisons were carried out in the present study, and the calculation of the upper limit of the expected number of false significances indicated that one of the three significant differences in change between the groups could be false; therefore, the significance levels found should be interpreted with caution.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To conclude, there were no differences between the resistance exercise programme and the pool exercise programme in fatigue; however, both groups appeared to improve in different dimensions of fatigue. The resistance exercise programme improved isometric strength compared with the pool exercise programme. The present study is a pilot study, and the results could be of guidance in the design of future studies with a larger sample, including a control group, which is needed to establish whether exercise decreases fatigue in men with CWP.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ACR</term><def><p>American college of rheumatology</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CWP</term><def><p>Chronic widespread pain</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FIQ</term><def><p>Fibromyalgia impact questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FM</term><def><p>Fibromyalgia</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS</term><def><p>Hospital anxiety and depression scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS-A</term><def><p>Hospital Anxiety and depression scale, subscale of anxiety</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HADS-D</term><def><p>Hospital anxiety and depression scale, subscale of depression</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MCS</term><def><p>Mental component summary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MFI/MFI-20</term><def><p>Multidimensional fatigue inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PCS</term><def><p>Physical component summary</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PE</term><def><p>Pool exercise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RE</term><def><p>Resistance exercise</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RM</term><def><p>Repetition maximum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RPE</term><def><p>Rating of perceived exertion</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Standard deviation</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-36</term><def><p>Short form-36</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all of our colleagues at the Rosenh&#x000e4;ll physiotherapy unit, primary health care, Uddevalla, especially Elisabeth Enh&#x000f6;rning and Mats Nolkrantz for performing the examinations in the study as well as Rebecca Kantola and Mikaela Andersson for administration.
