This discipline includes a diverse set of approaches used for prevention and treatment of many diseases.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Several benefits of CAM have been proven, and it may be considered an effective modality for disease prevention, treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and for improving the quality of life (QOL) of individuals with chronic medical conditions.<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Many patients who may not be satisfied with the outcomes of modern medicine, particularly those with chronic diseases, may be satisfied with the outcomes of CAM.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Pain is the most common reason for seeking therapeutic alternatives of conventional medicine. Cupping, wet or dry, is an ancient treatment, which was broadly utilized in several communities, and it was recommended by the Islamic society.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Wet cupping (Hijama) is an old medical technique, which has been broadly applied for treatment of numerous conditions, such as acute/chronic inflammation, communicable diseases, and the immune system diseases.<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Nowadays, the interest in conventional cupping has been escalated with the increasing evidence that it may be effective in decreasing different types of pain. In cupping, a glass cup is used to create suction over a painful part, after making skin incisions. It has been postulated that suction of the &#x0201c;congested&#x0201d; blood out of the skin will improve both lymphatic and blood circulation, hence relieve pain.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Cupping has been used for the treatment and cure of a wide range of conditions, such as hematological disorders, rheumatic conditions, arthritis, sciatica, and back pain. It can be also used for anxiety, and other physical and mental conditions.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Furthermore, cupping may be effective for migraine, tension headaches,<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> post-herpetic pain,<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and other clinical conditions. Kim et al<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> conducted a systematic review on the use of cupping for treating pain and reported that the rate of using alternative therapies increased with increasing the pain severity.<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Furthermore, Farhadi et al<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reported that compared with the standard care, cupping therapy significantly decreased pain, functional disability, and the use of pain medications within 3 months after treatment of their patients with low back pain. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) refers to the perceptions of wellbeing, well-functioning, life satisfaction, and being healthy. Nowadays, HRQOL has been increasingly utilized as a parameter for evaluation of various treatment outcomes.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Despite the growing evidence of the effects of wet cupping in many diseases, few intervention studies were carried out on its effect on chronic medical conditions. These researches were carried out on small samples and mainly addressed the non-specific pain.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> No adequate interventional studies has been conducted to assess the effects of wet cupping on different chronic medical conditions in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). Similarly, no interventional study has described the effects of wet cupping on the HRQOL of patients with chronic medical conditions. There are unanswered questions about such areas of cupping research. So, a comprehensive intervention epidemiological study is therefore warranted to evaluate the effects of wet cupping on such patients, particularly its effect on their HRQOL. The objective of the current study was to assess the effects of wet cupping on the HRQOL of patients with chronic medical conditions who were referred to the cupping clinic from different specialty clinics at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH), Jeddah, KSA.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>The study was carried out according to the ethical principles of Helsinki Declaration.

The HRQOL was assessed using the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). The WHOQOL-BREF instrument contains 26 questions; 2 general questions and 24 items used to assess the 4 HRQOL domains. Those domains are the physical health, the psychological health, the social relationships, and the environmental domains. The internal consistency reliability of WHOQOL-BREF and its 4 domains ranged from 0.66-0.92.

The patient took a sitting position or lying position according to the affected site fully exploring the positions for bloodletting. The local hair of the patient was cut-off and then cupping was applied to the related points for 5-10 minutes. The physician wore sterilized gloves and a face mask. A mono-use surgical blade was used to superficially cut the skin (inside each of the cupping marks for about 10 cuts). The patients&#x02019; pain diagram and physical examination were used to identify the painful areas and the big geloses of the sub-skin.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> After the cup was removed, the mouth and internal wall of the cup were sterilized with 75% alcohol. Cupping was performed again at the local parts, with blood drawn into the cup.

However, their results included a small pilot sample.</p><p>Patients with headache who received cupping intervention in the current study reported significantly better scores of most of HRQOL domains after cupping, especially the physical domain. These results agrees with the findings of Ahmadi et al.<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Furthermore, Teut et al<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> conducted a randomized controlled, exploratory pilot study to investigate the effectiveness of cupping therapy among 21 patients with pain of knee osteoarthritis. Their results showed significantly better component scores of the short form 36 of the physical domain in the cupping group than for the control group. In the current study, the score of the physical domain of HRQOL improved after cupping among patients with osteoarthritis pain, but without statistical significant difference. On the other hand, our study showed significant improvement in HRQOL scores of patients with chronic joint pain in general.</p><p>The current controlled quasi-experimental intervention study succeeded in improving the HRQOL of patients with chronic medical conductions referred to the cupping clinics compared with before performing it, and compared with the control group. The external validity of the current quasi-experimental clinical trial is considered good due to its large sample size (compared with other studies), fair length of follow-up, the university hospital setting, and involving many types of chronic medical conditions.</p><p>The findings of our trial responded to the study&#x02019;s research objectives. This study has a programmatic and policy implication of the need to apply wet cupping as a complementary treatment, for treatment of clinical medical conditions, especially pain in the university hospitals. The implications of our findings for future research are based on the need to conduct big randomized clinical trials to assess HRQOL for patients with each chronic medical conditions, separately. The number of cupping sessions can be increased and the follow period can become longer. The limitation of the study is that there was no randomization. The main barrier of the study was the presence of a large number of referred patients to the clinic.</p><p>In conclusion, pain was the most common cause of referral to the Cupping Clinic. Wet cupping (Hijama) intervention improved most of the HRQOL domains of the adult patients with chronic medical conditions. Improvements were present after one month of intervention compared with their baseline scores. After cupping, the mean scores of most of the HRQOL domains, especially the physical function domain, improved significantly among patients who complained from almost all types of pain (except osteoarthritis pain), and among those who complained from most of the chronic medical conditions (except the metabolic syndrome). Furthermore, cupping was more effective among women and non-smokers compared with others. Post-test findings showed presence of significant improvements in the scores of the physical and social HRQOL domains among patients who received cupping intervention compared with those in the control group who did not receive cupping. Finally, the study added that there are promising effects in favor of using wet cupping for improving HRQOL of patients with chronic conditions. Cupping is recommended to be used as a complementary treatment modality for chronic medical conditions, which agrees with recomendations from Hadith.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p><italic>The authors would like to thank Sheikh Yousef Abdul Latif Jameel Scientific Chair and all doctors, nurses, and co-workers at the Hijama Clinic, and special thanks to our colleagues Prof. Mohsen Abdul Elalah, Dr. Amal Obied, Dr. Anhar Gazzaz, Dr. Manal Dahalawi, Dr. Mohammad Al Farrah, Dr. Asmaa, Ms. Rasha Ramadan, Ms. Zakia, Ms. Sabreen, Ms. Zahra, Mr. Mohammad Jumaah, Ms. Reham, Ms. Susana de Guzman, and Mr. Kelvin from King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</italic>.</p><p>This study was funded by Sheikh Yousef Abdul Latif Jameel Prophetic Medicine Scientific Chair, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Grant No. MBK/5/437).</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>
