tibialis posterior, flexor digitorum longus, and peroneus longus during gait with
orthoses. [Subjects and Methods] Sixteen healthy males participated in this study.
Activity of each muscle was measured by using fine-wire and surface electromyography. Gait
task was performed by the participants barefoot, with footwear and with orthoses. The
electromyography data from a stance phase of each gait trial were used for analysis. The
stance phase was divided into contact, midstance, and propulsion phases. The data from ten
participants were extracted for final analysis, as electromyography measurements were
unsuccessful for the other six. [Results] The results demonstrated that orthoses
significantly reduced the tibialis posterior muscle activity in the propulsion phase
compared to that in the barefoot condition. Although there was a significant difference in
the midstance phase, post hoc analysis did not indicate significant differences among the
phases. No significant electromyography amplitude change was detected in flexor digitorum
longus and peroneus longus. [Conclusion] Orthothes reduced the tibialis posterior activity
level during gait. This result may be beneficial for patients with injuries related to
excessive activity of tibialis posterior.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Tibialis posterior</kwd><kwd>Flexor digitorum longus</kwd><kwd>Insole</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Foot orthoses is often used to correct the foot alignment for the treatment or prevention
of the injuries and for performance enhancement. Clinically, patients who have foot as well
as knee and hip joint problems use foot orthoses to alleviate symptoms. In sports, foot
orthoses is sometimes prescribed for improving propulsion force transmission, absorbing
ground reaction force, and increasing or decreasing muscle activity level. The effect of
orthoses has been researched and recent systematic review regarding orthoses reported that
kinematic, shock attenuation, and neuromuscular paradigms are the main effects of
orthoses<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, kinematic
changes led by orthotic use have been reported in numerous studies. These studies described
that foot eversion angle and moment are reduced by orthoses<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, the
number of studies reporting the effect of orthoses on neuromuscular paradigms has been
increasing.</p><p>Posterior calf muscles are fundamental in producing propulsion force during walking.
Tibiails posterior (TP), peroneus longus (PL) and flexor digitorum longus (FDL) produce a
torque toward plantar flexion, which functions as propulsion force during walking. In
addition to this, these muscles control foot pronation or supination and maintain the arches
of the foot<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. These functions can change
the foot rigidity and flexibility that adapt the mechanical demands on the foot. Orthoses
are considered to compensate the function of the calf muscles and alter the muscle activity
pattern. Several studies researched the effect of the orthoses on the TP, PL, and
gastrocnemius muscle<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of those
studies showed that the muscle activity level of TP decreased, while the PL demonstrated
increased muscle activity level during walking. However, no study has researched the effect
of orthoses on the muscle activity level of the TP, PL, and FDL simultaneously.</p><p>Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the TP, FDL, and PL muscle activity
change resulting from orthotic insertion during the walking stance phase by using a
fine-wire and a surface electromyography (EMG). Moreover, stance phase was divided into
three phases and muscle activity alteration of each muscle was analyzed in each phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Sixteen healthy male students (age: 24 &#x000b1; 4.9&#x02005;years, height: 168.4 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x02005;cm, and weight:
60.9 &#x000b1; 7.8&#x02005;kg) participated in this study. Participants who had injuries or surgical
intervention for the lower extremities in the past year or had a neurological problem were
excluded. All participants provided written informed consent prior to participation. The
Ethical Committee of Waseda University approved this experiment in accordance with the
Helsinki Declaration (Ethics ID: 2015-010).</p><p>Bipolar fine-wire intramuscular electrodes (Unique medical Co., Ltd., Japan) were employed
for measurement of TP and FDL muscle activity. All electrodes and needles were sterilized in
an autoclave prior to insertion. The fine-wire intramuscular electrodes were inserted into
the right TP muscle belly. During insertion, the tip of the needle and muscles were observed
by using an ultrasound system (LOGIQe, GE, USA). The posterior approach was employed for
insertion into the TP<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this manner,
the fine-wire intramuscular electrodes were also inserted into the right FDL. Accurate
insertion into TP and FDL was checked with the muscle activity level during active foot
pronation, adduction, and plantar flexion for the TP and toe flexion for the FDL. If the EMG
amplitude did not appear for each motion, it was defined as failed insertion and excluded
from the data. For the PL measurement, surface electrodes (BlueSensor N-00-S, METS Co.,
Japan) were placed on the muscle belly of the right PL. The skin was rubbed with an abrasive
and alcohol to decrease skin impedance. A wireless EMG telemeter system (BioLog DL-5000,
S&#x00026;ME Co., Japan) was used to measure both fine-wire and surface EMGs.</p><p>Gait tasks were performed under three conditions: (1) barefoot, (2) with footwear, and (3)
with footwear plus orthoses (orthoses). All participants wore the same type of footwear
(Calcetto Le3, Asics, Japan) and prefabricated orthoses (Athlete grip7, Winning One Inc.,
Japan). Prefabricated orthoses was employed in this study because it is more clinically
meaningful if easy and low cost prefabricated orthoses can change the muscle activity
pattern of the calf muscles. The upper layer of the prefabricated insole was made of poly
microsuede and the base material was ethyl vinyl acetate. The orthoses had three arch
supports for the medial longitudinal, lateral longitudinal, and transverse arches. These
arch supports functioned to prevent from lowering the arches. Especially medial longitudinal
arch support was expected to control excessive foot pronation.</p><p>A force plate (Kistler instrument AG, Switzerland) was placed on the middle of the walkway.
The force plate and EMG system were synchronized for simultaneous data collection. In each
condition, participants were instructed to walk at comfortable speed on the walkway and step
on the force plate with the right foot during gait trials. Prior to measurement, sufficient
practice was allowed for the participants to become familiarized with the task. The
measurements were implemented until three successful trials were recorded. Maximum voluntary
isometric contractions (MVICs) for TP, PL, and FDL were measured after completing the gait
tasks in each condition. All MVIC measurements were performed in a sitting position. Over
five seconds of MVICs were measured for each muscle. One-second periods of time, including
the maximum root mean square (RMS) from the entire MVICs data, were recorded and used as the
MVIC values for each muscle.</p><p>One stance phase per gait trial, which was defined from the force plate data, was selected
to analyze the muscle activity level of each muscle. When the vertical ground force exceeded
more than 10 N, the time frame was defined as heel contact. In the same manner, when the
vertical ground reaction force decreased less than 10 N, the time frame was defined as toe
off. In addition, the stance phase was further divided into contact, midstance, and
propulsion phases. The anterior-posterior force value from the force plate data was used to
define these phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Definition of the phases based on the anterior-posterior force data during stance
phase&#x0ff0e;The contact phase was defined from the beginning of the stance phase to the
negative peak value. The midstance phase was defined from the negative peak value to
the zero value. The propulsion phase was defined from the zero value to the end of the
stance phase.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-28-3458-g001"/></fig>). The contact phase was defined from heel contact to the negative peak value of the
anterior-posterior force. The midstance was defined from the negative peak value to the time
frame when the anterior-posterior force value reached zero. The propulsion phase extended
from zero value of the anterior-posterior force to toe off. The sampling rate of EMG and the
force plate data was 1,000&#x02005;Hz. Raw EMG signals were analyzed with software (BIMUTAS-Video,
Kissei Comtec Co., Ltd., Japan). The EMG data were rectified, high-pass filtered at 20&#x02005;Hz,
and low-pass filtered at 500&#x02005;Hz to remove motion artifacts. Data from the gait tasks was
normalized with MVIC values, using a RMS value presenting as % MVIC. The % MVIC values from
one stance phase from each trial and task were averaged and used for statistical
analysis.</p><p>In order to confirm the normal distribution of EMG data, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was
employed. Because all data had a normal distribution, one-way repeated measure ANOVAs was
conducted to compare the muscle activity level of each muscle in the three conditions during
each phase. If Mauchley&#x02019;s test detected a violation of the assumption for sphericity, the
<italic>F</italic>-ratio was determined from the Greenhouse-Geisser epsilon. Bonferroni
post hoc analysis was used if one-way repeated measures ANOVAs detected significant
differences. Partial eta squared was employed to calculate the effect size (ES). Alpha level
was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Because of the EMG measurement failure for TP and FDL, the total number of participants

The % MVIC of the FDL and PL showed that there were no statistical differences

amplitude change of TP, PL, and FDL simultaneously during gait. The current study revealed
that the orthoses significantly reduced muscle activity level of TP in midstance and
propulsion phases during gait. In contrast, muscle activity level of the PL and FDL remained
the same for all conditions in each phase.</p><p>The muscle activity pattern of TP during gait displayed a biphasic EMG waveform. This
waveform is similar to previous studies<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. The function of TP during gait is to prevent excessive foot
pronation during the contact phase and to increase the stiffness of foot during the
propulsion phase<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the medial longitudinal arch is maintained by TP
during weight bearing activities<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Owing
to the relative distance between the axes of the subtalar joint and TP tendon, TP functions
as the strongest supinator muscle of the hindfoot<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Foot supination in the propulsion
phase is fundamental in increasing rigidity of the foot, a function known as midtarsal
locking mechanism that has an advantage of improving force transmission efficiency<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Considering this reduction of the muscle
activity level of TP in the propulsion phase with orthoses, the rearfoot might be
stabilized, and the function of TP, which increase the stiffness of the foot, can be
compensated by the orthoses. However, this result is inconsistent with a previous study. The
results of the previous study reported that a significant reduction in the RMS amplitude of
TP was found during the contact phase of gait with prefabricated and customized foot
orthoses compared to shoes only condition<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the previous study, there were no significant differences in RMS
amplitude during midstance/propulsion phase among the conditions. Because the previous study
divided the contact phase into 2 phases; contact phase and midstance/propulsion phase based
on the EMG pattern, number of phases and hence the definition of phases are different from
the current study. These differences might have led to the inconsistent results. Although
the phase where the reduction of TP muscle activity found was different, orthoses can
decrease the muscle activity level of TP while walking.</p><p>PL generates eversion torque to the subtalar joint<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Contraction of PL during gait results in decreased foot rigidity
and increased energy dissipation rate<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These mechanisms are antagonistic in function with TP and are important for shock
attenuation. The effect of orthoses on PL activity has been described by several
studies<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results of these previous
studies were diverse. Two studies showed that significantly higher muscle activity level was
observed with orthoses<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, a previous study reported that muscle activity
level of the PL did not alter<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Significant increase of the PL muscle activity level was considered due to laterally
unstable conditions caused by posting. In order to stabilize the subtalar joint against the
tilting, the PL needs further contraction. In the current study, no wedge was added to the
orthoses. This may influence the result that orthoses did not affect the muscle activity
level of PL.</p><p>The muscle activity of FDL also showed no difference in the three conditions in all phases.
Because no previous study assessed the FDL activity change with orthoses, the results cannot
be compared to those of other researches. In normal gait, the FDL contracts from midstance
to toe off during gait<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similar to TP,
FDL isometrically contracts to maintain the height of the longitudinal arch of the foot
thereby improving the propulsion force transmission efficacy<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although orthoses might be able to support medial and lateral
longitudinal arches as well as transverse arch, it might not be sufficient to support arches
and compensate for the activity of FDL.</p><p>Clinically, the reduction of the muscle activity level of TP might be beneficial for some
injuries. The traction force applied to the medial distal tibia is one of the mechanisms
resulting in medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). Recent studies demonstrated that TP does
not have direct insertion into the symptomatic location of the medial distal tibia<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, the TP, FDL, and soleus muscles are
responsible for generating the traction force on the medial distal tibia via the crural
fascia<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, the reduction
of TP muscle activity with orthoses can be beneficial for patients who have MTSS.</p><p>The small number of subjects is the limitation of this study. The sample size decreased due
to technical errors in measuring the fine-wire EMG. Precise insertion of the electrodes into
the muscle belly of TP and FDL is technically challenging and must be carefully performed to
avoid damaging these structures<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Additionally, muscle contraction of the calf muscles pulls out the wires even when the tips
are properly inserted. More stable and accurate insertion technique should be considered for
future studies.</p><p>In summary, the current study assessed the muscle activity change of the TP, FDL, and PL in
three conditions, barefoot, footwear, and orthoses, during gait. Gait with orthoses
exhibited significantly less TP muscle activity than that in the barefoot condition. This
significant difference was found in midstance and propulsion phases. PL and FDL had no
significant muscle activity changes in the three conditions in all phases. Reduction of TP
muscle activity might be beneficial for patients who have excessive TP contraction related
