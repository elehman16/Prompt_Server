Introduction</title><p>Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is an acute major complication that follows the intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents (<xref rid="b1-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). CIN is defined as an absolute increase of 0.3 mg/dL in serum creatinine within 48 hours of exposure to the contrast agents (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b3-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It is the third leading cause of acute renal failure in hospitalized patients, and its occurrence is accompanied by a significant increase in mortality, longer hospitalization, and accelerated progression to end stage renal disease (ESRD) (<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b5-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The incidence of CIN is estimated to be in the range of 10 to 15%; however, it also has been reported to be as high as 50% in patients with cardiovascular risk factors (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b6-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). To date, several methods have been proposed to prevent CIN, including hydration with normal saline or sodium bicarbonate; the use of drugs, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vitamin C, theophylline, and acetazolamide; and the administration of iso-osmolar contrast agents (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b7-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="b8-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). However, there is still uncertainty regarding the best approach for preventing CIN, and research is ongoing to identify better modalities. In recent years, a comparatively new, non-pharmacological method has been proposed for the prevention of CIN following coronary angiography (<xref rid="b9-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The method is called remote ischemic pre-conditioning (RIPC), and it produces a protective effect on tissue and organs by creating short, consecutive cycles of ischemia and reperfusion. Its beneficial effect may result from the release of humoral factors, such as adenosine or bradykinin, into the bloodstream or to its anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidant effects (<xref rid="b9-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b10-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The initial results have shown that this method can be effective in reducing the incidence of CIN by 15&#x02013;30%; however, due to the small number of studies in this field, it still cannot be recommended for general, routine use. (<xref rid="b9-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of RIPC intervention on the incidence of CIN in the first 48 hours following coronary angiography and/or angioplasty.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Material and Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>This double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted in 2014 on patients who were referred to the Cardiology Department at Imam Reza University Hospital in Mashhad, Iran. Specifically, the patients selected for the study were those who had been diagnosed with chronic stable angina or non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE.ACS) and were candidates for coronary angiography and/or angioplasty. CONSORT statement flow diagram is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-epj-07-1557">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>2.2. Sampling</title><p>Among patients described in the Study Design, we included those who had a risk score &#x02265; 6 based on Mehran et al. study (<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). We excluded patients who had cardiogenic shock, had ST elevation myocardial Infarction (STEMI), had a kidney transplant, or required dialysis. We also excluded patients who had undergone an imaging study with contrast agents during the week before the study or who had experienced bleeding complications and lost 1 g per dL or more of hemoglobin. Those who could not tolerate an inflated cuff for five minutes were withdrawn from the study. The calculation of the required sample size was based on Fikert et al.&#x02019;s study (<xref rid="b15-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). According to the &#x0201c;comparison of two proportions&#x0201d; formula for determining the sample size and by assuming an alpha error of 5%, a study power of 80%, and a loss of 20%, we determined that 84 patients were required in each group. In order to ensure blinding and random allocation, all angiography candidates were included in a separate list by the head nurse of the unit who was blind to the study protocol. The patients were divided in one of the two groups by using numbered envelopes that contained information identifying one of the two methods of intervention. All of the patients who entered the catheterization laboratory received either RIPC intervention or a placebo (according to the group specified in the envelope), and then they underwent angiography and/or angioplasty by an interventional cardiologist. After the procedure, a cardiology resident who was also blind to the interventions collected the required data. After the data were entered into the software and the statistical analyses were performed, the group members were revealed by the interventional cardiologist in charge.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3. Interventions</title><p>All of the patients underwent hydration with normal saline at a rate of 1.5 cc per kg per hr for 3 to 12 hr before coronary angiography. The hydration with the saline was continued at the rate of 1.5 ml per kg per hr for 6 to 24 hr after the intervention. According to the aforementioned protocol, the patients were divided into two groups. In the intervention group with RIPC, a blood pressure cuff was fastened around the patient&#x02019;s arm an hour before coronary angiography, and it was inflated to 50 mmHg above systolic pressure for 5 min, and then the cuff was deflated for 5 min; this cycle was repeated four times. In the placebo group, a pressure cuff also was fastened around the patient&#x02019;s arm, and, despite repeated cycles by pressure gages, the pressure transferring wire was cut off from the cuff in order to prevent ischemia/reperfusion in this group of patients. The contrast agent Visipaque (TM320 mg/ml, GE Health Care, Ireland) was used for all of the patients. Before coronary angiography and/or angioplasty, none of the patients received nephrotoxic drugs, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aminoglycosides.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4. Baseline variables</title><p>Before the intervention, the demographic characteristics of all of the patients were recorded, including age; gender; history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart disease, and related health interventions; smoking; drug history, including aspirin, clopidogrel, statins, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and loop diuretics of recent use. The day before the angiography, baseline tests were performed for each patient, including hematocrit, hemoglobin, fasting blood sugar, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), serum creatinine, and calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation. If new diagnoses were made, such as anemia (hemoglobin &#x0003c; 13 g/dL or hematocrit &#x0003c; 39% for men and hemoglobin &#x0003c; 12 g/dL or hematocrit &#x0003c; 36% for women), diabetes mellitus(FBS &#x0003e; 126 mg/dL or HbA1c &#x0003e; 6.5%), or dyslipidemia (TGs &#x0003e; 150 mg/dL, LDL-c &#x0003e; 130 mg/dL, or HDL-c &#x0003c; 40 mg/dL for men and HDL-c &#x0003c; 50 mg/dL for women), they were recorded in the patients&#x02019; files. Transthoracic echocardiography also was performed for all of the patients before catheterization. The findings were recorded based on the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and diastolic function. Then, the intervention was conducted, and the amount of contrast agent used for each patient was recorded.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5. Outcomes</title><p>Serum creatinine, eGFR, CIN incidence, Mehran score, and the volume of saline infused within the 48 hr following the angiography were recorded for both groups. In this study, CIN was defined as an absolute increase in serum creatinine of 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hr of exposure to the contrast agent. The length of the hospital stay also was recorded for both groups.</p></sec><sec><title>2.6. Research ethics</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Mashhad University of Medical Sciences (Ref code: 920581), and a signed informed consent form was obtained from all participants prior to their participation in the study. The patients&#x02019; data were entered into the statistical software using a code, and they were published as a general conclusion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>2.7. Statistical analysis</title><p>The required data were collected using a designed checklist. SPSS ver. 16 was used for data analysis. The t-test was used for quantitative data, and the chi-squared test or its non-parametric equivalent was used for the qualitative variables. The significance level was set at P &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>3. Results</title><sec sec-type="intro"><title>3.1. Baseline characteristics</title><p>During the 18-month study period, 100 patients were studied who had stable angina or NSTE.ACS fulfilling the Mehran criteria for CIN and were candidates for coronary angiography or angioplasty. Out of these 100 patients, 52 patients who had a Mehran Risk Score greater than 6 were included in the study. Only one patient was excluded based on the exclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-epj-07-1557">Figure 1</xref>). In this study, 51 patients (30 females, 21 males) with a mean age of 68.7&#x000b1; 11.8 were divided into two groups, i.e., an intervention group (n = 25) and a control group (n = 26). The two groups were matched for age, gender, laboratory findings, Mehran rating, past medical history, echocardiography findings, and the volume of saline administered before and after coronary angiography (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-epj-07-1557">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-epj-07-1557">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>3.2.

Also, the eGFR levels were not meaningfully different during the same period of time (41.25 &#x000b1; 15.33 and 39.78 &#x000b1; 15.56, P = 0.73). The serum creatinine level was increased in both groups, but, again, the differences were not statistically significant (0.30 &#x000b1; 0.03 and 0.44 &#x000b1; 0.10, respectively, P = 0.20). The overall incidence of CIN in our study was 17.6% (nine patients); however, no statistically meaningful difference in CIN incidence was obtained between the two groups (RICP and Control: 12% and 23%, P = 0.30). The hospital stay was longer in the control group than in the intervention group, but the difference was not statistically significant (4.35 &#x000b1; 6.79 and 2.60 &#x000b1; 1.95 days, respectively, P = 0.64).</p></sec><sec><title>3.3.

Discussion</title><p>This study was performed to investigate whether RIPC intervention can reduce the incidence of acute CIN in the 48 hours after coronary angiography and/or angioplasty. In this clinical trial, the intervention and control groups were matched for underlying factors and Mehran&#x02019;s score. Also, there was no difference between the two groups in the use of drugs, mainly statins, ACE inhibitors, or ARBs, and injectable loop diuretics. Also, there was no difference in the cardiac function, which can have either a positive or negative impact on the incidence of CIN. Our results indicated a 17.6% incidence rate for CIN in the study population; this was higher than the rates reported by other studies, which indicated that the incidence of CIN in patients after undergoing coronary angiography is expected to be in the range of 10&#x02013;15% (<xref rid="b1-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b4-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="b6-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b16-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). The reason for the higher incidence of CIN in our study may be related to our inclusion criteria, a point that also was mentioned in Mehran et al.&#x02019;s study (<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In Mehran&#x02019;s study, the CIN incidence was reported to be as high as 57.3%, which was attributed to the presence of underlying risk factors (<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, the higher incidence of CIN seems reasonable according to the inclusion criterion of the study, i.e., a Mehran score higher than the average (&#x02265;6). The role of RIPC intervention in the incidence of CIN in high-risk patients, based on Mehran&#x02019;s rating system, was the primary outcome measure studied. Recent studies of patients who underwent coronary angiography with no STEMI have reported a 60% decrease in CIN incidence following RIPC (<xref rid="b6-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b8-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="b11-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="b12-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). However, there was a strikingly high incidence rate of CIN in such studies. This indicates that these studies evaluated the protective role of RIPC in patients with a higher risk of CIN, giving rise to the hypothesis that RIPC can be used to prevent CIN among higher risk groups. However, our results showed no significant difference in the incidence of CIN between the intervention and control groups, i.e., among the nine CIN cases diagnosed, six were controls and three were from the intervention group. However, we obtained a 10% lower incidence rate of CIN in the intervention group than in the control group. This difference might have been more significant in a larger population or in patients at higher risk for CIN, as was the case in previous studies. Nevertheless, it should be noted that the findings on the protective role of RIPC against the development of CIN are still insufficient, and further studies will be required to confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, in this study, no meaningful difference was found in the serum creatinine levels of the two groups after catheterization, a finding that is consistent with that of other studies. In a study by Igarashi et al., no significant differences in serum creatinine, eGFR, and other biomarkers associated with nephropathy, such as Cystatin C, and the L-FABP, were reported between the study and control groups before and after the intervention (<xref rid="b11-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, it seems that the current definition of CIN does not adequately include other biomarkers. Thus, for a closer look at RIPC&#x02019;s protective role in kidney damage, future studies should evaluate additional biomarkers, such as Cystatin C and L-FABP. However, the difference in time of calculation of CIN incidence can be another reason for the different results reported by various studies. In recent publications, such as Fikret et al. (<xref rid="b15-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) and Igarashi et al. (<xref rid="b11-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), the incidence of CIN was calculated in the short term and within the first 48 hours after angiography, while, in other studies, the incidence of CIN was measured within 30 days after angiography. Our results indicated that there was no significant difference in the amount of contrast agent that was received by the intervention and control groups with CIN; the mean volume of the contrast agent used was 62 ml in the affected group and 81 ml in the unaffected group. This indicates a high risk of the development of CIN in susceptible individuals, even with contrast volumes less than 100 ml; therefore, if either angiography or angioplasty is essential, the volume of contrast agent administered should be less than 50 ml. This can be achieved by using diluted contrast agents, bone markers, or other markers for the placement of balloons and stents, as well as using intra-vascular ultrasound studies. In general, the mean volume of saline administered before and after coronary angiography or angioplasty is 1 and 1.5 l, respectively, which are considerable amounts. Given that hydration currently is the most important and most effective strategy for preventing CIN, adequate hydration in our study population may have minimized the protective role of RIPC against the development of CIN. As was the case in other studies (<xref rid="b6-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="b9-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="b11-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), our patients did not experience any adverse complications or side effects related to RIPC.</p><p>CIN is a serious problem, and it is essential to anticipate and, if possible, prevent its progression. Several studies have shown that old age, renal dysfunction, and diabetes are the three main risk factors for CIN. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the incidence of CIN in relation to age, renal dysfunction, and diabetes. In a study performed on 16,592 patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), the incidence of CIN that required dialysis in was significantly higher in patients with basic renal dysfunction than in those without renal dysfunction (<xref rid="b17-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In addition, an inverse relationship was found between kidney function and the risk of CIN. Diabetes mellitus is another known risk factor for CIN as confirmed by many studies. Dangas et al. showed the rate of occurrence of CIN to be 15% in patients with diabetes and normal renal function (serum creatinine &#x0003c; 1.5 mg/dL or eGFR &#x0003e; 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 of the body&#x02019;s surface area) (<xref rid="b1-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Another study stated that diabetes is an independent risk factor in patients with normal renal function (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.55 and 95% CI: 1.26 &#x02013; 1.91)(<xref rid="b4-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, our results did not confirm the hypothesis that diabetes and chronic renal failure are associated with a greater incidence of CIN, because there was no significant difference in the incidence of CIN between our diabetic and non-diabetic patients. In addition, there was no difference in the incidence of CIN between the chronic kidney disease (CKD) group and the group of patients with normal renal function. This also applied to mild-to-severe cases of CKD. Even so, it is worth noting that, among all of the patients with severe CKD in the two groups, only two patients in the control group developed CIN; however, it is likely that, in the case of a larger sample size, the difference between the two groups would be significant, suggesting a protective role for RIPC in patients with severe CKD.</p><p>In our study, only one case (2% of the patients) required dialysis due to CIN, and this was similar to previous studies (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Given that there was no relationship between diabetes and the incidence of CIN in this study, as was the case in several previous studies, the duration of DM and the associated complications were associated strongly with the incidence of CIN (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b16-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In a prospective observational study that was performed recently, acute disrupted blood sugar level was reported as a risk factor for CIN (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b16-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, in our study, we only addressed the history of DM, and the duration of DM and the associated complications were not evaluated. It is considered likely that the evaluation of these factors would have led to a stronger association between diabetes and CIN.</p><p>Age is another risk factor that affects the incidence of CIN, and it has been discussed in several studies. This association may be related to the progression of renal failure with aging (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In fact, aging is associated to a greater extent with stenosis and vascular endothelial dysfunction than renal failure. However, this finding has not been confirmed in all related studies, and no relationship was found between age and the incidence of CIN in this study. This seems to be due to the simultaneous impact of age on the incidence of coronary artery-related disorders. The mean age of the patients in the study was 68.7 &#x000b1; 11.8 years, thus the age range was around 60 to 80 years, and no other patients were available in other age groups, so it was not actually possible to examine the effect of age on the incidence of CIN. Considering that there was no significant difference in the amount of saline infused into individuals with CIN and those without CIN, it is important to note that the average volume of saline infused before and after coronary angiography and angioplasty was about 1 and 1.5 l, respectively, which is a considerable amount; given that hydration is currently the most important and most effective strategy for the prevention of CIN, it is likely that the adequate hydration of the patients in our study minimized the effect of other factors, such as diabetes and CKD, on the incidence of CIN. The higher incidence of CIN in patients with a history of HF was addressed in this study; in this group of patients. Multivariate analysis introduced HF as the only independent predictor of CIN. Among HF patients who developed CIN, one had undergone RIPC, while three others were in the control group. The difference between the two groups may have been significant if the study population had been larger. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the Mehran score between the CIN and CIN-free groups; out of the nine patients with CIN, six had moderate Mehran scores, two had high Mehran scores, and one had a very high Mehran score. The Mehran score is not a good parameter for predicting the risk of CIN in patients with moderate to high risk. Moreover, proper hydration in our study may have minimized the effects of factors that could have interfered with the Mehran score; this should be confirmed in studies with a larger sample size. Another finding of this study was the relationship between the incidence of CIN and longer hospital stays; patients with CIN had a mean 8-day longer hospital stay than CIN-free patients, and this also was in agreement with the findings of other studies (<xref rid="b2-epj-07-1557" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Due to budget limitations of this research project, a smaller sample size and a shorter follow-up period were necessary. Also, other biomarkers associated with CIN were not investigated. Therefore, we highly recommend that additional studies be conducted to assess the protective role of RIPC in the development of CIN using a larger sample size and with a longer follow-up period and to evaluate other biomarkers.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>It seems that RIPC may have an additive protective role in high-risk patients, such as those with severe CKD or heart failure. However, regarding the favorable short-term and long-term effects reported by some studies and the simple, non-invasive technique without side effects or undue costs reported by other studies, the use of RIPC seems reasonable in patients who clinically are considered to be high risk patients for the administration of the contrast medium.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was the result of a thesis by Dr. Sayed Masoud Sadjadi for the fulfillment of the requirements for a specialty degree in Cardiology (thesis No. T-3069).
