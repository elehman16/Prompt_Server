Study Design: A randomized, triple-blind clinical trial was made using a split-mouth design. Both lower third molars of 10 patients were extracted and 3 mg of local melatonin or placebo were applied. Concentrations of interleukin-6 and nitrotyrosine were determined on samples of the clot from the socket by independent ELISA tests. Radiographic bone density was evaluated by measuring Hounsfield Units in panoramic and cross sections obtained by digital scanner. Statistycal analysis by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed for ELISA data. Bone density was analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk test. Subsequently t test was applied. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be significant.
Results: The concentration of interleukin-6 increased with the application of melatonin without statistically significance (361.32 &#x000b1; 235.22 pg/ml vs 262.58 &#x000b1; 233.92 pg/ml). Nitrotyrosine concentrations showed values below to the detectability pattern (&#x0003c;0.001 nM) in Optic Density curve. Bone density in panoramic sections at socket after melatonin application showed no significant difference (561.98 &#x000b1; 105.92 HU vs 598.82 &#x000b1; 209.03 HU). In cross sections, bone density in the alveolar region showed no significant difference(377.42 &#x000b1; 125.67 HU vs 347.56 &#x000b1; 97.02 HU).
Conclusions: Within the limitations of this pilot study, no differences with the application of melatonin were found in terms of the concentration of interleukin-6 and bone density in post-extraction socket of retained mandibular third molars.

Moreover, tooth loss is a functional, aesthetic and psychological problem in patients who request for a non-removable treatment for tooth replacement without delay. This time depends on the moment that osseointegration occurs, being bone density the most important factor to take place (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Melatonin (N - acetyl-5- methoxytryptamine) is a hormone with paracrine,autocrine and endocrine antioxidant actions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>This molecule is synthesized primarily in the pineal gland to 30 years of age, time at which production decreases. It is also synthesized in other regions such as retina, gastrointestinal tract, skin, bone marrow and lymphocytes (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). One of its main physical and chemical characteristics is its high diffusion capacity since it is a highly lipophilic molecule. It also has a very high redox potential, which determines an antioxidant activity far higher than other known antioxidants (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). It has been demonstrated the efficacy of melatonin in the treatment of diseases caused by the presence of free radicals (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). It produces intense antiapoptotic signals even in situations of ischemia and has cytoprotective properties of enzymes involved in the healing process. It also stimulates the immune system and has oncosupresor properties (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>The main mechanism of melatonin on surgical woundseems to be inhibition of the production of reactive oxidants, such as nitric oxide (NO) and nitrotyrosine (NT)(<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), by reducing the activation of NF- k&#x003b2; (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), expression of COX-2 and prostaglandin, and recruitment of polymorphonuclear cells into the site of injury (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Moreover,melatonin reduces neutrophil infiltration and neutralizes the exacerbated production of inflammatory mediators such as necrosis tissue factor-&#x003b1; (NTF-&#x003b1;) and several interleukins (IL- 1&#x003b2; and IL -6) (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>-<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It is known that the maximum antinociceptive effect of melatonin was observed 60 minutes after the systemically administration of high doses (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the bone, several studieshave reported that melatonin plays an important role in bone formation and bone metabolism (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It has been shown that locally applied melatonin increases trabecular bone formation directly by stimulating osteoblasts early from endosteum (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), and accelerating the synthesis and mineralization of the osteoid matrix after 2 and 4 weeks (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). This results in a significant increase in cortical width and length of bone (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). It also increases bone formation markers, such as alkaline phosphatase, sialoprotein, osteopontin, and osteocalcin (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Moreover, it interferes with osteoclast function, inhibiting bone resorption directly and by reducing RANKL (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>).</p><p>Consequently, there is scientific evidence of the potential of melatonin in the treatment of inflammation and pain (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>) and as a osteogenic factor that increases the volumeand bone density (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). It is also known that its effects are proportionally related to the dose applied, and there is general agreement that melatonin may be applied with insignificant adverse effects even at high doses (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, we hypothesize that local application of melatoninin the post- extraction socket produces favorable differences in the immediate postoperative period, as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and early osteogenic regarding the natural healing process of the socket.</p><p>For this set itwas aimed to determine whether there were differences in the levels of interleukin -6 and nitrotyrosine and bone density as a function of applied locally melatonin, assessing the possible complications associated with postoperative melatonin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>-Patients</p><p>Ten patients of the Department of Medicine and Oral Surgery, Faculty of Dentistry, Complutense University of Madrid indicating both lower third molar extraction, with good health (Category I and II of the American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA]) of both sexes, aged between 16 and 35, were included. Subjects would not have a history or metabolic or systemic diseases affecting bone or healing process, no locally periodontal disease or cystyc or tumorpathology. In addition, due to standardize the sample, both third molar were in similar position and situation. Subjects who met the inclusion criteria and agree to sign the informed consent were included in the study.</p><p>Were considered as an exclusion criteria smoking, pregnant or breast-feeding, use of contraceptives or hormonal medications, the presence of chronic disorders, and history of allergy or adverse effects associated with the drugs used as well as the presence of acute inflammation or infection the day of surgery. The operation time was timed from the beginning of the incision to the end of suture, and if it exceeded 30 minutes, the patient would be excluded. Also would be excluded those who do not allow monitoring and sampling.</p><p>Both extractions were performed in the same sequence by the same operator. Melatonin (3 mg melatonin into 2 ml hydroxyethyl cellulose gel 2%) in the socket is applied randomly by computer versus placebo (2 ml of hydroxyethyl cellulose gel 2 %). In all cases the same antibiotic, antiinflammatory, analgesic and surgical intensive gastroprotective was prescribed. Healing process was revised and proceeded to suture removalat 7 days.</p><p>Patient information, treatment and samples were coded so that the side of the treatment was unknown to the patient, the surgeon and for the data analysis.</p><p>Besides the occurrence of adverse events were recorded over a time period of two months after the extraction.</p><p>-Bone density measurement</p><p>A digital cone beam scanner before surgery was carried out (Model 17-19 Next Generation i-CAT &#x000ae; Imaging Sciences International, Inc.

In the panoramic image previous to extractions measuring 10 areas of lower third molar and 10 equal areas of bone in the region distal was performed. Measurements were made on both sides, avoiding overlapping cortical and anatomical structures. In addition, 10 cross sections of each side of the region of the lower ridge, on which five socket areas were measured, and five areas of the distal bone region were selected.</p><p>-Plasma measurements</p><p>IL-6 and NT were measured by ELISA from the clot obtained into the socket in order to quantify the anti-inflammatory effect (IL-6) and the analgesic effects (NT).</p><p>The first blood sample was obtained by direct extraction from the socket immediately after the tooth extraction. The second blood sample was obtained similarly to 60 minutes after completing the intervention.</p><p>-Statistical analysis</p><p>Data were analyzed using statistical package SPSS 21.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to determine the distribution of serum analysis data. Shapiro-Wilk test for bone density analysis was used.

The present study is within the time of surgery recorded by other authors, between 11.03 and 25.00 minutes (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Despite obtaining a sufficient amount of blood for processing all samples, there were two post- placebo gel application whose plasma samples could not be analyzed as having an oily consistency. This may be due to the limited local bleeding, which mixed with the gel, resulted in an impossible processing of the sample.</p><p>Regarding the concentration of IL-6, on both sides there was a non-inflammatory state before treatment application. After treatment no significant differences in the concentration of IL-6 were found, so our study cannot claim that melatonin influences the concentration of IL-6 in relation to the early inflammatory process. A possible explanation, according to Mayo <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), Cutando <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and Radogna <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), should be that the greatest effect of melatonin occurs when inflammatory mediators are increased in the damaged region. Another factor related to its effect, according to Maldonado <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and Laste <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), is the dose applied, which could be small in our study, although antiinflammatory and analgesic effects are described applying locally 2 mg (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>)and even micromolar doses (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p>The NO has a rapid degradation of compounds such as nitrotyrosine, so determination can detect earliest and smaller changes (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). In most samples, values below to detectable (&#x0003c;0.001 nM) were obtained. Although it is not possible to draw conclusions from these findings it follows that the values of products of oxidative and nitrosative degradation immediately after extractions are not yet high enough to be quantified, according to Hamza et al. (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)in extraction of wisdom teeth, which were not detectable. Furthermore, studies such as Mayo et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>) support the utility of melatonin as anti-inflammatory agent but its effects would be amplified when free radicals and inflammatory mediators were already present in the injured area (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>In the study of bone density, a patient had to be excluded from the sample due to an allergic reaction. He also received surgical treatment in the region operated due to a postoperative complication and was not possible to makethe mandibular scanner on deadline. The exclusion of this patient supposed that all the patients in the sample were women.</p><p>Bone density was obtained in panoramic sections in the distal regions (a = 609.39 &#x000b1; 173.28 HU; b = 620.59 &#x000b1; 177.36HU; A = 631.40 &#x000b1; 91.08 HU; B = 684.66 &#x000b1; 115.50 HU). This was comparable to that obtained by Hiasa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>), Norton <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and Turkyilmaz <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) in the same region (628.2&#x000b1;209.2HU (26), 669HU (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>) and 715.8&#x000b1;190HU (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>)), considering that bone density use to be lower in women and younger patients (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>).

A lower lipdysesthesia happened on the side of melatoninand was resolved within 3 days with anti-inflammatory therapy. One patient reported fever of 39&#x000b0;C, discarding oral origin at examination. Another patient had a post-extraction alveolitis on the side of melatonin application. At 36 days she developed an increasingly severe noninfectious inflammation due to trauma in the periosteum, which was resolved 10 days after. Finally, one patient showed an allergic reaction to metamizol 575 mg, not mentioned in the medical record at 10 hours after surgery. At 35 days, he went to the emergencies with an increased inflammation, trismus and night pain on the side where melatonin was applied. He was diagnosed of &#x0201c;paramandibular abscess of 38&#x0201d; and treated with surgical drainage and antibiotic (ciprofloxacin 500 mg), anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen 600 mg), analgesic (paracetamol 650 mg) and an antiseptic (chlorhexidine 0.2%) therapy.</p><p>Despite the reported complications, the distribution of the samedoes not determine its relation to the application of melatonin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Finally, within the limitations of this study, we can conclude that there were no differences between the application of melatonin and placebo in terms of the concentration of interleukin-6 and bone density.
