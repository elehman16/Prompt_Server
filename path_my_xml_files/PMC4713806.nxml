exercises increases the muscular strength and range of motion of the thoracic vertebrae of
chronic low-back pain patients. [Subjects] This study enrolled 20 patients with chronic
low back pain, who were divided into two groups. Ten subjects were randomly selected for
the stabilization exercise group and the remaining 10 subjects received thoracic spine
mobilization in addition to performing the stabilization exercises. [Methods] The patients
performed stabilization exercises and received thoracic spine mobilization for 12 weeks.
The range of motion and isometric muscular strength of the vertebrae of all subjects were
measured before and after the intervention. [Results] In the comparison of muscular
strength before and after the intervention, the change in muscular strength of the trunk
flexors in the stabilization exercise group was 16.0&#x000b1;7.4 Nm, and that of the thoracic
spine mobilization group was 34.2&#x000b1;7.6 Nm, a significant difference in each group. In the
post-intervention intergroup comparison, the muscular strength of trunk flexors in the
stabilization exercise group was 111.1&#x000b1;16.9 Nm, while that of the thoracic spine
mobilization group was 125.9&#x000b1;11.3 Nm, a significant difference. Also, the muscular
strength of the trunk extensors in the stabilization exercise group was 148.9&#x000b1;31.8 Nm,
while that of the thoracic spine mobilization group was 182.9&#x000b1;37.2 Nm, a significant
difference. The thoracic spine flexion in the stabilization exercise group was 29.8&#x000b1;9
degrees, while that of the thoracic spine mobilization group was 38.7&#x000b1;6.9 degrees, a
significant difference. However, there was no significant difference in lumbar flexion
values between the two groups. [Conclusion] Thoracic spine mobilization added to a
stabilization exercise increased the muscular strength of patients with chronic low back
pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Isometric muscle strength</kwd><kwd>Lumbar stabilization exercise</kwd><kwd>Thoracic spine mobilization exercise</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Excessive pressure against the spine leads to a change in the intervertebral discs and to
the phenomena of contraction, tension and rupture of the ligaments and muscles that support
the vertebral body. The symptoms of low back pain develop in all ages, social strata, and
occupations of all populations<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
duration of symptomatic manifestation of low back pain in most patients is approximately 2
to 3 months, and 80% to 90% of these patients generally experience recurrences<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The causes of low back pain are various.
However, soft tissue injury and weakening of the muscular strength of the trunk are primary
causes of low back pain development<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
These disorders lead to decreased endurance and limited range of motion of the lumbar
vertebrae<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with low back pain
may experience vertebral movement imbalance in flexion or extension of the trunk, and may
also develop abnormal coupling motions, compared to normal individuals<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The aim of lumbar stabilization exercise is to maximally
reduce the stress biomechanically placed upon the vertebral infrastructure while a subject
optimally performs required movements<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Paris<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> defined &#x0201c;spinal instability&#x0201d; as
having abnormal movements such as visually noticeable landing or catching during active
movements, or a condition in which changes of the relative positions of the adjacent
vertebrae are observable in a standing or prone position. Recently, the neutral zone theory,
the logic behind &#x0201c;spinal instability,&#x0201d; was proposed by Pnajabi et al<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. They asserted that the range of the neutral region would be
affected by reciprocal reactions among the passive, active and neuronal control systems.
Currently, lumbar stabilization exercise is recognized as an important therapeutic exercise
due to &#x0201c;its effect on functional recovery and range of motion in patients with low back
pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.&#x0201d; In human motion, the most
flexible segments cause the largest angle of motion in a system consisting of multiple
segments, and it has been observed that excessive movements of the lumbar spine are caused
by limited motions of the thoracic vertebral segments. Maintaining a sitting position for a
long time and aging increase thoracic kyphosis<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, thoracic kyphosis-associated movement reduction in
the thoracic vertebrae increases abnormal movements of the intervertebral bodies of the
lumbar spine through a compensatory mechanism. Owing to the fact that such abnormal
movements of the intervertebral bodies of the lumbar spine occur excessively, instability
develops in facet joints of the vertebrae, finally inducing low back pain<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Spine manipulation therapy has largely been utilized to increase the spinal range of motion
and reduce pain in patients with functional failure of the vertebral joints<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cleland<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, suggested spine manipulation therapy as an appropriate treatment
for patients with spinal pain. Recently, numerous studies of lumbar stabilization exercises
have been reported. There are also reports of therapeutic manipulation and on the strength
of lumbar vertebral extension. Studies of lumbar stabilization exercise include (1) &#x0201c;The
effect of trunk stabilization exercise on posture adjustment&#x0201d; by Hyung-Soo Kim<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>; (2) &#x0201c;Cross-sectional comparative analysis
of the multifidus muscle in compliance with the stabilization exercise approach,&#x0201d; by
Jung-Hoon Kim<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>; and (3) &#x0201c;The comparison
of thoracic and lumbar stabilization between lumbar stabilization and thoracic spine
mobilization exercise,&#x0201d; by Jin-Gang Huh<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Jung-Ah Kim<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>
reported that thoracic spine mobilization was effective for functional improvement of lumbar
spine stabilization when William&#x02019;s exercise and thoracic spine mobilization were
implemented. Nevertheless, there have not been any studies of exercises that concurrently
resolve both the difficulties of hypomobility of the thoracic spinal segments and
hypermobility of the lumbar spine, which cause instability of the lumbar spine. In the
present study manipulation of the spinal segments with hypomobility and stabilization
exercises were performed for spinal hypermobility, and their effects on range of motion and
muscular strength were examined in patients with chronic low back pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study enrolled 20 patients with chronic low back pain, who were divided into two

provided their written informed consent before participating. The study protocol was
approved by the institutional review boards of Daegu university of Daegu.</p><p>A Spinal Mouse was used to measure the range of motion of the spine. According to a study
conducted by Seichert<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, the reliability
coefficient of the Spinal Mouse is 0.96. In a comparative study of the lumbar shapes of the
sagittal plane and mobility of normal individuals, utilizing a functional radiologic study
and a Spinal Mouse, it was reported that these two methods did not show any differences and
there was a high correlation between these two methods. The Spinal Mouse, an
automatically-measuring device for spinal segmental motions, was dragged down from C7 to S3,
sagitally, along the vertebral column of subjects in three postures of vertebral extension,
flexion and lateral flexion. The data recorded of the spinal segments, was then transferred
wirelessly to a computer. The measurements included the length of the spine, degree of
scoliosis, and the angles of each segment of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. For the
measurement of spinal segmental motion, the subjects were asked to adopt a neutral posture,
which is the most comfortable position for the waist. While maintaining the neutral posture,
the segmental motion of the spine was measured from C7 to S3. Next, segmental spine motion
was measured in the same way, while the trunk was actively flexed to the maximum. The
measurements were repeated three times and the mean value was calculated. A single examiner
took measurements in order to minimize the margin of error of the test.</p><p>An isometric sthenometer (ISO-check, Germany) was used to measure the muscular strength of
the lumbar deep muscles. The maximum and average muscular strengths were obtained by
measuring isometric contraction. Subject sat on the device and the knees and chest were
secured with straps. Then, lumbar flexion, extension, lateral flexion and rotation were
measured. Lumbar flexion or extension was measured by pushing the lumbar region maximally in
the direction of flexion or extension while holding the chest belt tightly. Lateral flexion
was measured by pushing the fixed shoulder bar with maximum force, while rotation was
measured by rotating the lumbar spine with maximum force while holding the fixed handle. The
maximum muscular force was measured in each direction for six seconds, and the force is
reported in Nm.</p><p>For the purpose of strengthening the transverse abdominis muscle, multifidus muscle,
quadratus lumborum muscle, external oblique abdominal muscle, and internal oblique abdominal
muscle, subjects performed active stabilization exercises for one hour daily, three times a
week for twelve weeks. The stabilization exercises were divided into warming-up, main, and
cool-down exercises. The warming-up exercise was walking on a treadmill for fifteen minutes.
The cool-down exercise included three types of stretching exercise. The main exercise
included 3 types of workouts in 1 set and 3 sets were performed. Sixty percent (60%) of the
maximum muscular strength was used as the intensity of the exercise. The exercises were
repeated 15 times for one set and 3 sets were performed with 2-minute rest intervals between
them. A slow exercise speed was used so that subjects did not experience pain. The cool-down
exercises were comprised of stretching exercises for the rectus femoris muscle, the
hamstring muscle, and the peroneal muscle group<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. The main exercise of the stabilization workout program was
performed with the aim of promoting the muscular strength of the quadriceps femoris muscle
and the hamstring muscle. Before starting the exercises, subjects pulled-in their abdomens
so that a ball on the back did not sink down core muscles were contracted. For Exercise (1),
the subjects were asked not to push the medial aspect of the thighs, so that no force was
put on a small ball placed between the knees, and then flexed and extended the knees slowly
as if pushing against a wall.</p><p>Exercise (2): Subjects alternately raised their upper and lower extremities in a prone
position. When raising the upper and lower extremities, the pelvis and the chest had to be
in contact with the ground, with the lumbar spine not overly extended. This procedure was
performed alternately on both the left and right sides.</p><p>Exercise (3): Subjects flexed their knees and placed their hands on the neck area in a
supine position, then vertically raised their elbows up to the level of the scapula, lifting
the upper body. Then, the upper body was slowly brought down while maintaining the core
contraction.</p><p>Exercise (4): Subjects flexed their knees and elbows at 90 degrees while lying on a bench.
Then, they rotated their arms while pushing their elbows back to the limit of movement of
the shoulder joints and contracted the rhomboid muscle.</p><p>Exercise (5): Subjects stood with their legs shoulder-width apart in a walking position.
Then, they lowered the pelvis by flexing the knees, and raised, the pelvis extending the
knees. This exercise was performed with the leading leg alternated. This is an endurance
exercise for the femoral and gluteal muscles, and is an effective workout that must be
carried out in with the core muscles contracted.</p><p>Exercise (6): The subjects bent both knees to 90 degrees to a decubitus position. Then, the
upper part of the lower extremities was raised so that they were horizontal. The subjects&#x02019;
legs were crossed (in an inversion state) and the pelvis was not allowed to move. Then the
core muscles were contracted, This exercise was alternately performed on both the left and
right sides. The aim of this exercise was to strengthen the endurance capacity of the
gluteus medius, and the internal and external oblique abdominal muscles.</p><p>Exercise (7): A rubber tube (Theratube) was placed on the right ankle with the subjects in
a prone position, and the anterior aspect of the thigh was positioned on the edge of the
bench. Then, the flexed knee joints and hip joints were extended. slowly, with contraction
of the core muscles, so that lumbar movement was minimized. This exercise was performed to
strengthen the gluteus maximus and the erector muscles of the spine.</p><p>Exercise (8): This was an exercise of the upper extremities using a pulley. Subjects stood
next to a pulley. Movements of the upper extremities were performed at angles of less than
90 degrees. The shoulder joints were externally and alternately rotated slowly.</p><p>Exercise (9): With both hands and feet are on the ground, subjects contracted the
transversus abdominis muscle and then raised their knees, without lumbar lordosis, and with
the neck and the spine aligned straight. Both the stabilization exercise group and
mobilization group performed these exercise.</p><p>Thoracic mobilization therapy was performed for the thoracic spine mobilization group,
thoracic mobilization therapy was performed for five minutes before starting the
stabilization exercises. The thoracic mobilization therapy was the manipulation therapy
reported by Kaltenborn<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Traction was
applied to the articulations of the thoracic spine with restricted movements. Both hands
were crisscrossed so that each hand held the opposite shoulder of the subjects in a supine
position. The subjects facing the therapist. While one hand of the therapist was placed on
the thoracic segment with movement restriction, the other hand held and pushed the elbow of
the subject. In a sufficiently relaxed state, a very short and fast force is applied
downward toward the ground.</p><p>SPSS 12.0 version was used to analyze data collected in this study with a significance
level of p=0.05. The ranges of motion of the spine and isometric muscular strengths of the
stabilization exercise group and the thoracic spine mobilization group were tested for
differences using the independent t-test for intergroup analysis, and the paired sample
t-test for intragroup analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the comparisons of the results before and after exercises within each group the change

significant decrease in the kyphotic curvature of all thoracic segments in both sitting and
standing postures in a group of patients with low back pain after 3 weeks exercise of the
transversus abdominis muscle. White<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
suggested ranges of flexion and extension for the thoracic and lumbar spine: 4 degrees for
the upper part of the thoracic spine, 6 degrees for the middle spine, 12 degrees for the
lower part of the thoracic spine, and 20 degrees in the lumbar segments. Jung-Ah Kim<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, based on comparisons of a thoracic spine
mobilization group and a William&#x02019;s Back Exercise group, that the thoracic spine mobilization
group showed a decrease in kyphosis and pain the thoracic spine as well as an increase in
lumbar stability. Huh<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> prescribed
exercises for a thoracic spine mobilization group and a lumbar stabilization group for 3 and
6 months, and reported that the subjects of the thoracic spine mobilization group showed a
significant increase in their ability to raised both of their hands maximally above their
heads. Kim<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>, reported that sling
exercises for lumbar stabilization and muscular strength, increased sujects&#x02019; muscular
strength. Kim<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, reported the effect of
trunk stabilization exercises for postural control for patients with chronic back pain. The
muscular strengths of the transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis, and the external oblique
abdominal muscle increased in the groups performing matt-and-ball exercise or sling exercise
with isometric extension. They concluded that the muscular activation was effective and that
the exercises that decreased tlie Oswestry Disability Index also increased muscular
strength. This is because thoracic joint mobilization or self-stretching exercises for the
spine improve limited movements of the spine, recover facet joint sliding, and normalize the
articular capsule, thereby decreasing kyphosis and enhancing the flexibility of thoracic
extension<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
stabilization exercises with thoracic spine mobilization were performed for 12 weeks
resulting in a significant increases in the strengths of the trunk flexor, trunk extensor
and thoracic flexor muscles, a finding which is in agreement with those of previous studies.
Many exercise methods have been exhaustively researched in an effort to prevent the vicious
cycle of spinal tissue injury inducing spinal instability, and to find clinically safe and
effective exercise methods. From the aspects of safety and function of the lumbar spine,
many researchers are agreed about the importance of muscular stabilization<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, Kaltenborn<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that the therapeutic method of controlling
abnormal movements through relative adjustment of excessively restricted or large segmental
movements could affect lumbar stability, and that lumbar stabilization could be improved by
thoracic mobilization and thoracic manipulation for the improvement of thoracic
mobility<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book">Hemberg S: Introduction to
