It is required to tolerate intubation and other ICU related procedures, to lie down in the same position for a long time, to prevent ventilator dysynchrony, for optimization of oxygenation and for patients safety.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Attaining an optimal level of sedation is a challenging act for the ICU clinician. Both inadequate sedation and oversedation compromise patient's recovery and may prolong ICU stay along with associated complications and increased cost.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Many of the currently used agents have specific drawbacks that limit their practical utility along the full spectrum of patients and clinical situations that intensivists face every day. The discovery that clonidine has an opioid sparing property and attenuated withdrawal symptoms, sparked further interest in the use of alpha - 2 (&#x003b1;2) agonists as intravenous (IV) sedatives.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A resurgence in the research of &#x003b1;2 agonists for sedation developed after the approval of dexmedetomidine for ICU sedation.</p><p>Unlike most other sedative drugs, &#x003b1;2 agonists produce both sedation and analgesia with minimal respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This unique combination makes them highly beneficial especially in the ICUs.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] We therefore planned this study to compare sedative, analgesic and cardiovascular effects and safety profile of two &#x003b1;2 agonists, clonidine, and dexmedetomidine for patients requiring short-term sedation in ICU.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Patients</title><p>After approval from the Institutional Review Board and informed written consent, 70 adult patients of either sex were enrolled for this study. The main inclusion criteria were age &#x0003e;18 years, mechanical ventilation with endotracheal intubation and clinical need for light or moderate sedation for &#x0003c;24 h. We excluded pregnant females, patients with a neurological condition, central nervous system trauma, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hemodynamically unstable patients, known cases of conduction defects, cardiac failure, those with a creatinine clearance &#x0003c;30 ml/min, and those requiring neuromuscular blockade and prior use of &#x003b1;2 agonists.</p><p>The patients were predominantly postsurgical who were operated for major abdominal, gynecological or urological procedures under general anesthesia on an elective basis. The anesthetic technique was individualized by the anesthetist in-charge; however, fentanyl alone was used for intraoperative analgesia and the dose was recorded. Epidural or spinal technique was not used in any patient. On arrival to the ICU, patients were randomly allocated into two groups, Group C and D, based on computer generated random number tables.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Study drugs</title><p>Clonidine was supplied in 1 ml ampoules, containing 150 &#x003bc;g/ml and diluted with normal saline to a concentration of 3 &#x003bc;g/ml.

Hematological (complete blood count, coagulation profile) and biochemical profile (electrolytes, glucose, urea, creatinine, and liver function test) were obtained prior to the administration of sedatives and 24 h after the study period. Patients were ventilated with oxygen enriched air to obtain acceptable arterial blood gas (ABG) levels. Temperature and ABG was recorded at regular intervals. Apart from the sedative drugs, all management was according to the ICU protocol. Patients were extubated when clinically indicated.</p><p>Heart rate, CVP, noninvasive blood pressure (BP), respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (measured by pulse oximetry) were monitored continuously over 24 h. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded at 10 min, 30 min after the commencement of sedative infusions and then 2 hourly for the study period. Hemodynamic monitoring continued for 24 h after cessation of the infusions.</p><p>Adverse cardiovascular events were defined by hypotension, hypertension, tachycardia, and bradycardia. If systolic BP reduced below 80 mmHg or increased above 180 mmHg, diastolic BP reduced below 50 mmHg or increased above 100 mmHg or heart rate was below 50 or above 120 bpm, they were labeled as adverse cardiovascular events. Any change &#x0003e;30% from the baseline in BP and heart rate were also considered as adverse cardiovascular event.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4"><title>Protocol for sedation and analgesia</title><p>The degree of sedation was assessed by Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) (1: Patient anxious, agitated or restless, 2: Cooperative, oriented and tranquil, 3: Responds to commands only, 4: Exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus, 5: Sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory sound, 6: No response) obtained on arrival in the ICU, at 10 and 30 min after commencement of the infusion and 2 hourly thereafter for the study period. RSS of 3 - 4 was considered as target sedation and the infusion rates were titrated within their respective range until target sedation was achieved. RSS was also assessed prior to and 10 min after any titration in the study drug infusion rate or the use of additional sedation. Infusion was continued as needed until extubation or for maximum allowable time. Group C patients were administered an IV infusion of clonidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and titration was achieved with dosage increments up to 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Patients in Group D received dexmedetomidine as a loading dose of 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg over a period of 10 min followed by maintenance of 0.2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h with dosage increments titrated up to 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. The infusions rates were maintained to achieve sedation within target range.</p><p>Additional sedation with IV diazepam bolus of 0.1 mg/kg was given if the patient did not achieve target sedation on titrating the sedative to the maximum selected dose (2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h for clonidine and 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h for dexmedetomidine) or if the patient experienced side-effects (hypotension) with the drugs. Assessment of pain was by direct communication of the patient and fentanyl was given prior to anticipate noxious stimulus. Inadequate analgesia was treated with IV bolus of 20 &#x003bc;g of fentanyl or infusion if pain persisted.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A sample size of minimum 32 patients/group was expected to have an 80% power to detect a 30% reduction in additional sedation requirements (primary endpoint) with a significance level of 5%.

Biochemical and hematological parameters were not different between two groups at arrival in ICU and 24 h after admission.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The chief results of this study showed that target sedation was achieved in more number of patients receiving dexmedetomidine with lesser need for additional sedation. The patients in this group were more stable hemodynamically compared with those receiving clonidine. This study and many previous studies have documented dexmedetomidine to be a safe and effective agent for ICU sedation of postsurgical patients.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Although mean cumulative sedation scores over the study period were not significantly different in two groups (3.37 + 1.37 vs. 3.20 + 0.75 in Groups C and D, respectively), percentage of patients who attained target sedation was significantly higher in Group D compared with Group C (86 vs. 62% in Groups D and C, respectively, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). Dexmedetomidine is 8 times more specific for &#x003b1;2 receptors than clonidine and the improved specificity for the &#x003b1;2 adrenoreceptors, especially for the 2A subtype may make it to be a much more effective sedative than clonidine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Our finding of dexmedetomidine treated patients is in concurrence with previous studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] However, our findings are in contrast with those of Riker <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who suggested that dexmedetomidine attained target sedation less frequently. They recruited only medical patients, while our most patients were postsurgical. This could possibly be the cause of discrepancy.</p><p>A RSS of 1-2 or 5-6 occurred in more number of observations in Group C than in Group D. The short distribution half-life of dexmedetomidine (6 min) makes it an ideal drug for IV titration.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] This could be the reason for the rapid titration to target sedation and the lesser number of observations pertaining to inadequate sedation in Group D. Although more than 60% patients of both groups attained acceptable sedation, significantly more number of patients in clonidine treated group required additional sedation by diazepam on account of fall of BP on increasing infusion rate to maximum set level. Requirement of additional sedation in this group was about 43% more than dexmedetomidine treated group. In a retrospective analysis of patients receiving clonidine for ICU sedation, Gillison <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] have reported that clonidine reduces requirement of additional sedation and analgesia, but at the cost of higher than routinely prescribed dose. Only 8/35 patients (23%) patients in Group D needed additional sedation which agrees with findings of Martin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>There is no consensus on appropriate dose regimen of clonidine during ICU sedation[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and is extremely variable when given by continuous infusion. However, the usual dose is in the order of 100 &#x003bc;g/h.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We used an initial dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h of clonidine for infusion titrated to 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h as the maximum dose. The dose of dexmedetomidine for ICU sedation varies greatly ranging between 0.2 and 2.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study, we used a loading dose of 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg followed by 0.2-0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. A meta-analysis by Tan and Ho (2010)[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] observed that incidence of bradycardia requiring intervention increased in studies that used both a loading dose and maintenance doses of dexmedetomidine in excess of 0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Transient hypertensive responses have also been observed with higher doses[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] due to initial stimulation of &#x003b1;2B receptors present in vascular smooth muscles.</p><p>Hypotension and bradycardia are the most feared side-effects of &#x003b1;2 agonists. Baseline heart rates which were high in both groups settled to an optimal range over the study period. Hypotension was more commonly seen in Group C compared with Group D. 50% of the hypotensive episodes occurred within 2-4 h in Group C and after bolus infusion and within 2 h after maintenance infusion in Group D, as the steady state plasma concentration of the drugs are achieved at this time duration, causing vasodilatation and hypotension. In general, hemodynamic stability was preserved in most patients receiving dexmedetomidine, a finding in agreement with many previous studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Eleven out of 14 patients in Group C requiring additional sedation to achieve target sedation experienced hypotension on increasing the dose from 1 up to 2 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. This observation was consistent with previous studies of clonidine where adverse hemodynamic effects occurred at doses required for sedation.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Rebound hypertension occurs due to sympathetic activity following discontinuation of the drug.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Previous studies of ICU sedation with dexmedetomidine have found no or minimal increase in heart rate and BP following abrupt cessation,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] the finding similar to this study. In Group C, four patients experienced rebound hypertension on cessation of the infusions. It has long been recognized that clonidine can cause rebound hypertension after withdrawal.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>There were some limitations of the study that need discussion. A small study group containing patients mostly postsurgical precluded an extensive study on a heterogeneous ICU population. A short study period was considered as dexmedetomidine has been approved by Food and Drug Administration as a sedative in the ICU for patients undergoing mechanical ventilation of &#x0003c; 24 h duration. Therefore the length of ICU stay and outcome could not be studied. Being an open-label study, there is an inherent potential for observer bias. Due to the unavailability of bispectral index (BIS) at our center we restricted our assessment of the degree of sedation to RSS. It is a highly reliable and well-validated sedation scale for use in ICU[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and has also been shown to have a good correlation with BIS.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both dexmedetomidine and clonidine can be used as sedative agents for short term ICU sedation of postsurgical patients. On the basis of our study data, we derived that dexmedetomidine has a better cardiovascular safety profile. Further trials with both drugs may define their exact role for sedation of ICU patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
