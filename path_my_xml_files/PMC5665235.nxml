Women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) are less compliant to recommended prenatal care and suffer a higher risk of adverse perinatal outcomes. Several attempts to encourage optimal pregnancy follow-up have shown controversial results, particularly in high-income countries. Few studies have assessed financial incentives to encourage prenatal care, and none reported materno-fetal events as the primary outcome. Our study aims to determine whether financial incentives could improve pregnancy outcomes in women with low SES in a high-income country.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This pragmatic cluster-randomised clinical trial includes pregnant women with the following criteria: (1) age above 18 years, (2) first pregnancy visit before 26 weeks of gestation and (3) belonging to a socioeconomically disadvantaged group. The intervention consists in offering financial incentives conditional on attending scheduled pregnancy follow-up consultations. Clusters are 2-month periods with random turnover across centres. A composite outcome of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality is the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints include maternal or neonatal outcomes assessed separately, qualitative assessment of the perception of the intervention and cost-effectiveness analysis for which children will be followed to the end of their first year through the French health insurance database. The study started in June 2016, and based on an expected decrease in the primary endpoint from 18% to 14% in the intervention group, we plan to include 2000 women in each group.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Ethics approval was first gained on 28 September 2014. An independent data security and monitoring committee has been established. Results of the main trial and each of the secondary analyses will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02402855">NCT02402855</ext-link>; pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>clinical governance</kwd><kwd>organisation of health services</kwd><kwd>maternal medicine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Direction G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;rale de l&#x02019;offre de Soins, Minsit&#x000e8;re en Charge de la Sant&#x000e9;</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group><award-group id="funding-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Minist&#x000e8;re de la Sant&#x000e9;, Direction G&#x000e9;n&#x000e9;rale de l&#x02019;Offre de Soins (DGOS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Inadequate prenatal care has been associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, and in high-income countries, socioeconomically disadvantaged women have increased rates of both unattended pregnancy follow-up visits and pregnancy-related adverse outcomes.

A number of studies have demonstrated a relationship between fewer prenatal visits and poorer pregnancy outcomes. A large retrospective cohort in the USA demonstrated that women with inadequate prenatal care (defined as attending fewer than 50% of recommended visits) had an increased risk of preterm birth (OR 2.0, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.9 to 2.0), low birth weight (LBW) (OR 1.7, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.6 to 1.7) and infant mortality (OR 1.5, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.3 to 1.7) compared with women who received adequate prenatal follow-up.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> This association is even stronger in European cohort studies, even after adjusting for confounding factors.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>As the provision of prenatal care to pregnant women appears to be an effective way to improve perinatal outcomes, many countries have implemented specific recommendations for this care, with various expectations in different countries, the minimum being eight antenatal contacts, as recommended by WHO.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Appropriate pregnancy follow-up is based on early initial access to a health professional and adequate compliance with the scheduled follow-up visits. It has been suggested that initial access is influenced by late recognition of the pregnancy and subsequent denial or acceptance, whereas follow-up depends on a strategy of weighing up and balancing out the perceived gains and losses. Personal resources in terms of time, money and social support as well as the services available are all taken into account.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Perinatal outcomes in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations have been shown to be worse than those in the rest of the population, in terms of perinatal death,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> prematurity,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> congenital anomalies and LBW.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> Access to prenatal care is insufficient in this at-risk population. This has been demonstrated in countries where access to care is not equal, such as the USA, as well as in countries such as Belgium or France, where free healthcare is provided for socially disadvantaged populations.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14 15</xref> In France, for example, the preliminary results of the preCARE cohort, which analysed data of about 10&#x02009;000 women, suggested that women covered with insurance for low-income people (Couverture Maladie Universelle (CMU) or Universal Medical Coverage) and insurance for illegal immigrants (Aide M&#x000e9;dicale d&#x02019;Etat (AME) or State Medical Assistance)) have, respectively, a 50% and 80% increased risk of severe maternal morbidity (relative risk of 1.5; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.95 to 2.3 and 1.8; 95%&#x02009;CI 1.1 to 3.1, for CMU and AME women, respectively).<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>In addition, adequate prenatal care has been shown to be cost-effective. This effect is largely due to the extremely high cost of care for preterm and LBW infants, with costs standing at over US$100&#x02009;000 for extreme prematurity, between US$40&#x02009;000 and US$100&#x02009;000 for early prematurity, between US$10&#x02009;000 and US$30&#x02009;000 for moderate prematurity and below US$4500 for late prematurity.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>Several interventions to improve pregnancy follow-up have been assessed, and most of the recent literature on this topic has come from low-income and middle-income countries. In a systematic review published in 2016, Lassi and colleagues<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> assessed human resources for health (HRH) and showed that HRH interventions could contribute positively to the health worker&#x02019;s performance and thus improve maternal outcomes. The meta-analysis published in 2015 by the same authors suggested that community-based intervention packages could lead to a significant reduction in neonatal mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.75, 95%&#x02009;CI 0.67 to 0.83) and a possible effect on maternal mortality (RR 0.80; 95%&#x02009;CI 0.64 to 1.00).<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>In the few studies conducted in high-income countries recently, several reinforcement interventions have been tested. A study conducted in the USA among primiparous African-American women assessed four levels of incremental interventions, which combined financial support with enhanced postdelivery follow-up.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> None of these interventions proved to be effective, even as a numerical trend, in reducing premature delivery or the proportion of small for gestational age (SGA) infants.</p><p>More recently, a study conducted in Ireland, among women from a disadvantaged community in Dublin, showed that a home-visit programme had no impact on any of the neonatal outcomes.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In contrast,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> a meta-analysis published in 2016 by Sandall and colleagues suggested that women who received midwife-led continuity models of care were less likely to experience poor pregnancy outcomes than women who received other models of care.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Some studies have suggested that the use of incentives may improve prenatal care and neonatal outcomes. A retrospective cohort study in Canada demonstrated that low-income pregnant women who participated in a prenatal support programme beginning early in pregnancy (before 21 weeks of gestation) had significantly decreased rates of LBW infants compared with women who enrolled later in pregnancy (after 30 weeks of gestation) (RR 0.47, 95%&#x02009;CI 0.22 to 0.98).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>A Cochrane review on this topic published in 2015<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> was only able to show that pregnant women receiving incentives were more likely to obtain adequate quality prenatal care (mean difference 5.84, 95%&#x02009;CI 1.88 to 9.80) as none of the included trials reported on preterm birth, SGA and perinatal deaths.

This information is given by investigators after the delivery. Semidirected individual interviews will aim to understand the determinants of medical follow-up during pregnancy. The principle is to get the respondents to describe situations that highlight their habits, their social representations or their emotions. Women will be asked to describe their health practices during pregnancy, what was important for their medical follow-up and what led them to renounce scheduled care. For women who received the financial incentive, it is also a question of asking them how they experienced this incentive and what it may or may not have brought them.</p><p>In order to get this information, a retrospective study will be conducted. Interviews will take place within 1&#x02009;month of delivery.

There was, however, no formal assessment of the efficacy. Whereas this programme was associated with a very significant increase in the rate of delivery in healthcare facilities (from 39% to 74%), a recent survey suggested that beyond the cash incentive, the shift in the social norm and the women&#x02019;s own perception played a major role in this effect.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Interestingly, this programme was shown to be associated with a reduction in neonatal and perinatal deaths.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Financial incentive programmes to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy have been assessed and have recently been reported to be associated with a reduced likelihood of LBW.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>If our intervention proves to be effective, its implementation may have to overcome several difficulties, including tailoring the intervention to women most likely to respond, increasing acceptability of the concept among public bodies and health professionals and proving the intervention to be cost-effective.
