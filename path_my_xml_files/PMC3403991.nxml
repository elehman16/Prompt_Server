Adolescence, in particular, represents a period during which multiple physiological and psychological changes occur that affect dietary and physical activity habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Approximately 50% of obese adolescents with body mass index equal to or greater than the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile become obese adults with serious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Consequences of early obesity include: poor quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], onset of risk factors that can lead to early pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], frequent persistence into adulthood that can lead to increased morbidity of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer, and increased early mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In addition to physical consequences, obesity in youth is also associated with cognitive and psycho-social maladaptive behaviors. Li et al. showed an association between overweight and decreased cognitive function among children and adolescents that leads to poor quality of life, increased illness, incompetence, and low self esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Low self-esteem is also associated with a poor academic performance. Obese youth are less able to perform sport activities compared to their lean counterparts further contributing to low self esteem.</p><p>Early interventions, including appropriate pedagogy strategies, are important for a successful program. Exercise is one of the factors which contributes to long term weight maintenance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Physical activity, particularly aerobic training, improves lipid oxidation and may be take account in reducing cardiovascular diseases risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Caloric restriction is not recommended in children and adolescents. Children are still growing, diet restriction is not compatible with long term nutrition habits, and dietary restraint for youth as for adults can lead to greater food consumption later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Few studies of diet restriction have been undertaken in children. Protein-sparing and hypo caloric balanced diets have been evaluated for safety and effectiveness for children in outpatient weight reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Data suggest that hypo caloric diets are safe and effective in short-term management of pediatric obesity, but should only be undertaken with close medical supervision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Long term effectiveness is uncertain.</p><p>Combining diet and physical activity has not been recommended because of the consequences of decreased energy intake with increased energy expenditure. Ebbeling &#x00026; Rodriguez suggest that exercise offers metabolic benefits for obese children during diet-induced weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Longitudinal studies to assess long term health outcomes are recommended. In our study, we developed a program of physical activity using the Conative Educational Model, i.e. that each subject has an adapted program according to individual competences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The principal aim of the Conative Educational Model is to provide a variety of games specifically selected to be enjoyable, maintain interest, and motivate subjects to adhere. The model assures that the child is never in a failure situation which might lead to decreased activity. The child is positioned in an evolutionary dynamics to a particular moment, raising in the same time of his singularity and responsibility, he is an actor of his own construction and management. Each child has an individualized program. This is differentiation pedagogy.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to assess changes in ability to perform sport activity, classroom behavior and academic performance following one year of a health-wellness intervention using the Conative Educational Model in obese youth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-seven subjects, 19 girls and 18 boys from Dunkerque, France participated in the study.

Subjects identify their stage and observe their progress in the practice of sport. Progress of the intervention program is associated with a teaching activity adapted to the stage that best encourages acquiring of new skills and progressing from one stage to the next.

Several studies of intervention programs treating obesity in youth have been undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although the studies have dissimilar methodologies most showed decrease in BMI. A limitation of these interventions was the short duration of programs. CEMHaVi was planned for 12&#x02009;months to allow for a greater impact on healthy lifestyle than reported previously.</p><p>Krukowski et al. suggest that psychosocial variables, such as weight-based teasing, be considered in future research examining the impact of childhood obesity on school performance and the effect of health intervention studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Increased body weight is independently associated with decreased visuospatial organization and general mental ability among children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Obesity in adolescence is also linked with poor physical quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Another goal of CEMHaVi was to assess psycho-social issues because of their relationship to feeling ill, incompetence, and a low self esteem. Hillman et al. suggested that fitness may be related to better cognitive functioning in preadolescents and may have implications for increasing cognitive health in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The present study confirms the findings of Hillman demonstrating a strong inter-action between a decreased Z score of BMI and improved of classroom behavior, and increased academic performance (changes in class standing). Decreased BMI also had a favorable impact on self-esteem and the self-assurance. The present study demonstrates the inter-actions of physical and psycho-social measures and the contribution of physical activity to their improvement.</p><p>To reinforce self esteem and classroom performance, the CEMHaVi program used the Conative Educational Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Exercises during physical activity sessions were programmed as a function of subjects individual abilities, i.e. stage obtained in the conative curriculum. In the conative model, obese youth are never in a situation of failure prior to the activity, but rather value activity in relation into their effort and ability. Findings of CEMHaVi showed that the decreased BMI is associated with improved of ability to perform sport activity. Increased ability to perform, in turns, is associated with improved academic performance. Obese youth feel better during exercise sessions. As a consequence subjects are motivated to do more physical activity and to increase the cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>One of the limitations of the present study is the absence of a control group. Because of time limitations and financial constraints a randomized control group was not possible. However, the study has pre-test/post-test design and the group participants act as their own control subjects. Nevertheless, it would be preferable to develop this program with a control group in order to have more rigorous methodology, and to increase the number of participants for statistical power. Therefore, the present study is a pilot and its findings are preliminary, but encouraging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results following year one of CEMHaVi showed a close relationship between BMI, academic performance and ability to perform sport activity. Of greatest importance is that Z-score of BMI decreases proportionally to improved behavior and quality of life in classroom and ability to work alone. Results also showed a positive inter-action between academic performance and the ability to perform sport activities. Finally, the positive effect of academic performance on behavior traits in the classroom demonstrates in obese youth that increased academic performance results in better integration into classroom. These results are particularly favorable for obese youth to improve their general health state, both physical and mental.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing Interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Author contributions</title><p>J.
