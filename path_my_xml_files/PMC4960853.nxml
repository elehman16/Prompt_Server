Systematic reviews report that environmental and educational interventions to improve childcare provision of food and/or healthy eating curriculum can improve child dietary intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Internationally, countries including Australia have introduced nutritional guidelines to support provision of healthier foods in childcare services [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite this, research suggests that few childcare providers adhere to these guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Research suggests that a lack of knowledge of dietary guidelines as well as childcare staff attitudes and perceptions towards the provision of food may represent barriers to provision of foods consistent with guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Education resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] may represent a useful strategy to overcome such barriers to guideline implementation. Systematic review and randomised controlled trial evidence describing the effectiveness of education resources in changing clinician guideline implementation has reported that such interventions have a limited impact on changing provider intentions and behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These reviews, however, noted limitations such as insufficient sample sizes and inappropriate analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

This study only collected post-intervention data, which limits the ability to assess whether the intervention had differential effects on particular baseline characteristics. The study also had a short follow-up period of up to 2&#x000a0;months. The variation in time (1 to 8&#x000a0;weeks) between receiving the resource and when cooks undertook post-intervention data collection may have impacted on study findings as cooks had variable time to implement changes to their menus.</p><p id="Par28">This study found that the use of printed educational materials can improve childcare service cooks&#x02019; intentions to use nutritional guidelines when planning their menus. Others strategies to support implementation however may be required to improve food provision in care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec21"><p>
