The tablets are designed with gastric-retentive ER oral delivery technology that releases the ER component at a controlled rate in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Because consumption of food has demonstrated an impact on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of some marketed products using gastric-retentive ER oral delivery technology, a characterization of the effects of fed (high- and low-fat diets) versus fasted conditions on the PK of ER OC/APAP was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This Phase I study used an open-label randomized single-dose three-period six-sequence crossover single-center design. Healthy adult participants (n=48) were randomized to receive two tablets of ER OC/APAP under three conditions: following a high-fat meal; following a low-fat meal; and fasted. Plasma concentration versus time data from predose throughout designated times up to 48 hours postdose was used to estimate the PK parameters of oxycodone and APAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-one participants completed all three treatment periods. Both oxycodone and APAP were rapidly absorbed under fasted conditions. Total oxycodone and APAP exposures (area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve [AUC]) from ER OC/APAP were not significantly affected by food, and minimal changes to maximum observed plasma concentration for oxycodone and APAP were also noted. However, food marginally delayed the time to maximum observed plasma concentration of oxycodone and APAP. There was no indication that tolerability was affected by food.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings from this study suggest that ER OC/APAP can be administered with or without food.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>extended release</kwd><kwd>acute pain</kwd><kwd>fed conditions</kwd><kwd>opioid fixed dose combination</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Treatment of acute pain is an integral part of patient care in postoperative, postpartum, and emergency settings, as well as in the management of musculoskeletal diseases and medical illnesses, including cancer.<xref rid="b1-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is well documented that analgesics containing a combination of opioid and nonopioid agents can provide effective pain relief.

This fixed-dose IR combination of OC/APAP (available in doses of 2.5/325 mg, 5/325 mg, 7.5/325 mg, and 10/325 mg) has a well-documented postapproval efficacy and adverse event (AE) profile<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> supported by many years of clinical experience and an extensive literature. The usual dosing interval for treatment of pain with this IR OC/APAP formulation in adults is one tablet as needed every 4&#x02013;6 hours.<xref rid="b19-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b25-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Extended-release (ER) opioid combined formulations are designed to provide longer-lasting analgesia without the need for frequent dosing. At present, however, there are no other opioid/nonopioid analgesic combination drugs in an ER formulation approved by the FDA with a 12-hour dosing regimen. XARTEMIS XR (formerly MNK-795; ER OC/APAP; Mallinckrodt Brand Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dublin, Ireland) is a bilayer IR and ER combination analgesic that is indicated for the management of acute pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.<xref rid="b26-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Each tablet contains 7.5 mg OC/325 mg APAP, and the formulation provides rapid release, followed by sustained absorption of OC and APAP during the 12-hour dosing regimen. In single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies, the authors found no lag in the time to the first measurable concentration of OC or APAP after ingestion of a two-tablet dose of ER OC/APAP (15 mg OC/650 mg APAP); peak OC plasma concentrations for this dose occurred at 3 hours and were sustained over the 12-hour dosing period; peak APAP plasma concentrations occurred within 30&#x02013;60 minutes postdose and tapered off before the subsequent dose.<xref rid="b27-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> ER OC/APAP tablets employ a dual-layer biphasic delivery mechanism that, when administered as a single dose (ie, two tablets), is designed so that the IR component delivers 3.75 mg OC/325 mg APAP and the ER component delivers 11.25 mg OC/325 mg APAP. The tablets incorporate Acuform<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology (Depomed, Inc., Newark, CA, USA), which is designed to use release- controlling polymers that allow the tablet to remain in the stomach for several hours.<xref rid="b29-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This technology provides release of medication in the upper gastrointestinal tract at a controlled rate for an extended period of time.<xref rid="b29-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Each ER OC/APAP tablet contains high molecular-weight polyethylene oxide (Polyox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Dow Chemical Company, Midland, MI, USA) as a swellable release-controlling polymer, which imparts gastric-retentive properties to the dosage form. The gastric-retentive delivery system also conveys physicochemical properties to the product that may reduce abuse liability. A battery of in vitro evaluations of ER OC/APAP and an IR OC/APAP comparator demonstrated that the functional polymer, Polyox, creates obstacles to tampering techniques commonly used to facilitate abuse. Further evaluation of abuse-deterrent properties is in progress.</p><p>Intake of food before administration has been shown to impact the PK profile of products using gastric-retentive ER oral delivery technology. In fact, both calorie and fat content have been shown to affect the PK of drug products using the same Acuform<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> technology (eg, Gralise<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Depomed, Inc.).<xref rid="b31-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Given the possibility of a food-related PK effect with this formulation of OC/APAP, assessing the effect of food intake on ER OC/APAP was warranted. Effects of a standardized high-fat meal (&#x0003e;50%) were assessed, as recommended by the FDA for use in bioavailability studies, although effects of a low-fat breakfast (&#x0003c;30% fat), consistent with American Heart Association recommendations, were also explored.<xref rid="b32-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The primary objective of the present study was to determine the effect of fed conditions (both high- and low-fat meals) versus fasted conditions on the PK profile and bioavailability of OC and APAP from two tablets of ER OC/APAP. The secondary objective was to examine the safety and tolerability of ER OC/APAP under fed and fasted conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>The study population included 48 healthy male and female participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>Eligibility criteria for the study included a body mass index between 19 and 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, with a minimum weight of 130 lb (59 kg).

There were three treatment groups for each period: two that received ER OC/APAP after breakfast (high-fat or low-fat meal &#x02013; see &#x0201c;Meals&#x0201d; below) and one group that received ER OC/APAP without consuming a meal (fasted state). In the fed treatment groups, study medication was administered within 30 minutes of the start of a high- or low-fat meal. In treatment condition A, ER OC/APAP was administered in the fed state following a standard high-fat breakfast. In treatment condition B, ER OC/APAP was administered in the fed state following a low-fat breakfast.</p><p>In both treatment conditions A and B, participants were required to consume the meals within 30 minutes. In treatment condition C, ER OC/APAP was administered in the fasted state. All study participants fasted for at least 10 hours (overnight) prior to the beginning of each treatment period. During the overnight fast, participants were allowed to consume water, although no fluids were allowed for 1 hour prior to study medication dosing (except those provided with breakfast for treatment conditions A and B) and for the first hour after dosing. Subjects had no access to outside food or beverages and remained in-house the entire length of each period to maintain compliance with fasting and standardized meal conditions and fluid consumption. During the study confinement, fluid intake was restricted to water and to fluids provided with meals. No other food was allowed for the first 4 hours after dosing for all treatment conditions. After 4 hours, all participants were allowed to consume standardized meals that were served at appropriate times.</p></sec><sec><title>Meals</title><p>The standardized high-fat meal (treatment A; approximately 1,000&#x000b1;100 kcal; &#x0003e;50% fat, 13% protein, and 28% carbohydrates) consisted of eggs fried in butter, bacon, white toast with butter, hash brown potatoes fried in butter, and whole milk.<xref rid="b33-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The low-fat breakfast consisted of orange juice, whole-grain oat cereal, a hard-boiled egg, bagel with cream cheese, blueberry muffin, and 2%-fat milk (approximately 800&#x000b1;80 kcal; &#x0003c;30% fat, 14% protein, and 56% carbohydrates). Low-fat breakfasts and standardized meal contents were designed by a registered dietician and prepared at the clinical site (PPD, Austin, TX, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Blood collection and sample preparation</title><p>Blood samples were collected for PK analysis of OC and APAP plasma concentrations prior to dosing and at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing. At each time point, researchers collected 6 mL samples of whole blood from each participant in prechilled vacuum blood collection tubes containing the anticoagulant K<sub>2</sub>EDTA. Plasma samples were kept cool while processing and were frozen within 1 hour of collection at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C or below.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug concentration measurements</title><p>Plasma samples were analyzed for OC and APAP using a validated liquid chromatography (1,100 LC binary pump; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS, API3000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) method. The method used was developed by PPD (Middleton, WI, USA) and validated over a calibration range of 0.100 to 100 ng/mL for OC and 100 to 50,000 ng/mL for APAP using 0.100 mL of plasma containing K<sub>2</sub>EDTA. It was validated for linearity, precision, accuracy, ruggedness, recovery, and specificity. The calibration curves used for each analyte contained eight points (excluding 0). In addition, stability studies were carried out under short- and long-term conditions in which plasma samples were exposed to five freeze/thaw cycles.</p><p>Plasma was fortified with a combined OC-d<sub>6</sub> (Cerilliant Corp, Round Rock, TX, USA)/APAP-d<sub>4</sub> (C/D/N Isotopes Inc., Point-Claire, Quebec, Canada) internal standard working solution.

Actual sampling times were used to calculate PK parameters. The SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> mixed-effect linear model procedure (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to perform an analysis of variance to compare data from treatment conditions A, B, and C using the following natural log-transformed PK parameters: AUC from time 0 to the last quantifiable data point (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>); AUC from time 0 to infinity (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>); and the maximum observed plasma concentration (C<sub>max</sub>). AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub>, and C<sub>max</sub> were dependent variables, with sequence, treatment, and period as fixed effects, and subject nested within sequence as a random effect.

Administration of ER OC/APAP with a low-fat meal resulted in a slight but statistically significant median t<sub>lag</sub> of 15 minutes for APAP compared with fasted conditions (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). The median t<sub>max</sub> of APAP was statistically significantly delayed by 1.5 hours with meals versus times measured for the fasted state (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001 for both fed conditions). Similar to what was observed with OC, a modest but statistically significant decrease was observed with the t<sub>1/2</sub> of APAP under both fed conditions compared with the fasted condition (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety and tolerability</title><p>Of the 48 participants evaluated in the safety analysis, 33 (68.8%) reported one or more AEs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t6-dddt-8-1125">Table 6</xref>). The most frequently reported AEs were nausea (21 participants; 43.8%), vomiting (15 participants; 31.3%), and dizziness (ten participants; 20.8%). Although no statistical comparisons were performed, there were no notable differences between treatment conditions regarding these events. Seventeen (35.4%) participants experienced AEs rated by the investigators as mild, and 16 (33.3%) experienced AEs rated as moderate in intensity. There were no severe AEs, serious AEs, or deaths. All AEs resolved after discontinuation of treatment.</p><p>Most of the individual hematology and serum chemistry values were within the normal range, and no clinically significant trends in changes were apparent. One participant had an abnormal urine analysis (elevated white blood cells) during the third period (high-fat fed condition) that was considered by the investigator to be mild and unlikely related to study medication. There were no clinically significant trends or changes in mean values for vital signs, pulse oximetry, or ECGs over the assessment period.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Results from this study illustrate that the total OC and APAP exposures (AUC) from ER OC/APAP were not significantly affected by food. AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> were nearly identical under both the high- and low-fat fed conditions. For all AUC comparisons, the 90% CIs of LS mean ratios were contained completely within the predefined no-effect ranges, indicating no statistical differences in total OC or APAP exposure between fed and fasted states.</p><p>Small changes were observed in OC PK measures of C<sub>max</sub>, t<sub>max</sub>, and t<sub>lag</sub> when ER OC/APAP was administered with food. The peak exposures to OC reported under fed high- and low-fat conditions were slightly greater than those reported under fasted conditions (12% and 25%, respectively), although, under high-fat conditions, C<sub>max</sub> was not statistically different from the C<sub>max</sub> in the fasted state. There was a small increase (15 minutes) in lag for absorption of OC in the fed states that reached statistical significance, and the median t<sub>max</sub> was delayed by 1 hour in the low-fat fed state and by 2 hours in the high-fat fed state. However, these changes were small and only reached significance for the high-fat condition. Similar to extended-release OC,<xref rid="b34-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> the overall exposure to OC was not considered to be affected in a clinically relevant manner when ER OC/APAP was administered with food.</p><p>Small changes in C<sub>max</sub> and t<sub>max</sub> of APAP were also observed when ER OC/APAP was administered with food. C<sub>max</sub> decreased by approximately 24% under fed high- and low-fat conditions compared with values for the fasted state, and median t<sub>max</sub> was statistically significantly delayed by 1.5 hours under both fed conditions. In addition, median t<sub>lag</sub> was minimally but statistically significantly increased (at 15 minutes) under low-fat fed conditions. This indicates that the presence of food may slightly decrease and prolong the time to peak exposure of APAP with ER OC/APAP, which is consistent with what has been observed with other APAP formulations.<xref rid="b35-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="b36-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> However, the total systemic exposure to APAP was not affected by food, as AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> were comparable between the fed and fasted states, and all three treatments were equivalent according to the predetermined no-effect range.</p><p>Although other studies have demonstrated no significant effect of food intake on the PK variables of other ER oral opioid formulations,<xref rid="b37-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> as mentioned earlier, fed status and increased fat content of food have been shown to significantly affect the absorption of a formulation of gabapentin (up to twofold increase in AUC<sub>0&#x02013;inf</sub> following a high-fat meal) utilizing an ER delivery technology similar to that of ER OC/APAP.<xref rid="b31-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Acuform<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> gastric-retentive ER oral delivery technology has been shown to promote gastric retention and control drug delivery. The gabapentin tablet formulation swells up to three to four times in gastric juices, with a diameter larger than that of the pylorus, enabling gastric retention for about 8&#x02013;9 hours in the fed state.<xref rid="b31-dddt-8-1125" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Therefore, a comprehensive examination of the effect of food on the PK profile of ER OC/APAP was undertaken to determine if the current study medication might be affected in the same manner. This PK study of ER OC/APAP found that total OC and APAP exposures (AUC) did not significantly differ when ER OC/APAP was administered with or without food, and AUC and C<sub>max</sub> for both OC and APAP were equivalent under high- and low-fat meal states.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Small changes in C<sub>max</sub> were observed for both OC and APAP in fed versus fasted conditions; however, these differences are not expected to be clinically meaningful. ER OC/APAP was generally well tolerated and there was no indication that safety was affected by food. The modest effects on C<sub>max</sub> and the lack of effect of food on overall systemic exposure to OC and APAP, coupled with no changes in safety when administered in a fasted or fed state in this study, support the administration of ER OC/APAP with or without food.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Technical editorial and medical writing support for the development of this manuscript was provided by Lisa Bergstrom, PhD, James Bergstrom, PhD, Traci Stuve, MA (Synchrony Medical Communications, LLC, West Chester, PA), and Robert Gatley, MD, of C4 MedSolutions, LLC, A CHC Group Company, Yardley, PA.
