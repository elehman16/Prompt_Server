One such agent in widespread use is bevacizumab which was initially developed for use in oncology. Most of the evidence supporting the use of bevacizumab for nAMD has come from interventional case series and this clinical trial was initiated because of the increasing and widespread use of this agent in the treatment of nAMD (an off-label indication) despite a lack of definitive unbiased safety and efficacy data.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>The Avastin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(bevacizumab) for choroidal neovascularisation (ABC) trial is a double-masked randomised controlled trial comparing intravitreal bevacizumab injections to standard therapy in the treatment of nAMD. Patients are randomised to intravitreal bevacizumab or standard therapy available at the time of trial initiation (verteporfin photodynamic therapy, intravitreal pegaptanib or sham treatment). Ranibizumab treatment was not included in the control arm as it had not been licensed for use at the start of recruitment for this trial. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients gaining &#x02265; 15 letters of visual acuity at 1 year and secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with stable vision and mean visual acuity change.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ABC Trial is the first double-masked randomised control trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of nAMD. This trial fully recruited in November 2007 and results should be available in early 2009. Important design issues for this clinical trial include (a) defining the control group (b) use of gain in vision as primary efficacy end-point and (c) use of pro re nata treatment using intravitreal bevacizumab rather than continuous therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current controlled trials ISRCTN83325075</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of visual loss in patients over the age of 50 years in Europe and North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. There are 2 forms of the disease with dry AMD and wet AMD (neovascular or exudative AMD). Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is characterised by choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and is responsible for 75% of visual loss due to AMD despite only accounting for 25% of all cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Historically the prognosis for patients with subfoveal nAMD has been poor with the established treatment of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) only showing modest efficacy in reducing visual loss in patients with well-defined (predominantly classic or classic no occult) sub-types of nAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Until the introduction of new therapies, there was no effective treatment for poorly defined (minimally classic or occult) subtypes of nAMD.</p><p>One of the key mediators implicated in the pathogenesis of CNV in nAMD is vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF). New treatments have targeted VEGF with the introduction of agents administered by injection into the vitreous cavity with high binding specificity to VEGF (anti-VEGF agents). There are three agents which block the action of VEGF-A currently in clinical use. These agents are administered by intraocular (intravitreal) injections with repeated injection necessary every 4&#x02013;6 weeks depending on the agent.</p><p>The first drug developed and licensed for use was pegaptanib sodium (Macugen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Pfizer Inc, New York, NY). This agent is an oligonucleotide with high binding specificity for the 165 isoform of VEGF. The pivotal phase III randomised controlled trial reported a benefit in stabilising vision over sham treatment (70% of patients lost less than 15 letters of visual acuity at 1 year in treated groups compared to 55% in sham treated group) but disappointingly only 6% of treated patients improved vision by 15 letters or more at one-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Another agent which has gained favour with ophthalmologists is bevacizumab (Avastin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA). This full-length monoclonal antibody binds to and blocks the action of all isoforms of VEGF. It was initially developed as an intravenous agent in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] before ophthalmologists reported promising results using bevacizumab as an intravitreous treatment for nAMD in case series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has gained popularity worldwide as a treatment option for nAMD due to the low drug cost of treatment when used as an intraocular agent. Despite the widespread off-label ocular use of bevacizumab, there have been no definitive prospective, double-masked, randomised, controlled trials investigating the safety and efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab for the treatment of nAMD.</p><p>Ranibizumab (Lucentis<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Genentech Inc., San Francisco, CA) is an antibody fragment developed from the bevacizumab molecule with increased binding affinity for all isoforms of VEGF. It has been shown to be more efficacious than sham treatment (placebo) in treating minimally classic or occult CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and PDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] in treating predominantly classic CNV. Patients treated with monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab for 1&#x02013;2 years showed better visual acuity outcomes than patients treated with sham or PDT (40&#x02013;33% of ranibizumab treated patients improving visual acuity by 15 letters or more compared to 4% of sham treated and 6% of PDT treated patients). Ranibizumab was licensed for use in the treatment of nAMD after the start of recruitment for this study and so was not included as a comparator arm. Randomised controlled trials comparing bevacizumab to ranibizumab have commenced recruitment but are likely to take a further 2&#x02013;3 years before they report outcome data. In addition it is important to consider that a 4 weekly dosing interval for both bevacizumab and ranibizumab is planned to be used in these trials, which, given that studies have suggested a 6 weekly dosing schedule may be adequate for intravitreal bevacizumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], eliminates one of the main potential advantages bevacizumab over ranibizumab &#x02013; the need for less intravitreal injections and less intensive patient follow-up.</p><p>In 2005, the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of nAMD was increasing both in the USA and Europe as ophthalmologists had received early promising reports of efficacy from interventional case series with approximately 1/3 of patients improving vision. At that time, the only licensed agents in the treatment of subfoveal nAMD were PDT and intravitreal pegaptanib injections which though associated with reducing visual loss, had shown only modest efficacy in improving vision (only approximately 5&#x02013;6% of patients improving vision with either of these agents in randomised controlled trials). In addition to perceived better efficacy, repackaging pharmacies provide intravitreal bevacizumab for a fraction of the cost of pegaptanib, verteporfin or ranibizumab. However there are no large scale prospective, double-masked, randomised controlled trials supporting the use of bevacizumab for nAMD and there was therefore a need to design a clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab injections to standard therapy (PDT or pegaptanib) in the treatment of nAMD.</p><p>The current trial is designed to investigate whether intravitreal bevacizumab injections are an effective and safe treatment for nAMD when compared to standard therapy. It will also provide exploratory data on the efficacy of bevacizumab when compared to either PDT, pegaptanib or sham treatment alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p>Double-masked, randomised, controlled trial with 2 parallel treatment groups. Eligible patients were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either intravitreal bevacizumab or standard therapy (either PDT, pegaptanib intravitreal injections or sham intravitreal injections). Only one eye per patient was included in the study and this was selected prior to randomisation. Standard therapy was determined prior to trial enrolment at which point patients were allocated to treatment groups by minimisation &#x02013; a dynamic process which reduces the imbalance between trial arms with respect to standard treatment eligibility and site. During trial recruitment, patients with well-defined (classic, no occult or predominantly classic CNV) were funded for PDT in line with National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance. However there was no national funding in place for patients with poorly defined forms of nAMD (minimally classic or occult CNV) as PDT had not shown efficacy over natural history for these lesion subtypes and the new anti-VEGF agents (pegaptanib and ranibizumab) had not been subject to appraisal by NICE. National Health Service (NHS) treatment was delivered on a case by case basis with many patients not funded for NHS treatment. Eligible patients with minimally classic or occult no classic CNV were either randomised to pegaptanib or sham treatment (based on funding of pegaptanib therapy). A summary of the enrolment and randomisation process in shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Summary of trial design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-9-56-1"/></fig><p>During the later stages of trial recruitment, after ranibizumab had been introduced into clinical practice, if patients were funded for ranibizumab, they were excluded from enrolment to this clinical trial. At the time of recruitment for this trial, since many patients who were refused public funding of treatment did not have medical insurance and could not afford the costs of private treatment, a significant proportion of patients remained untreated and therefore would consider involvement in a trial in which they were randomised to active treatment (intravitreal bevacizumab) or to a sham arm. Previous precedents for such active treatment versus sham or no treatment trial included the pegaptanib VISION trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] or the Lucentis MARINA trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The ABC trial fully recruited its patient population before final NICE guidance was issued on the use of pegaptanib or ranibizumab for treating nAMD in the NHS.</p><sec><title>Objectives</title><sec><title>Primary</title><p>To test the hypothesis that in patients being treated for choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), intravitreal bevacizumab injections can improve visual acuity (defined as a gain of &#x02265; 15 letters) in the treated eye in a greater proportion of patients than standard therapy after 12 months</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary</title><p>To test the hypothesis that in patients being treated for CNV due to age-related macular degeneration (nAMD):</p><p>1.

Intravitreal bevacizumab injections</title><p>Bevacizumab was administered by six weekly intravitreal injections (dose of 1.25 mg in 0.05 ml per injection) and a treatment strategy of 3 treatments with further injections as needed based on investigator driven retreatment with standardised retreatment criteria was used reflecting the real world use of this agent at the time of the trial (3 to 9 injections in total in 54 weeks). The bevacizumab injections were prepared by Moorfields Pharmaceuticals in line with UK pharmaceutical regulatory standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Control intervention. Intravitreal pegaptanib injections</title><p>These were given as per the product license with a dose of 0.3 mg of pegaptanib in 0.09 ml given as continuous therapy by intravitreal injection every 6 weeks for 1 year (9 injections in 54 weeks). This reflects the dosing and frequency of treatment used in the pivotal VISION randomised controlled trial reporting the efficacy and safety of pegaptanib in the treatment of nAMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Control intervention. Verteporfin photodynamic therapy</title><p>Verteporfin PDT is performed as described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Briefly, an unmasked trial member not involved in any outcome assessments and trained in the importance of maintaining masking prepares an infusion of verteporfin (6 mg/m<sup>2 </sup>of body surface area) in 30 ml of 5% dextrose after calculating body surface area from a nomogram based on the height and weight of the patient. Intravenous infusion of the solution is given over 10 minutes after covering the infusion line and pump to maintain masking (the solution is green). Fifteen minutes after the start of the infusion, the unmasked ophthalmologist applies laser light (diode laser 689 nm) for 83 seconds (light exposure of 50 J/cm<sup>2</sup>, intensity 600 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) to the CNV lesion through a fundus contact lens of known magnification. The laser spot size for each treatment is determined by measuring the greatest linear diameter of the CNV lesion on fluorescein angiography and adding an addition 1000 &#x003bc;m in order to provide an additional margin of 500 &#x003bc;m around the lesion. After the treatment the patient is advised to avoid bright sunlight for 48 hours to prevent possible photosensitive reactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Placebo treatment. Sham intravitreal injections</title><p>In line with previous randomised controlled trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], sham intravitreal injections rather than placebo intravitreal injections of vehicle are used. Sham injections are performed by following the procedure used to prepare the eye for injection but instead of an intravitreal injection, the hub of an empty 1 ml syringe is applied firmly to the conjunctiva to mimic an active injection. This procedure is ethically acceptable as it does not subject the patient to the potential risk of sight-threatening infection associated with intravitreal injections whilst maintaining masking by closely resembling an active injection procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures to maintain masking</title><sec><title>Placebo PDT</title><p>This is used for patients randomised to bevacizumab in cases in which standard care is PDT. The procedure is identical to that used for active verteporfin PDT except 5% dextrose is used as placebo with no verteporfin added. This is in line with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Care was taken to ensure that the intravenous infusion pump and line were covered as the active verteporfin solution is green while the placebo infusion is a clear solution.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional use of sham injections</title><p>As the treatment of patients randomized to bevacizumab or pegaptanib involves the comparison of a pro re nata treatment (bevacizumab) to a treatment given continuously (nine, six weekly intravitreal injections of pegaptanib), to maintain masking, sham treatments were given to patients randomised to bevacizumab not requiring intravitreal treatment at that visit (weeks 18 to 48) based on the standardised retreatment criteria. This was to maintain masking as pegaptanib was delivered as continuous therapy (as per the product license) whereas bevacizumab was given as 3 initial injections with further retreatment as necessary using standardised retreatment criteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Evaluating the success of masking</title><p>Adequacy of masking was assessed by means of a questionnaire to patients and the masked investigator when the patient left the study to determine views on treatment allocation</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Primary</title><p>1. Visual acuity score</p><p>An improvement in visual acuity is defined as a gain of 15 letters or more (3 lines) of best corrected visual acuity score at the 12 month time point compared with baseline, using ETDRS visual acuity charts and visual acuity measurement at a starting distance of 4 metres.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary</title><p>1. Other visual acuity based outcomes</p><p>In addition to the conventional end-point of 15 or more letter gain in visual acuity, more recently a clinical trial visual acuity end-point of 10 or more letters has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and so the proportion of patients improving visual acuity using this end-point in both the bevacizumab treated and standard therapy treated group will also be described and analysed as a secondary outcome measure for the 6 month and 12 month time-points. Other alternative end-points of the proportion of patients gaining 5 or more letters and patient losing less than 15 letters of best corrected visual acuity score will also be examined similarly as secondary end-points. The mean change in visual acuity in the two groups at 12 months will also be reported.</p><p>2. Optical Coherence Tomography based retinal thickness measurement</p><p>Stratus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc) was used to obtain retinal thickness measurements using fast macular thickness mapping scan protocol. Radial line scanning (or cross-hairs when radial line scans not possible) was used to determine the presence or absence of macular fluid (intra-retinal cysts and sub-retinal fluid) at each visit. The mean change in macular thickness in the bevacizumab and standard therapy groups at the 6 and 12 month time-points will be reported.</p><p>3.

Both ocular and systemic adverse events will be noted. There will also be a specific report of any adverse events meeting the Antiplatelet Trialists' Collaboration (APTC) criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. As this is a double-masked trial, adverse events will be reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) who may ask to be unmasked to treatment allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Visit schedule and assessments</title><p>Randomisation and treatment occur up to 14 days after a screening visit (or on the same day). After baseline treatment, patients attended again at week 1 for a safety visit (no treatment given). Further follow-up visits with repeat treatment occurred at week 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and week 48. The study exit visit occurs at week 54 (1 year). This gives 9 treatment visits with the first 3 intravitreal bevacizumab treatments compulsory (baseline, week 6 and week 12) with further treatments as needed based on standardised retreatment criteria (at weeks 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48). Safety assessments consist of recording all adverse events, monitoring of blood pressure and pulse at every visit with blood tests at baseline, week 24 and study exit (week 54).</p><p>Study assessments include functional outcome measures including best-corrected visual acuity assessments, contrast sensitivity measurement and measurement of reading ability (using MNREAD acuity charts). Structural outcome was assessed at every visit using OCT measures of retinal thickness and qualitative features of CNV activity. Fundus fluorescein angiography was performed at baseline and weeks 6, 12, 24, 36 48 and week 54 visits (with additional fluorescein angiography at week 1 for the first 20% of patients) to allow assessment of any change in CNV size and leak. The trial visits are summarised in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Summary of trial visits.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1745-6215-9-56-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Trial size</title><p>A Fisher's exact test with a 0.050 two-sided significance level will have 90% power to detect the difference between a Group 1 proportion, &#x003c0;<sub>1</sub>, of 0.300 and a Group 2 proportion, &#x003c0;<sub>2</sub>, of 0.060 when the sample size in each group is 57.

The proportion of patients who gain 15 letters of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) or more in each group at 12 months will be provided with 95% confidence intervals computed by the exact binomial method. A Fisher's exact test will be conducted to assess whether or not any observed difference in these proportions is statistically significant. Odds ratios will be reported together with 95% confidence intervals to illustrate the contrast between bevacizumab and standard treatment. If any imbalance in prognostic factors is detected, logistic regression will be conducted to assess the impact of any imbalance and adjusted odds ratios reported. Data will be analysed according to the group to which patients were originally assigned (i.e. intent to treat). In addition to the intention to treat analysis, a per protocol analysis will be carried out.</p><p>The proportion of patients in each group who at 6 and 12 months have</p><p>a) gained 5 letters of BCVA</p><p>b) gained 10 or more letters of BCVA</p><p>c) lost fewer than 15 letters of BCVA</p><p>will be reported with 95% confidence intervals together with a description of the average change in OCT determined central macular thickness and BCVA at 12 months.

However, most of the evidence supporting its use comes from interventional case and in this age of evidence-based medicine, there is no data from prospective, double-masked, multi-centre randomised controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of intravitreal bevacizumab to other therapies in the treatment of nAMD. The Avastin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(bevacizumab) for CNV trial will be the first definitive, prospective, double-masked, multi-centre, randomised controlled trial reporting unbiased efficacy and safety data for intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of nAMD with results expected in early 2009.</p><p>In addition, the trial will provide information about the effect of treatment on structural (qualitative and quantitative OCT measures) and other functional outcome measures (including contrast sensitivity and reading ability). Exploratory analyses including possible prognostic indicators will also be of interest.</p><p>The Avastin<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>(bevacizumab) for CNV trial incorporates several novel features in the trial design. In contrast to previous multi-centre randomised controlled trials in the field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], this study is the first to use visual gain as the primary outcome measure rather than stabilisation in vision with secondary outcomes including mean visual acuity change to maximise use of data points. This shift from stabilisation to visual gain as the primary end-point reflects the changing expectation of both patients and physicians in the treatment of nAMD.</p><p>Treatment in the comparator or control arm is determined by funding of standard therapy. This may be viewed as both a strength and a weakness of the study. Though not allowing comparison with a single agent, the choice of a comparator arm with one of 3 different treatments (2 active and one sham) reflects the usual treatment of patients in the NHS at the time of recruitment. It does not undermine the analysis of results as all treatments in the comparator arm have shown to offer patients a similar chance of improvement in vision (a maximum proportion of 0.06 improving vision with either comparator treatment at one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]). Ranibizumab was not one of the therapies included in the comparator arm as this drug only reached market after the start of recruitment and was not widely available during the recruitment phase of this trial.</p><p>Another novel design feature is the use of pro re nata treatment with bevacizumab (based on investigator determined retreatment with standardised retreatment criteria) after three initial treatments. This approach reflects clinical practice with clinicians using retreatment criteria to determine further treatment with anti-VEGF agents and should make the results more translatable into clinical practice. However this is distinct from the approach taken in the pivotal anti-VEGF agent trials in which a continuous treatment strategy was used. The use of continuous pegaptanib (reflecting the product license for pegaptanib) in the comparator arm is identical to the dosing used in the phase III trial comparing pegaptanib to sham treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The ABC trial is the first multi-centre randomised controlled trial to use OCT in all patients both using retinal thickness data to assess outcome and to use qualitative interpretation of scans in deciding on retreatment of patients with AMD. Previous randomised trials have used OCT only in a sub-set of patients with no use of OCT based retreatment criteria.</p><p>In summary, the ABC trial uses a pragmatic yet high-quality trial design to evaluate the efficacy of intravitreal bevacizumab in the treatment of nAMD. The treatment strategy used reflects the clinical use of bevacizumab in treating nAMD and should help clinicians in translating the results from the trial into clinical practice. The trial aims to augment the evidence base for therapeutic options in the treatment of nAMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PJP participated in development of the trial protocol and the trial design, coordinated the trial's set-up at Moorfields Eye Hospital and facilitated the set-up of the other study sites in London; prepared the trial's manual of operations, study documentation and publicity and drafted the manuscript.
