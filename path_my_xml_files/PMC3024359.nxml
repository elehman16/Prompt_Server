As such, chronic use of GCs was associated with odds ratios between 1.4 and 2.3 to develop diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Loss of glycemic control during GC use is particularly due to impaired postprandial glucose metabolism, whereas fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels are usually only mildly elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Although the exact prevalence of steroid-related diabetes is unknown, the widespread use of GCs indicates that it may represent a major clinical problem worldwide.</p><p>When initiating GC therapy in current clinical practice, preventive pharmacologic measures are taken to prevent some of the GC-related side effects, most notably osteoporosis and peptic ulcer disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Despite the highly prevalent occurrence of steroid diabetes, to date, no strategies have been undertaken to prevent the adverse metabolic effects of GC treatment. Previous studies showed that metformin and the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone were unable to mitigate the effects of GCs on glucose tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), whereas the thiazolidinedione troglitazone prevented GC-induced hyperglycemia by enhancing GC clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Because of liver toxicity, however, troglitazone is no longer available for treatment in humans.</p><p>The gut hormone glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 and synthetic dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 resistant GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as exenatide (EXE), lower blood glucose by, glucose-dependently, enhancing insulin secretion and production and inhibiting glucagon secretion, and by slowing down gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). One year of EXE treatment was shown to improve clamp-measured &#x003b2;-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The GLP-1 RA exendin-4 was shown to prevent GC-induced &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). In a single patient with Cushing disease, GLP-1 infusion was as effective in lowering blood glucose levels compared with patients with &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). GLP-1 infusion effectively reduced stress hyperglycemia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>Given these beneficial effects of GLP-1 RA treatment and the pathophysiologic defects underlying GC-induced glucose intolerance and diabetes, we aimed to assess whether intravenous (IV) infusion of the GLP-1 RA EXE could prevent the acute adverse effects of prednisolone (PRED) treatment on glucose metabolism, islet-cell function, and insulin sensitivity in healthy normoglycemic individuals.</p><sec id="s5"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s6"><title>Participants</title><p>Eight healthy men were recruited via local advertisements.

On day 2, participants underwent a combined clamp procedure, starting with a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and followed by a hyperglycemic clamp with subsequent arginine stimulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc10-1677/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). The three 2-day treatment blocks were separated by at least 4 weeks. Participants were instructed to refrain from intense physical activity 2 days before each treatment block.</p><p>The primary end point was the 4-h glucose area under the curve (AUC<sub>G</sub>) during the meal challenge test. From previous studies, we expected an increase in AUC<sub>G</sub> of 400 mmol/L &#x022c5; 240 min after PRED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). A sample size of eight would provide 80% power to detect a significant reduction of 50% by EXE of PRED-induced augmentation of AUC<sub>G</sub>. Secondary end points included first- and second-phase C-peptide incremental area under the curve (iAUC<sub>CP</sub>) and arginine-stimulated C-peptide secretion (ASI-iAUC<sub>CP</sub>) during the hyperglycemic clamp.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Standardized meal challenge</title><p>On day 1 of each treatment block, participants underwent a standardized meal challenge test after an overnight fast of minimally 10 h. The meal contained 905 kcal (50 g fat, 75 g carbohydrates, 35 g protein) and 1 g liquid acetaminophen to estimate gastric emptying rates. Samples for determination of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, acetaminophen, and EXE were obtained at times &#x02212;120, &#x02212;60, &#x02212;30, 0, 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 240 min, with the meal beginning immediately after the time 0 sample and consumed within 15 min. Eighty mg oral PRED or PLB was ingested 2 h before meal consumption and IV. EXE or SAL infusion started 60 min before the meal at an infusion rate of 40 ng/min for 30 min and was decreased to 20 ng/min for the remainder of the test (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc10-1677/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and hyperglycemic clamp</title><p>On day 2 of each block, a combined hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp procedure was done. After an overnight fast, an indwelling cannula was inserted into an antecubital vein for infusion of glucose and insulin. To obtain arterialized venous blood samples, a retrograde cannula was inserted in a contralateral wrist vein and maintained in a heated box at 50&#x000b0;C. Insulin was infused at a rate of 40 mU/m<sup>2</sup> &#x022c5; min for 120 min; plasma glucose was kept at 5 mmol/L by a variable infusion of 20% glucose. The hyperglycemic clamp was started 90 min after cessation of exogenous insulin infusion. Plasma glucose concentration was then increased to 10 mmol/L by a body weight-adjusted IV bolus of 20% glucose, and a variable 20% glucose infusion was adjusted to maintain the targeted glucose level. After 80 min of hyperglycemia, an IV bolus of 5 g arginine (dissolved in 50 ml) was given over 45 s, and the glucose level was maintained at 10 mmol/L for 30 min. Oral PRED or PLB (80 mg) was administered 2 h before initiation of hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. IV EXE or SAL infusion was started 60 min before the start of the hyperglycemic clamp at an infusion rate of 40 ng/min for 30 min and was decreased to 20 ng/min for the rest of the hyperglycemic clamp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc10-1677/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></ext-link>). Note that EXE was not infused during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, because in a pilot study, EXE strongly induced insulin secretion at a glucose level of 5 mmol/L. The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp was performed to be able to calculate the disposition index (DI) (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Study medication</title><p>PRED tablets were purchased from Pfizer AB (Sollentuna, Sweden), and PLB tablets were obtained from Xendo Drug Development (Groningen, the Netherlands).

Commercially available EXE was purchased (Pharmacy VU University Medical Center) and diluted in saline containing 1% human serum albumin, forming a colorless solution. IV administration of EXE was chosen to be able to gain steady-state EXE levels within a short period of time.

This study is the first to demonstrate that treatment with the GLP-1RA EXE prevents PRED-induced glucose intolerance as assessed by a standardized meal challenge test. During the hyperglycemic clamp, EXE infusion restored PRED-induced impairment of &#x003b2;-cell function variables and even significantly improved a number of these variables relative to the control situation. In contrast with the findings observed during the clamp procedure, EXE treatment given during the meal challenge improved glucose tolerance but resulted in decreased insulin plasma levels. This observation is in line with a previous study in healthy individuals in whom subcutaneous EXE treatment reduced postprandial glucose excursions despite significantly lower insulin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The glucose-lowering effects of EXE were attributed to decreased glucagon secretion and gastric emptying, and because of its glucose-dependent mode of action, EXE did not further stimulate insulin secretion in the presence of normoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Our study similarly found reduced postprandial glucagon secretion and gastric emptying after EXE treatment. Studies using stable isotope techniques have demonstrated that EXE may also reduce hepatic glucose output and increase whole-body glucose disposal in the postprandial state, independently of its more established effects on islet hormone secretion and gastric emptying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In our study, EXE improved whole-body insulin sensitivity during the meal challenge as estimated by the Matsuda index; however, reduced glucose appearance resulting from decreased gastric emptying seemed primarily responsible for improving glucose tolerance. We did not assess the effects of EXE on whole-body insulin sensitivity during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp for previous mentioned reasons.</p><p>In this proof-of-principle study, both treatment regimens were administered for a short period of time, that is, for 2 consecutive days per study block. Although the acute metabolic effects of both PRED and EXE may to some extent differ from their effects after prolonged administration, it provides a good model to study the effects of each of both drugs and their interaction. IV EXE infusion was able to prevent the acute adverse effects of PRED on glucose tolerance, and additional benefits from EXE treatment may be expected when both compounds are administered for a more prolonged time period. Chronic GC use is associated with increased appetite, significant weight gain, increased visceral fat mass, altered secretion of adipocytokines, and dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), all of which contribute to the adverse effects of GCs on glucose metabolism. In clinical studies in patients with T2DM, chronic EXE treatment was shown to reduce appetite, resulting in substantial weight loss, decreased truncal fat mass, and increased secretion of adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Also, EXE improved postprandial dyslipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The strong reduction of postprandial glucose levels by EXE, rather than a pronounced effect on FPG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), matches the profile of GC-induced hyperglycemia, which is predominantly present during the day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>During the hyperglycemic clamp experiments, pharmacologic concentrations of EXE were able to restore PRED-induced changes in &#x003b2;-cell function, including first-phase and ASI C-peptide secretion and DI calculated for the entire hyperglycemic clamp. GC exposure was demonstrated to impair various pathways in the &#x003b2;-cell in vitro. These include both steps in the uptake and metabolism of glucose, but GCs also affected distal pathways in the insulin exocytosis process, resulting in impaired insulin secretion in response to different secretagogues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Because EXE was able to restore insulin secretion, one may speculate that GCs do not block the pathways mediating GLP-1 action on &#x003b2;-cells. However, it was recently reported that a 2-week treatment with oral PRED reduced the insulinotropic effects of endogenous GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>A limitation of our study is that we treated healthy subjects with GCs. GCs are prescribed to treat acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, as well as autoimmune diseases. Chronic inflammation is also associated with whole-body insulin resistance and &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction, as recently reported in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Therefore, the complex interrelationship among inflammation, GC, and GLP-1RA treatment needs to be studied prospectively in relevant patient populations.</p><p>The plasma levels of EXE reached with our infusion protocol were lower than those usually obtained after subcutaneous injection of EXE 10 &#x003bc;g b.i.d. (the recommended dose for the current treatment in T2DM). Although good efficacy was demonstrated by current plasma EXE levels, the full potential of GLP-1 RA treatment to prevent PRED-induced glucose intolerance may be fully unveiled in clinical studies administering EXE at the usual dose.</p><p>This study provides evidence that the GLP-1 RA EXE may prevent PRED-induced glucose intolerance and restore islet-cell functional balance. Long-term studies in relevant populations should explore the potential of GLP-1 RA treatment as a novel strategy to prevent steroid diabetes.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
