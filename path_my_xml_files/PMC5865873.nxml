Patients with CHB, in addition to liver stagnation and spleen deficiency syndrome were randomly assigned to receive either Chinese (mXCHD) or western (entecavir) treatment, with 30 cases in each group. Serum was collected following treatment with mXCHD or entecavir for 7 days. A healthy group of 30 individuals was also included. HepG2.2.15 cells were cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> and randomly divided into four groups: Healthy; entecavir-treated; 10% mXCHD-treated; and 20% mXCHD-treated. The HepG2.2.15 cells in the four groups were treated with either serum from the healthy volunteers, entecavir-containing serum, or mXCHD-containing serum at different concentrations (10 or 20%, respectively). Following treatment with the corresponding serum, cell proliferation was examined using an MTT assay, and the expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the cell supernatant was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mRNA and protein expression levels of Janus kinase (JAK)2 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 were measured using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses, respectively. The results indicated that the most effective treatment for the promotion of HepG2.2.15 cell proliferation was a 20% concentration of mXCHD serum. The expression of HBsAg was significantly decreased in the groups treated with 10 and 20% mXCHD 48 h following intervention (P&#x0003c;0.01). The mRNA and protein expression levels of STAT3 in the 20% mXCHD serum group were significantly increased, compared with those in the healthy group (P&#x0003c;0.01 and P&#x0003c;0.05, respectively), whereas no significant difference was observed in the expression of JAK2 among the four groups. These results indicated that mXCHD suppressed the hepatitis B virus, and treatment of the cells with mXCHD-containing serum promoted HepG2.2.15 cell proliferation via modulating the expression of STAT3, which may contribute to the clinical efficacy of mXCHD against CHB.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chinese medicine</kwd><kwd>chronic hepatitis B</kwd><kwd>HepG2.2.15 cell</kwd><kwd>Xiaochaihu decoction</kwd><kwd>human drug-containing serum</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatitis B is the most common serious liver infection worldwide. Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major public health concern, affecting ~240,000,000 individuals with chronically infection, and leading to ~650,000 individuals each year succumbing to CHB-associated mortality worldwide (<xref rid="b1-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The major complications of CHB are cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (<xref rid="b2-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b3-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Antiviral agents with activity against hepatitis B virus (HBV) are available. CHB can be treated with drugs, including interferons, and antiviral agents, including nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA), which have been shown to suppress HBV replication, prevent its progression to cirrhosis, and reduce the risk of HCC (<xref rid="b4-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, current available treatment methods fail to eradicate the virus in the majority of those treated. In addition, long-term NA therapy does not guarantee protection against the development of HCC or CBH-associated mortality in patients with cirrhosis (<xref rid="b5-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).</p><p>Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used in China and is becoming increasingly prevalent in Europe and America. Since ~1950, the scientific evaluation of herbs used for the treatment of viral hepatitis has been undertaken in China, including clinical investigations of complex formulas and isolated components, isolation of active constituents, and assessment of crude herb extracts and purified components in laboratory animals. Several complex formulas and crude materials used in Chinese medicines have been shown to have measurable activity against viral hepatitis, including Xiaochaihu decoction (XCHD) (<xref rid="b6-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>XCHD, a TCM clinical prescription, has advanced the treatment of hepatobiliary diseases in China (<xref rid="b9-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).

Largehead atractylodes rhizome, <italic>Poria cocos</italic>, white peony root and <italic>Fructus schisandrae</italic> have hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects (<xref rid="b28-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In the present study, HepG2.2.15 cells were cultured with the sera of patients treated with mXCHD. Following treatment with the drug-containing serum for 48 h, the cell viability, level of HBsAg, and expression levels of JAK2 and STAT3 of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway were detected.</p><p>Serum pharmacology is a novel method used to investigate traditional Chinese herbs. This technique overcomes the various disadvantages of applying drugs directly to cells. Following the oral administration of traditional Chinese herbs, various ingredients are absorbed into the blood through the gastrointestinal tract and are transformed into bioactive ingredients. Cells treated with serum containing TCMs <italic>in vitro</italic> provide conditions similar to those of cells found <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, serum pharmacology experiments on Chinese herbal medicines performed <italic>in vitro</italic> may produce results with reliable consistency to corresponding experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>. In the majority of associated investigations into serum pharmacology, experimental animals, including rats and rabbits, are administered with the drug through their feed, and animal serum containing the drug is used to treat cells in culture <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the present study, human serum containing the drug was used under the preconditions of medical ethics approval and provision of informed consent. Drugs may produce novel active substances or stimulate the body to produce other active substances by metabolism following absorption. Therefore, theresults of adding the drug-containing serum <italic>in vitro</italic> are similar to those observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, particularly for Chinese herbs. Following oral absorption and metabolism of the anti-HBV TCM compound, the human serum containing the drug was added to the HepG2.2.15 cell culture, to more closely resemble the real status of drug metabolism <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In the present study, the proliferation of HepG2.2.15 cells was detected using an MTT assay following treatment with a range of concentrations of mXCHD serum for 48 h. The results demonstrated that serum containing mXCHD was not toxic towards the cells, and it increased cell activity. Without drug intervention, the level of HBV in the supernatant of cell cultures increased with proliferation of the HepG2.2.15 cells. The mXCHD-containing serum inhibited the expression of HBsAg at 10 and 20%. Following intervention with mXCHD, normal growth of the HepG2.2.15 cells was maintained with no effect on cell proliferation, and the HBsAg content of HBV in the supernatant was also reduced. This indicated that HBV was effectively suppressed, which is consistent with the results expected in the clinical treatment of CHB. As drug-containing serum from HBV-infected patients was used for cell culture in the present study, the HBsAg concentration in the supernatant of the cell cultures in the mXCHD group were not only from the HepG2.2.15 cells, but also the human drug-containing serum of the patients with CHB. There was no HBV or HBsAg in the sera of healthy volunteers, and their sera was used in one of the cell groups as a healthy control group. The effect of mXCHD on HBsAg was analyzed by comparing the changes in the level of HBsAg prior to and following treatment with 10 and 20% mXCHD-containing serum.</p><p>The JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway transmits information from extracellular chemical signals to the nucleus, resulting in DNA transcription and the expression of genes involved in immunity, proliferation, inflammation, apoptosis and oncogenesis. The protein expression levels of several members of this pathway can be observed in liver tissues. These proteins are also involved in the wound-healing process in the liver. The liver has a regenerative function, in which the proliferative and regenerative function of hepatocytes promote repair of the injured liver. It has been shown that STAT3 is closely associated with the liver. With further investigations, the importance of STAT3 in the protection of the liver is likely to be gradually elucidated. STAT3 has notable anti-apoptotic and mitogenic abilities, and it can upregulate the expression of several genes associated with cell survival and proliferation. When liver cells are damaged, the expression of STAT3 increases following acute stress, the binding force to DNA strengthens, and the expression of Cyclin D1 is activated directly or indirectly. Cell mitosis then accelerates and stimulates liver cell proliferation (<xref rid="b29-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36-mmr-16-05-7416" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, the mRNA and protein expression levels of STAT3 in cells were significantly upregulated by culture in serum containing mXCHD, whereas those of JAK2 were unaffected. It was hypothesized that mXCHD can promote the upregulation of STAT3, and the latter is involved in the wound-healing process in the liver. The promotion of the proliferation and regeneration of hepatocytes through the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway may be one of the important mechanisms underlying the effect of mXCHD against CHB. The JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, particularly STAT3, has a regulatory role in protection of the liver, which merits further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that mXCHD not only inhibited HBV, but also stimulated hepatocyte proliferation by upregulating the expression of STAT3. In the present study, the two detection time points of 48 and 144 h post-drug intervention were used. Due to limited funding, the extent of the experiments was limited. Therefore, further discussions and investigations are required, with the inclusion ofadditional time points for detection. The data obtained improves understanding of the effects and mechanisms of mXCHD in the treatment of CHB. However, which of the components of this herbal medicine contribute to these effects remains to be elucidated. Therefore, further investigations of the individual components of mXCHD are required in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The present study was supported by the
