</p><p>Although the optimal means of eliminating children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS in the home is for caregivers to quit smoking, it is apparent that this cannot always be successfully or sustainably achieved.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Where quitting smoking is not desired by or not achievable for caregivers, a &#x02018;next best option&#x02019; to reduce children&#x02019;s exposure is to support caregivers in making their homes completely smoke free.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> A range of approaches based on behaviour change theories and educational strategies has been proposed to help to protect children from exposure to SHS and to promote smoke-free homes (SFHs) for children.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> However, a review of interventions aimed at promoting SFHs,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and a systematic review<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and separate meta-analysis<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> of interventions aimed at reducing children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS have found mixed evidence for effectiveness that was insufficient to recommend any one specific interventional strategy over another. A more recent systematic review<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> and meta-analysis highlighted that measuring the effectiveness of SHS interventions can be problematic. It concluded that, although some studies that had used objective measures of SHS exposure had shown to be effective in reducing exposure to SHS in the home, air contamination through SHS was still overall significant following the intervention in the study homes. The authors further acknowledged that it is important that further effective interventions to promote SFHs are developed.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>On the basis of a UK feasibility study, which showed that providing families with personalised home air quality feedback combined with a motivational interviewing approach had potential to improve home air quality,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and findings from our own development work,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> we designed a complex intervention comprising behavioural and pharmacological support including personalised indoor air quality feedback. We hypothesised that air quality and other markers of SHS exposure (eg, saliva cotinine) and smoking behaviour (eg, numbers of cigarettes smoked in the home per day) in homes receiving the complex intervention would be significantly decreased compared with homes that did not. We now report results from a randomised controlled trial assessing the effectiveness of this intervention in reducing children&#x02019;s exposure to SHS in the home.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design</title><p>We conducted an open-label, parallel, randomised controlled trial in deprived communities in Nottingham City and County in England.

Potential participants who were already trying to quit smoking or had attempted to do so in the 3 months preceding recruitment were excluded, as were pregnant smokers, those planning a pregnancy or breast&#x000a0;feeding during the intervention period, those with health-based contraindications to nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) use and those living in hostels or refuges.</p><p>Participants were recruited from 81 English &#x02018;Sure Start&#x02019; Children&#x02019;s Centres across Nottinghamshire, which offer free services for disadvantaged families with children up to 5 years of age, designed to improve health, language and readiness to learn before school.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Potential participants were identified and approached with the help of Children&#x02019;s Centre managers and through attendance of &#x02018;outreach&#x02019; activities such as play sessions.

Participants completed questionnaires on socioeconomic status, their own and the index child&#x02019;s health, family and household composition, current smoking behaviour and beliefs relating to home smoking with children Indoor air was sampled for up to 24&#x02009;hours using a Sidepak Aerosol Monitor AM510 (TSI Instruments Ltd, High Wycombe, UK), positioned in the main living area. Monitors were set with the calibration factor of 0.30 by the manufacturer to measure particle sizes of secondhand smoke.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> PM<sub>2.5</sub> data were logged at 60&#x02009;s intervals throughout the data collection period, which varied between 16 and 24&#x02009;hours, depending on when a collection of the monitor could be arranged with participants. Two air monitors were affected by calibration error, resulting in their calibration factor being set to 1.0 for a period of time throughout the study. Affected data were converted to the correct calibration level retrospectively using <italic>Trackpro</italic> software in a standard approach, and participants&#x000a0;were notified. Saliva samples to measure cotinine, the major proximate metabolite of nicotine and a biological marker for SHS exposure<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16 22</xref> were taken from the index study child during the home visit by a member of the research team in the presence of the caregiver, using appropriate swabs (<italic>Salimetrics</italic> infant swabs).

Participants were provided with samples of small quantities of the NRT products to support an informed choice on which one (or which combination) may be best suited to them. Suitability and use were reviewed during the 1&#x02013;2 weeks proactive phone call and at each home visit and a further 4 or 5 weeks of product dispensed at the 3-week and 7-week visits, if appropriate.

On completion of the study at week 12, all participants in the usual care group received graphical feedback on their home air quality data and basic behavioural advice supported by the offer of 1 month&#x02019;s supply of free NRT products for temporary abstinence and/or cutting down dispensed by the SFHA. During the course of the study, the &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; resource pack offered by the local SSS was discontinued as standard care.

Secondary outcome measures, also compared between treatment groups, included maximum concentrations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>, the proportion of time PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations exceeded WHO recommended levels of maximum exposure of 25&#x02009;&#x000b5;g/m<sup>3</sup> per 24&#x02009;hours period,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> salivary cotinine levels in the index child, caregiver-reported cigarette consumption in the home, caregivers&#x02019; Heaviness of Smoking Index (HSI),<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>; determination to quit, quit attempts and quitting altogether.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An intention-to-treat analysis was performed using all randomised participants. Data on air quality were considered sufficient for analysis where 16&#x02009;hours or more of particulate matter measurements had been obtained. The sample size was defined as 100 participating households per group, powered at 83% assuming alpha 0.05 and calculated to detect a 33% reduction between baseline and week 12 in log-transformed mean home air quality (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) in the intervention group compared with the usual care group.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
</p><p>The primary outcome was compared between intervention and control groups using multiple linear regression, adjusted for baseline (basic model), and then adjusted for season, partner&#x02019;s smoking status and multiple deprivation index as prognostic variables (adjusted model). Our primary analysis used a multiple imputation model, assuming that those participants who refused consent for follow-up were missing at random and included all relevant variables to predict average PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the model (HSI, number of cigarettes smoked daily inside the house, demographic characteristics and the outcome measure). We carried out a range of sensitivity analyses using alternative assumptions about the missing data (complete case and last observation carried forward), using specific models for data over repeated measures (mixed model), excluding those participants with affected air quality readings due to calibration error, and using alternative definitions for our primary outcome variable. Alternative assumptions about missing data included a complete case model that assumes missing completely at random and a last observation carried forward model, assuming those lost to follow-up would have preserved similar air quality levels from the last observation recorded. Second, to account for repeated measures from the same units, we used a mixed methods approach incorporating all three repeated measurements with a random effect to allow for clustering by household. Third, to explore the impact of calibration factor errors, we performed the primary analysis excluding those participants affected by incorrect air quality readings and, finally, we used two alternative computations of mean PM<sub>2.5</sub> including only those participants with paired measurements at baseline and week 12 obtained at exactly the same time of day for the household and across all households. For secondary outcomes, a complete case approach was used, with linear regression for continuous variables&#x02014;log-transformed when appropriate&#x02014;and logistic regression for categorical variables.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Participant involvement</title><p>A lay representative was a coapplicant on the original research proposal and was involved in the early stages of study design. We carried out extensive qualitative and feasibility work with families prior to conducting the trial to ensure that their opinions and experiences informed both the intervention components and the outcome measures accordingly.

sec-type="discussion" id="s9"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this randomised controlled trial, a complex intervention combining personalised feedback on home air quality with behavioural and pharmacological support achieved significant behaviour change, improvements in indoor air quality and consequent reductions in exposure of young children to SHS as measured by salivary cotinine. Notably, these changes took place in predominantly highly disadvantaged single-parent families who, at the outset of the study, were not willing to consider quitting smoking. To our knowledge, this is the first trial to demonstrate effectiveness of this type of intervention across a comprehensive range of primary and secondary outcome measures, including home air quality, child salivary cotinine, smoking and quitting behaviour. It demonstrates that an intensive intervention can succeed in preventing harm to children from SHS even in the most difficult circumstances, with the potential to break the intergenerational cycle of tobacco addiction and smoking-related harm. Although we did not investigate measures relating to the potential clinical effectiveness of reduced secondhand smoke exposure in the home on respiratory and other smoking-related conditions, our findings could be of particular relevance, in view of discussions relating to smoke-free public housing<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> and the circumstance that recent trials of minimal interventions to achieve reduced secondhand smoke exposure have shown to be unsuccessful.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
</p><p>Although all of the families enrolled in our trial belonged to low socioeconomic strata, and almost all were of white British background, our findings are likely to be generalisable to families of other socioeconomic or ethnic backgrounds with the shared common feature of a caregiver who feels unable or unwilling to quit smoking. However, in view of previous findings indicating that barriers to creating SFHs are particularly great among disadvantaged families,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> our results are of particular relevance and may have underestimated the effect the intervention could have in less challenging environments. Our findings do not appear to have been adversely affected by the calibration error that generated inflated home air quality measurements at baseline and/or at week 7 for 29 participants, which was corrected for analysis of indoor air quality but resulted in the delivery of behavioural advice to these participants based on inflated readings. Although this may have affected motivation and behaviour change positively or negatively, depending on the context provided by previous measurements, our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that the error had little effect on key study outcomes.</p><p>In terms of the primary outcome (change in indoor air quality at 12 weeks), it is of note that particulate matter was sampled at various points using air monitors over a period of up to 24&#x02009;hours. It is perceivable, particularly given the presence of the monitor inside the home, that participants could have adjusted their smoking behaviour to affect air quality readings. Although this is a possibility that we cannot rule out, it is important to consider that we collected a number of other outcome measures, including salivary cotinine from the index children, that are less likely to be affected by short-term behaviour change or other bias. Results from our analysis of salivary cotinine measures were also significant, underpinning the likelihood of our findings related to indoor air quality being reliable. PM<sub>2.5</sub> is an indirect but well-established measure of secondhand smoke and has been used extensively to assess secondhand smoke levels in homes, and elsewhere.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It can be affected by non-tobacco sources, including cooking, heating and environmental exposures,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> but because our study was randomised and there is no reason to suspect that any change over time from other sources would affect the intervention group differentially from control, it is unlikely that this has affected our results.</p><p>The results of this study build on the Reducing Families' Exposure to Secondhand Smoke in the Home (REFRESH) feasibility study, which only showed evidence of effectiveness within and not between treatment groups,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> suggesting that the more intensive and longer intervention period is important to support the initiation and maintenance of SFH to protect children from exposure to SHS. The reduction in levels of SHS exposure found in our study of caregivers who were unable or unwilling to quit smoking is similar to that reported in the American KISS Trial,<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> which, however, included caregivers who had recently quit or tried to do so. This could be interpreted as evidence that our intervention was particularly effective because our population may have been less amenable to smoking-related behaviour change. Our findings also demonstrate intervention effectiveness across a range of further smoking-related measures, such as increases in determination to quit, and actual quit attempts, which predict further quit attempts in the future.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
</p><p>This is in contrast to a US trial assessing a multicomponent intervention including motivational interviewing, where effectiveness was found for improvement of air quality in the home only at 12-month follow-up but not before and not at all for salivary cotinine.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It is possible that our intervention was more effective, because it was delivered in private family homes rather than largely in a public school environment, included NRT and personalised advice from trained smoke-free homes advisors to make the family home smokefree, thus being particularly tailored to individual need. In contrast also to a recently published RCT of a complex intervention very similar to the one used in our study, conducted with 205 families in Armenia<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> using children&#x02019;s hair cotinine as primary outcome measure, our findings of changes in salivary cotinine were significant in the adjusted analysis, although similar challenges in collecting samples for cotinine analysis from index children were experienced. There was evidence in our study that determination to quit smoking was greater in participants who had received the low-intensity &#x02018;usual care&#x02019; intervention, which could be interpreted in various ways. For example, it could indicate satisfaction of complex intervention participants with their achievements and improved home air quality for their children, removing the perceived &#x02018;necessity&#x02019; to stop smoking completely. However, the significantly higher number of quit attempts during the study in the intervention group, measured at various time points, contradicts this theory.</p><p>Overall, our intervention specifically contributes to the growing evidence base of effective multicomponent interventions that result in a reduction in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, which helps to protect children from exposure to SHS in the home.<sup>16</sup> In addition, it helps to provide important information on intervention components and modalities that can be used to inform future meta-analyses/evidence syntheses given that, to date, systematic review evidence<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13 14 16</xref> has not been able to recommend one specific intervention over another. It is important to notice that, as with other studies,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> our intervention did not eliminate SHS exposure in the participating homes. The need to develop and test complex interventions that have the potential to do so remains apparent.</p><p>The high retention of participants in our study can be viewed as a strength and as an indicator of high motivation among smokers to protect their children from SHS exposure, denoting the potential of widespread uptake of interventions to support this aim. The combination of a financial incentive on completion of data collection, free NRT, frequent communication with SFHAs and flexibility to accommodate participants&#x02019; needs in terms of appointments is also likely to have contributed to the high retention.</p><p>An important consideration refers to the cost-effectiveness of the complex intervention tested here. An economic analysis is currently ongoing and will be made available elsewhere. Further research to refine our intervention, adapting it for widespread and sustainable application and taking into account participants&#x02019; perceived importance of intervention components is required. Rankings of importance obtained from our intervention participants indicate the central role of personalised air quality feedback (ranked as the single most important intervention component by most participants); further exploration of this and implications for future service development and implementation is warranted. Furthermore, research related to clinical impacts of reduction in SHS exposure is also required.</p><boxed-text id="B1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>What this paper adds</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Children&#x02019;s exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke (SHS) is extremely harmful to health and occurs mainly in the home.

It highlights the potential of such interventions to break the intergenerational cycle of tobacco-related harm even under the most difficult circumstances.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053279.supp2</object-id><label>Supplementary table 2</label><p>
