After receiving the information, all patients have 1 week to consider their consent. After 1 week, patients are contacted by the coordinating researcher (PCvdS) to make an appointment to obtain and register informed consent.</p><p>After obtaining informed consent, randomization is done by computer-generated random numbers. Concealment of allocation is maintained by using sealed opaque envelopes. There is no blinding for the patient, surgeon and coordinating researcher because this is difficult in daily practice. However, the independent data monitoring safety committee is blinded to the allocated intervention. Within 1 week, patients will be informed about the allocated treatment. This study is completed funded by the Department of Surgery, UMCU. Multiple esophageal cancer biopsies for pathological analysis will be obtained through esophagogastroscopy, of which four biopsies will be snap frozen and stored for translational research.

After incision and desufflation of the right lung, the pulmonary ligament is incised followed by identification of the azygos vein. The azygos vein is clipped and ligated at the level of the azygos arch. The thoracic duct is identified, clipped and ligated. The esophagus is resected <italic>en bloc</italic> with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resected specimen will contain right-sided paratracheal (lymph node station 2R), tracheobronchial (lymph node station 4), aortopulmonary window (station 5), carinal (station 7) and peri-esophageal (station 8) lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Chest tubes are placed and the thoracotomy wound is closed using intracutaneous closure with absorbable sutures.</p><p>The patient is turned to a supine position for the abdominal phase via supra-umbilical laparotomy. The stomach is mobilized with special care for the gastroepiploic and short gastric vessels. The left gastric artery is identified, clipped and ligated. Lymph node dissection is performed around the celiac trunk and the lesser omentum. A linear stapler (GIATM 80, 3.8 mm; Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) is used to create a gastric conduit 4 cm wide, which is routinely oversewn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The gastric conduit is pulled up through the mediastinum along the original anatomic tract of the esophagus with the aid of a plastic tube (laparoscopic camera bag). A cervical handsewn end-to-side anastomosis is created between the gastric tube and the cervical esophagus using a 3/0 polydioxanone single-layer running suture. A feeding jejunostomy is placed in the second loop after the ligament of Treitz for postoperative feeding. The abdomen is closed in layers with PDS loop for the fascia and skin intracutaneously with monocryl. Patients are transferred to the ICU after the surgical procedure.</p></sec><sec><title>Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy</title><p>Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. For the thoracic phase, the patient is positioned in the left lateral decubitus position, tilted 45&#x000b0; towards the prone position. The robotic system (daVinci Si; Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) is brought into the field at the dorsocranial side of the patient. Three ports are placed for the robotic system as well as two thoracoscopic ports for the assisting surgeon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>a). After incision and installation of the operation robot and selective desufflation of the right lung, the pulmonary ligament is divided. Hereafter, the parietal pleura is dissected at the anterior side of the esophagus from the diaphragm up to the azygos arch. The azygos vein is ligated with Hem-o-lok (Teleflex Medical, Weck Drive, NC, USA) and divided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Dissection of the parietal pleura is continued above the azygos arch to establish dissection of the right paratracheal lymph nodes. At the posterior side of the esophagus, the parietal pleura is dissected cranially to caudally along the azygos vein, including the thoracic duct. The thoracic duct is clipped with a 10 mm endoscopic clipping device (Endoclip&#x02122; II; Covidien) to prevent chylous leakage. To facilitate esophageal mobilization a penrose drain is placed around the esophagus to manipulate the esophagus for further mobilization. The esophagus is resected <italic>en bloc</italic> with the surrounding mediastinal lymph nodes. The resection specimen will contain the same lymph nodes as described for the open procedure.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Trocar arrangement during the robot</bold><bold>assisted thoracoscopic phase.</bold> (<bold>a</bold>) Trocar arrangement during robot-assisted thoracoscopic phase.

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b shows the position of the laparoscopic trocars. The lesser omentum is opened and transected closely to the liver, until the left crus of the diaphragm is reached. Hereafter, the greater gastric curvature is dissected using a harmonic ace. An abdominal lymphadenectomy is performed including lymph nodes surrounding the celiac trunk, along the left gastric and splenic artery and the lesser omental lymph nodes. The left gastric artery and vein are ligated with Hem-o-lok (Teleflex Medical) and transected at their origin.</p><p>Through a left-sided vertical incision along the sternocleidomastoid muscle, the cervical phase of esophagectomy is initiated to facilitate mobilization of the cervical esophagus. No formal cervical lymph node dissection is carried out, but macroscopically suspected cervical lymph nodes are dissected. The cervical esophagus is transected and a cord is attached to the specimen. The dissected esophagus <italic>en bloc</italic> with the surrounding lymph nodes are pulled down through the mediastinum under laparoscopic view.</p><p>Hereafter, the left para-umbilical trocar port is widened to a 5 to 7 cm transverse transabdominal incision. The resection specimen is removed through this incision with a wound drape (3M) to create the gastric conduit extracorporally. A linear stapler (GIATM 80, 3.8 mm; Covidien) is used to create a gastric conduit 4 cm wide, which is routinely oversewn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].

Exact localization of the lymph nodes is an essential part of the pathologic examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The pathology report contains the following parameters: site of tumor, type and gradation, extension in the esophageal wall, margins of the resection, extent of resection (R0 (oncological radical resection), R1 or R2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], lymph node status with the number of lymph nodes, tumor regression grade (according to Mandard and colleagues) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], vaso-invasion and perineural growth. Quality control of pathology will be provided by a specialized gastrointestinal pathologist (FJWtK).</p><p>The type and dose of used analgesics will be noted during the hospital admission period. A visual analogue scale for pain will be noted at the following times: preoperatively, the first 10 days after surgery and a fixed period during follow-up (6 weeks, 6 months and yearly postoperatively up to 5 years).</p><p>The quality-of-life questionnaires Short Form-36, EORTC Quality-of-life Questionnaire Core 30 (Dutch), EORTC OES18 (Dutch) and EQ-5D (Appendices 1 and 2) will be required at the following times: preoperatively &#x0003c;5 days, and 6 weeks, 6 months and yearly up to 5 years postoperatively.</p><p>The approach for the cost analysis is comparing actual direct medical costs incurred with both strategies up until 5 years after the operation. Costs estimates will be based on the recorded volumes and unit costs associated with both procedures. This includes the costs of operation rooms, costs of hospital and ICU stays, and costs associated with complications and reoperations.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Hypothesis: Compared with an open transthoracic esophagectomy, robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy will result in a lower percentage of overall complications (MCDC grade 2 and higher). In a prospective analysis of our own series, MCDC grade 2 to 5 complications were observed in 69% of all patients who underwent robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy and in 91% of all patients who underwent open transthoracic esophagectomy in our won series in the UMCU (2003 to 2010). We calculated that 102 patients (51 in each arm) with resectable esophageal cancer would be required to detect this 22% reduction in the absolute risk of overall complications (from 91% to 69% of patients) based on a two-sided significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and a power of 0.80. An estimated compensation of 10% for drop out is included in the total number of patients, resulting in a total of 112 patients, 56 in each arm.

The quality-of-life questionnaires will be compared using covariance analysis (preoperative scores as covariables). The cost-effectiveness analysis will compare the mean costs and effects for both strategies and result in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Uncertainty in the balance between costs and effects will be assessed with bootstrapping. A time horizon of 5 years will be applied, and costs and effects will be discounted according to Dutch guidelines.</p><p>If the baseline characteristics differ after randomization &#x02013; that is, there is a lack of balance in the confounding factors &#x02013; this will be corrected using multivariate analysis or using a net-benefit regression approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Interim analysis</title><p>There will be one interim analysis. The stopping rule used for efficacy (that is, better outcome for the minimally invasive method as the primary endpoint) is the Peto approach, meaning <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.001. The trial will not be stopped for futility (that is, no difference) as the robot-assisted minimally-invasive approach is being used by a growing numbers of centers worldwide and the outcome of all endpoints of this first randomized trial on this subject are relevant to healthcare professionals involved with this procedure in those hospitals. As is advised by the Dutch Central Committee on Research involving Human Subjects (CCMO), there is no formal stopping rule for harm.</p><p>After every 25 patients, individualized patient description charts including safety parameters will be presented to the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC). The DSMC will discuss these in a plenary or telephone conference with the study coordinator and principal investigator present. If the suspects are harmed (that is, worse outcome for the minimally invasive method) the DSMC will inform the trial research group. The trial research group will discuss in a plenary session together with the DSMC the potential harm per patient and will determine whether a relationship can be drawn between the minimally-invasive procedure and the adverse events. Consensus will be reached and the Medisch Ethische Toetsingscommissie will be informed.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>To the best of our knowledge this is the first randomized controlled trial designed to compare robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy with open transthoracic esophagectomy as surgical treatment for resectable esophageal cancer.</p><p>In the 2010 revised Dutch esophageal carcinoma guidelines, open transthoracic esophagectomy is considered the first-choice procedure for patients with resectable esophageal carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, open transthoracic esophagectomy is accompanied with significant morbidity, predominantly through cardiopulmonary complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>To reduce surgical trauma and morbidity of the open transthoracic esophagectomy, minimally invasive procedures have been designed to overcome this problem. However, conventional (thoraco)scopic surgery has some important limitations, such as a two-dimensional view, disturbed eye&#x02013;hand coordination and limited degrees of freedom, which might limit the surgeon in performing an optimal radical esophageal and mediastinal lymph node dissection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>To overcome the limitations of conventional (thoraco)scopic surgery, the robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy was developed in the UMCU in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Despite these unchallengeable technical advantages, evidence behind its superiority over the conventional open transthoracic esophagectomy is still lacking. From a systematic review, which included nine articles (130 cases) related to robot-assisted esophagectomy, it was concluded that robot-assisted esophagectomy was a feasible and safe technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In terms of short-term oncological outcomes, robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy was at least equivalent to the open transthoracic approach for esophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy was accompanied with reduced blood loss, shorter ICU stay and improved lymph node retrieval compared with open esophagectomy, and the pulmonary complication rate, hospital stay and perioperative mortality were comparable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Disadvantages of the robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy were reported to be a prolonged operative time and high costs consisting of acquisition of an operation robot and disposable tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The level of evidence for robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy is suboptimal and based on case series or expert opinions only (level 4 or 5) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The systematic review strongly emphasized the need for well-conducted randomized controlled trials and long-term survival studies within a framework of measured and comparable outcomes to prove the superiority of robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy over the worldwide current standard open transthoracic esophagectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Two articles about conventional minimally invasive esophagectomy were published recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Results from both articles show that minimally invasive esophagectomy in general is superior over open esophagectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. These results suggest that robot-assisted esophagectomy might also be superior. One could argue that the real question is whether robotic-assisted esophagectomy can improve outcomes when compared with coventional minimally invasive esophagectomy. However, with limited evidence available for the superiority of robot-assisted esophagectomy over open esophagectomy, it is too early to compare robot-assisted esophagectomy with conventional minimally invasive esophagectomy. Differences between these groups will probably be small and therefore large numbers of patients are needed to ensure enough statistical power. Such a clinical trial can only be performed worldwide in a multicenter fashion by surgeons who are experienced in both techniques to avoid bias.</p><p>The UMCU has the largest experience worldwide with robot-assisted thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy. Combined with a completed learning curve, our centre is considered the best place to compare robot-assisted esophagectomy with open transthoracic esophagectomy. We started this monocenter randomized controlled trial in 2012. This monocenter randomized controlled superiority trial can provide further evidence supporting the robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy as treatment for resectable esophageal cancer.</p><p>We anticipate that the inclusion for this study will take 3 years to complete. The study started in January 2012, and follow-up will be 5 years. Short-term results will be analyzed and published after discharge of the last randomized patient.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first randomized controlled trial designed to compare robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy with open transthoracic esophagectomy as surgical treatment for resectable esophageal cancer.</p><p>If our hypothesis is proven correct, robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy will result in a lower percentage of postoperative complications, lower blood loss and shorter hospital stay, but with at least similar oncologic outcomes and better postoperative quality of life compared with the open transthoracic esophagectomy (current standard).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment of patients started in January 2012.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>DSMC: Data Safety Monitoring Committee; EORTC: European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer; MCDC: Modified Clavien&#x02013;Dindo classification; RATE: Robot-assisted minimally invasive thoraco-laparoscopic esophagectomy; UMCU: University Medical Center Utrecht.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>PCvdS, JPR, SvdH, MJDP, LH, CS, RJJV, MGHB, and RvH were involved in developing the original study design and developed the research protocols.
