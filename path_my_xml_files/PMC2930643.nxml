Accordingly, preventive interventions focusing on children between the ages of birth and 5 years are gaining increasing attention from researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>A recent systematic review identified 7 randomized controlled trials (RCT) aimed at preventing obesity in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Four trials were carried out in preschool setting, 2 were family-based and 1 was carried out in maternity hospitals by promoting breastfeeding. None of these trials had an effect in preventing overweight or obesity. Most of these trials had BMI as outcome measure but centile crossing or the timing of adiposity rebound may be better indicators of growth exceeding the expected standards in children under 5 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Another reason why these trials have given negative results might be that the interventions were not compulsory or not given for enough time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Another recent systematic review identified 23 randomized and non-randomized clinical trials aiming to prevent obesity in preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Most of these studies were conducted in either the home or preschool/child care setting and interventions designed to impact not only on knowledge but also on skills where somewhat more effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The involvement of parents was identified as essential to make children receptive to prevention programs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence of overweight and obesity in Italian preschool children is high as in many Western countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Under the Italian National Health System (INHS), children are cared for by family pediatricians, who perform health balances (HB) at regular intervals. The Obesity Working Group of the Italian Society of Preventive and Social Pediatrics (SIPPS) has designed a RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of family pediatricians for the prevention of childhood obesity in preschool children. In this paper we report the rationale and protocol of such trial, named the "Mi voglio bene" ("I love myself") study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>"Mi voglio bene" is a parallel-arm RCT. Family pediatricians willing to participate to the trial will be recruited through advertisements on scientific journals and websites or direct contact at scientific meetings. They will be randomly assigned to a control group and to an experimental group. The control group will provide the usual standard of care while the experimental group will implement the 10 preventive actions that make up the experimental intervention (promotion of breastfeeding, avoidance of solid foods, control of protein intake, avoidance of sugar-sweetened beverages, avoidance of bottle, active means of transportation, identification of early adiposity rebound, limitation of television viewing, promotion of movement, and teaching portion size; see below for details). Such actions will be performed at 10 time points corresponding to HB performed for INHS (1.0 to 1.5 months, 2.5 to 3.0 months, 5.0 to 6.0 months, 8.0 to 9.0 months, 11.0 to 12.0 months, 16.0 to 18.0 months, 24.0 to 30.0 months, 36.0 to 42.0 months, 48.0 to 54.0 months and 66.0 to 72.0 months; see below for details). Blinding and concealment are not possible owing to the study design. Written informed consent will be obtained from the legal guardians of the children and the study protocol will be submitted to an Ethics Committee for approval. The trial will be registered on the ISRCT register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.org">http://www.isrctn.org</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec><title>Main outcome</title><p>We hypothesize that the 10 preventive actions will reduce the prevalence of overweight and obesity at 6 years of age from 25% to 20%. In order to detect this difference as statistically significant at an alpha level of 0.05 with a power of 90%, 1504 children per group are needed. This number will be increased to 1805 children per group owing to an expected drop-out of 20% during the study. Thus, a total of 3610 children will be required for the study. Because each study pediatrician is expected to enroll 30 consecutive newborns, a total of 120 pediatricians will participate to the study. Presence of chronic disease requiring specific counseling on nutrition or lack of command of the Italian language will be reasons for exclusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>The availability of 10 time points from the age of birth to 6 years is a great strength of the trial. We plan to use these time points to compare trajectories of BMI, BMI centile crossing, and adiposity rebound in the two groups using mixed models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements and data entry</title><p>The reported compliance of the children with the 10 preventive interventions will be recorded during the study. Weight, length (&#x02264; 24 months of age) and height (&#x0003e; 24 months of age) will be measured following the Anthropometric Standardization Reference Manual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Overweight and obesity will be diagnosed using the criteria put forth by the International Obesity Task Force [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The early adiposity rebound will be defined as proposed by Rolland-Cachera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and patterns of BMI centile changes will be analyzed as suggested by Cole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Waist circumference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] will also be measured at the 10<sup>th </sup>HB (66.0 to 72.0 months).

Our study differs from the presently available RCT for three main reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]: 1) it is pediatrician-based, a circumstance made possible by the fact that under INHS children are cared for by family pediatricians; 2) it is cost-effective, as it will require only a minimal increase of the time needed to perform already scheduled HB; 3) the availability of many (10) encounters will allow to reinforce the preventive messages. We expect that this trial will provide important information for the INHS and possibly other institutional child care settings about the effectiveness of a pediatrician-based approach to the prevention of childhood obesity.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ESPGHAN: European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition; HB: health balance; INHS: Italian National Health System; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; SIPPS: Societ&#x000e0; Italiana di Pediatria Preventiva e Sociale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All the Authors contributed to the development of study protocol.
