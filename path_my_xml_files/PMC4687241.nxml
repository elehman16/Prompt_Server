Moreover, children are expected to learn and remember them and repeat it during exams. Except when there is a marked deviation from the normal, young children are not aware of what their intellectual level is. The bright, for example, do not realize how bright they are, the dull are unaware of their dullness, and the average take their intelligence for granted. After they enter the school, children measure their level of intellectual power by the kind of adjustment they make to school work.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Intelligence may be narrowly defined as the capacity to acquire knowledge and understanding, and used in different novel situations. It is this ability, or capacity, which enables the individual to deal with real situations and profit intellectually from sensory experience. Although it is difficult to define intelligence, indeed it appears to have no formal definition, there is, nevertheless, at least one particularly apposite definition: The capacity to learn and understand.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In the Ayurvedic classics, the word &#x0201c;<italic>Buddhi</italic>&#x0201d; is used in many contexts. On studying it's literally meaning, (<italic>Nirukti</italic> and <italic>Vyutpatti</italic>) it can be understood as the psychological faculty for reasoning and logic. However, after critical analysis of classics, it is evident that at many places it has been used as an advance stage or as a process leading to a true knowledge. <italic>Buddhi</italic> is described as <italic>Jnana</italic> (knowledge).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The word &#x0201c;<italic>Medha</italic>&#x0201d; has been used mainly in two ways viz. <italic>Grahana Shakti</italic> (grasping power) and <italic>Dharana Shakti</italic> (retention power).[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Besides this, <italic>Buddhi</italic>, <italic>Smriti</italic>, <italic>Dhi</italic>, etc., words have been used in a similar sense at many places.</p><p>Concept of improving cognitive functions like intelligence and memory is relatively very new to current modern system of medicine. The first drug discovered to enhance cognitive functions known as &#x0201c;Nootropics&#x0201d; were in 1972.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Knowledge of natural herbal drugs possessing cognitive enhancing activity dates back to thousands of century back. &#x0201c;<italic>Medhya Rasayana</italic>&#x0201d; is a specific group of four, time-tested classical preparations for promotion of mental health and well-being.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> (<italic>Glycyrrhiza glabra</italic> Linn.) is one among them mentioned for these purpose by <italic>Acharya</italic> Charaka.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Abundant works have been carried out on varied systemic actions of <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> in different disorders.

In this regard, Ayurveda has a potential to make a significant contribution with a potent and cost-effective <italic>Medhya Dravya</italic>.</p><p>There are a number of different methods, which contend to measure intelligence, the most famous of which is the intelligence quotient (IQ), or IQ test.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The IQ is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed carefully to assess intelligence. The method of testing <italic>Medha</italic> is explained as &#x0201c;<italic>Grahanenaiti Granthadi Dharanena</italic>&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that is, understanding the ability of the person to understand, grasp, remember, and recall the <italic>Granthas</italic> (books) after reading.</p><p>By considering the above facts, this study has been undertaken to assess the efficacy of <italic>Yashtimadhu</italic> in enhancement of IQ in school going children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Healthy school going children of 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> standard (aged 14&#x02013;16 years) of either sex irrespective caste, religion, and socioeconomic status were duly registered in the outpatient department of <italic>Kaumarabhritya</italic> Department.

Although these individual differences can be substantial, they are never entirely consistent: A given person's intellectual performance will vary in different occasions, and in different domains, as judged by different criteria. Concepts of &#x0201c;intelligence&#x0201d; are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena. Although considerable clarity has been achieved in some areas, no such conceptualization has yet answered all the important questions and none commands universal assent.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>To assess intelligence level of a child, many factors come into play such as his family background, social background, cultural background, scholastic background, mental status of the child during the testing procedure, environment where the test is conducted, the abilities and disabilities of the child in understanding the commands, etc.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Therefore, one such test was necessary that would give an appropriate measure of IQ overcoming all the above differences and variations.
