Currently there is no vaccine or cure for AIDS still Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) is successful. It reduces both the mortality and the morbidity of HIV infection, but is expensive and inaccessible in many countries. However intense the therapy may be, HIV virus is rarely eliminated, and drug resistance is a major setback during long-term therapy. The development of new drugs and strategies and exploring alternative systems of medicine for antiviral herbs or drugs is the need of the age to improve treatment outcomes. <italic>Ayurveda</italic> describes many diseases which incorporate HIV like illness e.g. <italic>Rajayakshma, Ojo Kshaya, Sannipata jwara</italic> etc. HIV infection affects multisystems, chiefly the Immune System which can be correlated to <italic>Ojo Kshaya. Rasayana Chikitsa</italic> is the frontline therapy employed to treat <italic>Ojus</italic> disorders. Therefore <italic>Shilajatu</italic> (Mineral pitch), <italic>Centella asiatica (Mandukaparni), Tinospora cordifolia (Guduchi)</italic> and <italic>Emblica officinalis (Amalaki)</italic>, well known for their Immuno-modulator and antioxidant properties were selected to evaluate their role on immune system. The study was carried on 20 patients from OPD and IPD of <italic>Kayachikitsa</italic>, S.S.Hospital, IMS, BHU and was randomly allocated into Treated group (<italic>Shilajatu</italic>+ART) and Control group (ART). Treated Group responded better to ART both clinically and biochemically. The results show that <italic>Shilajatu</italic> decreases the recurrent resistance of HIV virus to ART and improves the outcome of the therapy</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>HIV Virus</kwd><kwd>AIDS</kwd><kwd>ART</kwd><kwd><italic>Rasayana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Shilajatu</italic> and CD<sub>4</sub> count</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>AIDS is one of the major global health concerns, highly infectious,and stands first as a sexually transmitted and incurable disease. AIDS is now a pandemic and globally, an estimate of 33 million people are affected with AIDS and AIDS has killed an estimate of 2.1 million people in 2007. Over three-quarters of these deaths occurred in sub-SA<italic>hara</italic>n Africa, retarding economic growth and destroying human capital<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>.</p><p>AIDS is caused by Human Immuno Deficiency virus (HIV). HIV is a retrovirus that primarily targets CD<sub>4+</sub> helper T (a subset of T cells), cells that are responsible for the Immunity of an individual. Once HIV has killed so many CD<sub>4+</sub> T cells and there are fewer than 200 of these cells per microliter (<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L) of blood, cellular immunity is lost and the person has said to be suffering from AIDS. This infection progressively reduces the effectiveness of the immune system and leaves individuals easily susceptible to opportunistic infections and tumors. HIV is transmitted through direct contact of a mucous membrane or the bloodstream with a bodily fluid containing HIV, such as blood, semen, vaginal fluid, seminal fluid, and breast milk. This transmission can involve anal, vaginal or oral sex, blood transfusion, contaminated hypodermic needles, exchange between mother and baby during pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding or other exposure to one of the above bodily fluids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>.</p><p>As per (UNAIDS definition)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>. ABC of AIDS prevention are:</p><p>A- bstinence or delaying first sex.</p><p>B- eing safer by being faithful to one partner or by reducing the number of sexual partners.</p><p>C- orrect and consistent use of condoms for sexually active young people, couples in which one partner is HIV-positive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>.</p><p>Currently there is no vaccine or cure for AIDS. Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART) is successful. It reduces both the mortality and the morbidity of HIV infection, but is expensive and inaccessible in many countries.</p><p>Clinical picture of AIDS, described in <italic>Ayurveda</italic> is found scattered in all authentic texts. Immunity has been explained under the concept of <italic>Ojus</italic>. Clinical features of <italic>Ojus</italic>, its formation, features of derangement-<italic>Visramsa, Vyapat</italic> and <italic>Kshaya</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref> are explained in detail by the authors like <italic>Charaka, Sushruta</italic> and <italic>Vagbhata</italic> in their texts. Stages of AIDS resemble <italic>Hatoujas</italic> a complicated type of fever, <italic>Ojanirodhaka Jvara, Shosha, Madhumeha, Asadhya Pandu, Rajayakshma</italic> and <italic>Udanavrata Prana Vata</italic> in <italic>Ayurveda</italic>. Here AIDS and its opportunistic infections have been correlated with <italic>Ojo Kshaya</italic>. The virus invades the <italic>Rasadi sapta dhatus</italic> and causes decrement in their quality and quantity. In <italic>Ayurveda, Ojus</italic> is the essential substance of all <italic>dhatus</italic> and determines the capacity of the individual to combat the disease (<italic>Vyadhibala virodhitvam</italic>) and the power to the resist the virulence of disease (<italic>Vyadhi utpadaka pratibandhakatvam</italic>) causing factors in future<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>.</p><p>For the process of rejuvenation, <italic>Ayurveda</italic> has described a unique therapy-<italic>Rasayana</italic> therapy. Drugs described under <italic>Rasayana</italic> act on <italic>Agni, Dhatu</italic> and <italic>Srotas</italic> level and help in formation of <italic>prashasta dhatus</italic> maintaining a perfect equilibrium of all the <italic>doshas</italic> and <italic>dhatus. Shilajatu</italic> is one of the best of the <italic>rasayanas</italic> described by <italic>Charaka, Sushruta</italic> in all diseases where <italic>Bala</italic> i.e <italic>Ojus</italic> is involved.Hence <italic>Shilajatu</italic> along with <italic>Mandukaparni, Guduchi</italic> and <italic>Amalaki</italic>, well known <italic>rasayana</italic> herbs were selected to evaluate their role in boosting the immunity.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Aims and Objectives</title><p>
