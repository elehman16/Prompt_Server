on masticatory muscle activation in elderly stroke patients. [Subjects and Methods] The
subjects included 20 elderly patients diagnosed with stroke and 10 healthy elderly
individuals. The neuromuscular electrical stimulation group received stimulation on the
masseter muscle in the affected side for 30&#x02005;min each day, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. In
all the subjects, surface electromyography was used to measure activity of the masseter
and temporal muscles in both sides under resting and clenching conditions. [Results] In
the neuromuscular electrical stimulation group, after the intervention, an increase in the
activity of all of the masticatory muscles was observed during clenching, with a
significant increase in the activity of the masseter muscle in the affected side.
Significant differences between the groups were not observed after the interventions.
[Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that application of neuromuscular
electrical stimulation effectively improves muscle activity in elderly stroke patients
during clenching, and that this technique can be applied particularly for the improvement
of the clenching activity of the masseter muscle in the affected side.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Masticatory muscle</kwd><kwd>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke is a cause for reduction in the masticatory movement<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mastication, which is controlled by the nervous system, is closely
related to quality of life. The sensory, motor, and pre-motor cortexes and the cerebellum of
the brain are activated during the clenching action<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Mastication movements are under highly accurate control of the
nervous system. The complex control of mastication is disrupted by a neurological injury
that prohibits the interactions of the central and peripheral mechanisms<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. The bite force of the masticatory muscles
in the affected and the unaffected side in stroke patients, as compared to that in healthy
individuals, decreases an approximately 20&#x02013;30%<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, in stroke patients, the masticatory muscles are
asymmetrically stimulated, resulting in the thickening of the muscles in one side<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Consequently, masticatory function is
impaired. Therefore, a longer oral phase and a greater number of chews are required in
stroke patients than in healthy individuals<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The masticatory function also decreases because of aging<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, and in cases of accompanying stroke, the negative impact of the
neurological impairment on the masticatory function is heightened. In a few previous
studies, electrotherapy was used to stimulate the masticatory muscles in elderly stroke
patients. Regarding the treatment method for increasing the muscle strength in stroke
patients, neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) is considered effective<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
NMES is used for the recruitment of motor units or for increasing the muscle strength<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The oxygen levels of tissues increase and
the intrinsic characteristics of paralyzed muscles are altered as a result of NMES
application<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recently, NMES
application for stroke patients was reported to effectively reduce lower-extremity
impairment and improve the functional locomotion ability<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>; moreover, it improved isometric finger-extension strength and
increased cortical intensity in the somatosensory cortex<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, NMES is currently successfully applied in clinical
practice for muscle re-education, prevention of muscle atrophy, and recovery of functions in
stroke patients. However, few studies have been conducted on electrotherapy for the
management of the masticatory muscles in elderly stroke patients.</p><p>In this study, NMES was applied to the masticatory muscles in the affected side in elderly
stroke patients, and the results were evaluated using objective measuring equipment.
Furthermore, the mechanism by which NMES caused changes in muscle activation during rest and
during clenching was examined. Thus, a treatment method that is clinically effective in
improving the masticatory functions in elderly stroke patients was proposed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>For this study, 20 chronic stroke patients among those hospitalized in a geriatric hospital
located in Gyeonggi-do Province in Korea were selected. They were diagnosed with stroke by
using computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); the patients showed
hemiplegia that persisted over a year. This study also included 10 healthy elderly
individuals (normal group). The research was performed from October to December 2014. The
elderly stroke patients were randomly assigned to the NMES group consisting of 10 patients
who underwent NMES treatment, and the control group consisting of 10 patients who did not
undergo NMES treatment. All of the subjects satisfied the following inclusion criteria: no
missing teeth, no history of trauma to the face or to the temporomandibular joint over the
past year, a score of 24 on the Korean version of a mini-mental state exam<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, teeth preservation including implants,
and characteristics of unassisted gait better than those of cane-assisted gait. All of the
30 participants gave their consent to participate in this study. This study was approved by
the Ethics Committee of Namseoul University in Korea. The institutional review board (IRB)

G2 (Noraxon Inc., USA). Surface electrodes were placed on the right masseter (RM), left
masseter, right temporal, and left temporal muscles, and the interelectrode distance was
maintained at 20&#x02005;mm. The location of the electrodes was based on the anatomical
landmarks<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. A ground electrode was
attached to the forehead. Before the electrode was attached, the part in contact with the
forehead was lightly wiped with a 70% alcohol solution to reduce resistance of the skin
under the electrode. Thereafter, an Ag&#x02013;AgCl surface electrode with a diameter of 10&#x02005;mm
(Noraxon Inc., USA) was attached to the skin. The sampling rate of the EMG signal was set at
1,000&#x02005;Hz, and the signal was filtered at 10&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz using a band-pass filter with a 60-Hz
notch filter. The EMG signals recorded were converted into digital signals by using TeleMyo
2400T G2; the digital signals were subsequently analyzed using Myoresearch-XP 107 software
(Noraxon Inc., USA).</p><p>The measurements were recorded with the participants in a sitting position, with their hips
and knee joints in 90&#x000b0; flexion, lower limbs in alignment, the back of the chair at the
height of the shoulders, and both hands placed on the thighs. The head was positioned
parallel with the ground, with the eyes in a straight-ahead position of gaze.</p><p>For the measurement of muscle activation in the resting condition, the subjects were shown
a screen display at 200-ms intervals of the root mean squared (RMS) value of their EMG
activity while they maintained a comfortable posture with eyes closed. For the measurement
of muscle activation during clenching, maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) was recorded. The
subjects were instructed to maintain a comfortable posture, ensuring that the upper teeth
were not in contact with the lower teeth and that the mandible was in the center. The muscle
activity in the resting condition was measured twice with a 15-s interval. Regarding
measurements during clenching, the subjects performed 5-s maximal clenching voluntarily for
3 times in total with a 5-min interval. RMS and MVC were measured in 4 muscles. The subjects
were verbally encouraged during the MVC test.</p><p>The subjects in the NMES group underwent 3 treatment sessions per week for 8 weeks. Each
treatment session lasted 30&#x02005;min. For NMES, an adhesive electrode with a diameter of 1.25
inch (Neurostimulation Electrodes, ValuTrode, USA) was attached to the affected masseter
muscle by using a 2-channel portable electrical stimulator (Microstim, Medel, Germany).</p><p>The parameters of the electrical stimulation were as follows: symmetric biphasic waves, a
pulse width of 250 &#x003bc;s, a frequency of 20&#x02013;40&#x02005;Hz, a pulse rate of 50 pps, and on-off time
ratio of 1:3<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The stimulation intensity
was controlled so that the subjects did not feel discomfort during current conduction. The
subjects were instructed to close their mouths slightly with voluntary contractions during
NMES. The posture maintained during the treatment was identical to the one maintained during
EMG activity measurement. The control group and the normal group did not receive NMES.</p><p>All of the data were encoded and analyzed using statistical analysis software (SPSS
19.0/PC, USA). The differences in the activities of the masticatory muscles between the
affected side and unaffected side before and after the NMES application were tested using a
Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Moreover, a Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed to compare the
values obtained before NMES application to those obtained after NMES application. The
significance level for all the tests was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The masticatory muscle activity under the resting condition did not differ significantly

condition did not change significantly after NMES application in any of the study groups.
However, the extent of activation of these muscles was lesser in stroke patients in the NMES
group and the control group than in the healthy individuals in the normal group.</p><p>A previous study in rats examined the impact of masticatory muscle paralysis on the
masticatory function. In that study, botulinum toxin type A injected in both the right and
left temporal muscles (TM) and masseter muscles (MM) caused a remarkable decrease in the TM
and MM weight and muscle fiber size. These observations supported the argument that a
decrease in masticatory function affects the masticatory muscle fibers<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the case of humans, decreased masticatory function
caused by paralysis also decreases the thickness of the MM fibers<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>; furthermore, in the case of stroke patients, the extent
of decrease in MM thickness is greater in the affected than in the unaffected side under
both relaxation and contraction<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
results of the previous studies are consistent with those of the present study: the muscle
activity decreased in the NMES group and the control group, as compared to the muscle
activity in the normal group.</p><p>Iwatsuki et al. reported that the application of a deep-friction massage on the masticatory
muscles resulted in an increase in the bite force of approximately 10&#x02013;15%<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kawanishi et al. suggested that mastication
of solid food after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats was effective in the
rehabilitation of sensorimotor and learning/memory dysfunction<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. These report implying that management of the masticatory
muscles in stroke patients enhances the clenching ability.</p><p>In this study, the extent of masticatory muscle activation at the early clenching stage was
lesser in the elderly stroke patients than in the healthy individuals. Furthermore, the
muscle activation was weaker in the affected side than in the unaffected side. Even though
no significant differences were observed in terms of the changes in the muscle activity
among the study groups after the intervention, the activity of all of the AT, UT, AM, and UM
muscles increased in the NMES group; particularly, a significant increase in the activity of
the in AM muscle was observed (p &#x0003c; 0.05). NMES application not only increased AT muscle
activation, but also improved muscle activation in the unaffected side, and thus probably
enhanced the overall masticatory function. Moreover, an increase in the MVC of the AT and AM
muscles through NMES application eased mastication of solid food, which can be effective for
the resolution of the masticatory muscle dysfunction in stroke patients. Iwatsuki et al.
argued that the maximum bite force in the affected side reduces to a greater extent in
stroke patients than in healthy individuals<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this observation is consistent with the observations of the
present study. However, other studies did not show a clear difference in the maximum bite
force between the affected and the unaffected side<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, various factors may affect
the maximum bite force in stroke patients, and diverse results can be obtained in a sample
consisting of elderly people.</p><p>However, the brain activity can be increased to a greater extent through the application of
both functional electrical stimulation (FES) and voluntary contraction than through the
application of either voluntary contraction or FES<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. NMES in elderly stroke patients is thought to play a positive role
in motor function recovery and neuronal plasticity, because the improved masticatory muscle
activity increases brain activity as well as the clenching ability. However, the study
results cannot be extended to stroke patients of all ages and all levels of impairment;
furthermore, they cannot be generalized to patients with teeth loss. A limitation of this
study is that it did not measure muscle fatigue to avoid potential risks caused by isometric
contractions for a sustained period of time in elderly stroke patients. However,
importantly, this study show that masticatory muscle activity in elderly stroke patients can
be improved by NMES application. In particular, NMES is an effective intervention to improve
clenching ability of AM.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bakke</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>M&#x000f8;ller</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomsen</surname><given-names>CE</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Chewing in patients with severe neurological
