In the first study, we investigated the effect of a preload containing 20 g of casein, whey, pea protein, egg albumin or maltodextrin vs. water control on food intake 30 min later in 32 male volunteers (25 &#x000b1; 4 yrs, BMI 24 &#x000b1; 0.4 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Subjective appetite was assessed using visual analogue scales at 10 min intervals after the preload. Capillary blood glucose was measured every 30 min during 2 hrs before and after the ad libitum meal. In the second study, we compared the effect of 20 g of casein, pea protein or whey vs. water control on satiation in 32 male volunteers (25 &#x000b1; 0.6 yrs, BMI 24 &#x000b1; 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The preload was consumed as a starter during an ad libitum meal and food intake was measured. The preloads in both studies were in the form of a beverage.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the first study, food intake was significantly lower only after casein and pea protein compared to water control (P = 0.02; 0.04 respectively). Caloric compensation was 110, 103, 62, 56 and 51% after casein, pea protein, whey, albumin and maltodextrin, respectively. Feelings of satiety were significantly higher after casein and pea protein compared to other preloads (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Blood glucose response to the meal was significantly lower when whey protein was consumed as a preload compared to other groups (P &#x0003c; 0.001). In the second study, results showed no difference between preloads on ad libitum intake. Total intake was significantly higher after caloric preloads compared to water control (P &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Casein and pea protein showed a stronger effect on food intake compared to whey when consumed as a preload. However, consuming the protein preload as a starter of a meal decreased its impact on food intake as opposed to consuming it 30 min before the meal.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The rise in global obesity prevalence in both adults and children may lead to a decrease in life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to find solutions to help control the rise in obesity. Protein intake is associated with weight loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This effect has been attributed to the greater satiating potential of proteins compared to other macronutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The source of protein may play a role in its satiating effect; however, inconsistent data exists from human studies. Milk proteins have been considered to increase satiety and suppress short-term food intake compared to other sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], but the contribution of complete milk proteins vs. whey protein or casein is still not clear. Whey protein showed a stronger suppression of hunger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and lower food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] compared to casein. However, other studies have found similar effects on satiety and food intake between whey protein and casein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Eggs are a good source of proteins. Recently, eggs have been shown to enhance satiety and decrease energy intake when consumed for breakfast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] resulting in higher weight loss during energy restriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. There is limited and inconsistent evidence on the effect of egg proteins on appetite regulation. Studies have found either the same effect compared to gelatine, casein, soy, pea or wheat protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] or lower effect on satiety and short-term food intake compared to whey and soy protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Currently proteins of plant origin are gaining interest as an alternative to animal proteins, favoured by consumers shifting away from animal-derived proteins for health and environmental reasons. One recent study investigated pea protein and showed stronger suppression of appetite compared to whey protein when 15 g of pea protein hydrolysate was consumed in overweight subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; however, evidence remains limited.</p><p>Dose plays an important role on the duration of effect of proteins on food intake. It is clear that around 50 g of protein in a food or a meal has a strong effect on satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, the application of such a dose in food products remains limited. Interestingly, a recent dose-response study has shown that 20 g of whey protein is able to suppress food intake 30 min later [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The association of protein with satiation is not known. Only one study showed that subjects consumed less from a high protein omelette compared to a high fat omelette consumed ad libitum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Satiation develops during a meal and results in the termination of a meal while satiety develops after a meal and inhibits further eating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To date, most of the literature has dealt with satiety and little attention was given to satiation.</p><p>In this context, we investigated the satiety benefits of 20 g of different protein sources on a meal consumed either immediately after the preload or 30 min later.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Experiment 1</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Thirty-two healthy male volunteers were recruited from the local vicinity.

The control preload was 250 ml of non-carbonated water. All the preloads except for the water control contained around 80 kcal (20 g protein) and were adjusted to a total volume of 200 ml (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Subjects were allowed to eat as much or as little as they want from the served foods but were not allowed to take food with them to consume later. The ad libitum meal was served in excess to allow subjects to eat until comfortably full. Subjects chose between 2 types of Cr&#x000e8;me Budwig (apple-orange or pear-kiwi) but were asked to consume the same type at each session.

All foods and water were pre-weighed by the investigators before serving and left-overs were weighed afterwards to calculate the amounts eaten. The food tray was served in the Evaluation Room and subjects were able to eat while seated in individual cubicles.</p></sec><sec><title>Visual analogue scales (VAS) ratings</title><p>VAS ratings were collected before and after the preload and at 10 min intervals between the preload and the ad libitum meal. A validated electronic system based on a Dell Pocket PC was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Subjects rated their motivation-to-eat and other sensations on a horizontal non-graded, unlabelled line anchored at each end by an opposed statement (e.g. "not at all hungry", "as hungry as I ever felt"). In the Pocket PC system, the subjects answered the questions on a 70 mm VAS by clicking on the screen with the aid of a plastic marker. The computer measures the distance in mm from the left end of the scale to the point where the subject has inserted a line. An automatic computation is made to normalize this distance to 100 mm (standard distance). All entries are automatically timed and dated. The motivation-to-eat questions were based on Hill and Blundell's motivation-to-eat questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. A French translation of the following questions was used:</p><p>"How strong is your desire to eat?" (very weak - very strong)</p><p>"How hungry do you feel?" (not hungry at all - as hungry as I ever felt)</p><p>"How full do you feel?" (not full at all - very full)</p><p>"How thirsty do you feel?" (not at all thirsty - very thirsty)</p><p>"How much do you think you could eat?" (nothing at all - a large amount)</p><p>To assess liking or palatability, the following question was asked twice, once after consuming each preload and once after consuming the ad libitum meal:</p><p>"How much did you like this food or beverage?" (not at all - very much)</p><p>To assess the sweetness of the preloads, the following question was asked after the preload:</p><p>"How sweet was the beverage?" (very sweet - not sweet at all)</p></sec><sec><title>Capillary blood glucose</title><p>Capillary blood glucose was measured using a glucometer (Accu-check Compact Plus) and a lancet device (Soft Clix, Roche Diagnostics). A correction factor of 1.12 is programmed into the monitor to convert the results from capillary blood to venous plasma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, the reported results correspond to plasma glucose concentrations. The total amount of blood taken over the study was about 1\2 a teaspoon. The proper use of a finger prick blood sampler (lancet) and glucose monitor was explained to the study participants during the training session. The measurement of the capillary glucose was supervised by the investigators. To control for CV of the glucometer, the glucose measures were performed in duplicates and the average of the 2 measures was calculated. In instances where the difference between the 2 measures was equal or above to 10%, a third measure was done and the average of the 3 was calculated.</p></sec><sec><title>General procedure</title><p>Subjects came to the Nestl&#x000e9; Research Centre for 7 sessions, including one training session and 6 test sessions. During the training session, subjects' weight and height was measured and they received a letter with information about the study. They were introduced to the electronic VAS pocket PCs. Subjects tasted the beverages and foods used in the study and chose one of the two breakfasts that they preferred. They answered medical and dietary questionnaires and a French translation of the TFEQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Subjects were told that they were not allowed to drink alcohol (alcohol increases passive over-consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or do vigorous exercise the day before the test day. Subjects were told that the aim of the study was to evaluate the properties of different protein beverages with no mention of food intake measurement.

We decided to only use protein preloads for experiment 2 as the objective is to confirm the observed effect of pea protein and casein and to compare it with another protein that did not show an effect on food intake. Whey was chosen due to its reported effect on food intake in the literature. The protein preloads included 20 g of casein protein, whey protein or pea protein dissolved in 250 ml non-carbonated water. The control preload was 250 ml of non-carbonated water. The water control treatment was adjusted to 250 ml in order to match the volume of the test preload (200 ml) plus the volume of water used to rinse their mouth (50 ml) right after. All the preloads except for the water control contained around 80 kcal (20 g protein) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). In this experiment, the protein preloads were homogenized and the pH was adjusted to improve the taste and texture. Aspartame and aromas were added as well to improve the taste.</p><p>The ad libitum meal was a Bircher Muesli consisting of yoghurt and muesli. Energy and macronutrient content of 100 g of ad libitum meal was 160 kcal, 4.7 g protein, 14 g CHO, 2 g fat and 1.5 g fiber respectively. Subjects made a choice between three different yoghurts for the ad libitum breakfast. For every test session the same breakfast was served. Subjects were allowed to eat as much or as little as they want from the served foods but were not allowed to take foods with them to consume later. The ad libitum meal was served in excess to allow subjects to reach satiation.

(not happy at all - very happy)</p><p>"How stressed do you feel?" (not stressed at all - very stressed)</p><p>"Did you sleep well last night?" (not well at all - very well)</p><p>"How tired do you feel?" (not tired at all- very tired)</p></sec><sec><title>General procedure</title><p>Subjects came to the Nestl&#x000e9; Research Centre for 5 sessions, including a training session and 4 test sessions.

They were invited to go into the Evaluation Room and sit in individual cubicles. Before starting, subjects answered a questionnaire about their wellbeing and whether they were fasted on the day of the test. At 9.00 h subjects answered their first VAS questions (t = -20) and subsequently they received a preload. The order of the four preloads was randomized. Subjects were told to finish the drink within 5 minutes. They then answered a palatability question about the drink along with unrelated mood questions. Right after, the ad libitum meal was served. Subjects were allowed to eat as much as they liked. A bottle of water was offered with the breakfast. After breakfast VAS questions were answered at 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error. Energy intake was analyzed using a mixed model with a random subjects effect (to take into account the correlation between the repeat measurements for each subject) and fixed treatment effect. Baseline covariates were adjusted for. Multiple pair-wise treatment comparisons were carried out using Tukey's Honest Significant Difference procedure. The secondary outcome measures were analyzed similarly within the mixed model analysis of covariance framework. The incremental area under the curve (AUC) was calculated using the trapezoide rule. Suitable normalizing transforms were applied to certain incremental AUC measures.

This was further supported through higher feelings of satiety after the casein and pea protein preload. However, this effect on food intake was attenuated when the preload was consumed immediately before the ad libitum meal.</p><p>Ad libitum energy intake was lower after the pea protein and the casein preloads in the first experiment and showed a trend in the second experiment. These findings demonstrate pea protein and casein as candidate proteins for satiety. In the literature, there are inconsistent findings related to protein source and satiety when a 45-50 g dose is used. Previous studies have shown similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or lower effect on food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] when whey was compared to casein. These inconsistencies can be attributed to different reasons including dose, study design, subject sample, as well as different physical properties of the proteins used. Even within the same source of protein, attributes can differ with regards to degree of hydrolyzation of the peptides, aggregation of the peptides (micelles) and purity of the isolates used.</p><p>Unlike casein protein, pea protein has not been extensively investigated. In the present study, we show for the first time that pea protein is effective in lowering short-term food intake. A few studies have shown either similar or lower food intake after pea protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and pea protein hydrolyzate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] respectively compared to other proteins. Mechanisms were not explored but gastric emptying might play a role. Casein has been shown to exhibit slower gastric emptying compared to whey protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Other potential mechanisms can be related to the action of satiety hormones.</p><p>When the preload was consumed 30 min before the ad libitum meal, total food intake was similar after casein and pea protein compared to after water control, with a caloric compensation of around 100%. This means that subjects were able to compensate only for the calories in the casein or pea protein preload and not more. Except for a limited number of fiber studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], it is rare to find an effect of a preload on total food intake that is superior to the calories of the preload. Accordingly, there is limited basis for recommending the ingestion of a preload or a snack to reduce total food intake when simply drinking water or not ingesting the preload or snack results in the same effect. We therefore suggested conducting a second experiment to measure satiation where the preload is given right before the ad libitum meal in order to maximize its effect on the meal or caloric compensation. Contrary to our hypothesis, we found that administering the pea protein or casein preload as a starter before the meal did not lower ad libitum food intake. Furthermore, total intake was higher compared to the water control. In the literature, there are no reported studies on protein source and satiation. The observed lack of effect on satiation was perhaps because the drinks were consumed fast and therefore the volume effect might have overridden any potential functional effect of the protein preload. In both experiments, all treatments were iso-volumetric and subjects were instructed to drink the preloads quickly, as a shot. Previous studies have shown that by shortening the delay between the preload and the ad libitum meal, energy compensation is affected by the volume of the undigested preload and not the type of preload served [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. A slow eating rate has been associated with lower food intake and higher satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] perhaps due to longer oro-sensory exposure as well as interaction with the gastrointestinal tract to release of satiety signals. Ratings of satiety in the first experiment were higher after the pea protein and casein preloads compared to other preloads. This might explain the observed lower energy intake. In the second experiment, the ratings were measured only after the ad libitum meal and as expected, they did not differ amongst the preloads.</p><p>Postprandial glycaemia was measured as a secondary outcome to investigate if the reported second meal effect of whey protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] persists when the preload is administered 30 min before the meal. Indeed, whey protein blunted the blood glucose response to the ad libitum meal compared to the other protein preloads and water control. Unlike the literature where a fixed meal was administered, which used a fixed meal, our results were reported after an ad libitum meal and therefore should be considered with caution. We did not investigate the mechanisms responsible for this decrease in blood glucose, but others have shown an increase in plasma insulin concentrations after whey protein which could explain the blunted glucose response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the time of ingestion of the ad libitum meal (30 min after the preload) corresponds to the peak insulin response after protein and carbohydrate preloads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]</p><p>One limitation in the first study is the palatability of the pea protein preload which was lower than the other preloads. It was not possible to control for palatability in the statistical analysis due to its correlation with energy intake. It is not clear how much of the observed effect on energy intake is driven by palatability. For instance, the casein preload, in the first experiment, had a similar palatability to albumin and whey preloads but still resulted in significantly lower energy intake. Studies by Spitzer et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and Poppitt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] found little or no evidence for a reduced food intake after low palatable foods. Furthermore, De graaf et al have shown that palatability has an effect on the intake of the preload itself and not on subsequent food intake and satiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Other limitations include including only male subjects which raises the question of whether these findings can be applied to women as well, and the single blinded design of the studies which could result in a bias on the results. However for the latter, the person administering the treatments was not the same person preparing them, and given that the drinks were served in opaque and covered cups, the bias is quite limited.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Different protein sources have distinct metabolic and behavioural effects. Casein and pea proteins show a promising effect on lowering short-term food intake. A beneficial impact on satiation may require a slow rate of consumption but this remains to be tested.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>AUC: area under the curve; BMI: body mass index; CHO: carbohydrate; CSS: combined satiety score; e.g.: for example; g: grams, hrs: hours; i.e.: that is; kcal: kilocalorie; kg: kilogram; m: meter; min: minutes; ml: millilitre; mm: millimetre; PC: personal computer; PFC: prospective food consumption; TFEQ: three factor eating questionnaire; VAS: visual analogue scales; vs: versus; yrs: years.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors were employees of Nestec S.A. during the planning and execution of the studies.
