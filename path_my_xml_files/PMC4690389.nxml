People with chronic disability use the majority of the National Health Service (NHS) and other resources that are devoted to back pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the management of non-specific low back pain were published in 2009. These proposed a care pathway in which all those people with non-specific low back pain that has not resolved after 6&#x000a0;weeks should be offered a choice of three different therapist-delivered interventions; exercise, or manual therapy, or acupuncture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Those with continuing problems after one or more of these treatment options would then be able to access an intensive programme of combined physical and psychological intervention lasting up to 100&#x000a0;hours, a duration that has rarely been delivered in practice. The guidelines made &#x02018;do not use&#x02019; recommendations for a range of treatment approaches that have not been proven to be effective through randomised controlled trials, including the injection of therapeutic substances into the back. Some of these procedures, including intra-articular facet joint injections, whilst not universally available, remain in common use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. There has been renewed interest in evaluating invasive procedures for low back pain including intra-articular facet joint injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. A definite diagnosis of facet joint pain can only be made following a diagnostic procedure. In clinical practice it would be unusual to do a diagnostic procedure before considering a therapeutic intra-articular facet joint injection; the diagnosis of probable facet joint pain is usually made on clinical grounds alone.</p><p>Continuing pain, or increasing pain during physiotherapy or other exercise, is cited as a barrier to engagement with physiotherapy interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Even short-term pain relief following facet joint injections might facilitate rehabilitation and improve patient outcomes. We, therefore, wish to conduct a randomised controlled trial of adding intra-articular facet joint injections to a combined physical and psychological intervention, deliverable in the NHS, for people with living with probable facet joint pain. If the trial has positive results then use of intra-articular facet joint injections will be justified. If the trial is negative its conclusions need to be sufficiently robust that all parties are satisfied that the evidence does not support their use. Here we present the protocol for a feasibility trial for such a trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This protocol has been developed and informed by recent best evidence and a consensus conference of experts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives of the trial</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Primary objective</title><p>The primary objective of this trial is to explore the feasibility of running a randomised controlled trial to test the hypothesis that for people with suspected facet joint pain contributing to persistent low back pain, the addition of intra-articular facet joint injections to best usual non-invasive care available from the NHS is clinically and cost effective.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Secondary objectives</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To test and evaluate agreed criteria for identifying people with suspected facet joint pain.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To test and evaluate an agreed protocol for the injection of facet joints in a consistent manner.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To test and evaluate a standardised control treatment deliverable in the NHS and congruent with NICE guidance (best usual care).</p></list-item><list-item><p>To test systems for collecting short- and long-term pain outcomes, including measures required for economic evaluation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To demonstrate that recruitment to the main trial is feasible.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To collect the recruitment and outcome data required to inform sample size and number of sites needed for the main trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To obtain an initial indication of pain relief to inform the need for a full trial.</p></list-item><list-item><p>To do a process evaluation that includes patient experience within the trial.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Trial design</title><p>This is a multicentre (up to six sites) randomised controlled trial with two arms.

If they are potentially eligible they will be provided with additional information. An assessment consultation with a research physiotherapist will determine if a participant is actually eligible. If they are eligible and they would like to join the study, written informed consent will be obtained by trained research health professionals at each of the sites. The patient flow is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

We will recruit 150 participants to the randomised feasibility trial over 6&#x000a0;months, randomised into two equal groups. Data from the resulting 75 patients in the active injection group will allow us to estimate the proportion with &#x02018;true&#x02019; facet joint pain, based on achieving immediate pain relief (a reduction of 50&#x000a0;% or more), with a standard error of 5.5&#x000a0;% if the true proportion is 62&#x000a0;%. The proportion of 62&#x000a0;% is based on the figure found in the best previous study; we would hope we can achieve a higher treatment response rate than this with a commensurate increase in precision.</p><p>We have also considered how the effect size found in a between-group comparison within this feasibility trial will influence a decision to run a main trial. Essentially, we should only proceed if the limit for the 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval includes a value that would be indicative of a clinically important difference in favour of the injection group; if it does not then we should not proceed. At the design stage we calculated that if the desired standardised mean difference (between-group difference/pooled baseline standard deviation) indicative of a minimally clinically important difference is in range 0.3&#x02013;0.4, then after allowing for 20&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up, if we recruit 150 participants then the probability of proceeding to a full trial if true effect is zero is around 50&#x000a0;%.

The main questionnaire packages are completed at baseline (at trial entry assessment) and follow-up (3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months post randomisation). A pain severity (today) score will be recorded daily for 35&#x000a0;days from 7&#x000a0;days before the first treatment session and following this weekly until 3-month follow-up. For this we are testing the use of text messaging to allow participants to respond by text. However, paper diaries will be provided as a back-up as this is our primary outcome. Health utilities (measured using the EuroQol EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L) will be recorded weekly from 1&#x000a0;week prior to the first treatment session until the night before the injection appointment when we will ask participants to complete the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L measure for 8&#x000a0;days then weekly until the 3-month follow-up. In addition, intervention participants will record a pain severity score 45&#x02013;60 minutes before and after injection. Clinical data will be collected and recorded by physiotherapists and clinicians, covering patients&#x02019; assessments, injections and involvement in the best usual care. It may be necessary to increase the number of data points for the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L and the pain severity score; first, if an injection is cancelled/rescheduled and second, towards the end to ensure test-retest reliability. We will undertake postal follow-up with two postal reminders, and one telephone call for primary outcomes at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Outcome measures and delivery time points</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="2">Type of data</th><th rowspan="2">Outcome measures</th><th colspan="5">Time points</th></tr><tr><th>1<sup>a</sup>

Waiting room posters will allow patients to self-refer to the study. At some sites patients who are attending clinics with low back pain may be approached by their treating clinician or a member of their team, to assess possible participation in the trial. Those patients in which the GP suspects a specific cause for their back pain (tumour, fracture infection, ankylosing spondylitis) will normally have been referred in through a different pathway. Referrals will include, but not necessarily be limited to, pain clinics, neurosurgery, rheumatology and orthopaedic clinics. Potential participants will be sent a brief Information Sheet along with a Screening Questionnaire and Expression of Interest Form by a member of the investigator&#x02019;s trial team based at the local site (e.g. a research nurse or physiotherapist) to assess preliminary eligibility for enrolment into the trial.</p><p>The potential participant will be asked to return the completed Screening Questionnaire and Expression of Interest Form to the study team at the local site in an envelope provided. From review of the questionnaire, if the potential participant appears eligible and interested, a member of the local site trial team will send the full Participant Information Sheet regarding the trial. Specifically the full Information Sheet will inform the patient about the eligibility assessment they are being invited to attend, which will help determine their possible inclusion in the trial, clearly explaining that it is only at this assessment that their eligibility will be confirmed. They will be invited to attend an appointment for their clinical/physical (diagnostic) assessment at a nominated research clinic. Each site will be required to maintain an anonymised trial Screening Log monitoring the number of screening packs sent out, returned and recruited, noting reasons for ineligibility. Only screening data from consenting participants will be returned to the coordination centre at Warwick CTU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Diagnostic assessment (visit A)</title><p>Those potential participants who are interested and appear eligible based on the Brief Screening Questionnaire and Expression of Interest will be invited to attend an appointment for the initial eligibility physiotherapy assessment.

Participants will undergo a thorough initial physical assessment (60&#x000a0;minutes) based on the principles of Maitland manual therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The assessment will also include discussion of patient expectations, fear avoidance and perceived self-efficacy.</p><p>Once the first trial physiotherapy session is completed, the participant will be randomised to receive facet joint injection with the best usual care package (intervention arm), or the best usual care package only (control arm). The investigator trial team will then complete the randomisation process and inform the participant whether they need to attend for an injection.

The treating clinician will at this time make their own assessment of the participant&#x02019;s suitability for facet joint injection and obtain consent for the procedure following normal practice in each participating Trust. The treating clinician may postpone injection in the presence of short-term illness (e.g. influenza). If significant comorbidity is identified at this time that contra-indicates injection, this will be &#x02018;flagged&#x02019; to the patient notes, local investigator, site clinician or general practitioner, whichever is most appropriate. The participant will continue to receive the control intervention.</p><p>Up to six facet joints (L3/L4, L4/L5, L5/S1 bilaterally) in each participant will be injected. However, where, on clinical assessment, there is unilateral pain, or involvement of only some levels, the operator may choose to do unilateral injection, or be selective on levels injected. This pragmatic approach reflects current clinical practice within the NHS.</p><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> outlines the injection procedure that was agreed at consensus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Procedure for intra-articular facet joint injections (for this trial)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2015_1117_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>We will use the feasibility data to inform the development of a baseline decision-analytic model, which will allow important elements of resource use, costs and health consequences and gaps in the economic evidence to be identified. This may include an element to account for long-term harms from radiation. Further, we will employ value of information techniques using the data available from the feasibility trial (supplemented, where necessary, using data from secondary sources) to give us an indication of whether it is reasonable to proceed to a main trial. This will supplement our clinical analysis in the decision-making process regarding a main trial. If these data effectively exclude a reasonable possibility that the intervention is cost-effective then we would not wish to proceed to a main trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Our objectives are to understand the patient and professional participants&#x02019; experience of the trial processes, the intervention and intervention sequelae to inform the design of a future full trial.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Quantitative data</title><p>Data will be collected in relation to the number of patients approached, who agree to participate in the trial, and who are randomised.

In choosing to do these interviews at this time we are mindful that the interviews themselves might introduce bias into our between-group comparison and that there will be some loss in quality of the qualitative data because of recall bias. Pragmatically, we will do these after we have collected 3&#x000a0;months of follow-up needed for our primary analysis. Interviews will be face to face or by telephone. The choice will be left to the participant to help maximise recruitment. We will recruit for diversity of age, gender and baseline severity of back pain. Interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed. Early interviews will be reviewed and the interview schedule developed based on the data. Recruitment will continue until data saturation. We expect this to be after approximately 15 interviews.</p><p>Interviews will cover: past experience of back pain, actions taken to help back pain such as treatments sought, how the participant summarised their experience of back pain as a diary pain score and in response to the EQ-5D-5&#x000a0;L, expectations of the effect of the intervention and whether these were met, any change the participant thinks that has or has not occurred, and experience of trial processes such as recruitment process and use of the diary.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Focus groups/interviews with trial team members and clinicians delivering intervention</title><p>We will run focus groups (or, if impractical, interviews) with trial team members involved in recruitment and data collection and with clinicians delivering interventions and clinic staff associated with intervention delivery. We will undertake this data collection at each recruiting Trust. Focus groups will be facilitated by an experienced researcher. Where possible they will be observed by a second researcher. Focus groups and interviews will be audio recorded. The topic guide will include: experience of patient recruitment and assessment, intervention delivery, and outcome data collection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Observation of assessment at trial entry and delivery of intervention/control intervention</title><p>A researcher independent of the team will sequentially observe up to five of each of: initial assessment, intervention, and control intervention events. The researcher will take field notes and provide almost immediate feedback to the trial team on issues of variation in delivery so these can receive attention.

The trial team will review and refine draft criteria, which will then be tested on a further five events of each type later in the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Analysis</title><p>We will develop a detailed statistical analysis plan prior to any analyses.

We will undertake a thematic analysis, interrogating and coding the data for each of the objectives. Data relevant to each theme will be compared within samples (patients/observed events/focus groups) paying particular attention to variation in the data from participants with different characteristics (e.g. age) or from different contexts. Data relevant to each theme will also be compared across samples e.g. contrasting patient/clinician data. The analysis will be written up as a report to inform the design of a subsequent main trial.</p><p>Data will be synthesised and anonymous quotations will be used as exemplars of themes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Regulatory authorities/ethical approval</title><p>The Facet Injection Study comes under the definition of a Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP) under the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and will therefore require submission to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
