The secretion of chloride (CS) into the gastrointestinal tract lumen is pivotal in the body's ability to process non-digestible food components. CS sets the optimal rate of hydration for non-digestible food components, their fluidity, and their adequate propulsion along the alimentary tract. Chloride is also instrumental in the secretion of alimentary tract mucus, and the formation of a gel-like, viscous mucus-buffer layer. This layer acts as the first line and vanguard of the mucosal barrier. This barrier is essential in mucosal lubrication and protection. Lubiprostone, a novel chloride channel stimulator ClC-2, is currently approved for the treatment of CC. Its impact on mucus, mucus secretion, and viscosity is not established.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>A double-blind, crossover trial was approved by the IRBs at the Kansas University Medical Center (Kansas City, KS) (study site) and at the Texas Tech University HSC (El Paso, TX) (analysis site). The study included 20 patients (17 females (F); mean age: 37 years) with symptoms of CC diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria. Patients were randomized to 1 week of therapy with lubiprostone or placebo followed by a 1 week washout and 1 week of the alternative therapy. Gastric juice was collected basally and during stimulation with pentagastrin (6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/kg body weight subcutaneously) at the end of weeks 1 and 3. Pentagastrin stimulation mimics food stimulation. The mucus content in gastric juice was assessed gravimetrically. The mucin content was measured after its purification using ultracentrifugation. The viscosity of the gastric secretion was measured using a digital viscometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>In comparison with placebo, the volume of gastric secretion in patients with CC during administration of lubiprostone increased significantly by 50&#x00025; (86.3 vs. 57.5&#x02009;ml/h) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) in basal conditions and increased by 25&#x00025; (210.0 vs. 167.6&#x02009;ml/h) (<italic>P</italic>=0.024) during stimulation with pentagastrin. The rate of gastric mucus secretion during therapy with lubiprostone was 91&#x00025; higher (257.3 vs. 135&#x02009;mg/h) (<italic>P</italic>=0.001) in basal conditions and 28&#x00025; higher (348.1 vs. 270.8&#x02009;mg/h) (NS) in stimulated conditions, although the latter was not statistically significant. The rate of gastric mucin secretion during lubiprostone therapy was 85&#x00025; higher (98.4 vs. 65.5&#x02009;mg/h) (<italic>P</italic>=0.011) in basal conditions and 38&#x00025; (98.3 vs. 71.7&#x02009;mg/h) (NS) higher in stimulated conditions. In basal conditions, the viscosity of gastric secretion during administration of lubiprostone increased by 240&#x00025; at the lowest (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and by 106&#x00025; at the highest shear rate (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). In stimulated conditions, it increased by 226&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) at the lowest shear rate and by 67&#x00025; (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) at the highest shear rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The significantly higher content of gastric mucus and mucin during therapy in basal conditions with lubiprostone in patients with CC suggests and supports the potentially leading role of lubiprostone and ClC-2 stimulation in their secretion. This increased stimulation results in profoundly increased viscosity, which in turn facilitates and/or accelerates the transit and evacuation of non-digestible food components. Although increases in mucus and mucin were observed in stimulated conditions, neither increase was statistically significant. Based on this experiment, we hypothesize that, in CC patients, the significantly increased rate of mucus and its major component, mucin secretion, during lubiprostone administration may partially explain its clinical effectiveness and also have additional clinically important effects. We propose that since the increased mucus production enhances the protective quality of the mucosal barrier, it also boosts its potential to withstand luminal aggressive components such as acid/pepsin duet, <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/aspirin, or a combination of all. Further trials are needed to test this hypothesis. As this was crossover clinical trial, the patients serve as their own controls. No interaction was found with body mass index (BMI) and treatment. The observed relationships of BMI and mucus and mucin secretions and gastric juice volume are important considerations in the design of future trials, particularly if a crossover design is not used.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The alimentary tract mucosa is covered by an ~200-&#x003bc;m-thick viscoelastic mucus-buffer layer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> This mucus-buffer layer protects a delicate surface epithelium from various luminal chemical and physical aggressive factors.

A tight protocol was used and all volunteers completed the study. Standardized criteria were used to determine subject eligibility and to assess CC. No crossover affect was identified in the multivariate analyses. BMI appeared as a significant covariate in several analyses. No interaction between BMI and treatment was observed.</p><p>The major limitations of our study are based on the fact that the 20 enrollees were volunteers with established CC. Eighty-five percent were female and 90&#x00025; were Caucasians. The study was designed to assess the impact of lubiprostone on lubrication in this select population. To fully generalize these results, additional studies would be required, which include a large sample of males, African Americans, longer treatment and follow-up phases, additional data on prior CC history and risk factors, assessment of clinically significant end points, such as frequency of bowel movements, and ease of evacuation. As patients served as their own controls in the current study, the importance of considering BMI in the analyses was identified, but did not affect these findings. If future studies are designed so that patients do not serve at their own control, this study substantiates the need to consider BMI as a factor in the study design.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The significantly higher content of gastric mucus and mucin during therapy with lubiprostone in patients with CC suggests and supports the potentially leading role of ClC-2 stimulation in their secretion, resulting in profoundly increased viscosity facilitating and/or accelerating transit, as well as the evacuation of non-digestible food components.</p><p>Based on this experiment, we hypothesize that in CC patients, the significantly increased rate of mucus and its major component, mucin secretion, during lubiprostone administration may partially explain its clinical effectiveness and also have additional important clinical effects. We propose that as the increased mucus production enhances the protective quality of the mucosal barrier, it also boosts its potential to withstand luminal aggressive components such as acid/pepsin duet, <italic>H. pylori</italic> and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs/aspirin, or a combination of all. Further trials are needed to test this hypothesis.</p><p>As this was a crossover clinical trial, the patients serve as their own controls. No interaction was found with BMI and treatment. The observed relationships of BMI and mucus and mucin secretions and gastric juice volume are important considerations in the design of future trials, particularly if a crossover design is not used.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ctg201419i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><notes><p><bold>Guarantor of the article</bold>: Jerzy Sarosiek, MD, PhD, FACG, AGAF.</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions</bold>: Jerzy Sarosiek have conceived, initiated, and wrote the research project, as well as collected samples from enrolled patients in this study protocol.
