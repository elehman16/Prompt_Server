In patients with AO type B and C fracture with the Penning wrist fixator, the wrist was partially dynamized at 3 weeks, allowing 30&#x000b0; range of wrist motion (20&#x000b0; palmar flexion to 10&#x000b0; dorsiflexion) by unlocking the distal ball and socket joint. Full mobilization of the wrist by unlocking both the ball and socket joints three times a day was started 5 weeks post surgery. The fixator was removed at 6 weeks in all patients with AO type A fracture and at 8 weeks in patients with type B and C fractures, irrespective of the patient's age and degree of comminution of the fracture. The rehabilitation program was continued for 4 weeks after removal of the fixator.

All the scores were recorded by a trained physiotherapist. At each follow-up, radiography was repeated. A record was kept of the volar tilt of the distal radial fragment, the loss of ulnar tilt of the distal radius, and loss of radial height (as compared to the uninjured side). The same was graded as per Lindstrom's<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> anatomical score (modified by Sarmiento<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Anatomical results were further recorded in a descriptive manner.</p><p>A statistical analysis was performed using Stata<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software version 10 (StataCorp LP, Texas, USA). The patient demographics and baseline injury data were compared in the two groups to identify possible confounders. Gartland and Werley scores assessed at each examination were pooled and regressed on two indicator variables:</p><p>1) management modality (JESS fixator vs Penning fixator) and 2) follow-up time. The fracture type, side of injury (dominant or nondominant), presence of ulnar fracture, and Sangha score were added to the regression model for statistical adjustment. The Wald test was used to investigate the overall effect of management and follow-up time on functional outcome and to look for any interaction between management and time. If the overall management effect was statistically significant, these differences were quantified. Since we had single time point results of DASH scores we used a nonparametric test (rank sum test) for comparison of the two groups. Simple regression analysis was done to look for effect of defined confounders. We tried to correlate the two functional scores and the anatomical score using Spearman correlation coefficient. The occurrences of complications were compared between groups using univariable Fisher's exact test, and surgical treatment effect was quantified by the relative risk (RR) (along with its 95% confidence interval).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>Sixty patients with the same number of fractures were included and equally assigned to the two treatment group between April 2006 and December 2007. The follow-up rate was 100%. The mean age of patients treated with JESS fixator was 41.2 years, which was comparable to that of the patients treated with the Penning fixator (43.0 years). The patients were predominantly males: 67% (n=20) in the JESS fixator group and 70% (n=21) the Penning fixator group). In both groups, most of the patients were soldiers (n=18 in each). The mean Sangha comorbidity score was 2.1 in the JESS fixator group as against 3.5 in the Penning fixator group. The dominant hand was injured in twelve (40%) patients in JESS fixator group as against fifteen (50%) in the Penning fixator group. Road traffic accident and falls were the predominant (&#x0003e;80%) modes of injury in both groups. The average ISS in the JESS and Penning fixator group was 4.7 and 4.3, respectively. As per the AO classification, the JESS fixator group had 14 type A, 4 type B, and 12 type C fractures. The Penning fixator group had 17 type A, 6 type B, and 7 type C fractures.

In type C fractures (n=18), we used K-wires and FFS to stabilize the fracture and support the articular fragments.

However, the patient-reported function, as assessed by DASH score, was similar in the two groups at 2 years. Our results are at variance with the results obtained in a randomized trial conducted by Sommerkamp <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref> and by McBirnie <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref> The Penning fixator group consistently restored the palmar tilt of the distal radius, and loss of ulnar tilt and radial height was less than in the JESS fixator group.

Early wrist movements by unlocking the ball and socket joint did not lead to accelerated loss of reduction as compared to static fixation, which is in contradiction to the results of Sommerkamp <italic>et al</italic>. Our study concluded that none of the fixators were able to reliably restore or maintain the anatomy of the distal radius over mid-term follow-up. This compares well with the comparative study of McBirnie and coworkers. Better anatomical restoration did not ensure better function at 2-year follow-up as assessed by the DASH scores. Similar results have been published by many authors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref> The Gartland and Werley score, which is a combined subjective (patient-oriented) and objective (surgeon-oriented) score, showed better correlation with the anatomical outcome. Restoration of anatomy may lead to improved restoration of objective measurement of joint movement and function but it has little effect on subjective functional outcome.</p><p>It seems that non-bridging external fixation of AO type A fractures achieves better functional and anatomical outcome. These results compare well with those seen by McQueen and coworkers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref> The pins in the distal fragment permit the surgeon to have direct control, which allows exact repositioning. There is no mechanical restriction of wrist movement with a non-bridging fixator and this allows immediate postoperative mobilization of the wrist. Non-bridging external fixation may be the treatment of choice for unstable fractures of the distal radius in which external fixation is contemplated and there is sufficient space in the distal fragment. Larger clinical trials are needed to confirm the utility of non-bridging external fixators in this subgroup of fractures.</p><p>Our study has a few limitations. Most of our patients were active males below 60 years of age and had good bone stock. Hence it may not be possible to extrapolate our results to an older age-group or postmenopausal female patients with poor bone quality. Another limitation of our study is that 60% of the patients were soldiers. Although the patient data was anonymised and it was made explicit to the subjects that any data from the study would not be used beyond the purview of the study, the patient-reported outcomes may have been biased in case of soldiers who may have wanted to hide any disability. It was not possible to blind the subjects to the treatment in both the groups. The major strength of our study is the 100% follow-up rate.</p><p>Over last decade there have been numerous clinical trials that have tried to find the best method of management for displaced unstable comminuted distal radial fractures. A Cochrane review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref> of the subject concluded that there is still no robust evidence to support any specific modality of treatment. Our study used a specific design (Penning fixator) of dynamic external fixator and compared its result with that of a static fixator (JESS type). When used as a transarticular (bridging) fixator for management of displaced unstable comminuted distal radial fractures in young adults, the Penning fixator did demonstrate better anatomical restoration and early objective functional results as compared to the static fixator. The limited range of wrist movement that it allowed at 3 weeks did result in improvement in early functional outcome; however, it did not have significant difference on patient-reported function at 2-year follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold>
