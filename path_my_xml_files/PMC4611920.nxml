Hastak <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] in his study to evaluate the efficacy of turmeric extract, turmeric oil and turmeric oleoresin reported all the patients showed clinical improvement in burning sensation to various degrees out of which turmeric oil showed optimum effect.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Das <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in the study reported that patients in Groups I and II (curcumin capsules and turmeric oil) presented with statistically significant reduction in burning sensation and intolerance to spicy food after 3 months of treatment and follow-up, when compared to those in Group III (placebo group).

In relation to VAS scale with spicy and normal food the average reduction was 64 (42&#x02013;73) and 77 (70.5&#x02013;82) as compared to 34 (14.5&#x02013;64.5) and 64 (46&#x02013;75.5) respectively in control group. The test (curcumin) group results achieved in the treatment span was sustained in the follow-up (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to the control group showed statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) relapse.</p><p>It can be concluded that combination strategies for the management of OSF which include the stoppage of causative ill habits, appropriate medicinal and physiotherapy management is more efficient than single therapeutic modality.</p><p>In the short treatment span and small sample size, curcumin, a active ingredient in turmeric which is extensively used as medicinal plant in Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha medicine as home remedy for various diseases, has shown long term beneficial effects. Curcumin being antioxidant and antiinflammatory may enhance the neoangiogenic and antifibrotic potential of the sufferers. To our knowledge, till date no human randomized clinical trials have been reported in the literature to evaluate the efficacy of curcumin over any standard medicinal management modality for OSF. It is evident from the study that curcumin holds good promise in the treatment of OSF in future.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to acknowledge the contribution by:</p><p>
