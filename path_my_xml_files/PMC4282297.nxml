Sixty-four infertile patients with stage III or IV endometriosis undergoing IVF were randomly allocated to the study or the control group. The long protocol of GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) was used for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in all patients. Patients in the study group were treated with pioglitazone at a dose of 15 mg/day orally from the starting day of GnRH-a treatment to the day of hCG injection. Blood samples were drawn for serologic assay of RANTES on the first day of GnRH-a treatment and the day of hCG injection. There were no differences between the study and control groups in patient characteristics. There were also no differences between the two groups in COS duration, and the numbers of retrieved oocytes, fertilized oocytes and embryos transferred. The clinical pregnancy rate per cycle was higher in the study group, but this difference was not statistically significant. However, embryo implantation rate was significantly higher in the study group of 12.5% compared with 8.6% in the control group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). The serum RANTES levels after pioglitazone treatment were significantly lower than those before pioglitazone treatmen in the study group (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).

RANTES has been shown to be responsible for 70% of the stimulation of monocyte migration caused by peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al., 2001a</xref>). Some authors have suggested that RANTES production might be inhibited by activation of the PPAR pathway. Thiazolidinediones including rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are a new class of insulin sensitizers that do not stimulate insulin secretion (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">Adams et al., 1997</xref>). These drugs act as PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> agonists, alter gene expression, enhance the sensitivity of tissue to insulin, and partially reverse lipid abnormalities in patients with diabetes (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Lenhard, 2001</xref>). Therefore, theses drugs have been used for patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) undergoing IVF treatment. Our previous study demonstrated that pioglitazone therapy reduces intraovarian stromal blood flow and is beneficial in improving both the response to ovarian stimulation and IVF outcome in PCOS patients undergoing IVF (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2010</xref>).

Therefore, we performed this study to investigate the effect of pioglitazone, a drug of the thiazolidinedione class, on production of RANTES and <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) outcomes in infertile patients with stage II or IV endometriosis undergoing IVF treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><label>1.</label><title>Patients</title><p>Sixty-four infertile patients with stage III or IV endometriosis who underwent IVF were prospectively recruited to this randomized study, which was performed at the university-based infertility clinic of the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea. All subjects were diagnosed by laparoscopic surgery and histologic examination with stage III or IV endometriosis according to the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) classification. All patients provided written informed consent. Patients were randomly allocated to the treatment group (n=32) or the placebo group (n=32) by number allocation using sealed envelopes. A power calculation showed 82% when each groups consisted of 32 patients. All patients had endometriosis, and had failed to ovulate or conceive after repeated treatment with clomiphene citrate or gonadotropin. All patients were in good health with normal thyroid, hepatic, and renal function. Blood samples were collected from each patient on menstrual cycle day (MCD) 3 for basal measurement of sex hormone and prolactin levels.</p></sec><sec><label>2.</label><title>Controlled Ovarian Stimulation (COS)</title><p>The long protocol of GnRH agonist (GnRH-a) was used for COS in all patients. Daily injection of a GnRH agonist 1 mg (Leuprorelin acetate, Lorelin; Dongkook, Korea) was initiated commencing at the midluteal phase and was continued until menses, followed by a dose reduction to 0.5 mg daily. Ovarian stimulation was started with 50&#x02013;150 IU of recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (rhFSH, Puregon; Organon, Oss, the Netherlands) on menstrual day 3. The initial dose of rhFSH was calculated with reference to patient age and body mass index. When one or more follicles attained a mean diameter of &#x02265; 18 mm, 250 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g hCG was subcutaneously administered to induce follicular maturation.</p><p>In the pioglitazone treatment group, pioglitazone (Actos; Takeda, Osaka, Japan), 15 mg once daily, was given on the commencement day of GnRH-a administration to the day of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Ovidrel; Serono, Geneva, Switzerland) injection. In the control group, placebo was administered during the same period. Oocytes were retrieved 35&#x02013;36 hours later, and one to four embryos were transferred to the uterus three days later. During the luteal phase, 90 mg of vaginal progesterone gel (Crinone 8%; Serono) was applied once daily, starting on the day of oocyte retrieval. Pregnancies were identified by an increase in serum <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hCG concentration and transvaginal ultrasonographic evidence of a gestational sac. Serum concentrations of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-hCG were measured 11 days after embryo transfer (ET) by radioimmunoassay using an hCG MAIA clone kit (Serono Diagnostics, Woking, UK); the inter- and intra-assay variances values were &#x0003c;10% and 5%, respectively. A clinical pregnancy was defined as the presence of a gestational sac on ultrasonography. Blood samples were drawn for serologic assay of RANTES on the day on which the GnRH agonist was first administered and the day of HCG injection. We analyzed serum RANTES concentrations before and after treatment in both groups. RANTES was measured using a solid-phase enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Medgenix Diagnostics, Fleurus, Belgium); interassay and intraassay variances were less than 10% and 5%, respectively.</p></sec><sec><label>3.</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results are reported as means &#x000b1; standard deviations (SDs).

The reported disease prevalence varies widely depending on the population studied and the method of sampling employed, the prevalence of endometriosis appears to range from 2% to 18%, whereas within infertile populations the prevalence has been reported to be as high as 50% (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Missmer &#x00026; Cramer, 2003</xref>). Endometriosis is associated with activation of immune cells and aberrant cytokine production in peritoneal fluid, creating a local inflammatory environment (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">Lebovic et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Wu &#x00026; Ho, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In pathologic states including chronic endometritis and endometriosis, inflammation followed by cellular infiltration into the area of interest and is followed by differentiation and activation of immune cells (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Pritts et al., 2002</xref>). Such cells secrete growth factors, cytokines, prostanoids, complement components, and hydrolytic enzymes (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">Oral et al., 1996</xref>). These signals are released into the blood-stream and chemoattract other immune cells. The levels of cytokines associated with inflammation have been reported to be higher in women with endometriosis (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Bedaiwy et al., 2002</xref>) as well as in those with unexplained infertility (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">Demir et al., 2009</xref>). Both ectopic and eutopic endometrium can be stimulated to produce materials chemoattracting mononuclear cells, including monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Arici et al., 1997</xref>), interleukin-8 (IL-8) (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Arici et al., 1996</xref>) and RANTES (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Khorram et al., 1993</xref>). Many studies have demonstrated abnormal local endometrial production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a), IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Koninckx et al., 1999</xref>). Increasing evidence indicates that RANTES is the key chemokine involved at early stages of the inflammatory process (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Appay &#x00026; Rowland-Jones, 2001</xref>). One report showed that RANTES is responsible for 70% of the <italic>in vitro</italic> monocyte migration activity in peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Hornung et al., 2001</xref>). Subsequent activation of cellular inflammatory mediators might be prevented by blocking of early monocyte infiltration.</p><p>PPAR plays a key role in the regulation of inflammation and insulin secretion (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Yessoufou et al., 2006</xref>). Komar et al. (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) demonstrated transcription of PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> in rat granulosa cells. As well as exerting multiple effects on insulin production, recently thiazolinediones have been shown to exhibit both insulin-independent and insulin-sensitizing direct effects on steroidogenesis and production of IGF binding protein-1 in human ovarian cells. This implies that PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> is expressed in the human ovary (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Seto-Young et al., 2005</xref>). It has been reported that PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> also affect RANTES secretion even in the endometrial stromal cells (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Pritts et al., 2002</xref>). The cited <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggested that PPAR inhibits the pathway leading to RANTES expression in endometrial stromal cells. By binding to rosiglitazone, PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> receptor-ligand complexes seem to interact with response elements on the RANTES gene promoter, thereby blocking the subsequent transcription and translation of RANTES (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Pritts et al., 2002</xref>). However, studies on the effect of PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> or PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> agonist on RANTES secretion in endometriosis or endometrial tissue are very limited. Moreover, it is hard to find out the study on the effect of PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> agonist on RANTES and IVF outcome in patients with endometriosis.</p><p>Our study is the first report on the effect of thiazolinediones on RANTES secretion and IVF outcome in infertile women with advanced endometriosis undergoing IVF treatment. In the present study, we used a pioglitazone as a PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> ligand to treat infertile patients with endometriosis and evaluated whether PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> ligand such as pioglitazone could inhibit production of RANTES via activation of the PPAR pathway and improve IVF outcomes in infertile patients with advanced endometriosis undergoing IVF. As we expected before study, pioglitazone had a beneficial effect on RANTES secretion and IVF outcome in advanced enometriosis patients.</p><p>The thiazolidinediones including rosiglitazone and pioglitazone belong to a new class of insulin sensitizers that do not stimulate insulin secretion. The first available drug of the thiazolidinedione class, troglitazone, was effective to induce ovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but was later reported to be associated with fatal hepatotoxicity (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Azziz et al., 2001</xref>). This caused the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to withdraw approval of the drug. Rosiglitazone, another thiazolidinedione, has also been shown to be effective in inducing ovulation in PCOS patients. Few side-effects are evident in healthy subjects. However, the FDA encourages healthcare professionals to follow current recommendations on the drug label, including a contraindication of rosiglitazone use in patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure, and avoidance of use in patients with symptomatic heart failure. All patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of heart failure (rapid weight gain, difficulty in breathing, and/or swelling) after initiation of treatment and after an increase in dose (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Lago et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Singh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We have shown that administration of pioglitazone reduced the serum concentration of RANTES. Although the response to ovarian stimulation did not improve, the implantation rate was significantly higher in the treatment group. Further, in the pregnant subgroup, RANTES concentration was significantly lower than in the non-pregnant subgroup. Statistically significant differences in RANTES concentrations were evident before and after treatment. However, However, our study has a limitation to evaluate the efficacy of pioglitazone treatment in endometriosis patients due to a small number of sample available. Therefore, well-designed larger studies with longer follow-up times are needed to confirm the effectiveness and safety of pioglitazone.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref
