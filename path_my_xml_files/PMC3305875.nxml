Technological developments appear to have reduced X-ray doses and may help newer centres establish an AF ablation programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>3D mapping systems are widely used in catheter ablation of AF. Integration of a previously acquired image of the left atrium (LA) into the electroanatomical map offers several potential advantages, including visualization of the complex anatomy of the left atrium, reduction of fluoroscopy time and improved results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The two most widely used systems are Cartomerge (Biosense Webster, Diamond Bar, CA, USA) and NavX Fusion (St. Jude Medical Inc., Saint Paul, MN, USA). Although both systems have been independently validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], their clinical utility has not previously been directly compared in a randomised trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population</title><p>All eligible patients with either paroxysmal or persistent AF undergoing their first catheter ablation at St Bartholomew&#x02019;s Hospital were invited to participate in this study. All patients had symptomatic documented AF and had failed 1 or more class I and/or class III antiarrhythmic drugs. Exclusion criteria were &#x0003c;18&#x000a0;years of age, left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c;40%, known congenital heart disease or involvement in another study. The study was approved by the Outer North East London Research and Ethics committee (study number 07/4Q0603/66), and patients gave written informed consent. The design of the study followed the Consort guidelines for randomised trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>LA image acquisition</title><p>A multislice helical contrast CT was performed using GE Light-speed Ultra 8-slice scanner (GE Healthcare Technologies, Waukesha, WI, USA). The technique used for CT acquisition has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Towards the end of the recruitment period, it became possible to use a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scan image for segmentation of the LA, using a Seimens Magnotron 1.5-T MRI with cardiac gating.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Operator experience</title><p>Our centre had experience of &#x0003e;100 cases using image integration for each system at the start of patient recruitment. Image integration was performed by operators (ME, MD, SS, RS) assisted by technicians, each of whom had performed &#x0003e;20 image integrations and undergone training prior to the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Procedure</title><p>The procedure was performed in the post-absorptive state under conscious sedation. In patients with a CHADS2 score of &#x0003e;1, oral anticoagulation was administered for at least 4&#x000a0;weeks prior to the procedure. Transesophageal echocardiography was performed within 24&#x000a0;h prior to the procedure to exclude LA thrombus.</p><p>Local anaesthesia and conscious sedation was used for all procedures. Venous access, number and size of sheaths were at the operator&#x02019;s discretion. In the majority of cases, three venous sheaths (1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;7&#x000a0;F short sheath, 2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;F long sheath) were inserted via the right femoral vein without ultrasound guidance. If the patient was in AF at the start of the case, a decapolar catheter was positioned in the coronary sinus; otherwise, a quadripolar catheter was used. Two transseptal punctures were performed under fluoroscopic guidance with an Endry&#x02019;s coaxial needle using continuous pressure monitoring. Two long Mullin&#x02019;s sheaths were advanced into the LA, and a pulmonary vein mapping catheter (Ortbiter<sup>TM</sup> Woven, Bard Electrophysiology, Lowell, MA, USA) and an irrigated tip ablation catheter (either Navistar<sup>TM</sup> (Cartomerge group) or Celsius<sup>TM</sup> (NavX Fusion group) Thermocool, Biosense Webster Inc., Diamond Bar, CA, USA) were advanced through the sheaths.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Image integration</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>NavX fusion</title><p>The CT left atrium (CTLA) was imported into the proprietary Verisimo<sup>TM</sup> CT segmentation software. Image segmentation was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], ensuring that pulmonary veins were visible to second-order branch points and the left atrial appendage (LAA) was included in the scan. The rendered 3D image was imported into the NavX study. A geometry of the LA was collected from the PV mapping catheter, with particular attention given to collecting points at the PV ostia. Further geometry was collected from the mapping catheter. Field scaling was applied which refers to a computer algorithm that uses the known fixed separation of poles on the mapping catheter and the PV catheter to calibrate the non-linear electrical field data to real 3D space. Field scaling effectively reduces the apparent flattening and stretching of the LA geometry, making it easier to perform image integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. To integrate the image, 15 to 30 fiducial points that correspond to landmarks clearly visible on both CTLA and geometry are chosen. These often include, but are not limited to, venous bifurcations, the LAA, the intra-atrial septum, the mitral ring as well as several points on the roof, posterior wall and floor of the LA. When fiducial selection is complete, fusion is attempted. The geometry is rescaled to fit the segmented image, using the fiducials to effectively allow &#x02018;stretching&#x02019; of the geometry to match the exported scan image. Thereafter, catheters can be located on the scanned CT image shell, the matched geometry or both.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Cartomerge</title><p>Previously acquired scan images were imported into the proprietary Cartomerge image processing tool software. Segmentation was performed, ensuring that veins were visible to second-order branch points, and the segmented image imported into the Cartomerge study. The ablation catheter was placed on the roof of each vein in turn and retrograde pulmonary venography performed to confirm its exact position in relation to venous branch points. The position of the ablation catheter was identified and a Carto landmark point taken. This point was linked to its corresponding location on the segmented CT/CMR shell. Once points in all four veins had been acquired, landmark registration was applied. According to operator preference, further surface registration could be applied. Image integration was considered successful if the operator considered it to give an accurate representation of catheter location within the atrial chamber.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Ablation</title><p>PV WACA was performed using an irrigated tip catheter with power limited to 30&#x000a0;W and temperature to 50&#x000b0;C, with the endpoint electrical isolation determined by a circular PV catheter. In patients in whom AF persisted, further ablation was performed using a combination of (a) roof line, (b) mitral isthmus line, (c) coronary sinus endocardial and epicardial (within the CS) lines and (d) complex fractionated electrograms. If at any stage AF organized into atrial tachycardia (AT), activation and entrainment mapping was performed. If AF persisted following the linear ablation and targeting of fractionated electrograms, DC cardioversion was performed. Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation was performed only if patients had previously documented typical atrial flutter or organized into this during other ablation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Follow-up</title><p>All patients were reviewed in clinic at 3, 6 and 12&#x000a0;months following the procedure. If no episodes of AF recurrence had been documented, a 7-day Holter monitor was performed at 6 and 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was freedom from AF at 6&#x000a0;months, with AF recurrence defined either by documentation of symptomatic arrhythmia or arrhythmia on a 7-day Holter monitor at 6-month follow-up. Secondary endpoints were procedural, screening and energy delivery times for all stages of the procedure and complications and freedom from AF at 1&#x000a0;year following a single procedure</p><p>A sub-study aimed to determine navigational accuracy of image registration in clinical use. Data were taken from a consecutive series of 21 patients in each group where image registration had been used throughout the case. The distance from LA lesions points to their corresponding nearest location on the integrated image shell was assessed. Techniques for this assessment in both technologies have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This assessment assumes that lesion points are placed on the endocardial surface of the LA; lesions placed outside the endocardial LA (e.g. within coronary sinus) were excluded in this analysis. In Cartomerge, the three-dimensional linear distance from each lesion to the nearest point on the integrated image shell is calculated within the Cartomerge software. An equivalent distance can be calculated from data exported from NavX fusion. Lesion coordinates are exported separately, initially as 3D lesions and subsequently as projected onto the nearest corresponding point of the integrated image (&#x02018;Project on Dif&#x02019;). The primary objective of this sub-study was to compare observed accuracy during clinical use; therefore, both field scaling and surface registration were permitted. Offline analysis was performed using custom software to calculate linear distances between projected and 3D points for each lesion (Matlab, The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Assuming an overall single procedure success rate at 6&#x000a0;months of 60%, 63 patients were required in each group to achieve an 80% chance of detecting a 10% difference (alpha&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05, two-tailed) in outcomes between groups. Univariate continuous variables were compared with Student&#x02019;s <italic>T</italic> test or the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test as appropriate. Proportions were compared using the chi-squared test. Univariate survival analyses were performed by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method, and multivariate survival regression analyses were performed using the Cox regression method. Statistical analyses were carried out using PASW 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) software and Graphpad Prism 4 (Graphpad Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Analyses performed included data from all patients who underwent an ablation procedure. Data are presented on an intention-to-treat basis; hence, presented procedural data include information from patients who had unsuccessful image integration. A 6-week blanking period was observed, but timing of recurrence was ascribed to the earliest documented recurrence (even within this 6-week period). Values are given as means&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation unless otherwise stated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec15"><title>Randomisation and baseline factors</title><p>One hundred one patients were enrolled.

No symptomatic pulmonary venous stenosis was reported in either group, and no asymptomatic pulmonary venous stenosis was observed in any case undergoing a redo procedure or on further imaging performed for clinical indications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The principal findings of this study are that Cartomerge allowed a slightly faster and more accurate registration of the reconstructed LA than NavX fusion, but overall procedural times and clinical outcomes were unaffected by mapping system used. A reduction in X-ray screening associated with registration using Cartomerge was observed, but this was small in comparison to overall screening and did not translate to an overall reduction in X-ray use. Less ablation time was used with Cartomerge than with NavX fusion, and similar procedural results were achieved.</p><p>Clinical results, measured as freedom from AF at 6&#x000a0;months, were not different between groups. Although one system cannot be claimed to be superior overall to another for the catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation, the slightly faster procedural stages seen with Cartomerge and greater accuracy, particularly in image registration, may encourage its use for pulmonary vein isolation procedures.</p><p>This is the first prospective, randomised clinical trial comparing the two most widely commercially available 3D mapping systems. Image integration of a previously acquired anatomical dataset to 3D mapping systems offers several advantages in the ablation of complex arrhythmias, particularly AF where a good knowledge of anatomy is key to procedural success. The technique of image integration, particularly the process of registration, with Cartomerge and NavX fusion is quite distinct.</p><p>The Carto XP system locates catheter position in 3D space by trigonometry from three separate magnetic (linear) fields. The relative field strength in three planes enables location of a proprietary mapping catheter. User-selected locations (&#x02018;points&#x02019;) can link 3D locations with anatomical boundaries, and known anatomical landmarks can be used for rapid registration of a previously LA image. The technique used in this trial has previously been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. As magnetic fields vary in a linear manner (actually log-linear) with distance, and a fixed movement of the ablation catheter tip produces a corresponding and predictable change in magnetic fields detected by the catheter tip. Anatomical data can thus be imported into the Carto system without need for further calibration.</p><p>In contrast, NavX uses three orthogonal high-frequency electric fields to locate catheter position. Impedance changes due to catheters movement can be tracked in three dimensions and relative positions of catheters derived. Unlike magnetic fields, electrical fields within the human body are non-linear; thus, a fixed deviation of catheter produces an impedance change dependent on the exact location of the catheter within the body. The non-linearity of the NavX maps often gives an apparent anteroposterior flattening of the LA, and the anatomic dataset cannot be simply matched to position, as with Carto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Field scaling and image fusion attempt to overcome this non-linearity. Previous work by our group has confirmed that good anatomical accuracy can be obtained by NavX fusion when field scaling is performed and an adequate number of fiducial points selected. The presented data showing a navigational accuracy in clinical use of NavX Fusion of 3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.9&#x000a0;mm is in extremely close agreement with the accuracy of 3.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6&#x000a0;mm observed by Brooks and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] in a validation study.</p><p>Our results imply that image integration with NavX fusion is slower than Cartomerge. More ablation appeared to be required to achieve a similar clinical result with NavX fusion, possibly reflecting the higher accuracy of image registration with Cartomerge. These data give a mechanistic insight into improvements in outcomes associated with image integration with Carto XP seen in registry data, improvements not replicated with NavX fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Contributors to the slower registration process of NavX fusion were not formally examined in this study. NavX fusion requires the creation of a full LA NavX geometry to allow image registration, whilst Cartomerge allows image registration after acquisition of as few as three points; further surface registration points can be targeted subjectively thus minimising number of acquired points. We hypothesise that the conceptually simpler Cartomerge image registration thus has fewer steps and is less time-consuming. A recent retrospective analysis of Carto- vs. NavX-guided ablation (without specifying CT integration) also found that Carto-guided procedures were more rapid overall than those using NavX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Thus, time differences may not be entirely attributable to differences in CT integration technique.</p><p>Our findings are important when considering the future of 3D mapping technology in catheter ablation. Technological advances have recently allowed systems to integrate positional data from both impedance and magnetic data, aspiring to overcome limitations of both systems. Our data suggest that image integration in new systems would best be primarily based on magnetic location data. We believe that the utility, stability and accuracy of image integration in these new systems should be independently validated in the clinical setting.</p><p>We observed no differences in complication rates between groups. Neither symptomatic nor asymptomatic pulmonary vein stenosis was observed in this study, a purported benefit of 3D image integration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Limitations of this study</title><p>Since this study, a number of updates to both the technologies studies have been developed. The results of this study should be extrapolated to these newer system versions with caution, but these newer versions are likely to be available and used in a limited number of centres for some time, and our data will therefore remain relevant. Our study was performed with operators experienced in both systems; a comparison of the learning curve using either system was not undertaken.</p><p>In comparing the two mapping systems, to obtain optimal outcomes and to represent best practice in both groups, image integration was used. However, the complex geometries created by NavX system are often adequate to perform safe catheter ablation without 3D image integration. CartoXP anatomical maps appear simple and schematic in comparison. Image integration may thus hold a greater potential benefit for the Carto system over NavX. Indeed, when using NavX in clinical practice, many physicians use a pre-procedure CT to identify and exclude variant pulmonary venous anatomy; thereafter, the geometry is used alone during ablation. Our clinical practice has moved away from routine image integration with NavX fusion as a direct result of the presented data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Cartomerge offers faster and more reliable image registration than NavX fusion and may require less X-ray screening. Absolute differences between systems are small and do not translate into important differences in procedural length, cost or clinical outcome. Both systems can be considered equivalent for the first time of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="AppESM1"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="SecESM1"><p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="10840_2011_9632_MOESM1_ESM.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOC 270 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec id="d28e1636"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>M.F. and V.B. are recipients of St Jude Research Fellowships.
