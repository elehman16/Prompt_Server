Antioxidants can improve glycemic control, lipid profile, and cognitive functions. We assessed the effect of Vitamin E and omega 3 fatty acids (OFA) on the above parameters. One hundred patients with type 2 DM receiving metformin 500 mg and glimepiride 1 mg were randomized to receive add-on therapy of Vitamin E 400 mg or OFA once daily for 12 weeks and the third group served as control. Fasting blood sugar (FBS), postprandial blood sugar (PPBS), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR), lipid profile, and mini-mental state examination were done at baseline and 12 weeks. Eighty-seven patients completed the study. A significant reduction in FBS, PPBS, and HbA1c was observed in all the three groups at 12 weeks. There was significant reduction in total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) in patients receiving either of the antioxidants and also significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein in patients receiving OFA at 12 weeks compared to baseline. BMI and WHR were significantly increased in control group. Intergroup analysis showed that in patients receiving Vitamin E and OFA, the reduction of FBS, PPBS, and HbA1c were similar. The patients receiving OFA had significant reduction in TG compared to control. There was no significant effect on cognitive function. Vitamin E and OFA had beneficial effects on lipid profile and anthropometric measurements; however, the glycemic control was similar to the patients in control group.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Diabetes mellitus</kwd><kwd>glimepiride</kwd><kwd>metformin</kwd><kwd>omega 3 fatty acids</kwd><kwd>Vitamin E</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent noncommunicable disease.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Hyperglycemia leads to activation of polyol pathway, increased formation of intracellular advanced glycation end products, activation of protein kinase C isoforms, and overactivity of the hexosamine pathway.

One hundred patients diagnosed with type 2 DM receiving combination of metformin (500 mg) and glimepiride (1 mg) were recruited; among them, 87 completed the study.
