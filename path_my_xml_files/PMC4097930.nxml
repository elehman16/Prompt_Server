Previously, lipoprotein disorders were the purview of specialized lipidologists, but the demonstration that lipid-lowering therapy significantly reduces the clinical complications of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) has brought the diagnosis and treatment of these disorders into the domain of the internist.

In the light of above it would only be appropriate to explore the utility of those reputed pharmacopeial drug or a formulation their off for such activities.</p><p>The study test drug Safoof-e-Muhazzil (SM) is a classical Unani pharmacopeial formulation indicated for obesity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] In each 5 g it contains five herbal ingredients Tukhme badyan (<italic>Foeniculum vulgare</italic>) - 1 g, Nankhwa (<italic>Trachyspermum ammi</italic>) - 1 g, Zeera Siyah (<italic>Carum carvi</italic>) - 1 g, Sudab (<italic>Ruta graveolens</italic>) - 1 g, Marzanjosh (<italic>Origanum vulgare</italic>) - 0.25 g, one animal origin drug Luc Magsool (purified stick lac) - 0.5 g and a mineral origin drug Bura Armani (Borax) - 0.25 g. These constituents of SM have been attributed by Unani physicians to have deobstruent, dessicant and mulatif-e-urooq (vessel relaxant) properties and many of them have been proven to be antihyperlipidemic as well.

On the basis of above current study was designed to elucidate the effect of SM; primarily a classical Unani anti-obesity drug on hyperlipidemia in human subjects in its classical powder form in comparison to its compressed tablets in equivalent dose in a randomized, open label, standard controlled clinical trial.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was conducted at a Hospital in New Delhi after obtaining written informed consent from patients and approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee prior to enrollment for the study.

The control group was prescribed atorvastatin 10 mg orally once daily.

However, test drug had a better effect in emulating the associated clinical symptoms in comparison to control drug as the test drug also has proven antihypertensive as well as antiobesity properties.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>The test drug did not raise any safety issue.
