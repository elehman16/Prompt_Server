GERD is a common condition, particularly in the Western world, where the prevalence has been estimated to range between 10% and 20% using a definition of at least weekly heartburn and/or acid regurgitation[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Population studies in Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom (UK) reported a prevalence of frequent (at least weekly) heartburn and/or acid regurgitation of 9.8%, 16.7% and 18%, respectively[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Management of GERD focuses on symptom control and, as the severity of GERD varies significantly between patients, it should be individualized. Lifestyle modifications, including weight loss for overweight/obese patients and avoiding specific foods, may improve GERD outcomes[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Initial management for patients with uncomplicated heartburn is maintenance anti-secretory therapy with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) or histamine<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists (H<sub>2</sub>RAs). Anti-reflux surgery is recommended when a patient with GERD is responsive to, but intolerant of, acid suppressive therapy, or when troublesome symptoms persist despite PPI therapy[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>On-demand, patient-driven therapy with PPIs may provide cost-effective, convenient, successful treatment for GERD, other than for severe esophagitis[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Importantly, on-demand therapy differs from intermittent therapy, which requires predefined intermittent episodes of continuous therapy followed by discontinuation until symptoms recur. A systematic review encompassing 17 studies concluded that on-demand therapy with currently available PPIs is effective in the long-term management of GERD, excluding erosive esophagitis[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Zegerid (Santarus Inc, [now Salix], USA) has been developed for improved, rapid symptom relief of the symptoms of GERD as on-demand therapy. The two active ingredients in Zegerid are omeprazole, an established PPI therapy for GERD, and sodium bicarbonate, known to neutralize gastric acid. Most oral PPI preparations, including omeprazole, are enteric-coated in order to avoid rapid degradation of the drugs in the acidic conditions of the stomach; however this results in delayed-release characteristics. Zegerid contains an immediate-release preparation of omeprazole that does not require an enteric coating since the combination with sodium bicarbonate acts as a buffer to protect omeprazole from gastric acid degradation. The antacid sodium bicarbonate also provides rapid neutralization of gastric acid and, therefore, may provide faster relief of symptoms independent of the accelerated effect on omeprazole absorption. Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) and pH data from a randomized Phase I study in healthy volunteers suggested an onset benefit for this new combination formulation of omeprazole with sodium bicarbonate (Norgine, data on file). The Phase I study investigated the relative bioavailability and pharmacodynamic profiles of Zegerid (immediate-release omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate) 20mg capsule and Zegerid powder for oral suspension (Zegerid suspension) versus a comparator arm, Losec (enteric-coated omeprazole capsule, AstraZeneca, UK) 20mg. Intragastric pH rose more rapidly after treatment with both Zegerid formulations than after Losec in the Per Protocol (PP) and Intention-to-Treat (ITT) populations (<xref rid="pone.0116308.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Zegerid capsules demonstrated a faster time to maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) compared with Losec (0.50 vs. 1.38 hours, p = 0.0001) and Zegerid suspension showed a superior Tmax compared with Losec (0.38 hours versus 1.38 hours, p&#x0003c;0.001). Based on these pH data, it was proposed that both Zegerid formulations may provide more rapid clinical relief of heartburn symptoms associated with GERD than delayed-release omeprazole.</p><fig id="pone.0116308.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0116308.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Mean intragastric pH, PP population, Unpublished Phase I study.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0116308.g001"/></fig><p>The previously held conventional theory was that heartburn symptoms are secondary to acid reflux[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, pH was an acceptable surrogate marker for heartburn, with an increase of esophageal pH linked directly to symptom relief[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, it has been demonstrated that ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring in patients refractory to PPI therapy is predominantly normal[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is now recognized that non-acid reflux can produce heartburn symptoms, and may contribute to the persistence of symptoms in patients on PPI therapy[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Indeed, simultaneous intraesophageal impedance and pH measurement in patients with persistent symptoms despite acid-suppressive therapy demonstrated that symptoms were associated with non-acid reflux in around a third of patients[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Other constituents of gastric contents may induce esophageal symptoms[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], with bile and pepsin both identified as contributing to reflux episodes[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Due to the contribution of other mechanisms to symptomatic reflux episodes, regulatory authorities no longer accept intragastric pH as a surrogate marker for heartburn. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) &#x02018;Guideline on the evaluation of drugs for the treatment of gastro-esophageal reflux disease&#x02019; requires demonstration of symptomatic relief in clinical trials and states that for the later phases of drug development (Phase IIb and Phase III), symptom-based evaluation is required as the primary basis of proof of efficacy[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Thus, demonstration of a rise in intragastric pH is not sufficient to demonstrate efficacy to the satisfaction of European Union (EU) Regulators. Consequently, the key objective of this patient-outcomes trial was to assess the clinical superiority of Zegerid versus Losec in the rapid relief of heartburn.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref rid="pone.0116308.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Checklist</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0116308.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Protocol</xref>.</p><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>This Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized study assessed the superiority of Zegerid suspension 20mg versus Losec 20mg as on-demand therapy in the rapid relief of heartburn associated with GERD.

Each of the 39 study sites was blinded and identified only by a site identifier number. In Bulgaria, sites 101, 102, 103, 104 and 106 recruited 7, 5, 8, 2 and 7 patients, respectively. In the Czech Republic, sites 201, 202, 203, 206 and 207 recruited 8, 6, 4, 10 and 3 patients, respectively. In Hungary, sites 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, and 307 recruited 5, 5, 2, 3, 7, 4 and 7 patients respectively.

Recruitment started on 26 April 2011 and last patient last visit was on 8th September 2011. Enrolled patients entered a 7-day baseline symptom-assessment screening period, during which they recorded the severity of daily episodes of heartburn using a 9-point Likert severity scale and an electronic diary (e-diary). The only antacid medication permitted during this screening period was the specified rescue medication (Gaviscon; chewable tablets; Reckitt Benckiser Group, UK). Eligible subjects were then randomized 1:1 to receive Zegerid suspension 20mg or Losec 20mg in a double-dummy design during the 14-day study period and were followed-up on Day 15. The randomization list, available via Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), was produced by an independent statistician (Premier Research Group Ltd.), who was not involved in the conduct or analysis of the study, using the SAS system for Windows (SAS Institute Inc).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.

During the 7-day screening period, patients recorded the occurrence and severity of daily episodes of heartburn. Between 06:00 and 22:00 h daily during the study period, patients recorded the severity of each heartburn episode for which randomized study medication and placebo were taken, pre-dose and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 150 and 180 minutes post-dose. After 22:00 h, patients were not to take study medication if all the time points up to 180 minutes could not be recorded, for example, if the patient was not prepared to stay awake for 180 minutes if woken by an episode of GERD (rescue medication could be taken instead).</p><p>The primary endpoint was the median time to sustained response, defined as a reduction in severity of heartburn associated with GERD by 3 points or more on the 9-point Likert severity scale, which was sustained for at least 45 minutes. Key secondary efficacy assessments (which were sustained for 45 minutes or more) were the median time to sustained partial response and sustained total relief, and the proportion of patients who achieved sustained response, sustained partial response or sustained total relief by 45, 60 and 90 minutes.

It was assumed from Phase I PK and pH data that conservative estimates (compared to previously reported values of 30 minutes and 102 minutes respectively) for the median time to response for Zegerid and Losec were 45 and 75 minutes, respectively. Therefore, with 90% power and a two-sided level of significance of 0.05 (5%), 97 patients were required per treatment group.</p><p>Four analysis populations were defined. The Safety Set (ITT) consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of randomized study medication during the course of the study. The modified ITT (mITT) population consisted of all patients who had recorded data for at least one evaluable episode of heartburn. The PP set excluded patients who violated any inclusion/exclusion criterion, or with major protocol violations, and the PP2 set also excluded patients who received study drug that was stored below the recommended storage temperature.</p><p>The primary statistical hypothesis, evaluated using a confirmatory test, was that there was no difference in the time to sustained relief in the two treatment groups. Differences between the two treatment groups were tested at a two-sided significance level of 0.05 using a Cox regression model, including a country effect. All efficacy parameters were defined using the median of the one to three heartburn severity scores at each time point with the patient as the unit of analysis. Each patient could have up to three evaluable episodes of heartburn and in the primary analysis the average (median) of severity was derived for each time point over the evaluable episodes before any analysis was performed. Secondary endpoints were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and chi-squared tests. All efficacy analyses were performed using the mITT, PP and PP2 sets.</p><p>While all data were collected prospectively, an additional exploratory efficacy analysis was planned and conducted after locking the database and unblinding the data. In the exploratory analysis, the episode was the unit of analysis and each GERD episode was treated as an individual data point, stratified by severity and time.

Zegerid was effective at relieving the symptoms of GERD, it was well tolerated and no safety concerns were raised. In terms of patient outcomes, however, the superiority of Zegerid was not demonstrated. No significant differences between the Zegerid and Losec groups were observed in the times to sustained response, sustained partial response and sustained total relief. The proportion of patients reaching sustained total relief over time was significantly higher in the Zegerid group after 30 minutes in all analysis sets; however, no other significant differences were observed. For best overall sustained response, the sustained responder rate was similar in both treatment groups. While the Zegerid group showed a higher percentage of patients with sustained partial response, the Losec group showed more non-responders and patients reaching sustained total relief. The severity of heartburn was similar in both treatment groups 180 minutes after medication intake.</p><p>Zegerid is a novel, fixed combination of omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate. Omeprazole is an established therapy for GERD and belongs to the class of anti-secretory PPIs, which are substituted benzimidazole derivatives that selectively and irreversibly inhibit the H<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme system at the secretory surface of parietal cells[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Proton pump inhibition is greatest in those parietal cells that are actively secreting acid; therefore, the anti-secretory effect of PPIs is optimal after a meal, when the parietal cell and its proton pumps are maximally stimulated[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Consequently, gastric pH control with PPIs is affected by dose-timing relative to a meal[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In Zegerid, the sodium bicarbonate provides rapid neutralization of gastric acid which protects omeprazole from gastric acid degradation. The PPI can, therefore, be rapidly absorbed from the stomach allowing earlier onset of action than delayed-release preparations such as Losec, which are intended to reach the intestine before being broken down and absorbed.</p><p>Previous Phase I PK and pH studies clearly demonstrated that immediate-release omeprazole/sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid) increases intragastric pH more rapidly than delayed-release omeprazole (Losec). <xref rid="pone.0116308.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> illustrates that Zegerid suspension increased intragastric pH &#x0003e; 4 after approximately 5 minutes post-dose, whereas intragastric pH remained below 3 up to 120 minutes after Losec administration. Based on the Phase I studies, it was proposed that Zegerid may provide more rapid clinical relief of GERD symptoms than Losec. However, the results of this study do not correlate clinical outcomes with Phase I PK and pH evidence.</p><p>Although few clinical studies have directly examined the relationship between intra-gastric pH control and symptom relief, previous studies have met with a similar challenge to that of the current study, reflecting the difficulty in correlating intra-gastric pH with clinical effect in the treatment of GERD[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For example, the acid-suppressing agent AZD0865 demonstrated a rapid onset of acid suppression, however, when compared with esomeprazole this effect did not translate into more rapid clinical benefit[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In relation to the current study, there are several reasons that may contribute to the lack of difference observed between the treatment groups, including the unexpected rapid onset of action in the comparator group as well as aspects of study design, which highlight the importance of careful design in trials of this type.</p><p>Notably, omeprazole with delayed-release characteristics (Losec) improved patient outcomes more rapidly than expected in this study and at the same time, the Zegerid group demonstrated a somewhat slower onset than anticipated. There were, however, various sub-groups of patients, including those based on age, weight and gender, for which an analysis of the primary or secondary endpoints was not carried out. In addition, the ingestion of water during study drug administration and the use of peppermint flavoring could potentially result in an immediate soothing effect that may have impacted the perceived speed of onset of the administered medications, and are further discussed below. Given its delayed-release characteristics, these factors are likely to impact results in the Losec group to a greater extent than for Zegerid suspension, which is designed to act quickly.</p><p>Water can provide immediate symptom relief of heartburn; therefore, the ingestion of water during the intake of randomized study medication (suspension and capsule) may have affected the patients&#x02019; heartburn severity scores as well as the perceived speed of onset for each medication. One study demonstrated that a glass of water (200mL) increased gastric pH &#x0003e;4 in 10/12 healthy subjects after 1 minute, whereas the median time to pH &#x0003e;4 was 171 minutes for omeprazole[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><sec id="sec019"><title>Limitations</title><p>There were a number of limitations to this study. In order to maintain blinding in this double-blind, double-dummy study, the placebo and Zegerid suspensions were flavored with peppermint and peach. It has been reported that ingesting spearmint does not improve or worsen GERD symptoms[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. However, in contrast to this report, it has been stated that ingestion of mints can cause reflux symptoms, most likely due to relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A study investigating the use of peppermint oil in irritable bowel syndrome reported heartburn as an adverse effect[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, the peppermint flavoring in the Zegerid suspension may have had a detrimental effect on the ability of the formulation to relieve heartburn over a sustained period.</p><p>Alternatively, the initial cooling effect of the peppermint flavoring[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in the placebo suspension may have contributed to the observation that Losec improved patient outcomes more rapidly than expected.</p><p>The formulation differences of Zegerid and Losec (suspension vs. capsule) may also have influenced the study results. More rapid action may be expected for the Zegerid suspension than the Losec capsule, which delays release of omeprazole due to the time required for the capsule to dissolve. Similarly, the over-encapsulation of Losec might have contributed to further delay omeprazole release. While it is possible that the administration of placebo suspension together with the Losec capsule altered its pharmacokinetic properties, it remains surprising that the capsule acted so rapidly in the current study.</p><p>Although recommended as a valid method of symptom assessment[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], rating of heartburn severity by each patient is subjective and therefore may be subject to a placebo effect. However, the use of an active comparator in this study prevented assessment of the extent of any placebo effect of Losec. Symptom assessment at 5-minute intervals during the first 15 minutes post-dose may also have provided greater insight into the immediate effect of Zegerid and Losec on GERD symptoms.</p><p>While a crossover design was not employed in the current study, it has been suggested that, due to the substantial inter-individual variability in intra-gastric pH control[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], studies comparing GERD therapies should be of a crossover design in order to measure therapy responses in the same individuals[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Crossover studies also minimize the potential influence of genetic polymorphism on individual pH control and PPI metabolism by CYP450 [<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In the current study, while patients were excluded due to use of medication for the purpose of eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, the <italic>H. pylori</italic> status of the patients was not determined. However, intragastric pH is affected by <italic>H. pylori</italic> colonization of the gastric corpus, and controlling <italic>H. pylori</italic> status has become standard in performing and interpreting clinical trials of intragastric pH control[<xref rid="pone.0116308.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec020"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study supports the previously reported difficulty in correlating intragastric pH with clinical effect in the treatment of GERD. Although preliminary PK and pH evidence demonstrated that Zegerid increases intragastric pH more rapidly than Losec, the superiority of Zegerid was not demonstrated for the primary or secondary endpoints. Despite these findings, it should be noted that Zegerid was effective at relieving the symptoms of GERD, it was well tolerated and no safety concerns were raised. This study highlights the significance of a number of technical considerations for GERD studies, including the importance of appropriate study design; careful selection of placebo; control of liquid intake when taking study medication; the use of a crossover design in which each patient acts as their own control; and the assessment of the <italic>H. pylori</italic> status of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec021"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116308.s001"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116308.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116308.s002"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116308.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0116308.s003"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Statistical Analysis Plan.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0116308.s003.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Zegerid is a product owned by Santarus Inc, San Diego, CA, USA and was licensed for development to Norgine BV.
