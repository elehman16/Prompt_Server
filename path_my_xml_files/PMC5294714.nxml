It is considered a safe procedure, but is often associated with blood loss during liver transection. Blood transfusions are frequently needed, but they are associated with increased morbidity and risk of recurrence. Many surgical devices have been developed to decrease blood loss. However, none of them has proven superior to the standard crushing technique. We developed a new, powerful intra-operative high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) transducer which destroys tissue by coagulative necrosis. We aim to evaluate whether HIFU-assisted liver resection (HIFU-AR) results in reduced blood loss.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This is a prospective, single-centre, randomized (1:1 ratio), comparative, open-label phase II study. Patients with LM requiring a hepatectomy for&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;2 segments will be included. Patients with cirrhosis or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome with portal hypertension will be excluded. The primary endpoint is normalized blood loss in millilitres per square centimetre of liver section plane. Secondary endpoints are: total blood loss, transection time, transection time per square centimetre of liver area, haemostasis time, clip density on the liver section area, rate and duration of the Pringle man&#x00153;uvre, rate of patients needing a blood transfusion, length of hospital stay, morbidity, patients with positive resection margin, and local recurrence. Assuming a blood loss of 7.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.7&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>2</sup> among controls, the study will have 85% power to detect a twofold decrease of blood loss in the experimental arm, using a Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) rank-sum test with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Twenty-one randomized patients per arm are required. Considering the risk of contraindications at surgery, up to eight patients may be enrolled in addition to the 42 planned, with an enrolment period of 24&#x000a0;months. Randomization will be stratified by surgeon.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously demonstrated the safety and efficacy of intra-operative HIFU in patients operated on for LM. We also demonstrated the efficacy of HIFU-AR in a preclinical study. Participants in the HIFU-AR group of this randomized trial can expect to benefit from reduced blood loss and decreased ischemia of liver parenchyma.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrial.gov, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02728167">NCT02728167</ext-link>.

However, LM occur mainly in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). In France, CRC is the second most frequent cancer, with an incidence of nearly 41,000 cases each year. It continues to have a poor prognosis and causes nearly 16,000 deaths per year, often due to LM. Hepatic resection is the mainstay of treatment for LM and remains the only potentially curative intervention.</p><p>Unfortunately, LM resections are complex major procedures and the resulting blood loss may be significant, leading to the requirement for blood transfusions during the procedure. Such transfusions are correlated with increased morbidity, mortality and risk of tumour recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, the control of blood loss is mandatory to limit morbidity, mortality and recurrence.</p><p>Since the hepatic parenchyma tolerates ischemia better than bleeding, intra-operative man&#x00153;uvres have been proposed to minimize the risk of bleeding during hepatic resection. These include total vascular exclusion, the Pringle man&#x00153;uvre and selective ligature to control hepatic inflow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. None of these methods is universally practical or completely effective, and each carries a risk of inducing liver dysfunction in patients with chronic liver disease. Vascular clamping is a time-critical technique, since the risk of morbidity is increased if clamping lasts more than 60 continuous minutes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Overview of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)</title><p>HIFU is mechanical waves generated by an ultrasound transducer. As with conventional ultrasound, HIFU can propagate harmlessly through living tissue. However, if the ultrasound beam carries sufficient energy and is brought into a tight focus, the energy within the focal volume can cause a local rise in temperature of sufficient magnitude (up to 80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) to generate irreversible cell death. This occurs in a few seconds through coagulative necrosis without damaging the surrounding tissue.</p><p>HIFU offers several advantages, which encourage its clinical development. First, HIFU allows non-invasive real-time targeting using sonography. Such real-time monitoring enables adjustment of treatment plans. Second, the mechanism of action of HIFU is not tumour-specific; therefore a wide range of tumour types can be targeted. Third, HIFU is mechanical waves, therefore there is no ionizing radiation. Treatment can be given more than once, as there is no upper limit of tissue tolerance to repeated ultrasound exposure. Finally, HIFU generates very few side effects, and serious adverse events are rare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In several centres worldwide, HIFU has been in clinical use for 5 to 10&#x000a0;years, sometimes in daily practice, to treat solid tumours (both malignant and benign), including those of the prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and kidney [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Current data are encouraging and the role of HIFU in oncology is likely to expand as devices become more widely available.</p><p>However, several technical limitations of currently available HIFU devices have been raised, such as the long time needed to treat tumours of several cubic centimetres. For example, the sonication time (defined as the time from the first to the last sonication) to ablate abdominal pathologies such as uterine leiomyomas with target volumes of 4.6&#x000a0;cm<sup>3</sup> ranged from 32 to 135&#x000a0;minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The use of an extracorporeal HIFU device is clinically feasible for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] but only a small part (approximately 30%) of the liver is accessible using a non-invasive HIFU device. In addition, phase aberration and liver movements can produce secondary lesions (such as skin burns or gastric lesions) if a completely extracorporeal treatment is performed. To fill these technical gaps, we undertook a research program on CRC LM treatment by HIFU.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>The HIFU toroidal device: intra-operative HIFU prototype</title><p>We previously developed a toroidal HIFU transducer that enables the destruction of large volumes of tissue over short periods of time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This work led to the development of a prototype that has been tested in vitro and in preclinical studies. These studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of treating the liver using HIFU generated by a toroidal transducer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A collaboration with the EDAP TMS company has allowed a prototype to be developed for clinical use and this is currently being evaluated for the treatment of colorectal LM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>The HIFU probe is brought into contact with the liver using a sterile ultrasound cooling and coupling liquid (Ablasonic&#x000ae;, EDAP TMP, Vaulx en Velin, France) contained in a sterile polyurethane envelope (Civco, Kalona, IA, USA). It is possible to change the location of the focal zone by adjusting the quantity of coupling liquid between the device and tissues or by electronic focusing. Under these conditions, the focal zone can be placed anywhere between the surface of the liver and 9&#x000a0;cm in depth. This allows treatment of the entire plane of liver transection. A 7.5&#x000a0;MHz ultrasound imaging probe (Vermon, Tours, France) is placed in the centre of the device and connected to a BK HAWK 2102 EXL scanner (BK Medical, Herlev, Denmark) to guide the liver resection. Specific software is used to define the treatment zone from a two-dimensional ultrasound image. The user interface displays the position of the HIFU-treated region superimposed on the sonogram obtained by the integrated ultrasound imaging probe. It is therefore possible to locate the ablation and visualize in real time the treated zone created during ultrasound exposures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Previous clinical results</title><p>Our team has already demonstrated the safety and feasibility of HIFU for intra-operative ablation of liver parenchyma. We have also demonstrated in an animal study that HIFU can be used to assist hepatic resection.</p><p>The HIFU device using a toroidal HIFU transducer guided by ultrasound imaging was evaluated clinically for the treatment of colorectal LM during an open procedure. The transducer has a toroidal shape with a diameter of 70&#x000a0;mm and is divided into 256 emitters each of 0.13&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>. The radius of curvature is 70&#x000a0;mm to enable treatment of the deepest regions of the liver. The operating frequency is 3&#x000a0;MHz.</p><p>We conducted a prospective, single-centre phase I&#x02013;IIa trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. HIFU was delivered immediately before scheduled hepatectomy. To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of rapidly ablating large liver volumes, ablations were performed on healthy tissue within the areas scheduled for resection. In total, 30 ablations (one superficial and one at least 1&#x000a0;cm deep) were carried out in 15 patients. These ablations were all generated within 40&#x000a0;seconds and on average measured 27.5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;21&#x000a0;mm. The phase I element of the study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) showed that use of the HIFU device was feasible and safe, and did not damage neighbouring tissue. The phase IIa study (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) showed both that the area of ablation could be precisely targeted on a previously implanted metallic mark and that ablations could be undertaken deliberately to avoid such a mark. Ablations were achieved with a precision of 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mm.</p><p>These results enable us to conduct a randomized phase II trial to evaluate whether HIFU-assisted liver resection (HIFU-AR) reduces blood loss compared to standard liver resection in patients with LM.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective is to compare the blood loss during hepatectomy in patients treated by HIFU-AR (arm A) versus standard liver resection (arm B).</p><p>The primary endpoint is normalized blood loss in millilitres/square centimetres, defined as total blood loss (in millilitres) divided by the resected hepatic surface (in square centimetres). Total blood loss will be measured during the whole liver transection procedure, i.e. between beginning the section of liver parenchyma and the end of resection including complete haemostasis of the raw surface of the remaining liver. In arm A, time needed to perform HIFU pre-coagulation will be added to this duration.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>Anaesthesia will be performed according to standard procedure. Central venous pressure (CVP) will be measured immediately before and after the transection. No pharmacological intervention (such as a diuretic) and no surgical procedure (such as infra-hepatic inferior vena cava clamping) will be used to modify the CVP.</p><p>The procedure begins with a full exploration of the abdominal cavity, liver palpation and intra-operative ultrasound to confirm the indication of liver resection. Hepatectomy will be carried out in the same way in the two study arms. In arm A, hepatectomy will be performed after pre-coagulation of the hepatic parenchyma by HIFU along the section plane. This will be the only difference between arm A and arm B. Whenever possible, selective control of inflow will be performed. Otherwise, the Pringle manoeuvre will be used if haemorrhage of more than 500&#x000a0;mL occurs during hepatectomy.</p><p>In arm A, pre-coagulation is intended to establish a defined full-thickness plane of coagulative necrosis. This is generally achieved by six to ten side-by-side 40-s HIFU ablations, though more can be used if necessary. Resection is performed in the middle of the pre-coagulated zone.</p><p>In both arms, parenchymal division will begin along line marked by electrocautery and then cut with scissors. Liver resection technique (the same for both groups) uses a Kelly clamp claw, a suction device, a bipolar forceps and metallic clips. Blunt clamp dissection is a rapid, easy and cheap method. In essence, a large Kelly clamp is used to crush the liver parenchyma. The relatively soft liver substance dissects away, leaving behind the vascular and biliary structures, which are then ligated by vascular clips.</p><p>In arm A, it is planned that all vessels&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;mm in diameter are sealed successfully using HIFU pre-coagulation and will not require any additional haemostasis. Surgical clips will be used only to control the few vessels&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;mm in diameter.</p><p>After completion of liver parenchyma section and removal of the resected liver, the surgeon will complete haemostasis of the raw surface of the remaining liver. This haemostatic phase will be performed only with Prolene&#x000ae; stitches (Ethicon Inc., Cornelia, GA, USA), or coagulation with electrocautery, bipolar forceps or Argon beam coagulator.</p><p>Any use of special haemostatic products [such as Tachosil&#x000ae; (Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Osaka, Japan) or biological glue] will be noted.</p><p>Blood loss volume during this phase of haemostasis will be measured and added to the previous blood loss (during the transection phase) for evaluation of the primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Data collection and follow-up</title><p>Screening/baseline assessments include general demography and relevant medical history, including prior/concomitant therapies and tumour assessment within the 4&#x000a0;weeks before randomization; complete physical examination and laboratory tests within 7&#x000a0;days before randomization.

These techniques are both expensive and time consuming. Recently, new approaches have been developed to allow bloodless hepatic resection without any vascular exclusion using energy sources such as radiofrequency, ultrasonic scalpels, and microwave coagulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Among these alternative techniques, the use of HIFU has potential advantages.</p><p>Preclinical study has demonstrated that HIFU-AR using the new toroidal-shaped transducer during an open procedure in an animal model is safe, reduces bleeding, and can be guided by real-time ultrasound imaging. This work demonstrated blood loss reduction during hepatic resection without the Pringle man&#x00153;uvre (hepatic pedicle clamping). This was avoided where possible to prevent liver ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury, which is known to predispose patients to post-operative liver failure. In addition, it showed the feasibility, safety, and reproducibility of HIFU-AR during an open procedure. This technique also holds promise in human patients for whom pre-coagulation may offer better control of blood loss, especially in a liver fragile following chemotherapy. Patients undergoing iterative hepatic resection might also benefit from HIFU pre-coagulation. The sample size was calculated to have a twofold decrease in blood loss, because we consider this twofold decrease clinically relevant and in accordance with the results observed in the preclinical study (11.35&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>2</sup> versus 4.77&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>2</sup>). The value chosen for the sample size calculation (7.6&#x000a0;mL/cm<sup>2</sup> in the control arm) is in the upper limit of reported blood loss in the literature. It is based on personal data when measuring blood loss was determined by aspirated fluid and also by weighing all blood-soaked surgical mops, which is essential, otherwise blood loss might be underestimated.</p><p>In the protocol outlined above, the risks are limited since the surgical procedure is identical to the one patients would undergo if not randomized to HIFU-AR. The only difference is that HIFU ablations are carried out on the section plane of the liver. These ablations will be performed only after final checking of the indication for them and immediately before the section phase. The duration of the HIFU ablations will last between 5 and 7&#x000a0;minutes. We consider that this minor increase in operative time will be compensated for by a major decrease in the time necessary to perform liver transection and haemostasis. A potential risk for HIFU-AR patients would be an injury to neighbouring organs secondary to HIFU ablations. Measures taken to avoid this include surgical mops placed under the targeted area to limit risks of ultrasound propagation. Furthermore, this risk was fully assessed during the phase I and IIa studies recently completed and no adverse effects were observed. The post-operative follow-up period will last 6&#x000a0;months, which seems to&#x000a0;be sufficient to cover late adverse events. The study participants in the HIFU-AR group can expect to benefit from reduced blood loss and a decreased period of ischemia in the future liver remnant.</p><p>Based on previous preclinical and clinical experience, the proposed study design, and the safety monitoring plan described in this protocol, the sponsor considers that adequate risk mitigation measures are included in this protocol and that the benefit-risk profile is favourable.</p><p>To limit biases, blood losses are normalized by the resected hepatic area (in square centimetres), which allows to perform several types of anatomical hepatectomy. We also use stratification by surgeon to ensure equal allocation of subgroups of participants (i.e. to each surgeon) in each arm. The three surgeons (AD, MR, PP) are trained with the HIFU prototype, as they already use it in an ongoing study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>If the results of this study appear clinically relevant, the development of this technique could be an important improvement in treatment of LM by reducing the invasiveness of surgery. The next step of our research programme is to improve the user interface and then to evaluate the HIFU device in a multicentre phase III study. It may also be possible to extend HIFU-AR to other types of liver resection such as segmentectomy or non-anatomic resections and to primary liver tumours. Furthermore, combining HIFU-AR with HIFU ablation of non-resectable metastases may permit an increase in liver surgery with curative intent for patients with non-resectable LM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started recruitment in May 2016.
