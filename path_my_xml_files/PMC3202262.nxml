In india, the prevalence of myopia in the general population has been reported to be only 6.9%. Genetic factors can work in various biochemical ways to cause myopia; a weak or degraded sclera and cornea are significant factors in causing myopia. One recent study suggested that students exposed to extensive &#x02018;near work&#x02019; may be at a higher risk of developing myopia. Stress has been postulated as a factor in the development of myopia. Nutritive factors also play a vital role in the manifestation of myopia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Although myopia is usually not a devastating eye disease, it can rarely cause blindness through retinal degeneration, tears, and detachments. Billions of dollars are spent each year to get surgical relief from this condition, not to mention eyeglass and contact lens expenditure. Surgical intervention, although popular, is not successful for everyone and complications such as dry eyes and night glare can be very annoying.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Although modern medical science has made tremendous and remarkable progress and advance in the field of ophthalmology in recent times, the importance of Ayurvedic treatment in the diseases of eyes cannot be ignored owing to the above-mentioned pitfalls of modern therapy.</p><p>In Ayurveda, the clinical features related to visual disturbances are seen only in <italic>Drishtigata Rogas</italic>. Hence, all cases of visual disturbances can be correlated under the broad heading of the <italic>Timira &#x02013; Kacha &#x02013; Linganasha</italic> complex. A part of the clinical features of <italic>Timira</italic> (first and second <italic>Patala</italic>) can be correlated with the most important refractive error, which is, myopia. In the Ayurvedic classics, we find the concept of <italic>Chakshushya</italic> and many food items, drugs, and therapeutic procedures explained, which are said to improve or enhance visual acuity as well as improve the health of the eye. <italic>Nasya karma</italic> is one among the <italic>panchkarma</italic> procedures that is specifically desired in supraclavicular disorder.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p><p>All efforts should be made to strengthen the eyes by resorting to <italic>Nasya, Anjana, Tarpana</italic>, and so on, for once the vision is lost, all the different things of this world will become one kind &#x02014; that is darkness.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]</p><p>A good number of <italic>Nasya</italic> preparations are also described for Timira, because the nose is the gateway of drug administration in the case of <italic>Urdhwajatrugata rogas</italic>, and <italic>Nasya</italic> is the only procedure that directly influences all the <italic>Indriyas</italic>.</p><p><italic>Kriyakalpa</italic> &#x02014; the local ocular therapeutic procedures are a group of special methods of drug administration, locally into the eye, for the treatment of eye diseases, in which <italic>Tarpana</italic> is the foremost procedure for <italic>Timira</italic>, which provides <italic>Vatashamaka</italic> with a nourishing effect to the eyes and improves visual acuity.</p><p>A number of formulations are prescribed for the treatment of <italic>Timira</italic> in Ayurvedic classics; <italic>Mahatriphaladya Ghrita</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] for <italic>Tarpana</italic> and <italic>Abhijit Taila</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] for <italic>Nasya</italic> were selected for the present study, which were specially mentioned by Chakradatta in the context of <italic>Timira Chikitsa</italic>.</p><p>Sufficient studies have already been carried out on <italic>Timira</italic> with reference to myopia and its management with <italic>Tarpana</italic> at the Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda, Jamnagar and other institutes, to know the efficacy of <italic>Tarpana</italic>.

Ghrita</italic> pacifies Vata due to <italic>Sneha, Pitta</italic> due to <italic>Sheeta</italic>, and even <italic>Kapha</italic>, which is similar in properties, due to processing with drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] Thus, the overall effect of the compound drug is <italic>Tridoshashamaka</italic>, and hence, it disintegrates the pathogenesis of the disease <italic>Timira</italic>, which is <italic>Tridoshaja</italic> in its manifestation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-7"><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>Nasya</italic> followed by <italic>Tarpana</italic> in group B provided better results in chief complaints like <italic>Durastha Avyakta Darshana, Vihwala Darshana, Netrayasa</italic>, and <italic>Shirobhitapa</italic>. In few patients, even if no change in clinical refraction was observed, still the overall clarity of vision was found to be improved and asthenopic symptoms like <italic>Netrayasa, Netrasrava, Netradaha</italic>, and the like were remarkably reduced.</p><p>In reduction of the dioptric power, <italic>Nasya</italic> followed by <italic>Tarpana</italic> has shown better results than only <italic>Tarpana</italic>. Newly detected cases and patients having dioptric power less than -3D were found to have better results. No adverse or side effect was encountered while doing <italic>Nasya</italic> and <italic>Tarpana</italic> in this study. The duration of the treatment was short, hence for reaching any definite conclusion further long duration studies are needed. As the study has shown encouraging results, it is recommended that the study be carried out in a large number of patients, with longer duration, to evaluate and analyze the results.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ashtanga</surname><given-names>Hridayam</given-names></name><name><surname>SrikanthaMurthy</surname><given-names>KR</given-names></name></person-group><source>Uttar Tantra 31/98</source><year>2002</year><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>KrishnadasAcademy</publisher-name><fpage>130</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myopia</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><comment><uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.bmj.com/content/324/7347/0.1.full?sid=3edf92c4-bb9a-4c3c-83a4-6beb647b8239">http://www.bmj.com/content/324/7347/0.1.full?sid=3edf92c4-bb9a-4c3c-83a4-6beb647b8239</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Ashtanga</surname><given-names>Hridayam</given-names></name><name><surname>Upadhyaya</surname><given-names>YV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vidyotini Hindi Teeka</article-title><source>Uttar Tantra, 20/1</source><year>2003</year><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhamba Sanskrit Sansthana</publisher-name><fpage>127</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Ashtanga</surname><given-names>Hridayam</given-names></name><name><surname>Upadhyaya</surname><given-names>YV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Vidyotini Hindi Teeka</article-title><source>Sutra sthana, 24/22</source><year>2003</year><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Chaukhamba Sanskrit Sansthana</publisher-name><fpage>139</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chakradutta</surname></name><name><surname>Tripathi</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chaukhamba Sanskrit Sansthan</article-title><year>2005</year><volume>59</volume><publisher-loc>Varanasi</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Netra rogadhikara chikitsa prakarana</publisher-name><fpage>165</fpage><lpage>72</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref7"><label>7</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chakradutta</surname></name><name><surname>Tripathi</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Chaukhamba Sanskrit Sansthan</article-title><year>2005</year><volume>59</volume><fpage>189</fpage><lpage>190</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref8"><label>8</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kumar</surname><given-names>E.
