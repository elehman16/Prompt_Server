continued as supplementary feeding to at least 2 years of age <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. This recommendation, which is based on several undeniable
advantages of breastfeeding <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, aims to prevent
approximately 1.3 million infant deaths annually<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, less than 40% of mothers around the world breastfeed their children
exclusively for the first 6 months of life <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>and
several countries, including Brazil, are still far below the goals advocated by the
World Health Organization. In Brazil, according to the latest national research, the
median exclusive breastfeeding duration was 60 days, the 25th percentile was 5 days and
the 75th percentile was 150 days <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.</p><p>Given that breastfeeding is an effective intervention, that it is feasible to implement
on a large-scale and that it has the greatest potential to reduce child mortality in
Brazil <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, several strategies have been implemented
under the National Policy on Promotion, Protection and Support of Breastfeeding.</p><p>We must also consider that in addition to maternal knowledge of the subject,
self-efficacy also has a strong influence on the initiation and maintenance of
breastfeeding in Brazil<sup>(5-6)</sup> and worldwide<sup>(7-9)</sup>. Self-efficacy is
the belief in one's personal skill to successfully perform certain tasks or behaviors to
achieve desirable outcomes <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>and it is a
modifiable factor mainly through health education <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>.</p><p>Given the importance of self-efficacy, we developed the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy
Scale (BSES) <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, an instrument to assess the
self-efficacy of breastfeeding mothers. The short form version of the BSES was designed
to be used in a hospital environment to optimize nursing support for the promotion of
breastfeeding <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, which has already been validated
in Brazil <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>Instruments such as the BSES are essential for building educational interventions that
are appropriate for the specific characteristics of each population. Thus, this study
sought to construct, validate and assess an educational intervention using the flip
chart titled "I Can Breastfeed My Child." The hypothesis of this study is that
educational intervention using the flip chart titled "I Can Breastfeed My Child" is
effective in increasing self-efficacy and also for increasing the duration of
breastfeeding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>This was an experimental study using a design that included a pretest, intervention and
posttest, as well as a control group ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure
1</xref>).</p><p>The intervention was a flip chart and the process of construction and validation
occurred in five stages: 1) the construction and validation of the flip chart were based
on literature research and the Breastfeeding SelfEfficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF)
<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>; 2) the BSESSF was administered to all of
the mothers in the study 6 hours postpartum (1<sup>st</sup> contact); 3) the
intervention group received an explanation from the researcher using the flip chart,
while the control group did not receive this explanation; 4) the second application of
the BSES-SF and an assessment of the infant's diet were performed before hospital
discharge (2<sup>nd</sup> contact); and 5) the third application of the BSES-SF and an
assessment of the infant's diet at two months after childbirth were conducted by
telephone (3<sup>rd</sup> contact). The independent variable was the flip chart
application. The dependent variable was the maternal self-efficacy and breastfeeding
rates.</p><p>The study was conducted in a large public maternity hospital that provided tertiary
neonatal and perinatal care. This hospital is located in Fortaleza, Cear&#x000e1;, Brazil; it is
associated with the National Health System and also trains students from several
universities. As a maternity hospital that is certified as baby-friendly and is
associated with the Human Milk Bank in Brazil, it sees an average of 600 births per
month. The hospital follows the "10 steps to successful breastfeeding" routine, thus
babies are offered infant formula only in cases in which breastfeeding is
contraindicated-usually due to illness or medication.</p><p>The study included mothers who were hospitalized between October 2010 and May 2011,
during which there were 2,871 births in the hospital. The inclusion criteria required
that the women were in the immediate postpartum period (1-10 days), at least 6 hours
after delivery; they were at least 12 years old and authorization and consent was
required of the guardian in the case of adolescent mothers; the healthy mothers needed
to be able to breastfeed; and the mothers had to have had newborns that weighed more
than 2,000 g, given birth after more than 35 weeks of pregnancy and had an APGAR score
greater than 6 at 5 minutes after birth. The exclusion criteria excluded women with
medical or obstetric complications in the postpartum period; women with medical
conditions that made it impossible to breastfeed or contraindicated breastfeeding;
mothers whose children were admitted to the intensive care unit; and women with children
with some disability or malformation that made breastfeeding impossible. The
discontinuation criteria included withdrawal by the The sample size was calculated using
the formula for intervention studies, setting the significance level at 5% and the power
at 80%, resulting in a sample size of 150<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>.
Considering the possible information loss, we added approximately 30% to the final
sample size and recruited 201 mothers.</p><p>To reduce possible bias, we collected data from the intervention and control groups
during different periods because if the data was collected during the same period, the
mothers could share the information provided in the flip chart, thus compromising the
validity of the efficacy intervention.</p><p>In the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> contacts (before hospital discharge), the data
collection was conducted with the 201 mothers selected according to the inclusion and
exclusion criteria: 101 women were in the control group and 100 women were in the
intervention group. However, in the 3<sup>rd</sup> contact, only 96 mothers participated
due to difficulties </p><p>mother or legal guardian (for adolescents) from the making the continuation of data
collection impossible; or research; a change in phone number during the study, the death
of the participant or newborn during the study.</p><p>

</p><p>in contacting the participants by phone 42 (43.7%) in the control group and 54 (56.2%)
in the intervention group ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). The
researchers compared the phone numbers of the participants with the register at the
institution but still failed to maintain communication with some of the participants for
the 3<sup>rd</sup> contact.</p><p>The mothers were recruited during the daytime, from Monday to Friday, after being
identified as eligible by their medical records. The researchers visited the mothers
individually to invite them to participate in the study. After obtaining written
consent, they administered the BSES-SF, socio-demographic and clinical-obstetrics
questionnaires.</p><p>Between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> contacts, the intervention group received
health education through the use of a flip chart that illustrated maternal
self-efficacy, while the control group did not receive this intervention.</p><p>The flip chart titled "I Can Breastfeed My Child" (40 cm wide, 32 cm high) had seven
illustrations prepared with the help of a professional service and the Corel Draw X5
Graphics Suite, it contained seven scripts (back of each illustration) that addressed
the breastfeeding theme based on the BSES-SF items.</p><p>Ten experts validated the appearance and content of the flip chart. These were experts
in the area of breastfeeding who had at least two years of experience and they were
selected by convenience. The experts judged the six figures and six scripts as clear and
understandable, with an agreement level above 50%. Regarding the degree of relevance of
the figures and scripts of the flip chart, two figures presented with 80% relevance and
the others presented with between 90% and 100% in the opinion of the experts. For the
degree of relevance, we calculated the global Content Validity Index (CVI) and obtained
0.92 for the figures and 0.97 for the scripts, indicating excellent agreement between
the experts. The suggestions from the experts were adopted to improve the figures and
scripts <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>Ten lactating mothers participated in a test of the educational strategy presented in
the flip chart titled "I Can Breastfeed My Child." They were questioned on the type of
intervention used as well as its clarity and the mothers' comprehension of the figures
shown in the flip chart was also assessed.</p><p>After the validation process, the flip chart was used with each mother individually at
the patient's bed for an average time of 20 minutes. A single researcher shared the flip
chart with the mothers in the intervention group, covering the content in the flip chart
using the scripts as well as listening to their questions and clarifying issues to
encourage them to begin and to continue breastfeeding. Thus, the researcher initially
presented each picture in the flip chart to the mother to hear her opinion on each
aspect of breastfeeding. Based on previous experiences, the researcher tried to
establish a bond with the patient, giving specific guidance according to the needs of
each person. While the mother was looking at each figure in the flip chart, the
researcher explained the information using the corresponding script.</p><p>Because the flipchart was developed based on the domains of the BSES-SF scale (Technique
and Intrapersonal Thoughts), the researcher addressed the technical domain by teaching
the adequate positioning of the newborn during feeding, ways to improve comfort during
the act of feeding, recognition of the signals of quality lactation and proper suction
of the nipple-areolar complex, among other technical issues. While the Interpersonal
Thoughts domain worked through the desire to breastfeed, the internal motivation for
breastfeeding was based on satisfaction with the breastfeeding experience.</p><p>We included three measurement instruments in this study. The BSES-SF, which assesses the
maternal selfefficacy in breastfeeding, consists of 14 items organized into two domains
(eight items in the technical domain and six items in intrapersonal thoughts) assessed
through a five-point Likert scale, from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree),
with scores ranging from 14 to 70. The total score on the scale was used to calculate a
person's self-efficacy. The version of the scale validated for Brazil was shown to be
reliable (with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.74 and interclass correlation coefficients
ranging from </p><p>0.68 to 0.78) <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>.</p><p>The second questionnaire developed by the researchers addressed the socio-demographic
profiles of the participants and collected data related to clinical variables, obstetric
history, current pregnancy, childbirth, breast conditions and previous experience with
breastfeeding.</p><p>The third instrument was used to guide the telephone contact with the participants in
both the control and intervention groups and it collected data related to visits to
primary care health professionals in the first 15 days after delivery and the guidelines
on breastfeeding provided during these visits regarding the infant's diet according to
World Health Organization classifications <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>The participants were interviewed three times, twice during hospitalization: one time at
least 6 hours postpartum (baseline study) and the other time close to hospital
discharge; and the third time at two months after childbirth (follow-up study). The data
collection team included five nursing students trained for the research, and another
researcher was responsible only for the presentation of the flip chart. In the training
of the student nurses, they had to interview the main researcher repeatedly until the
questions were made without influencing the response of the interviewee. The interviews
were recorded so that the students could identify aspects of the interviews that could
be improved and also so that the professor could provide some explanations.</p><p>The data was double-entered into Access 2007 (Microsoft Office) and later exported to
SPSS 18.0 for Windows, by which descriptive and inferential analyses were performed. To
validate the figures and scripts, we calculated the Content Validity Index (CVI),
considering a CVI above 0.90 as being appropriate <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>.</p><p>The participants were characterized by frequencies (percentages), means, and standard
error of the mean (SEM). To compare the intervention and control groups, we applied the
Student's t-test and Snedecor's F-test. Along with Snedecor's F-test (ANOVA)
significance, we used Tukey's test to determine which pairs were significantly
different. To compare the groups at baseline and the groups after two months of
intervention, we used the chi-squared test and either Student's t-test or the
Mann-Whitney test, considering a critical alpha of 0.05.</p><p>In the analyses of the type of feeding, exclusive breastfeeding was defined as when the
child received only breast milk and no other liquids or solids except for drops or
syrups containing vitamins, oral rehydration salts, mineral supplements or medicines.
Breastfeeding is a concept understood as a child receiving breast milk, regardless of
whether the child had received other foods <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>.</p><p>The Research Ethics Committee of the Assis Chateaubriand Maternity School approved the
study. All of the study participants in the intervention and control groups as well as
the experts who assessed the flip chart and the mothers in the intervention test were
informed of their rights, assured of data confidentiality and were given the opportunity
to withdraw from the study at any time.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The total study sample (n=201) was divided into two groups: control (n=101) and
intervention (n=100). There was no difference between the intervention and control
groups with regard to age (p=0.116), per capita income (0.120), receiving help for
household chores (p=0.178), and the existence of a place designated for breastfeeding at
home (p=0.273). There was no difference between the groups with regard to the average
years of schooling (0.774), with 9.38 years in the intervention group and 9.49 years in
the control group. Furthermore, with regard to the obstetric variables, we observed
homogeneity between the groups regarding the number of pregnancies (p=0.138), number of
abortions (p=0.083) and period of breastfeeding (p=0.546). Thus, the groups were
similar, ensuring that the differences found between them were actually due to the
intervention and not to selection biases.</p><p>The BSES-SF scores ranged from 14 to 70, the minimum and maximum scores, respectively;
higher scores indicated greater maternal self-efficacy. However, to assess the variable
maternal self-efficacy in breastfeeding, we adjusted the total scores obtained from the
BSES-SF so that the minimum value was zero and the maximum value was 100 ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure
2</xref>).</p><p>The mean score of the BSES-SF at baseline in the intervention group was 74.1 (SEM&#x000b1;1.2)
and the control group 72.8 (SEM&#x000b1;1.0) (ANOVA, p=0.384). The scores at the 2<sup>nd</sup>
contact, after the flip chart was used with the intervention group and after the
conventional guidelines of the institution were used with the control group, were 77.5
(SEM&#x000b1;1.0) and 75.1 (SEM&#x000b1;1.0) (ANOVA, p=0.113), respectively, verifying that between the
1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> contacts, the mean scores were very close, with an
increase of 3.4 points in the intervention group and an increase of 2.3 points in the
control group. The BSESSF scores were higher in the intervention group (79.1, SEM&#x000b1;1.2)
than in the control group (70.7, SEM&#x000b1;2.5) two months after childbirth (the
3<sup>rd</sup> contact), verifying that the intervention group scores increased by 5
points, while the control group score decreased by 2.1 points ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>At the 1<sup>st</sup> contact, 100% of the mothers in both groups continued
breastfeeding, with no differences between the two groups. However, when the
1<sup>st</sup> contact was compared with the 3<sup>rd</sup> contact, all of the
participants (100%) in the intervention group continued exclusively breastfeeding, while
only 41% of the participants in the control group still offered breast milk to their
children ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>With regard to the influence of self-efficacy on continued breastfeeding, we inferred
that in the intervention group, the mean scores of the BSES-SF on exclusive
breastfeeding were higher than the mean scores on non-exclusive breastfeeding (p=0.003).
In the control group, the mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding and non-exclusive
breastfeeding were similar (p=0.267). The duration of exclusive breastfeeding in the
intervention group (64.31) was considerably higher than the average duration of
exclusive breastfeeding in the control group (56.96) (p&#x0003c;0.05) ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the strategy of health education
fostered by the flip chart titled "I Can Breastfeed My Child" was effective in
increasing selfefficacy and the duration of breastfeeding.</p><p>

</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The variation in the BSES-SF scores was more evident in the intervention group than in
the control group. Between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> contacts, the scores
increase by 3.4 points in the intervention group and 2.3 points in the control group.
However, between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> contacts, the scores in the
intervention group increased by 1.6 points but decreased by 4.4 points in the control
group. Other studies have also shown an improvement in maternal self-efficacy scores
among those who received interventions by specialists<sup>(15-16)</sup>, increasing by
up to 15.1 points on the BSES-SF<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. In Australia,
an intervention based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory increased breast-feeding
self-efficacy. Furthermore, at 4 weeks postpartum, women in the intervention group
showed a trend toward breast-feeding their infants for longer, and more exclusively than
those in the control group <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>. In Canada, after a
self-efficacy intervention, the mothers in the intervention group had higher mean
BSES-SF scores at 4 and 8 weeks postpartum than the control group.</p><p>Educational practices are considered effective when they influence the beliefs that
people have in their own abilities. Education also affects how people will behave when
facing adversity and also influences the duration of adversity and the amount of effort
people will exert to confront adversity <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.
Maternal self-efficacy may also have been influenced by personal experiences, verbal
persuasion at the time of the educational intervention and vicarious experiences, such
as observing other women breastfeeding at the maternity hospital where the study was
conducted <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>.</p><p>For both the control and intervention groups, the scores increased for the items in the
interpersonal domain between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> contacts, while
scores for items in the technical domain decreased between the 2<sup>nd</sup>and
3<sup>rd</sup> contacts. The practice and technique of breastfeeding are factors that
cause insecurity in mothers, even in the group that received the intervention and when
the impact of the intervention was not sufficient after the mothers of having returned
home. The interventions must occur beyond the maternity context, with an effective daily
support network that teaches, supports and demonstrates the ideal practices related to
breastfeeding so that mothers may prevent early weaning.</p><p>Our literature review identified that the main factors that influence breastfeeding
among Hispanics are acculturation, interpersonal support, self-efficacy and immediate
competing demands <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Thus, information and
guidance should be extended to the family support network because many of the women lose
confidence in themselves after returning home from the hospital due to the pressure from
family and friends to provide infant formulas to their children <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>.</p><p>A study conducted in Chile showed some factors that negatively influence the maintenance
of exclusive breastfeeding, such as maternal age up to 25 years, so the need for
educational and social strategies in this group is shown <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>.</p><p>In addition to raising the scores of maternal selfefficacy, educational intervention
presented through the flip chart titled "I Can Breastfeed My Child" prolonged the
duration of breastfeeding and 100% of the mothers in the intervention group continued
breastfeeding in the follow-up study compared to only 41% of the mothers in the control
group. A similar result was found in Japan, where, at the one-month follow-up,
breastfeeding declined by approximately 24% in the control group but only by 10% in the
intervention group <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>.</p><p>In the intervention group, the mean scores on the BSES-SF with regard to exclusive
breastfeeding were higher than the mean scores on non-exclusive breastfeeding and the
average BSES-SF scores with regard to exclusive breastfeeding in the intervention group
was significantly higher than those scores in the control group. This result
corroborated with an Australian study in which self-efficacy in breastfeeding was higher
among mothers who maintained exclusive breastfeeding compared with those who breastfed
partially and those who had weaned their children. Guidance on breastfeeding, support
regarding the duration of breastfeeding and maternal confidence are associated with
breastfeeding at 1 month postpartum <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>.</p><p>A study using various strategies (individual consultation, preparation courses for
parenting/ childbirth, and domicile visits) without the focus on selfefficacy showed
that the nursing intervention was not a determinant for the prevalence of breastfeeding
<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>.</p><p>We emphasize that self-efficacy should be considered in interventions related to
breastfeeding, and we should identify the level of these mothers' self-efficacy before
developing any strategies <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>for implementation
during the prenatal through the postpartum periods <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. This variable is a strong predictor of breastfeeding duration because the
risk ratio for weaning increases by approximately 18% among women who have lower
selfefficacy scores on the BSES <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Despite the numerous benefits of breastfeeding, it is still a practice that requires
intervention to ensure continuity. This study found that educational intervention
enhanced by the flip chart titled "I Can Breastfeed My Child" provided positive results
regarding increased maternal self-efficacy that was related to a greater adherence to,
and a longer duration of breastfeeding at two months postpartum. Therefore, it is
important that nurses use health education strategies such as this flip chart to promote
breastfeeding. It is necessary to engage in further research in other populations and in
other contexts, especially during other stages of pregnancy and childbirth, for example,
during the prenatal and remote postpartum periods, so that we can assess the influences
of this intervention over longer periods of time.</p><p>The limitation of this study was the difficulty in reestablishing phone contact with the
study participants during the final stage of data collection, which made it impossible
to follow up with some mothers in the study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>Paper extracted from doctoral dissertation "Elabora&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o e valida&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de tecnologia
