Patients had to meet the following inclusion criteria: The age was between 18 and 60 years old; the mini&#x02013;mental state examination (MMSE) score was more than 24 before surgery; the number of years in school was 9 years or more; no opioid or antipsychotic drugs was used recently; no history of neurological and psychotic disorders, diabetes mellitus, severe hepatic/renal dysfunction, and severe hypertension; no history of alcohol or drug abuse. Meanwhile, patients unwilling to comply with the procedures were excluded from the study. All patients were under the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical Status I or II.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Patients were randomly allocated to three groups using the random number table. All patients were anesthetized using the same procedure. Anesthesia was induced with sufentanil (2&#x02013;3 &#x003bc;g/kg, Hubei RenFu Pharmaceutical Company, China), midazolam (0.2&#x02013;0.4 mg/kg, Jiangsu EnHua Pharmaceutical Company, China), and propofol (5 &#x003bc;g/ml, TCI, Xian LiBang Pharmaceutical Company, China). Anesthesia was maintained by the TIVA with remifentanil (0.1&#x02013;0.15 &#x003bc;g/kg/min, Hubei RenFu Pharmaceutical Company, China) and propofol (2&#x02013;4.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) by TCI. During the anesthesia, the blood concentration of remifentanil and propofol was regulated to control the depth of sedation. The depth of sedation was maintained to achieve a BIS (Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.,) score of 30&#x02013;40 in the first group, 40&#x02013;50 in the second group, and 50&#x02013;60 in the third group. Rocuronium bromide injection (0.6 mg/kg, N.V. Organon, the Netherlands) was used to maintain muscle relaxant. The heart rate, electrocardiography, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, pulse oximetry, hemoglobin oxygen saturation, and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure were continuously monitored during the whole process. We did not use the muscle relaxant antagonists. If postoperative pain was obvious, then 0.2 g compound aminophenazone and barbital injection (Xian LiJun Pharmaceutical Company, China) was used by intramuscular injection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Outcome measurement</title><p>Cognitive function was evaluated one day preoperatively and one day postoperatively in a quiet place with only one patient and the experienced psychometrician each time. Both the rate and patient were blinded to the treatment methods and groups. We used the sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes to conduct allocation concealment and blind outcome assessment. Usually, using several scales to assess cognitive function at the same time could increase the sensitivity, but it needs more testing time, which will easily result in fatigue for patients and then increase the false negative rate.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Therefore, in this study, the MMSE[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and trail-making test (TMT)[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] were used to assess cognitive function.

Both MMSE and TMT were recommended by the International Study of postoperative cognitive dysfunction to assess the cognitive function. The MMSE had a good sensitivity and was easily to operate,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and TMT could assess several aspects: Visual attention, visuospatial abilities, task-switching, and psychomotor processing speed.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Compared to MMSE, the TMT might be more appropriate for female.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Before the experiment, all patients obtained some relative training to make sure that they could successfully complete the MMSE and TMT.</p><p>In this study, we found that during TIVA with remifentanil and propofol given by TCI, the MMSE score of all patients was still more than 24 on the day after surgery, which indicated that no one experienced POCD. However, this result could not demonstrate that no transient cognitive impairment was occurred. Actually, we found that the average MMSE score on the day after surgery was nonsignificantly decreased in three groups, which suggested that there might be transient cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, the average MMSE score in the first group was significantly higher than those in the other two groups after surgery. Usually, compared with the TMT completion time in the first time, in the second time, it should be decreased after learning and memory. However, here, we found that the average TMT completion time in the third group was not decreased, even a slight increased. The average TMT completion time in the first group was decreased and significantly lower than those in the other two groups after surgery. There was no obvious correlation between the result of TMT and MMSE. These results indicated that during the TIVA with remifentanil and propofol given by TCI, maintained the BIS of young and middle-aged laparoscopic patients in the 30&#x02013;40 range yielded a minimal influence on postoperative cognitive function. However, one thing should be noticed: Whether the statistical difference here was clinical difference or not needed future studies to further investigate.</p><p>Our results were different with the results reported by Shu <italic>et al</italic>. that maintained the BIS in the 40&#x02013;50 range resulted in minimal impact on postoperative cognitive function after gynecologic laparoscopic operation.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Two reasons might be responsible for such phenomenon: (1) We used the different types of anesthesia-intravenous &#x02013; inhalational anesthesia versus TIVA; (2) we used the different drug to maintain BIS - remifentanil and sevoflurane versus remifentanil and propofol. Therefore, our results could enrich the choice of clinicians in clinical practice.</p><p>Sodium thiopental had been largely replaced by propofol for the induction of anesthesia, for its more rapid and &#x0201c;clear&#x0201d; recovery.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Several mechanisms of anesthesia reported that propofol could potentiate the activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor, and then slow the channel-closing time.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Furthermore, propofol could act as a sodium channel blocker.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Fowler reported that endocannabinoid system might significantly contribute to propofol's anesthetic action.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Previous study indicated that surgery-induced tissue damage could activate the peripheral innate immune system, and then lead to the exaggerated release of inflammatory cytokines, which could impair postoperative cognitive function.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Researchers suggested that propofol could inhibit the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and produce an improvement effect on postoperative cognitive function in the early stage after surgery.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Due to the lower BIS value indicated the more depth of sedation, and the more depth of sedation needed more propofol;[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] then in this study, the depth of sedation in the first group (BIS, 30&#x02013;40) was the deepest, which indicated that the dosage of propofol in this group was the maximum. Therefore, the minimal influence on the postoperative cognitive function in this group suggested that propofol might be able to inhibit the inflammatory response in central nervous system and improve POCD.</p><p>Remifentanil, as a new potent synthetic opioid analgesic drug, had the following characteristics: decomposition by plasma and tissue esterase, which was not affected by the liver/kidney function; short-acting; good controllability; rapid onset of action; rapid clearance; no accumulation with continuous infusion; easily control the dose. In this study, the operative time was short and the dosage of remifentanil was relatively small. Therefore, whether the remifentanil was relative with POCD needed future study to further investigate.</p><p>This study certainly had some limitations. First, we only recruited about fifty patients in each group. The relatively small samples might weaken our conclusion. Second, only the postoperative cognitive function in the early stage after surgery was assessed. Whether the conclusion was appropriated for the mid-to-late postoperative period was unknown. Third, it could not be able to rule out the possibility that the other known or unknown perioperative factors, such as education level, might affect the conclusion. Therefore, our conclusion was still needed future larger scale clinical trials to verify and support.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Through recruiting 166 ASA physical Status I or II patients scheduled for gynecological laparoscopic surgery to compare the effects of different depths of sedation during TIVA with remifentanil and propofol given by TCI on postoperative cognitive function, we found that the depth of sedation (30 &#x0003c; BIS value &#x02264; 40) had the minimal influence on postoperative cognitive function for young and middle-aged patients.
