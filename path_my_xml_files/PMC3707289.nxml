During visual scanning training, these patients learn to consciously pay attention to contralesional target stimuli. It has been suggested that combining scanning training with methods addressing non-spatial attention might enhance training results. In the present study, a dual task training component was added to a visual scanning training (i.e., Training di Scanning Visuospaziale &#x02013; TSVS; Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>). Twenty-nine subacute right hemisphere stroke patients were semi-randomly assigned to an experimental (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14) or a control group (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15). Patients received 30 training sessions during 6&#x02009;weeks. TSVS consisted of four standardized tasks (digit detection, reading/copying, copying drawings, and figure description). Moreover, a driving simulator task was integrated in the training procedure. Control patients practiced a single lane tracking task for 2&#x02009;days a week during 6&#x02009;weeks. The experimental group was administered the same training schedule, but in weeks 4&#x02013;6 of the training, the TSVS digit detection task was combined with lane tracking on the same projection screen, so as to create a dual task (computerized visual reaction time task designed for training). Various neglect tests and driving simulator tasks were administered before and after training. No significant group and interaction effects were found that might reflect additional positive effects of dual task training. Significant improvements after training were observed in both groups taken together on most assessment tasks. Ameliorations were generally not correlated to post-onset time, but spontaneous recovery, test&#x02013;retest variability, and learning effects could not be ruled out completely, since these were not controlled for. Future research might focus on increasing the amount of dual task training, the implementation of progressive difficulty levels in driving simulator tasks, and further exploration of relationships between dual task training and daily functioning.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>hemineglect</kwd><kwd>spatial attention</kwd><kwd>divided attention</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd><kwd>driving simulator</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="76"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="10376"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visuospatial neglect is defined as &#x0201c;a disorder whereby a patient fails to explore the half-space contralateral to the cerebral lesion&#x0201d; (Heilman et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">1993</xref>). To explain the deficit underlying this disorder, various theories have been formulated, like attentional, representational, and cerebral balance theories (see Kerkhoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">2001</xref> for a review). Corbetta and Shulman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>) suggest that neglect results from a dysfunction of the distributed and interacting cortical networks responsible for the control of both spatial and non-spatial attention processes. For instance, neglect symptoms have been shown to vary with arousal and sustained or vigilant attention (Robertson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">1997</xref>; Samuelsson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">1998</xref>; Robertson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">2001</xref>) as well as with task complexity (Deouell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>; Vuillemier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2008</xref>).</p><p>Neglect occurs more often after right hemisphere (RH) than after left hemisphere (LH) stroke. Reported rates of occurrence vary widely as a result of a number of factors, including assessment method and time post stroke (see Bowen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">1999</xref> for a review). Also, large within-patient variability in test performance is reported. Machner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2012</xref>) administered the Bells test, a symbol cancelation and a line bisection task on five consecutive days to 15 neglect patients. They observed large day-to-day variability, indicating that five more or less omissions on the Bells test and deviations of plus or minus 16&#x02009;mm in the line bisection task could be due to test or within-patient variability, rather than indicating a reliable change of neglect severity. Similar results have been reported by Bailey et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">2004</xref>).</p><p>Spontaneous recovery of neglect is mostly reported in the first weeks after stroke (Ferro et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">1999</xref>; Appelros et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">2004b</xref>; Jehkonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">2007</xref>). However, a recent study of Nijboer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">in press</xref>) reports significant spontaneous recovery up to 14&#x02009;weeks after stroke. Farn&#x000e8; et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>) also report changes in the performance of neglect tasks until at least 3&#x02009;months after stroke. The presence of neglect is generally associated with poor functional outcome after stroke (Jehkonen et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">2006</xref>; DiMonaco et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">2011</xref>; Vossel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">2012</xref>). Nijboer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">in press</xref>) point out that 40% of the neglect patients still show visuospatial neglect 1&#x02009;year after stroke, indicating that rehabilitation of this disorder is of great importance.</p><p>Several interventions aimed at reducing neglect symptoms have been described, like visual scanning training, prism adaptation, limb activation training, and non-invasive brain stimulation techniques (see Zoccolotti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">2011</xref>; Kerkhoff and Schenk, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">2012</xref>; Fasotti and Van Kessel, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">in press</xref>, for reviews). In a Cochrane review excluding all studies that were not considered properly randomized controlled trials, Bowen and Lincoln (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">2007</xref>) conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of specific cognitive rehabilitation approaches for reducing disabilities due to neglect (see also Rohling et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2009</xref>; Paci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">2010</xref>). However, in two reviews of cognitive rehabilitation, Cicerone et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">2005</xref>) recommend visual scanning training as a practice standard for the treatment of neglect. Also, in a meta-analysis of the reviews by Cicerone et al., Rohling et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">2009</xref>) report a medium to large effect of visuospatial training. In an extensive review of 18 different treatments for neglect and their rationales, in which not only randomized controlled trials but also multiple baseline single case studies were included, Luaut&#x000e9; et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2006</xref>) conclude that for 6 of the available methods there is some evidence for clinical relevant training effects, visual scanning training being the most extensively evaluated training method.</p><p>Visual scanning training was originally introduced by Diller and Weinberg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">1977</xref>) and further developed and described by Pizzamiglio et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>) (see Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2006</xref> for a review). This type of training stems from the observation that neglect patients generally show very limited attention and exploration behavior toward the contralesional hemispace. The aim of training is to improve visual scanning behavior, i.e., to encourage neglect patients to actively and consciously pay attention to stimuli on the contralesional side. In the original training protocol by Pizzamiglio et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>) (Training di Scanning Visuospaziale &#x02013; TSVS), four standardized training tasks are used, i.e., a computerized digit detection task projected on a large screen, figure copying, picture exploring, and reading and writing tasks. Contralesional exploration behavior is encouraged by means of operant conditioning techniques (i.e., reinforcement of correct scanning movements) and repeated training of the use of compensatory strategies (for instance using a contralesional anchor and systematically starting to scan from this point and controlling one&#x02019;s performance starting from the contralesional side before finishing an activity). Guidelines for the use and gradual reduction of various stimulation methods and cues are provided. Moreover, in order to increase their awareness of the deficit, patients are given concrete feedback about their performance.</p><p>Significantly increased scores on paper-and-pencil tasks as well as on a semi-structured observation scale (Zoccolotti et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">1992</xref>) were found after TSVS (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>; Antonucci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1995</xref>). The authors stress that the duration and intensity of the training (40&#x02009;h during 8&#x02009;weeks) plays an important role in the attainment of positive results. Moreover, the gradual and systematic increase in difficulty levels of the materials and the reduction of feedback seem important ingredients of the training leading to improvement. Positive training results were replicated by Paolucci et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1996</xref>), who found improvements in test performance as well as in functional status linked to the timing of the training and additional to general rehabilitation. Despite these generally positive results, a large variability in patients&#x02019; benefits from TSVS has also been observed in each of the abovementioned studies. It is unclear why some patients benefit from the training while others do not. One factor seems to be the improvement of the patients&#x02019; awareness of deficit (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>). However, often it is not possible to predict whether improved awareness may be expected in an individual patient as a result of the training. In addition, since neglect may occur after lesions in different regions of the brain (see for instance Karnath et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">2004</xref>), lesion site might also play a role in the variability of training effects.</p><p>As various authors (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2006</xref>; Saevarsson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">2011</xref>) point out, individual variability in training results has led to the question whether training effectiveness can be improved by combining interventions. Until now, positive training results were found in both conditions in a study comparing regular TSVS with TSVS plus additional optokinetic stimulation (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">2004</xref>). However, no differences were observed between conditions. Luaut&#x000e9; et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">2006</xref>) also recommend the evaluation of combinations of existing methods. More specifically, these authors suggest that effective treatments be combined with techniques aiming at processes that contribute to the clinical manifestation of neglect (for example non-spatial attention and working memory) to further enhance training effects. Moreover, in another TSVS evaluation study, Piccardi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">2006</xref>) investigated whether TSVS might result in improved performances on various neglect and non-neglect measures (i.e., measures of vigilance, alertness, and attentional control/response inhibition). TSVS training effects were observed on neglect measures but not on non-spatial attention tasks. Therefore, Pizzamiglio et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">2006</xref>) point out that in the rehabilitation of neglect, care must be taken to also treat non-spatial disorders.</p><p>In the present study, an attempt is made to further extend the scope of standardized TSVS by combining it with additional dual task training. The use of dual tasks in neglect may be pre-eminently useful because of the association between spatial and non-spatial attentional processes in this disorder. Robertson and Frasca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">1992</xref>), for instance, assume that neglect patients are particularly vulnerable to a deterioration of performance in the face of additional attentional load because of this association. Robertson and Manly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2004</xref>) suggested that it is possible to detect the presence of well-compensated or even &#x0201c;recovered&#x0201d; neglect by increasing attentional load. This can be accomplished by means of a dual task. In line with this idea, it was found that computerized dual tasks elicit more contralesional omissions (Bonato et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2013</xref>) and slower contralesional reaction times (RTs) (Deouell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>) than single paper-and-pencil tasks. Moreover, clearly asymmetric task performance in the computerized dual tasks even occurred in some patients showing no signs of neglect in paper-and-pencil tasks. Thus, computer-based dual tasks, even though not always showing resemblance to contexts of daily living, have high diagnostic potential in the assessment of neglect and its recovery (Schendel and Robertson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2002</xref>; Bonato and Deouell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2013</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, various authors describe that deficits in non-spatial attentional processes not only occur in association with neglect (for instance in the case of impaired arousal). Non-spatial attention processes involved in the exertion of top-down influence on lower level spatial perception may also play an important underlying role in this disorder (Corbetta et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">2005</xref>; Vuillemier et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">2008</xref>). Bartolomeo and Chokron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">2002</xref>), for instance, suggest that a basic mechanism leading to neglect behavior is an impaired exogenous orienting toward left-sided targets. Nevertheless, patients may be able to compensate for their deficit by means of endogenous attentional processes, that may be spared but slowed in neglect. The ability to successfully compensate for neglect symptoms might thus depend on the patients&#x02019; capacities to gain attentional control over their scanning behavior.</p><p>Neglect is often associated with frontoparietal damage in the RH (Farn&#x000e8; et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">2004</xref>; Committeri et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">2007</xref>) or in the white matter connecting parietal and frontal areas (Bartolomeo et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">2012</xref>). According to Corbetta and Shulman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">2011</xref>), lesions in the RH that cause neglect impair non-spatial functions mediated by a ventral frontoparietal attention network. This impairment may in turn induce abnormalities in an anatomically linked dorsal frontoparietal network that controls spatial attention. Singh-Curry and Husain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">2009</xref>) point out that a frontoparietal system might allow the flexible reconfiguration of behavior between maintaining attentive control and responding to salient stimuli. Dual tasks might then not only generally increase attentional load, but might address this frontoparietal system more specifically.</p><p>Thus, dual tasks might not only appeal to attentional capacity, but also to the control over attention. Patients&#x02019; performances on these tasks could be indicative for their abilities to compensate for neglect (Van Kessel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2013</xref>). This raises the question whether these tasks might also be used as a training tool. As Robertson and Manly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2004</xref>) point out, the demands on neglect patients&#x02019; impaired abilities in maintaining corrective &#x0201c;top-down&#x0201d; control over spatial attention might be minimized by attempting to train these corrective strategies to a point where they become more habitual. TSVS training is aimed at the conscious compensation for spatial attention deficits and thus appeals to top-down attentional control. Combining TSVS with additional dual task training might provide tools for accomplishing a higher degree of automation of scanning strategies and contribute to the enhancement of training results.</p><p>To investigate the additional value of dual task training, in the present study, a computerized visual RT task designed for training (CVRT-TR) will be used. The CVRT-TR was designed on the basis of two diagnostic tasks, i.e., a single and a dual CVRT task (CVRT and CVRT-D, respectively). These assessment tasks had been previously used to investigate spatial and non-spatial attention processes in neglect (Van Kessel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">2013</xref>). In concordance with the abovementioned findings of Deouell et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">2005</xref>) and Bonato et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">2013</xref>), more patients were classified as neglect patients by using RT asymmetries on the CVRT than by using scores on the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT; Wilson et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">1987</xref>). Moreover, the results suggested that some patients with defective RT asymmetries but normal BIT scores might compensate for their lateralized deficit in paper-and-pencil tasks. These patients might have engaged intact non-spatial attentional processes, especially attentional control (Van Kessel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">2010</xref>). When single (CVRT) and dual (CVRT-D) task performance were compared (Van Kessel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2012</xref>), a clear increase in RT asymmetries between CVRT and CVRT-D was observed. Half of the patients meeting the BIT criterion for neglect showed increased RT asymmetries from CVRT to CVRT-D. Moreover, two LH and RH patients without neglect symptoms on the BIT and CVRT showed significantly increased asymmetries in the CVRT-D. This fostered the idea of an emergence of subtle neglect under increased attentional load.</p><p>In the CVRT-TR, a large screen driving simulation task was added to the computerized digit detection task used in the standardized TSVS protocol (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>). Thus, a dual task was created that can be used for training patients. The CVRT-TR could be referred to as a virtual reality (VR) task. Other VR methods include desktop simulator tasks or head-mounted devices. Recently, different kinds of VR tasks have been applied in the assessment and observation of neglect patients (Broeren et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">2007</xref>; Buxbaum et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2012</xref>; Jannink et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">2009</xref>; Kim et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">2010</xref>; Fordell et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">2011</xref>). Buxbaum et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">2012</xref>) describe a virtual reality lateralized attention task (VRLAT) in which patients had to navigate through a VR environment while seated in front of a flat screen display in a powered wheelchair treadmill. These patients were asked to name objects projected on both sides of the road. Neglect symptoms were detected in more patients by using the VRLAT, compared to paper-and-pencil tasks. Moreover, left-sided collisions on the VRLAT showed significant correlations with real-world left-sided collisions.</p><p>Virtual reality tasks are also used as a rehabilitation tool (see Tsirlin et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">2009</xref> for a recent review). VR training in neglect is mostly aimed at improving performance on the task that is simulated, for instance navigating through a real-life wheelchair obstacle course (Webster et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">2001</xref>) or street crossing (Katz et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">2005</xref>). In an alertness training program used by Thimm et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">2006</xref>), patients had to &#x0201c;drive&#x0201d; a simulated car or motorcycle as quickly as possible and avoid crashing into obstacles that appeared suddenly on the screen. After 3&#x02009;weeks of training, both alertness and neglect deficits were significantly reduced. However, 4&#x02009;weeks after the end of training, neglect symptoms had returned to the pre-training level. Finally, Akinwuntan et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">2010</xref>) observed no differences between stroke patients receiving either simulator-based driving-related training or non-computer-based cognitive training over 5&#x02009;weeks. In their RCT, both groups showed similar improvement after training on a test of driving-related visual attention skills.</p><p>Not only are VR techniques suitable to simulate daily activities, but in doing so, tasks can be created that allow for the combined training of visuospatial and non-spatial attention. In the present study, it will be investigated whether the effectiveness of the standardized TSVS protocol (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>) might be further enhanced using the CVRT-TR. In the CVRT-TR, patients are enabled to additionally practice their acquired scanning strategies while performing a secondary task. It is hypothesized that training patients with this task could contribute to an enhancement in TSVS training results and better performance on various diagnostic tasks for neglect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Patients with a first intracerebral infarction or hemorrhage admitted for clinical multidisciplinary rehabilitation to one of four local rehabilitation centers in the Netherlands were eligible for this study. Over a period of 2&#x02009;years, 53 RH patients showing neglect symptoms as observed by their therapists and/or found in early neuropsychological screening, were referred for further assessment. This assessment was aimed at investigating whether TSVS and inclusion in the present study would be indicated. Tests were performed at least 8&#x02009;weeks post-onset to minimize the role of spontaneous recovery. Six patients in the control group and 8 patients in the experimental group could be considered chronic neglect patients, since they had post-onset times of more than 3&#x02009;months. Patients with omission scores above cut-off on at least three of the paper-and-pencil neglect tests and one of the observational scales (all listed below) were asked to participate in the present study.

All words consisted of three syllables and were composed of 6&#x02013;11 letters. Fifty-five words were used in their natural form. Moreover, in every word two letters were replaced within the first syllable in one condition (left non-word) and within the last in a third condition (right non-word). All words (55) and non-words (110) were presented in random order. RH neglect patients tend to misread the first syllables. An index score was computed in which the difference between left and right errors was divided by the sum of left and right errors.

A pair of vertically aligned horizontal rectangular bars of equal length was printed on each page. The bars were filled with continuous scales of different gray shades varying from black to white at the extremes. The upper and lower bar of each pair were mirrored copies of each other. Hence, one of the gray scales was black on the left and white on the right and the other exactly the opposite. Pairs of stimuli of different lengths were randomly used. Patients were asked to judge which (top or bottom) bar of each pair appeared darker overall. RH neglect patients tend to show extreme rightward biases (consistently choosing bars that are black on the extreme right). An index score was computed, in which the difference between rightward and leftward biased responses was divided by 26.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2-1-7"><title>Baking tray task</title><p>In this task, patients were asked to equally distribute 16 blocks (4&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4&#x02009;cm) on a &#x0201c;baking tray,&#x0201d; i.e., a 75&#x02009;cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100&#x02009;cm board (Tham and Tegn&#x000e9;r, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">1996</xref>; Appelros et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">2004a</xref>).

Six scores for the extent of asymmetric performance were given on 0&#x02013;3 point scales, so that the maximum total score of 18 indicated severe asymmetries on all subscales.

Patients were asked to indicate how frequently (1&#x02013;5) each problem had occurred the last month. Thus, the minimum score of 19 indicated no reported problems, the maximum score was 95.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S2-2-3"><title>Driving simulator tasks</title><p>Three types of driving simulator tasks were used during the assessment. These were a single lane tracking task, a single target detection task, and a dual task consisting of both lane tracking and target detection (see also below). In all driving simulator tasks, patients were seated in front of a 2.13&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;3.18&#x02009;m projection screen at a distance of approximately 90&#x02009;cm, thus creating a visual angle of approximately 110&#x000b0;. On the screen, a driving scene was projected. A steering wheel (Trust formula 1 race master) was fixed on a table in front of the participant and a white wooden board was placed on the table between the steering wheel and the projection screen, so as to prevent subjects from using the edges of the table as a spatial reference while driving.</p><sec id="S2-2-3-11"><title>Lane tracking</title><p>In the lane tracking task, a driving scene was projected on the same screen that was also used as a part of the standard TSVS training (e.g., large screen digit detection, see below). The simulated speed of the imaginary car was set at a constant 50&#x02009;km/h. Patients were instructed to use the steering wheel to maintain the starting position in the middle of the right lane of the projected road, thereby compensating for what was indicated as &#x0201c;sidewind.&#x0201d; This was a continuous signal fluctuating from left to right in a fixed pattern created by superimposing three low frequency sinus movements. Thus, patients were continuously &#x0201c;blown&#x0201d; off track, either right- or leftward. Patients&#x02019; lateral positions during lane tracking were recorded every 15&#x02009;s. Mean lateral position scores were computed from these values for each patient and the SD of the lateral position scores reflected the degree of oscillation.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2-3-12"><title>Single detection task (CVRT)</title><p>In the CVRT, patients were asked to detect large rectangular dot patterns on one of three horizontal positions within a driving scene that was projected on the screen. RTs for left, middle, and right stimuli were recorded and asymmetries (i.e., difference scores) between left and right RTs were computed. Steering was not required.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2-3-13"><title>Dual task (CVRT-D)</title><p>In the CVRT-D, lane tracking and CVRT dot pattern detection were combined to create a dual task. Lateral position and oscillation scores were computed together with RTs and RT asymmetries.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Training tasks</title><p>A translated version of the original TSVS manual (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>) was used. This was slightly adapted for use in the present study. Most importantly, patients received 30 training sessions (5&#x02009;days a week, a 1-h session each day, during 6&#x02009;weeks) instead of the original 40&#x02009;h. Moreover, some changes had been made in the order of the digit detection sequences. Guidelines as to the use and fading of cues were provided in the manual. By individually adjusting difficulty levels of the sequences and the use of cues, patients were offered systematic training. Training sessions consisted of four standard tasks and additional control or experimental tasks.</p><sec id="S2-3-4"><title>Standard training</title><sec id="S2-3-4-14"><title>Large screen digit detection</title><p>Using a desktop computer and a projector, sequences of random digits (1&#x02013;9) were projected from behind on a 3.18&#x02009;m&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2.13&#x02009;m screen. Each digit was projected at one of 48 (12 horizontal&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 vertical) possible positions. Patients were seated in front of the screen, which was placed at approximately 90&#x02009;cm from their eyes, so as to create a visual angle of the projection of around 110&#x000b0; horizontally and 70&#x000b0; vertically (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> for training set-up). Patients were free to move their head and eyes. They were asked to name each digit and at the same time press a button as quickly as possible. Sequences of progressive difficulty levels were used, the easiest sequences progressing stepwise from right to left at the same height and the most difficult ones randomly alternating between all possible positions. Verbal cues (encouragement of the trainer to look further to the left) and non-verbal auditory cues (signal tones accompanying each digit) could be given.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>TSVS visual scanning training set-up</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnhum-07-00358-g001"/></fig><p>In general, during the first weeks of training, patients were trained to perform leftward scanning movements. To this end, training sequences were used that facilitated directing and preserving attention (supported by active head movements) to the left side of the screen, i.e., progressing stepwise to and (later) from the left side.</p><p>In the second half of the training, patients were taught to &#x0201c;center&#x0201d; their scanning behavior, i.e., using their straight ahead as a departing point from which to make scanning movements to either the left or right side. This technique is aimed at achieving symmetry in left and right detection times. The use of verbal and auditory cues was gradually faded during the training.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3-4-15"><title>Copying line drawings on a dot matrix</title><p>Patients were instructed to copy lines, connecting some points of a dot matrix placed on the left halve of a page, into an empty matrix on the right.

The division of tasks on Thursdays and Fridays was based on clinical experience. It was chosen for two reasons: first, driving simulator tasks were only added for 2&#x02009;days a week since it was considered important that patients in both the control and experimental condition were allowed sufficient time to practice TSVS digit detection. Second, the CVRT-TR dual was only introduced from week 4 of the training because it was presumed that patients should first learn the centering technique as a requisite skill for an adequate execution of the dual task.</p><sec id="S2-3-5-18"><title>Lane tracking task</title><p>This task was also used as a part of the pre- and post-training assessment, see for details under Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2-2-3">&#x0201c;Driving Simulator Tasks.&#x0201d;</xref></p></sec><sec id="S2-3-5-19"><title>CVRT-TR dual task</title><p>The CVRT-TR dual task was designed as a training counterpart of the CVRT-D, that was used as a diagnostic task in the present study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2-2-3">Driving Simulator Tasks</xref>). Instead of the large rectangular dot patterns on three possible positions used in the CVRT-D, sequences from the TSVS large screen digit detection task were projected in the driving scene in CVRT-TR conditions. Thus, besides maintaining their driving position, patients were instructed to detect and name digits that were projected on the upper half of the screen at one of 48 possible locations (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> for an example). The digit sequences that were projected were the same sequences that were used in the TSVS for training patients to &#x0201c;center&#x0201d; their scanning behavior (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S2-3-4">Standard Training</xref>) during the second half of the training. Thus, patients were enabled to further practice this centering technique during the CVRT-TR, by choosing to focus on the straight ahead (i.e., the road in front of them) and regularly performing scanning movements to the left or right to detect digits while driving.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>CVRT-TR driving scene with digit projected at one of 48 possible locations</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fnhum-07-00358-g002"/></fig></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Severity of neglect before and after training was analyzed using non-parametric (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>) tests.

Mixed Models is a procedure in which alternative estimators are used for the parameters of a variance-analytic design; it is claimed to be more robust to violations of assumptions which are crucial for the conventional ANOVA estimators.

It should be noted that since some patients omitted all left stimuli in the CVRT, CVRT-D, or both, this resulted in missing data for the RTs on this position. Therefore, varying degrees of freedom are reported. Moreover, as a result of the fact that only valid RTs were recorded, valid RTs might show an increase instead of a decrease in patients who after training did respond to stimuli they had omitted before.</p></sec><sec id="S3-7"><title>Correlations with post-onset times</title><p>To account for the possible role of spontaneous recovery, two-tailed Pearson correlations were computed between days post-onset on the one hand and pre- vs. post-training differences on the other.

No significant correlations of any measure with post-onset period were found.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, a computerized dual task was added to a standardized TSVS training (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>) for neglect patients. In this manner, patients were trained to use visual scanning strategies in an attention demanding task. It was hypothesized that this might enhance the automation of scanning strategies and thus contribute to an improvement of training results. Twenty-nine RH neglect patients, quasi-randomly assigned to one of two additional driving simulator training conditions, received TSVS training for 5&#x02009;days a week during 6&#x02009;weeks. In both conditions, for 2&#x02009;days a week, the TSVS large screen digit detection task was replaced by a driving simulator task. In the control condition, patients trained with a lane tracking task two times a week during 6&#x02009;weeks. In the experimental condition, lane tracking was replaced by CVRT-TR dual task training in weeks 4&#x02013;6 of the training.</p><p>The primary research question of the present study was whether dual task training could contribute to an improvement of TSVS training results, as measured by various neglect tasks. No significant group or interaction effects reflecting additional positive training effects were found in the experimental group compared with the control group. Several explanations for the absence of group or interaction effects reflect the shortcomings of the present study and give clues for future research.</p><p>First, the amount of training time has to be considered. In the present study, the difference between control and experimental training time was two periods of 35&#x02009;min per week during 3&#x02009;weeks. This amount of time may be too small to find differences between conditions. The present results suggest that all patients had trained enough to show some improvement on most of the paper-and-pencil tasks as well as the simplest driving simulator subtasks, i.e., lane tracking and the detection of left stimuli in the CVRT single task. However, no improvement or practice effects were observed on the more complex CVRT-D.</p><p>Given the absence of a no-treatment control group, it can not be excluded that improved performance on the assessment tasks is due to spontaneous recovery, test&#x02013;retest learning effects, or an interaction between these factors. Nijboer et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">in press</xref>), for instance, found spontaneous recovery occurring up to 14&#x02009;weeks after onset, on several paper-and-pencil tasks. Computerized dual tasks like the CVRT-D used in our study may show a higher sensitivity, even to slight signs of spontaneous recovery. Therefore, in future research, we recommend the use of longer post-onset times as an inclusion criterion and/or the inclusion of a no-treatment control group. Nevertheless, no significant correlations were found between pre- and post-training performances and differences in pre- vs. post-training performance on the one hand and post-onset time on the other. This indicates that spontaneous recovery does not explain all the observed improvements after training. Also, mean scores of both groups as a whole on the Bells test showed a reduction of approximately five omissions after training. This coincides with the maximum test&#x02013;retest variability in the Machner et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">2012</xref>) study (see also the Section <xref ref-type="sec" rid="S1">Introduction</xref>). This result suggests that patients&#x02019; progress can not entirely be ascribed to test&#x02013;retest variability, although some learning effect may have been present. Our results seem in concordance with previous studies evaluating TSVS (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">1992</xref>; Antonucci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1995</xref>; Paolucci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">1996</xref>). Nevertheless, the inclusion of a no-treatment control group is still recommended for future research. Including a control group might also be useful to rule out the possible role of other rehabilitation treatments that patients receive during the experimental or control training.</p><p>As in standardized TSVS, the mere amount of training time might be crucial also in dual task training (Antonucci et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">1995</xref>; Kerkhoff, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">1998</xref>). Therefore, in future research, increasing the amount of dual task training in the experimental group should be considered. The current training schedule was partly based on the standardized TSVS protocol (Pizzamiglio et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>) and partly on clinical experience. Although it was presumed that patients first should learn the &#x0201c;centering&#x0201d; technique before moving on to the CVRT-TR task in the experimental condition, other training schedules allowing for more dual task practice might be considered. For example, after first introducing the centering technique during two or three training sessions in the fourth week of training using the TSVS digit detection task, the automatization of this skill might be further practiced using the CVRT-TR on a daily basis. Moreover, a repeated evaluation of the patients&#x02019; performances with our assessment measures could have been useful. This might have unraveled the presence of a tendency to improve between the first half (equal for both groups) and the second half (different for the two groups) of the training. Moreover, repeated evaluation during training might reveal the time needed for substantial improvement and be useful to chart patients&#x02019; progress during different training stages. Although 6&#x02009;weeks of training may be considered time-consuming, the original TSVS training protocol by Pizzamiglio et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">1990</xref>) envisages 8&#x02009;weeks of training. Additional driving simulator training beyond 6&#x02009;weeks might turn out to be necessary to allow the generalization of training results. This would also have minimized the demands on the patients&#x02019; impaired abilities in maintaining corrective &#x0201c;top-down&#x0201d; control over spatial attention (Robertson and Manly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">2004</xref>).</p><p>In order to further evaluate the possible additional effects of dual task training and the design of future VR dual tasks for the training of neglect, it is important to address the issue of the large variability in neglect symptoms and training effects between patients. It may well be worth to evaluate larger groups of patients and to reconsider inclusion criteria for dual task training. For instance, despite the suggestion that it should be possible to also train patients with mild neglect using the CVRT and CVRT-TR, it must be noted that the groups participating in the present study consisted of patients with chronic and moderate to severe neglect. Although the CVRT-TR was, among other things, designed to allow patients with mild neglect to train visual scanning strategies up to a higher level of automation and under more challenging conditions, the inclusion criteria of the present study mostly led to the exclusion of patients with these milder degrees of neglect. Also, the CVRT-TR turned out to be too difficult for some of the participating patients. Two of them even complained that the dual task was unpleasant and had the impression that they were not improving. It might be worthwhile to evaluate which patients might really benefit from dual task training. To this end, data on the location and size of patients&#x02019; lesions might be informative and aid in the tailoring of interventions.</p><p>Finally, no specific strategies were presently proposed to patients to systematically improve single and dual lane tracking. In future dual task training developments, the design of progressively increasing difficulty levels might be considered, coupled to the formulation of helpful cues and strategies to be learned accordingly. For instance, the addition (and gradual reduction) of spatial cues regarding their actual lateral position and a built-in control or &#x0201c;brake&#x0201d; function might be helpful for patients who have difficulties performing the dual task. For some patients, monitoring (the risk of) errors or omissions and exerting control over the situation by pausing and taking time to scan the environment might be an important strategy to compensate for neglect. Similarly, suitable strategies might be developed for patients suffering from neglect in combination with visual field deficits, who were excluded from the present study.</p><p>In conclusion, previous research has pointed out that computerized (dual) tasks may be very useful in the assessment of neglect (Schendel and Robertson, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">2002</xref>; Bonato and Deouell, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">2013</xref>). Before any recommendation can be made about the use of these tasks for training, further research is needed. Alongside the abovementioned methodological suggestions, future research might focus on the relationship between ameliorations on dual task performance and the performance on other outcome measures. For example, a robust relationships between CVRT-D performance and measures of mobility, balance, and daily functioning has recently been found (Van Kessel et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">2012</xref>). It would be worthwhile to investigate whether possible training effects on driving simulator tasks might also be reflected in the reduction of neglect symptoms in real-life tasks like walking or (wheelchair) driving.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Research Grant 14350009 from the Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development.
