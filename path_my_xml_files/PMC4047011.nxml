Experiment 1 compared fibre specific and whole muscle responses to acute bouts of either low-volume high-intensity interval training (LV-HIT) or moderate-intensity continuous endurance exercise (END) in a randomized crossover design. Experiment 2 examined the impact of a six-week training intervention (END or LV-HIT; 4 days/week), on whole body and skeletal muscle fibre specific markers of aerobic and anaerobic capacity. Six recreationally active men (Age: 20.7&#x000b1;3.8 yrs; VO<sub>2</sub>peak: 51.9&#x000b1;5.1 mL/kg/min) reported to the lab on two separate occasions for experiment 1. Following a muscle biopsy taken in a fasted state, participants completed an acute bout of each exercise protocol (LV-HIT: 8, 20-second intervals at &#x0223c;170% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak separated by 10 seconds of rest; END: 30 minutes at &#x0223c;65% of VO<sub>2</sub>peak), immediately followed by a muscle biopsy. Glycogen content of type I and IIA fibres was significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) reduced, while p-ACC was significantly increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) following both protocols. Nineteen recreationally active males (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) and females (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;3) were VO<sub>2</sub>peak-matched and assigned to either the LV-HIT (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10; 21&#x000b1;2 yrs) or END (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;9; 20.7&#x000b1;3.8 yrs) group for experiment 2. After 6 weeks, both training protocols induced comparable increases in aerobic capacity (END: Pre: 48.3&#x000b1;6.0, Mid: 51.8&#x000b1;6.0, Post: 55.0&#x000b1;6.3 mL/kg/min LV-HIT: Pre: 47.9&#x000b1;8.1, Mid: 50.4&#x000b1;7.4, Post: 54.7&#x000b1;7.6 mL/kg/min), fibre-type specific oxidative and glycolytic capacity, glycogen and IMTG stores, and whole-muscle capillary density. Interestingly, only LV-HIT induced greater improvements in anaerobic performance and estimated whole-muscle glycolytic capacity. These results suggest that 30 minutes of END exercise at &#x0223c;65% VO<sub>2</sub>peak or 4 minutes of LV-HIT at &#x0223c;170% VO<sub>2</sub>peak induce comparable changes in the intra-myocellular environment (glycogen content and signaling activation); correspondingly, training-induced adaptations resulting for these protocols, and other HIT and END protocols are strikingly similar.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI).

Given the markedly reduced training dose (exercise energy expenditure and training time) associated with many high-intensity protocols, these data demonstrate the ability of high intensity exercise to induce physiological adaptations without the requirement for large training volumes.</p><p>The potency of HIT high-intensity exercise has recently been demonstrated by several studies employing a low volume- (LV) high-intensity interval training (HIT) protocol requiring a fraction of the training dose (total training time of &#x0223c;4 min/day) necessary for END and many other HIT protocols. Similar to other larger dose HIT protocols, studies utilizing LV-HIT have demonstrated improvements in VO<sub>2</sub>peak <xref rid="pone.0098119-McRae1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Tabata1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, anaerobic exercise capacity <xref rid="pone.0098119-Tabata1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, and increased mitochondrial protein content (cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (COX) subunit I and COX IV)<xref rid="pone.0098119-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> that are equivalent to those induced by END <xref rid="pone.0098119-McRae1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Tabata1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. While there is an abundance of literature demonstrating the efficacy of HIT at inducing adaptations, the mechanisms by which substantially lower doses of high intensity exercise induce adaptations typically associated with high dose END are not completely understood, specifically, similarities/differences in fibre-type specific adaptations induced by HIT and END have not been completely described.</p><p>For example, several recent reports suggest that improvements in aerobic exercise capacity and performance following HIT result primarily from peripheral adaptations <xref rid="pone.0098119-MacPherson1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Jacobs1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. These adaptations, specifically the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis, result from the activation of signaling cascades which increase transcription of mitochondrial genes via the activation <xref rid="pone.0098119-Pilegaard1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Wright1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and/or increased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1 alpha (PGC-1&#x003b1;) <xref rid="pone.0098119-Gibala2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Given that END and HIT result in similar increases in whole-muscle markers of mitochondrial content and oxidative capacity <xref rid="pone.0098119-Burgomaster1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098119-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Gibala1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Terada1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, it is not surprising that acute activation of signaling pathways, measured in whole-muscle homogenates, following a single bout of END and HIT are also comparable <xref rid="pone.0098119-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098119-Wang2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However, it is not clear if these whole-muscle measures reflect similar adaptations across distinct fibre populations within a trained muscle, or whether HIT induces adaptations in different populations of fibres. More specifically, whether the well characterized recruitment of type II fibres associated with higher intensities of exercise, including continuous supramaximal <xref rid="pone.0098119-Greenhaff1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0098119-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and intermittent maximal <xref rid="pone.0098119-Essn1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> exercise result in different fibre recruitment patterns between LV-HIT and END is unknown. Further, whether variations in acute fibre recruitment result in distinctive fibre adaptations following chronic LV-HIT and END is also not known; however, it is possible that different recruitment patterns and fibre-type specific adaptations may partially explain the potency of high intensity exercise and more specifically, LV-HIT.</p><p>To examine these issues we performed 2 distinct experiments. The purpose of experiment 1 was to examine: 1) fibre recruitment patterns, as reflected by reductions in glycogen content of each fibre-type population, and 2) whole-muscle and fibre-type specific signalling pathway activation following an acute bout of LV-HIT and END exercise. The purpose of experiment 2 was to examine: 1) changes in aerobic and anaerobic exercise performance, and 2) fibre-type specific adaptations in oxidative and glycolytic capacities, substrate storage and whole-muscle capillary density resulting from 6 weeks of LV-HIT and END training. We hypothesized that an acute bout of LV-HIT would result in the activation of a greater number of type II muscle fibres than END exercise, and that resulting fibre-specific metabolic adaptations following training would reflect these differences in acute fibre recruitment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All experimental procedures performed on human participants were approved by the Health Sciences Human Research Ethics Board at Queen&#x02019;s University and conformed to the Declaration of Helsinki.

All sections were visualized with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, TH, DE). Individual images were taken across the entire muscle cross-section and assembled into a composite panoramic image using AxioVision software (Carl Zeiss). Compiled images were matched to fibre-type images and &#x0223c;30 of each fibre type were randomly selected and analyzed. Data were expressed relative to the values obtained in type I fibers, which were assigned a reference value of 1.0, and reported as mean optical density in arbitrary units (AU). This method was utilized for all immunofluorescent and histochemical analyses except for the determination of capillary density where 3 separate areas per sample were analyzed for number of capillaries. Fibre-specific p-AMPK&#x003b1; fluorescence was performed in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA) and was determined by subtracting the average fluorescence of the slide background (&#x0003e;5 per slide) from each individual fibre&#x02019;s fluorescence.</p><p>As a general indicator of oxidative and glycolytic potential, histochemical staining for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) <xref rid="pone.0098119-Blanco1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> and &#x003b1;-glycerophosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) <xref rid="pone.0098119-HalkjaerKristensen1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> activity was performed <xref rid="pone.0098119-Bloemberg1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.

Images were acquired with a bright field Nikon microscope linked to a PixelLink digital camera. Individual images were taken across the entire muscle cross-section and assembled into a composite panoramic image using Microsoft Image Composite Editor (ICE) (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA). Image analysis was performed in ImageJ by converting color images to 8-bit, and calculated by subtracting background staining from the mean grey value of individual fibres. Estimated oxidative and glycolytic capacities were calculated by summing the calculated capacities of each fibre type together. Capacities for each fibre type were calculated by multiplying the mean SDH (oxidative) or GPD (glycolytic) activity for each fibre-type by the percent of that fibre present within each participant&#x02019;s sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Western Blotting</title><p>Samples were homogenized, total protein was determined, and sample loading, separation and transfer were performed as described previously <xref rid="pone.0098119-Boyd1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>.

The reasons for this discrepancy in intramuscular signalling are unclear, however the brevity of the LV-HIT protocol utilized in the current study, compared to the longer duration of SIT protocols utilized previously, suggests that the duration of exercise may be an important factor underlying the activation of these pathways. Collectively, these results suggest that END exercise at an intensity &#x0003e;65% VO<sub>2</sub>peak results in both similar fibre recruitment and activation of intramuscular signaling pathways as more intense, lower dose HIT. Additionally, it appears that the intensity/duration threshold required to activate intracellular signaling events associated with the induction of mitochondrial biogenesis within an individual muscle fibre is achieved by both LV-HIT and END exercise at intensities equal to, or greater than 65% VO<sub>2</sub>peak and a duration of at least 30 minutes <xref rid="pone.0098119-Bartlett1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Egan1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>.

These adaptations are also consistent with the muscle fibre activation patterns observed during a single bout of LV-HIT and END in experiment 1 suggesting that recruitment of fibres during repeated acute bouts of LV-HIT and END (i.e. training) results in increases in oxidative capacity within those fibres.

Collectively, these studies suggest that the intramuscular signaling required to elicit these adaptations are equivalently stimulated by both low intensity exercise of long duration and high-intensity exercise of short duration. While the minimum duration of low intensity exercise required to elicit adaptation remains unknown, very brief bouts of high-intensity exercise appear to be sufficient <xref rid="pone.0098119-McRae1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Tabata1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Ma1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. From an exercise prescription perspective, exercise resulting in the largest degree of intramuscular signaling activation in the greatest amount of muscle fibres would presumably result in the greatest degree of adaptation. What remains largely unknown, however, is whether differences in fibre recruitment and the magnitude of signal activation within individual fibre-types between interval training and END exercise are obscured by whole muscle analyses. Our results demonstrate that LV-HIT and END produce similar: a) glycogen depletion across fibre types (indicative of similar fibre recruitment), b) changes in intramuscular signaling, and c) fibre-type specific increases in oxidative capacity, intramuscular glycogen and triglyceride content, whole-muscle capillary density and O<sub>2</sub>pulse. Remarkably, these results suggest that 30 minutes of END exercise at &#x0223c;65% VO<sub>2</sub>peak or 4 minutes of LV-HIT at &#x0223c;170% VO<sub>2</sub>peak induce comparable deviations of the intra-myocellular environment (glycogen content and signaling activation); correspondingly, training-induced adaptations resulting for these protocols, and other interval training and END protocols <xref rid="pone.0098119-Burgomaster1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Gibala1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, appear comparable. The one exception to this equivocality is the capacity of LV-HIT to induce greater improvements in anaerobic adaptations than END. Thus, our results suggest that the mechanisms responsible for adaptation following chronic LV-HIT and END are the same, with the supramaximal exercise intensity inherent with LV-HIT permitting their manifestation in significantly less exercise time.</p><p>Collectively, results from this study suggest that the potency of high-intensity exercise resides is its ability to activate the mechanisms that trigger the induction of exercise-induced adaptation in a drastically reduced exercise time compared to traditional END training. However, while END exercise at intensities greater than &#x0223c;65% VO<sub>2</sub>peak are of adequate intensity to elicit &#x0201c;maximal&#x0201d; fibre recruitment (i.e. type I and IIA fibres) and the manifestation of chronic adaptations, at present the minimal duration of exercise at these relatively low intensities required for comparable adaptations is not known. Our results, and others <xref rid="pone.0098119-McRae1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, suggest that 30 minutes is adequate; however, given that our assumptions regarding the minimal dose of exercise required for adaptations having been recently challenged <xref rid="pone.0098119-Tjnna1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0098119-Hazell1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>, the minimal duration of moderate intensity END required to induce adaptation is an interesting area for future research.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank a very dedicated group of volunteers without whom this study would not have been possible.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0098119-Burgomaster1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
