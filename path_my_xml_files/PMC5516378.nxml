Progesterone supplementation reduces the risk of preterm delivery in women who have a shortened cervix in the midtrimester. We propose to study the feasibility of a trial of vaginal progesterone (VP) to prevent PTB among HIV-infected women receiving ART in pregnancy. Given low adherence among women self-administering vaginal study product in recent microbicide trials, we plan to investigate whether adequate adherence to VP can be achieved prior to launching a full-scale efficacy trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and design</title><p id="Par2">One hundred forty HIV-infected pregnant women in Lusaka, Zambia, will be randomly allocated to daily self-administration of either VP or matched placebo, starting between 20 and 24 gestational weeks. The primary outcome will be adherence, defined as the proportion of participants who achieve at least 80% use of study product, assessed objectively with a validated dye stain assay that confirms vaginal insertion of returned single-use applicators. Secondary outcomes will be study uptake, retention, and preliminary efficacy. We will concurrently perform semi-structured interviews with participants enrolled in the study and with women who decline enrollment to assess the acceptability of VP to prevent PTB and of enrollment to a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">We hypothesize that VP could prevent PTB among women receiving ART in pregnancy.

Over 60% of the world&#x02019;s preterm deliveries occur in Africa and South Asia; in sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of preterm birth (PTB) approaches 20%, compared to rates below 10% in the Global North [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This disparity can be partly explained by the elevated risk of PTB faced by HIV-infected women, some 85% of whom live in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Expanded access to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed the health of mothers and can prevent most cases of vertical transmission. However, an unanticipated consequence has arisen: ART use in pregnancy appears to increase the risk of PTB even beyond that attributable to HIV infection itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Declining concentrations of circulating progesterone and reduced progesterone activity are associated with preterm labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. With supplementation, higher serum concentrations of progesterone have incremental protection against preterm labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Prenatal progesterone&#x02014;an anti-inflammatory hormone administered intramuscularly or vaginally&#x02014;can reduce the risk of PTB in women who have had a prior spontaneous PTB and in those with evidence of cervical shortening via midtrimester sonography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. HIV infection causes immune activation and inflammation, both systemically and in the lower genital tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. While suppressive ART generally improves systemic inflammation, its inconsistent effect on the lower genital tract may underlie the observed amplification of PTB risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Progesterone has been tested to reduce PTB for numerous high-risk indications, but has yet to be studied in HIV-infected women.</p><p id="Par19">Our objective is to determine whether VP prophylaxis may reduce PTB among HIV-infected women receiving ART in pregnancy. We introduce the study protocol for a pilot study investigating the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of VP among HIV-infected gravidas taking ART in Lusaka, Zambia.

In this mixed method design, we plan a pilot study in which 140 participants are randomized to either VP or placebo and a qualitative component investigating the acceptability of such a study.

Those participants who are screened during the window of randomization will be asked to return the next day for their randomization visit to allow them time to consider the risks and benefits of study participation and to discuss the study with their family. The trial will use a paper-based system of sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes to assign women 1:1 to active progesterone or placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. A statistician not otherwise associated with the study will design the scheme using random permuted blocks. All randomization documentation will be stored in a secure location. At the time of randomization, the research nurse will allocate the randomization envelopes in sequence to assign randomization identification numbers using standardized procedures. The statistician will compare the order of randomization to the original list order to verify strict order of randomization. Progesterone and placebo vaginal suppositories will be produced and individually packaged prior to being shipped to Zambia. Packaging will be non-descript and identical for the two products. Each progesterone lot and each placebo lot will have a unique identifying number produced from a random number generator that will be indexed in a secured database as either placebo or product, accessible only to the US-based compounding pharmacy and the unblinded statistician at interim analysis and end of study. Participants will be assigned randomization numbers that correspond to either an active or placebo lot number, to be dispensed by an on-site pharmacist masked as to treatment allocation.

Secondary efficacy and safety outcomes will include: (a) delivery prior to 37&#x000a0;weeks gestation; (b) delivery prior to 34&#x000a0;weeks gestation; (c) birth weight &#x0003c;2500&#x000a0;g; (d) stillbirth; and (e) adverse events. In an exploratory analysis of these outcomes, we will conduct descriptive statistics of participant demographic and clinical features and of the proportion of participants experiencing the secondary outcomes of poor obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. Although our study is not powered for clinical efficacy, we will perform unadjusted analyses to determine whether a numerical difference in risk of these secondary efficacy and safety outcomes exists between women who were randomized to VP compared to those randomized to placebo. Exploratory analyses will be stated as such and presented as pilot effect estimates with a 95% CI; such analyses will provide useful results for planning a full-scale trial.</p><p id="Par41">We will also investigate whether the use of a pre-randomization placebo run-in period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] would be valuable in a full-scale efficacy trial. Several perinatal trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] including multiple progesterone studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>] have used a placebo run-in period to select participants who are most likely to be adherent prior to randomization. For a phase III VP trial, one could imagine a 2-week run-in period, where women are provided placebo/inert study product and only those returning applicators that met a certain adherence threshold would be randomized. While we do not intend to explicitly pilot this procedure, we will simulate it by dividing the adherence dataset into the first 2&#x000a0;weeks versus the remaining weeks and evaluate whether some initial threshold adherence (e.g., missing no more than one dose) is predictive of adequate adherence over the remaining study period. This exercise will allow us to evaluate the utility of a run-in in the overall context of phase III planning, when issues such as recruitment and representativeness are also being considered. Statistical approaches for diagnostic testing, such as receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses (plot of sensitivity versus 1-specificity), will be used to inform selection of the non-adherence cut-point. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the chosen cut-point will be estimated with a corresponding 95% exact binomial CI.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Qualitative analysis plan</title><p id="Par42">Our primary qualitative objective is to identify common facilitators and barriers to trial uptake, vaginal product adherence, and retention in a clinical trial. We will first analyze data from women who decline enrollment independently from data among those who enroll. Then, findings from common baseline domains evaluated in both assessment groups will be compared to identify commonalities or discrepancies between decliners and enrollees. The longitudinal data assessed from interviews with enrolled participants will be compared across time and between those randomized to placebo versus progesterone. After translations and transcription, a team of coders with qualitative data analysis experience will use qualitative analysis software to organize the transcribed data. Transcript data will initially be organized based on the questions in the semi-structured guides. Coders will read and &#x0201c;memo&#x0201d; each transcript and compare memos to create a preliminary codebook. They will apply the codes to significant utterances, comparing their results periodically (such as every 4&#x02013;5 interviews) to assess consistency between coders in order to refine a final codebook. They will examine codes and utterances for clusters of meaning to construct themes and maps reflecting categories and relationships among codes. They will then examine the themes identified from each dataset for contrasts and overlaps between them, which may lead to reconstructions of the existing themes or the emergence of new subthemes. A summary report of the analyzed SSI data will be created which will inform the development of the following materials for the planned full-scale efficacy and safety trial: study protocol, consent forms, adherence monitoring and counseling guide, and provider training materials.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p id="Par43">Participation in all study activities will be voluntary. Each participant will provide written, informed consent prior to enrollment. The study protocol has been approved by the University of Zambia Biomedical Research Ethics Committee and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Institutional Review Board. Research staff who have contact with participants receive protection of human research participants training prior to participating in any study activities and every 2&#x000a0;years thereafter. Key research staff members complete Good Clinical Practice or Good Clinical Laboratory Practice training, as applicable.</p><p id="Par44">It is expected that this study will expose participants to minimal risks. Self-administration of VP may cause mild discomfort to participants. Side effects and serious adverse events with VP administration are very rare. At each study visit, study staff will evaluate participants for social harms and adverse events. The severity of study-related adverse events and social harms will be graded using the National Institute of Health&#x02019;s Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events. Information on adverse events or social harms that are related to the study drug and all serious adverse events will be documented on study data forms and routinely reported to the Principal Investigator or designee. If the PI, co-investigators, or their designees determine that study-related adverse events are occurring at an unexpected rate, they will assess the need for staff re-training, protocol amendment, or study cessation. All adverse events will be reported to the regulatory authorities listed above according to their individual guidelines. In the case of an emergency that would require unblinding, the statistician will disclose the allocation arm for the individual participant.</p><p id="Par45">Participation in this study also raises the risks of loss of confidentiality and discomfort with the personal nature of questions, particularly when discussing HIV infection or sexual behaviors. At each step in the study, personnel will protect participant privacy and confidentiality to minimize these risks. All laboratory specimens, administrative forms, and study data will be identified by a random study number; data analysis will be performed using datasets linked to this number only.</p><p id="Par46">Individual participants in the VP arm of the randomized trial may benefit from a reduction in PTB risk. All participants may benefit from enhanced health education and close clinical monitoring. Knowledge generated from this study has the potential to inform future clinical trials on the reduction of PTB risk among HIV-infected women, which may in turn enable policymakers worldwide to make informed decisions regarding effective interventions for the prevention of PTB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par47">The convergence of the HIV and preterm birth epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa has unveiled unanticipated consequences among women taking ART to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission. As ART coverage continues to expand in the region, the burden of neonatal mortality and lifelong complications attributable to prematurity are likely to worsen. Global funding and research has succeeded in developing new technologies that improve outcomes for the preterm infant, yet many of these interventions are not applicable to resource-constrained settings, and advances in the area of prematurity prevention have been limited. Low-cost, high-impact interventions are desperately needed to prevent preterm birth among those at highest risk for prematurity and its consequences.</p><p id="Par48">In preparation for a trial to test the effectiveness of vaginal progesterone for the prevention of preterm birth among HIV-infected women, this pilot study will allow us to estimate key parameters of trial feasibility: uptake, adherence, and retention. It will also provide insight into rates of adverse events and perhaps preliminary efficacy. Finally, it will help us develop and test study procedures. The potential knowledge gained from this research could influence health policy and potentially prevent thousands of preterm births per year in Zambia alone. If prenatal progesterone is found to reduce the risk of preterm delivery faced by the 1.5 million HIV-infected women who become pregnant each year worldwide, elimination of infant HIV infection might be achieved without paying the price in prematurity-related death and disability.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ANC</term><def><p id="Par5">Antenatal care</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ART</term><def><p id="Par6">Antiretroviral therapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p id="Par7">Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSA</term><def><p id="Par8">Dye stain assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GA</term><def><p id="Par9">Gestational age</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HIV</term><def><p id="Par10">Human immunodeficiency virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PrEP</term><def><p id="Par11">Pre-exposure HIV prophylaxis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTB</term><def><p id="Par12">Preterm birth</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p id="Par13">Randomized controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SSI</term><def><p id="Par14">Semi-structured interview</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UTH</term><def><p id="Par15">University Teaching Hospital</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VP</term><def><p id="Par16">Vaginal progesterone</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research Social &#x00026; Behavioral Science Research Core (P30A150410) for their invaluable assistance in the design of this study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par49">The clinical trial presented in this article is funded through an award from the United States National Institutes of Health (R21 HD090987-01), which supports J.S.A.S.
