They were at first divided into two groups based on treatment method (57 with surgical and 57 with non surgical) with the age range of 30-80 years old.</p><p>These patients were similarized and uniformed as per the age, gender, underline diseases, and 2, 3, 4 parts fractures. The patients with Pathologic fractures proceeds because of any reasons like metastasis, underline diseases, tumor and infection, death during surgery or in 6 months later, disable to be followed for any reason like unavailability or not referring for check up, non complete information registered by surgeon, last Humerus surgery, Humerus proximal fracture with dislocation were excluded and finally the patients in each group were divided in 3 subgroups of 19 members based on the 2, 3, 4 parts fractures. They have been analyzed with the results of surgical or nonsurgical methods of treatments [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Consort Flowchart</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-3-253-g001"/></fig><p>The cases were gathered by non-eventually methods, by this way; any patient could be considered as one of the case study as per the diagnosis and treatment intervention. Depending on the type of intervention; and each one placed in one of the first group or second group and was followed.</p><p>The first group had surgery with internal fixation with plate, suture, k-wire, tension band technique, percotaneous pining under fluoroscopy. In this method the patients were ruled under general anesthesia or local supraclavicular anesthesia after preoperational procedures, then operation has been done by 1- delto pectoral 2- deltoid splitting 3- posterior, then internal fixation was fixed, irrigation has been done and then hemovac drain was placed and layer by layer suture was done and the operation place was reformed.</p><p>The second group was under nonsurgical treatment; in this method the Humerus was splinted by sling and swath or velpeau bandage and caused the better union by bone un-movement which resulted in better union.</p><p>Since we had considered the fractures in three groups of two, three, and four-parts fractures, with using the Cochran sample size formula 114 patients were divided in two general groups of surgical or nonsurgical treatments with three subgroups of 19 patients based on 2, 3, and 4 parts fractures types. For ensuring of matching, it has been tried to choose the patients in the same range of sex and age for each group.</p><p>After completing the cases for each group the Confounding Factors were reviewed. The complications check list was completed through examination according to the schedule (6 weeks, 3 month, 6 months and one year) by a resident cooperated in the project and under the related professor supervision. Occurrence of each side effect was considered as a complication during one year of intervention.</p><p>Finally the data were gathered and analyzed in order to compare the surgical and nonsurgical treatments outcomes for Humerus proximal fracture in SPSS software (version 17), with fisher exact test, Chi-square test, independent sample T test (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>This clinical trial study has been registered in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://WWW.IRCT.IR">WWW.IRCT.IR</ext-link> with the code of IRCT 2013052313435N1.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>RESULT</title><p>The studied population was consisted of 70 females (61.4%) and 44 males (38.6%).

Finding a way with less complication for the patients is very important and memorable.</p><p>Recent studies indicated that it is not so important if Humerus fracture had a union with a little mal-alignment because the appearance and function of the arm would not be changed after union. Accepting some mal-alignment is better than some complications which may happen after surgery, the operation procedure is opening reduction and internal fixation in this method that allow the patient to move his arm and shoulder normally one day after operation.</p><p>Yuksel <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on 18 patients between 39-90 years old in 2011 revealed that the result of nonsurgical method has been better in 3-4 parts fractures in older patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Also in our study the surgical method was associated with more complications in the patients above 50 and nonsurgical one was done with more success (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p>In a study by Kayalar <italic>et al</italic>., on 18 patients between 18-89 years old revealed that the result of percotaneous pining has been better in 2-3 parts fractures in the younger patients.

Osteo necrosis is common in 3 to 4% of three-parts Humerus proximal fracture, 13-14% of four-parts of this kind of fractures and it contains a vast surface of anatomical neck of the arm. Nonunion can be resulted from high tensile fracture fragments, inadequate fixation of fracture fragments and infection, one of the other complications is mal-union which is lead to restriction of shoulder movement, also in reviewing of 64 patients in 25 months they revealed that locking plates treatment in 4 parts fractured in some cases resulted to osteo necrosis complication.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] According to the results of this study we can say that locking plate surgical method can be more applied in four parts fractures and the complications such as Limited range of motion and Joint stiffness increase with fracture parts.</p><p>The study of Brorson <italic>et al</italic>., in 2009, on 62 patients with 4 parts fractures in one year revealed that using of locking plates is one of the best fixations and the most advantageous method in improving the situation, especially Osteoporotic fractures in elders, that leading to an early movement.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>As per Kilic <italic>et al</italic>., studied in 2008 on 13 males (between 35-83 years) with 2,3 and 4 parts fracture they noticed that locking plates will lead to better union in proximal Humerus fracture.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Woo-bin <italic>et al</italic>., in 2013 evaluated 62 patients including 42 females and 20 males with 2 and 3 parts fractures (between 18-92 years old) and noticed that treatment with suture k-wire, tension band technique, and locking plates would have better quality after surgery.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] In our study we have focused on this important point that generally it was not advised to use surgical method in the elders and it is better to use nonsurgical method for them.</p><p>Esen, Yunus <italic>et al</italic>., had studied 2 part fractures of 16 cadaver arm frozen in the age group of 70-80 years in 2011 showed that due to a complication of percutaneous pining move the pin from surgery to the thorax, mediastinal and abdominal with using multiplaner fixation with Suture and k-wire, tension band technique would be used to prevent the pin from the surgical site.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Yildis <italic>et al</italic>., found in their studies in 2010 that fixation should be used with considering of the bone quality with less offensive methods.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>In some prospective studies by Fallatah <italic>et al</italic>., in 2008, it has been assumed that only 20% of proximal Humerus fractures needed to surgery and in their study on 45 patients (between 46-95 years) with acute fracture of proximal Humerus showed that the soft tissue situation and surgery technique play very important roles in amount of the pain and movement after surgery.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] We have not mentioned to this matter in our study.</p><p>Orlando <italic>et al</italic>., in 2010 studied 50 patients (between 55-93 years) with 2 parts fracture and revealed that using of locking plated has very good results in these patients.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In opposite of this study we didn&#x02019;t use the locking plated method in two parts fractures at all.</p><p>Martinez <italic>et al</italic>., found in their studies in 2009 on 58 patients with 3 -4 parts fractures that locking plates has very good results in all fractures except one case leads to mal union in 4 parts fracture.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] According to our results the most applicable method in four parts fractures is locking plate with the rare malunion complication.</p><p>Gerhard <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on 211 patients with 3 parts fracture showed that experience of surgeon is more important than choosing of the implant type in 3 parts fracture of Humerus for a better successful surgery.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In this study the physician should make the final decision about the type of surgery.</p><p>Dietmar <italic>et al</italic>., in 2011 found in their studies on 64 patients with 4 parts fractures in 25 months that locking plates would be along with some complications like infection and Osteo Necrosis.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Which is in accordance with our study.</p><p>In our study, the average age of patients with humerus proximal fracture was generally 52.94 &#x000b1;
