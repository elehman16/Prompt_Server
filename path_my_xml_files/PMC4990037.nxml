profile. We selected 156 pregnant women in their &#x02265; 37 week/s, who had cervical
dilations of &#x02265; 4 cm and with two or more contractions in 10 minutes. The pregnant
women were randomly divided into three groups at a university hospital in the
suburbs of Sao Paulo, Brazil, in order to receive either acupressure treatment, a
placebo or participate as part of a control group. The acupressure was applied on
the sanyinjiao point during the contractions for 20 minutes. Then the intensity of
the pain was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p> The averages for the pain measured using the VAS were not different for the three

is both subjective and complex involving physiological, cultural and psychosocial
aspects. Currently there are a lot of studies aimed at looking to reduce the pain in
child birth (CB) emphasizing non-medicinal treatments that are less invasive and more
humanized. These are being developed by nurses and obstetricians. </p><p>In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) various alternative methods are used to alleviate
pain mainly through acupuncture, moxibustion, acupressure and the use of herbs.
Acupressure functions in the same way as acupuncture in that it seeks to maintain the
balance of energy in the various channels that circulate in the body - called meridians
- that are connected to the specific body organs, but without the use of needles.
Specific points in the hands and fingers are stimulated (sometimes combining points) to
have the best effect in alleviating pain or in putting someone in a relaxed
state<sup>4)</sup>. </p><p>The effects of acupressure on the pain during child birth has been studied in controlled
and randomized studies (CRS) done in Asian countries<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Three acupuncture points were identified for acupressure in the CREs: the
Sanyinjiao point (SP6), the Hegu point (IG4) and the Zhiyin point (B67). The TCM theory
is that these points contain the action that effects the activity in the uterus and
which can induce the CB. Advice is also given for it to be used in cases of shoulder
dystocia and prolonged CB<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The SP6 point is believed to have the ability to control some aspects of the
reproductive organs being in the case of dystocia and prolonged CB. It is located in the
spleen-pancreas meridian, four fingers above the internal malleolus in the front part of
the tibia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>

</p><p>Although some studies have associated acupressure on the SP6 point with the reduction in
the CB pain, it is not clear if this is the case for uterine dynamics (number and
intensity of contractions), which is considered influential in dealing with pain. We did
not find Latin American studies that reproduced this technique. The purpose of this
study was to analyze the effects of acupressure on the SP6 point for the pain in child
birth for expectant mothers in public maternity units.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We undertook a controlled and randomized clinical test (based on the consort diagram)
employing the use of pragmatism. It was carried out between January and August of 2013.
The subjects were pregnant women admitted to a teaching tertiary public hospital on the
outskirts of the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The study was evaluated and approved by the
Ethics Committee on Local Research (Opinion Case Number 182.421). All of the
participants in the study agreed to take part in the tests and they signed a consent
form demonstrating that they had decided to take part based on their own free will in
accordance with the country's laws.</p><p>We included expectant mothers of different ages and states from the 37th week in where
child birth was expected any time (induced or conduced) having: dilations at &#x02265; 4 cm, two
or more contractions in 10 minutes, skin covering the whole of the SP6 bilateral point
and with a live fetus with a cephalic vertex and in good condition. Those with the
following were excluded: serious preeclampsia, placenta previa, immediate indication of
cesarean, dilations at &#x02265; 8 cm and those that used analgesics for less than six hours
from the study admission time.</p><p>The size of the sample was estimated through considering the proposed calculation method
for the non-paired<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref> t test. We looked at the percentage differences in the pain using the Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) before and after the treatment in the three studies<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. For the calculations, we adopted a level of significance equal to 5% and a
power of 80%, except for studies that also showed results after 60 minutes. In these
cases the <italic>Bonferroni</italic> correction was applied at a significant level of
2.5%. The calculations for the sample resulted in the testing of 51 individuals per
group which was the biggest size for the test that was calculated amongst the studies,
totaling 153 participants.</p><p>The pregnant women in labor were allocated through a sequential list of random numbers
in blocks of six patients generated using the program Excel(r) and they were distributed
in three groups: acupressure (SP6), touch group (TG)/placebo and the control group (CG).
The study used the single-blind method (participants in the SP6 and TG groups did not
know what group they were in). This was not possible for the CG owning to the actual
nature of the study. All of those that were questioned, were identified with a number
and their groups were given a letter ensuring that no one could identify each other's
group for statistical analysis.</p><p>For conducting evaluations on the pain we opted for the VAS model which is a rising
scale from 0 10, 0 meaning no pain to 10 which is the worst pain felt. The patients
registered their pain using a picture of a grimacing face and writing down a number next
to it. The VAS was used and reused immediately after the treatment (VAS20) and 60
minutes after the treatment, once consent had been given by the pregnant women in labor
to participate in the study. </p><p>Information in relation to the use of medication and anesthesia was registered in
accordance with the relevant procedures and were checked by a team of professionals at
the institution. They looked at inpatient records, forms containing the use of
anesthesia, partograms and medical prescriptions. The professionals at the units that
managed the use of the medications did not know which group each individual belonged to
and the researcher had no influence over the prescriptions nor were they manipulated in
anyway.</p><p>The SP6 group with the pregnant women in labor received deep pressure (&#x000b1; 5kg) with fast
decompression applied to their thumbs which did not bring about any discomfort. The TG
group received a superficial touch that was of very low intensity (&#x000b1; 100g)<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>. In both groups the contact was at the SP6 bilateral point, during the
contractions, in one period of 20 minutes.</p><p>The researcher that was responsible for applying the acupressure went through 32 hours'
worth of training. A child-cushioned electronic anthropometric scale was used to control
and to put consistent pressure on the thumps until the researcher could apply such
pressure for the SP6 and TG groups.</p><p>The pregnant women in labor obtained normal obstetrical treatment. Where the study was
carried out, the following was permitted: the presence of someone to accompany the
pregnant lady, the use of methods other than drugs such as taking a shower, massages in
the lower back region and breathing exercises as well as liberty of movement (in cases
where this did not go against medical advice). </p><p>All of the pregnant women in labor where encouraged during the CB to breath in and out
deeply in the direction of the thorax during the contractions and the intervals in orde
for their bodies to be totally relaxed (slow thorax-abdomen breathing rhythm)<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>A questionnaire was developed to obtain sociodemographical and clinical data. The
content was analyzed in relation to its validity by five experienced analysts who had
experience in obstetrics and/or in TCM. No alterations were necessary as it was
pre-tested on pregnant women in labor. </p><p>The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to make comparisons between the groups in relation to
quantitative variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used in cases where significant
differences were found for multiple comparisons. The Chi-squared test was used in
relation to the association between groups and variables categories. The Exact Fisher
test was used in cases where there were at least 20% of the expected values being less
than five. The Friedman test was used for each group in relation to comparisons between
the three evaluation periods in the VAS.</p><p> Bonferroni correction was used for the variables where the comparisons between the
groups and those that were measured took place in one evaluation period. This divided
the significant level by the number of comparisons. The significant level of 1.67% was
adopted where the variable was measured in three periods and we compared the groups at
every stage. In relation to the VAS variable, aside from comparing the groups at every
period we also measured the periods for every group. With this we adopted the
significant level of 0.83% for this variable. Lastly for the multiple comparisons, the
significant level was corrected, following the same criteria. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>156 pregnant women in labor were used in this study and they were distributed equally in

</p><p>There were statistical differences (p&#x0003c;0.0001, Fridman test) in the VAS values for
each group for the three times when the evaluations were done. This came about due to
the rise in the TG and CG averages in relation to their being presented before the
treatment. This was not the case of the SP6 group whose values were reduced after the
acupressure. When the groups are compared (in in accordance with the Mann-Whitney test)
the difference can be seen immediately, with 60 minutes of treatment between the SP6
group in relation to the TG and CG groups (p&#x0003c;0.0001). There were no significant
differences in the two moments that were analyzed (p=0.0551 for 20 minutes and p=0.1287
for 60 minutes). </p><p>In relation to intravenous analgesics or those that were intra-musculary administered
during the CB, the number was small due to their use being discouraged in obstetric
wards. The medications used were either: dipyrone 1gr, meperidine 50mg or tramadol 50
mg. They were used on two women in the TG, two in the CG and only one in the SP6 group. </p><p>The analgesia epidural or the spinal anesthesia were available for women depending on
their need. Their use was as follows: 69.23% in the SP6 group (n 36) and 79.92% (n 40)
in the other groups (Chi-squared test, p=0.5840). Cervical dilations were registered
when the anesthesia was applied. The anesthesia was chosen by the team of anesthetists.
There were no differences in the groups (p=0.6650, Kruskal-Wallis test) showing a median
of 6 cm for those in the SP6 group and 5 cm for those in the CG.</p><p>There were no differences between the averages in the first (p=0.9542) and fifth minute
of life for the newly born babies when we used the Apgar score (SP6 9.62 verses TG 9.54
verses TG 9.29, p=0.7218). Therefore this indicator was not changed for this type of
treatment for all the groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>At the admission of the pregnant women in this study before the start of the treatment,
there was a difference in the number pregnancies. However, this did not affect the other
variables which can be considered influences on their responses to the pain. These
variables included: parity, the integrity of the amniotic membrane, the cervical
dilations and the number and intensity of the contractions. We noted during the
treatment fewer contractions in the TG group in relation to the SP6 and CG group that
received the acupressure.</p><p>Through an evaluation of the pain we saw a significant reduction in the group that
received acupressure in the SP6 point in comparison with the TG and CG groups. The
average for the VAS was less in the two evaluations after the treatment in the SP6
group. This data is similar to the previous CRS<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

<sup>)</sup> that evaluated the point. There was a study where acupressure was applied
for 30 minutes during contractions and for 20 minutes. It was applied on the SP6 point
and for another group on the IG4 point. There were no differences for the VAS in the SP6
and IG4 groups, but there were differences when compared to the CG which was 8 cm in
dilations. When the dilations were complete, we did not see any differences. This was
noted at the CRS in South Korea where the dilations were between 9 and 10 cm. The points
were close for the CG.</p><p>The other three CRS<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> evaluated the SP6 point on pain. The VAS score was not subsequently inferior to
the base values. Its rise, however, was greater for the women with the placebo. These
studies did not include a third group. Pain in the CB is gradual. Also the fact that the
pain did not get worse shows the effectiveness of the care given.</p><p>The participants in the TG showed, on average, a lower rise in the VAS even though on
the whole there were no significant differences. This may be due to the superficial
touch on the SP6 bilateral point which is a common practice for palpation points and
body energy points that stimulates the flux of energy<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>. Continuous support for pregnant women in labor can reduce complaints of birth
pains, favoring the development of the CB as note in a revision of Cochrane<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>. </p><p>The effect of acupressure on pain is not entirely clear physically and biochemically
speaking. An explanation based on TCM called the "G<italic>ate-control theory of
pain"</italic> was given in 1965 which talks about cutaneous tactile stimulation used
to alleviate pain<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>. The theory states that acupressure activates mechanoreceptors that provoke the
thick fibers (A-alfa and A-beta) and which direct them to shut the door whilst the fine
fibers (A-delta and C) direct the others to open them. This open and closing of doors
represents the transmission or not of the the pain along the nerves depending on the
intensity of the pressure. This then stops the transmission of the pain to the
spine<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>. Some authors suggest deep massages in the seven acupuncture points during
contractions and light massages in the lumbar region in the intervals in order to
activate the thick fibers (closing the door). This will inhibit the pain and reduce
discomfort for the lady that receives the treatment<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">

also noted this in other previous studies<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> whilst in other studies the analgesics were not mentioned or it was not clear if
they had been used. In the three groups for the CRS, the analgesia epidural and its
related combination analgesia was used a lot. There were less of these resources for the
SP6, TG and CG groups, however the statistical analysis did not show any differences. If
we consider and accept the reduction in score for the pain in the first 20 minutes, the
replication of the treatment during the CB could slow or reduce the use of analgesia or
other forms of early interventions allowing for a natural child birth.</p><p>There were no alterations in the Apgar scores between neonate women that received
acupressure in the SP6 point compared to the other participants. Thus there were no
adverse effects on the neonate women that received this intervention which corroborated
with the CRS<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> where the variable was evaluated.</p><p>A limitation of this study was the use of the single-blind method due to the lack of an
external evaluator after the treatment. Note that this in itself did not influence or
have any bearing on the responses to the variables studied. Another limitation for was
the use of manual palpation to assess the intensity of the contractions. The idea was
not to use an invasive method that could result in discomfort for the women. The third
limitation was the use of a university hospital which was hospital renowned for treating
high risk pregnancies. This may have contributed to the high rates of medical
interventions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results show that the use of acupressure on the SP6 point is a complementary method
that is non-invasive and can alleviate pain during childbirth, without presenting any
adverse effects for pregnant women in labor and neonate women.</p><p>Acupressure is a useful way to alleviate pain and it can be easily be put into practice
in medical institutions with a view to improving the quality of care given to pregnant
women in labor who would like a natural birth. However the effect of the treatment in
the reduction of pain is small, which suggests that acupressure may be more effective
where there are cervical dilations up to 8 cm and there is cephalic presentation. </p><p>Acupressure is an alternative for women that prefer to use methods that do not involve
drugs and side effects which is often the case for medical practitioners in
obstetrics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn1"><label>1</label><p>Paper extrated from Master's Thesis "Acupressure for pain relief in women in labor: a
