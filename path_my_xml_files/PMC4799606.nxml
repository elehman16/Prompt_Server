This prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind study were conducted in the pediatric surgical operation theater in our institute between August 2014 and December 2014, and total 100 children of either sex with American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA) physical status I and II, aged 1-12 years, weighing 5-30 kg were scheduled for elective infraumblical surgeries under general anesthesia. Patients are having a local infection at the caudal site, neurological disorder, the history of allergic reaction to local anesthetics, sacral/vertebral abnormalities, and bleeding diathesis were excluded from the study. An intravenous access was secured, and glycopyrrolate injection (0.004 mg/kg) and ondansetron injection (0.15 mg/kg) were administered. Standard monitoring including an electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement, pulse oximetry, capnography, and temperature were applied. All patients were induced with either inhalational agent sevoflurane (1-6%) with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen or intravenous thiopental in a dose of 5-6 mg/kg. In the left lateral position, caudal block was performed using 22-gauge epidural needle under complete aseptic precaution. After confirmation and negative aspiration for blood and cerebrospinal fluid, the study drugs were introduced into the caudal space slowly with continuous ECG monitoring. The patients included were randomized before induction of anesthesia using computer generated randomization numbers into two equal groups: Group BT received 1 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2 mg/kg of tramadol in normal saline and Group BF received 1 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2 &#x003bc;g/kg of fentanyl in normal saline with maximum volume of 12 ml in both the groups. The anesthesiologist performing the caudal block was blinded to the identity of the drug used.</p><p>The patients were repositioned supine. To facilitate insertion of an I-gel or endotracheal tube, intravenous succinylcholine 2 mg/kg was given. Intraoperatively, no analgesic was supplemented. Anesthesia was maintained with assisted ventilation using sevoflurane initially with 2% and then after decreasing up to 0.6% with hemodynamic stability or controlled ventilation using injection atracurium (0.5 mg/kg) with 50% nitrous oxide in oxygen and sevoflurane decreases up to 0.6% with hemodynamic stability. Glucose/saline solution was infused as per requirement, and perioperative blood loss was replaced as per requirement.</p><p>During surgery, adequate analgesia was assessed by hemodynamic stability, as indicated an increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure of no more than 15% compared with baseline values obtained just before the surgical incision with decreased requirement of sevoflurane concentration, at approximately 0.6%. An increase in heart rate and systolic blood pressure within 20 min of skin incision indicated failure of caudal anesthesia.</p><p>At the end of surgery, the residual neuromuscular block was antagonized with glycopyrrolate injection 0.008 mg/kg and neostigmine injection 0.05 mg/kg intravenously.</p><p>Intraoperatively required concentration of sevoflurane was recorded at every 15 min. Heart rate, NIBP, SpO<sub>2</sub>, EtCO<sub>2</sub>, and temperature were recorded at every 15 min interval till the end of surgery and every hourly interval postoperatively till rescue analgesic was given.</p><p>Duration of surgery, duration of anesthesia, and perioperative complications such as brady/tachycardia, hypo/hypertension, vomiting, and urinary retention were recorded.</p><p>In the recovery room, hemodynamic parameters, sedation, and pain score were recorded at hourly interval till rescue analgesic was given. Postoperative sedation was assessed by using four point sedation score (0 - spontaneous eye opening, 1 - eye open on speech, 2 - eye open on shake, 3 - unarousable), and pain was evaluated by using FLACC (F = Face, L = Leg, A = Activity, C = Cry, C = Consolability), score (maximum score of 10) at 1 h interval for first 3 h and thereafter every 2 h interval till score &#x0003e;4, and rescue analgesic was given.

A caudal block is one of the common regional anesthetic techniques used in pediatric age group undergoing infraumbilical surgery.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It is generally considered a simple, safe procedure with more reliability, and predictability of the cephalic spread of local anesthetic solution in children than in adults. It produces minimal hemodynamic changes and provides some pain-free period intraoperatively and postoperatively in infraumbilical surgeries in children.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Analgesic effect of caudal bupivacaine terminates early, and supplementary analgesics are required in the postoperative period. Various adjuvant drugs such as ketamine, midazolam, tramadol, fentanyl, clonidine, dexmedetomidine have been used to prolong the duration of analgesia for the caudal block.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>In our study, single shot caudal epidural using 1 ml/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine with 2 mg/kg tramadol or 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl with a maximum volume of 12 ml were given.</p><p>Tramadol is a racemic mixture of two enantiomers. The (+) enantiomer has moderate affinity for the opioid &#x003bc; receptor, which is greater than that of the (&#x02212;) enantiomer. In addition, the (+) enantiomer inhibits serotonin reuptake, and the (&#x02212;) enantiomer is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. These complementary properties result in a synergistic antinociceptive interaction between the two. The resulting opioid has a striking lack of respiratory depressant effect despite having analgesic potency approximately equal to that of pethidine.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid agonist. It exerts its analgesic action by binding to mu receptor, as well as to kappa and delta receptors within the spinal cord, producing spinal analgesia. It easily crosses the lumbar dura and penetrates quickly the lipid phase of the underlying tissue of the cord with minimal migration of opioids in rostral direction, hence, avoiding central nervous system depression of respiratory and cardiovascular system.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Caudal bupivacaine with tramadol 1 mg/kg provides prolonged, and good quality postoperative analgesia compared to plain bupivacaine in children.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Caudal tramadol 2 mg/kg with 0.5 mg/kg of 0.25% bupivacaine provided longer duration of postoperative analgesia up to 16 or 18 h without having significant side effects but with higher sedation score for 1 h postoperatively.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Similarly in our study, the duration of postoperative analgesia was more than 10 h up to 18 h without significant side effects in caudal bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml/kg with tramadol 2 mg/kg.</p><p>Greater epidural use of tramadol 2 mg/kg may be preferred to morphine 0.1 mg/kg for postoperative analgesia in children undergoing urological surgery without any significant side effects.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Caudal tramadol 2 mg/kg combined with bupivacaine 0.25% 0.75 ml/kg provided longer duration of postoperative analgesia and reduced requirement for rescue analgesic compared with tramadol 1 mg/kg or 1.5 mg/kg in children undergoing inguinal herniotomy.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>El Hamamsy <italic>et al</italic>. observed analgesia for up to 4.5 and 5 h with caudal fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and tramadol 2 mg/kg, respectively.

They also observed that if the period of time between performing the caudal injection and recovery of the child from anesthesia was &#x0003c;2 h, the incidence of immediate pain (requiring rescue analgesia) was high (30%), demonstrating a slow onset of action of caudal tramadol. However, with a longer duration surgery, caudal tramadol produced good quality analgesia for an average of 10.7 h. The slow onset of action of caudal tramadol may imply that there is little advantage in injecting tramadol into the extradural space. Bupivacaine tramadol may prove more useful in young children and infants than other opioids because of its lack of respiratory depressant effects. A bupivacaine-fentanyl mixture as a single caudal epidural injection does not change the onset, quality and duration of analgesia, and sedation score.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>We observed analgesia for up to 11 h and 18 h with caudal fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg and tramadol 2 mg/kg, respectively.
