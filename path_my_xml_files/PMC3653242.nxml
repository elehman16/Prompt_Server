Heart rate recovery (HRR) is a strong predictor of mortality in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of 8 weeks of supervised exercise training on autonomic function, which were assessed by heart rate, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and rate-pressure product (RPP) in CHF patients.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>METHODS</title><p>65 patients aged 57-82 years with CHF were assigned to two groups randomly. The first group received a supervised 8-week aerobic training program of 30-45 min sessions, 3 days per week on alternate days, while controls received standard medical care and were followed up. Body weight, body mass index, functional capacity, resting heart rate, HRR, resting systolic blood pressure, peak heart rate, peak systolic blood pressure, and RPP were measured before and after the study period. Medications and diet recommendations remained unchanged in both groups during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The exercise group consisted of 33 patients with mean age of 61.54 &#x000b1; 5.89 years and the controls were 32 patients with mean age of 60.94 &#x000b1; 5.03 years. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures revealed a statistically significant difference in the exercise group compared to the control group regarding body mass index, resting heart rate, heart rate recover, functional capacity, peak heart rate, peak systolic blood pressure, peak RPP after 8 weeks (P &#x02264; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, a multidisciplinary CR program with supervised exercise training support significantly improves functional capacity and autonomic function in CHF patients.

Patients should be referred by a cardiologist. The exclusion criteria included NYHA FC, acute myocardial infarction, or revascularization within the past 4 months, hypotension, unstable angina, ventricular or symptomatic arrhythmias, obstructive aortic valve disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, severe musculoskeletal problems preventing exercise, and case-note reported dementia or current severe psychiatric disorder.</p><p>Sixty-five male and female patients with CHF agreed to participate in the study. They were assigned randomly to two groups of exercise (n = 33) and control (n = 32). Participants signed a written informed consent after being informed of the details of the study.</p><p>There was no alteration in the prescribed medications and diet in both groups throughout the study. All subjects underwent comprehensive medical screening prior to participation, including medical history, physical examination, and stress testing. The patients did not participate in an exercise program for at least 3 months prior to the study; they were instructed to avoid any extra exercise not included in the study training program.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><p>All patients followed a familiarization training period of 2 weeks. Thereafter, each patient underwent anthropometric evaluation, physiological evaluation, and exercise stress testing using the Naughton protocol. Afterwards, they participated in a supervised and systematic exercise program of aerobic training three times per week for 8 weeks. The training program was arranged to provide an alternative day for the replacement of a possible lost session during the week. The baseline assessment was repeated after 8 weeks of training.</p></sec><sec><title>Aerobic training program</title><p>Aerobic exercise consisted of walking/jogging on the treadmill three times per week. Each session lasted about 45-60 min including a warm-up period (5-10 min), stretching exercises (10 min), the main program with treadmill exercise (15-30 min), and a cool-down period (15 min including stretching). During the first 4 weeks, the intensity of aerobic exercise was 60-70% of maximum heart rate (HRmax) achieved during stress testing. Thereafter, training intensity was increased to 70-80% HRmax according to the individual adaptation observed during training sessions.</p></sec><sec><title>Testing procedures</title><p>
<bold>Demographic measures and medical history</bold>
</p><p>A detailed medical history was obtained from each participant. The medical history addressed all of the aforementioned exclusion criteria, as well as history of hyperlipidemia, dyspnea, diabetes hypertension or other symptoms of CHF.</p><p>Height was measured using a stadiometer, with the measurement taken to the nearest 0.1 cm. Weight was measured using a balance scale, with the measurement taken to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height and weight measurements were then used to calculate body mass index (BMI); BMI = (weight in kilograms)/(height in meters2). Waist-to-hip ratio was measured with a measuring tape, with a horizontal measure at both the waist and hip sites, taken to the nearest 0.1 cm. Blood pressure and heart rate were measured with a sphygmomanometer following 30 minutes of rest.</p></sec><sec><title>Exercise stress testing</title><p>All patients underwent a symptom-limited exercise test on the treadmill with electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring according to the modified Naughton protocol. The Naughton protocol is a submaximal study which is used for high-risk patients. It uses 10 3-min exercise periods. The modified Naughton protocol has 2-min stages and starts at a lower metabolic equivalent (MET) workload increasing by patients stop because of either fatigue or dyspnea. It contains a 4-min warm-up and a set speed of 2.0 miles per hour (mph). The grade increases 3.5% every 2 min until maximum effort is achieved. This approach allows for a better tolerated gradual progression in exercise. Moreover, it is a more accurate assessment of functional capacity. During aerobic exercise sessions in these patients, exertion levels are often evaluated by the Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion Scale, because the rate of perceived exertion and heart rate (HR) are linearly concerned with each other and work intensity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-ARYA-09-150">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25-ARYA-09-150">25</xref></p><p>Resting HR and peak HR were measured using a 12-lead electrocardiograph with an automatic ST-segment analysis, while blood pressure was recorded manually at rest and then at 3-min intervals during the stress test.</p><p>Peak HR was considered the highest mean 10-s value achieved during the test. Blood pressure was measured with a mercury sphygmomanometer at rest, during the last 15 seconds of exercise near the end of the test. Peak systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded as the highest value achieved during the test. PRR product was computed by multiplying peak HR by peak systolic blood pressure.

Finally, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures was performed on cardiorespiratory fitness and hemodynamic variables to determine differences between the two groups after 8 weeks.

To define the effect of exercise training per se, other important variables were controlled such as medications use and diet. The main finding of our investigation is that cardiac rehabilitation independently improves cardiac autonomic function.</p><p>In this study, we found that an 8 week aerobic exercise program improved resting heart rate, heart rate recovery, resting systolic blood pressure, peak functional capacity, peak heart rate, and RPP significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.05). While the body weight, body mass index, and resting diastolic blood pressure in the exercise group did not show any significant changes.

Following the rehabilitation program in the present study, all factors in the training group had a significant improvement.</p><p>These positive effects on the autonomic nervous system suggested that the results of the current study are supported by decreasing RPP, maximal and resting heart rates, and blood pressure (systolic, mean, and diastolic) observed in the exercise-training group.</p><p>In healthy subjects and athletes, heart rate rapidly decreased after exercise. However, during exercise due to the withdrawal of parasympathetic tone and increased sympathetic tone, heart rate increases. Immediately after exercise, heart rate decreases due to rapid reactivation of the parasympathetic nervous system. The ability of the heart rate to recover after exercise is related to the capacity of the cardiovascular system to inverse the autonomic nervous system and baroreceptors adaptation, which is often called vagal reactivation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-ARYA-09-150">26</xref></p><p>A study by Wu TY et al. (2007) showed that both systolic and diastolic blood pressures at rest and after 8 weeks of exercise were significantly decreased in the training group. However, changes in blood pressure were not significantly different between the training and control groups.
