Antigenic and phylogenetic analyses of A(H5N1) viruses reported by the World Health Organization in February 2009 indicated that multiple clade 2 subclades were responsible for the majority of human cases since the reemergence of avian-origin influenza in 2003 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>].</p><p>Adjuvanted inactivated split-virion influenza vaccines containing the avian-origin H5N1 hemagglutinin antigen (HA) have been shown to be highly immunogenic and well tolerated in children and adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]. Reduction in the amount of antigen needed per dose, which is paramount to meet demand for vaccine during a pandemic, was achieved by formulation with an Adjuvant System (AS03) containing &#x003b1;-tocopherol and squalene in an oil-in-water emulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. The AS03 Adjuvant System enhances the immune response by triggering the transient production of cytokines at the injection site and in the lymph nodes and by promoting antigen presentation by mononuclear phagocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>]. While experience during the swine-origin H1N1 pandemic demonstrated that a single 3.75 &#x003bc;g HA dose of AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted vaccine was sufficiently immunogenic in adults and children, data concerning AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted avian-origin H5N1 vaccines have repeatedly shown that two 3.75 &#x003bc;g doses of HA (A/Vietnam/119/2004 or A/Indonesia/05/2005) were needed to fulfill immunogenicity licensure criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>]. In this phase III, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study, we assessed the immunogenicity, safety, and lot-to-lot consistency of an AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted A/Indonesia/05/2005 (clade 2.1) influenza vaccine in adults aged 18&#x02013;64 years and in adults aged &#x02265;65 years.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This was a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded study conducted in North America. The objective was to assess the immunogenicity and safety of 2 doses of an AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 A/Indonesia/05/2005 influenza vaccine in adults aged &#x02265;18 years. The equivalence of immunogenicity between 3 different lots of antigen combined with 3 lots of adjuvant was also examined.</p><p>Eligible participants were healthy or had controlled chronic illness. Women of child-bearing age were not pregnant and agreed to use reliable methods of contraception. All participants provided informed written consent. The protocol was approved by research ethics boards or local or central institutional review boards and was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, the Declaration of Helsinki, the US Code of Federal Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects, the Canadian TriCouncil Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and all relevant Canadian and US regulations.</p></sec><sec><title>Vaccines and Schedule</title><p>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals manufactured the H5N1 vaccine antigen in Ste-Foy, Quebec, Canada. Each dose contained 3.75 &#x003bc;g HA of A/Indonesia/05/2005 (IBCDC-RG2; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). The adjuvant (AS03<sub>A</sub>) was a 10% (by volume) DL-&#x003b1;-tocopherol&#x02013;based oil-in-water emulsion. The placebo control was phosphate-buffered saline.</p><p>A randomization list was generated by GSK Biologicals using a blocking scheme. Participants were randomized 3:1 to receive vaccine or placebo, and vaccine recipients were further randomized 1:1:1 to receive 1 of 3 lots. A minimization algorithm was used to balance the randomization by site and age strata (18&#x02013;30, 31&#x02013;49, 50&#x02013;64, 65&#x02013;74, and &#x02265;75 years).</p><p>Participants received 1 dose of vaccine or placebo intramuscularly on day 0 (deltoid, nondominant arm) and a second dose on day 21 (deltoid, dominant arm). The test articles were prepared and administered by unblinded staff who took no further part in the study. Vaccine and placebo injections were administered in overwrapped syringes to obscure contents to other study staff and participants. Participants attended study sites for screening (days &#x02013;21 to 0) and on days 0 (dose 1), 21 (dose 2), 42, and 182. Telephone interviews were conducted on day 84. A site visit or telephone interview was conducted on day 364.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunogenicity Assessments</title><p>Immunogenicity outcome measures were hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers and microneutralizing (MN) antibody titers. The coprimary immunogenicity objectives were (1) to evaluate vaccine-homologous HAI responses in both age strata for fulfillment of US Food and Drug Administration Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research (CBER) licensure criteria for the accelerated approval of pandemic influenza vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>], and (2) to test the equivalence of vaccine-homologous HAI geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 3 consecutive vaccine lots in participants aged 18&#x02013;49 years at day 42. Secondary endpoints included HAI responses at day 182 and in participants aged 18&#x02013;60 and &#x02265;61 years (European Union Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use [CHMP] age strata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>]) and in participants aged &#x02265;75 years, and day 42 MN antibody responses against A/Indonesia/05/2005 and clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004.</p><p>HAI responses were measured using an established assay method modified for horse rather than avian erythrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>], and MN assays were performed according to previously described methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>]. All serum samples were tested in duplicate by blinded personnel. The 50% neutralization titers were calculated using the Reed and Muench method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>].</p><p>The HAI endpoints were seroconversion rate, defined as the percentage of participants who had pre- and postvaccination titers of &#x0003c;1:10 and &#x02265;1:40, respectively, or showed a significant increase in antibody titer (a prevaccination titer of &#x02265;1:10 and &#x02265;4-fold increase in postvaccination titer); and seroprotection rate, defined as the percentage of participants with titers of &#x02265;1:40. All values were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). CBER licensure criteria require the lower limits of the 95% CIs for seroconversion rate to be &#x02265;40% and &#x02265;30% for participants aged 18&#x02013;64 and &#x02265;65 years, respectively, and for seroprotection rate to be &#x02265;70% and &#x02265;60% for participants aged 18&#x02013;64 and &#x02265;65 years, respectively.</p><p>For the analysis of CHMP criteria, point estimates of the seroconversion rate needed to be &#x0003e;40% and &#x0003e;30% for participants aged 18&#x02013;60 and &#x02265;61 years, respectively, and the seroprotection rate needed to be &#x0003e;70% and &#x0003e;60% for subjects aged 18&#x02013;60 and &#x02265;61 years, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>]. The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) was defined as the geometric mean of the within-subject ratios of pre- and postvaccination reciprocal HAI titers. GMFRs of &#x0003e;2.5 and &#x0003e;2.0 were required in the 18&#x02013;60 and &#x02265;61-year-old age groups, respectively, to fulfill the CHMP licensure criterion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>].</p><p>For the 3 H5N1 vaccine lots, group GMT ratios were calculated using an analysis of covariance model; vaccine lots were considered equivalent if the 2-sided 95% CIs for all of the GMT ratios were between 0.67 and 1.5.</p><p>MN assays were performed on a subgroup of subjects selected at randomization and exploratory analyses presented descriptively. Participants with an antibody titer of &#x0003c;1:28 were considered seronegative. The MN vaccine response rate was defined as the percentage of participants achieving &#x02265;4-fold increase in titer relative to the prevaccination titer. MN GMTs were described, and 95% CIs presented for all values.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety Assessments</title><p>The coprimary safety objectives were to describe solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs). Solicited local and general symptoms were recorded by participants using diary cards for 7 days after each dose and graded using a standard scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>]. Solicited local events were presumed to be vaccine related; investigators provided causality assessments for solicited general events. Assessments of lymph node enlargement and tenderness were conducted using standard grading definitions at baseline and days 21 and 42. In addition, the following were assessed prospectively: all reports of spontaneously offered AEs (termed <italic>unsolicited AEs</italic>) from day 0 to day 84, and serious AEs, medically attended events, and adverse events of special interest/potentially immune-mediated disorders (AESIs/pIMDs) from day 0 to day 364 (visit window day 349 to day 379). All AEs were coded by preferred term and primary system organ class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>]. A protocol amendment (8 July 2008) required participants to give additional informed written consent at the day 364 safety assessment. On 20 October 2008, in response to a request from CBER, the list of AESI/pIMDs included in the analysis plan was extended.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>The target sample size was 4400 subjects, 3300 receiving H5N1 vaccine and 1100 receiving placebo. Sample size calculations to support the primary hypothesis tests indicated that there would be 90% power to meet the coprimary objectives if a total of 1569 participants aged 18&#x02013;64 years, 399 participants aged &#x02265;65 years, and 399 participants aged 18&#x02013;49 years in each vaccine lot had evaluable results, and a subset of subjects preselected at randomization were tested by HAI to provide these numbers (assuming &#x02264;5% attrition).</p><p>The primary safety analyses were performed on the total vaccinated cohort, including subjects who received &#x02265;1 dose of vaccine or placebo for whom any postvaccination data were available. The immunogenicity analysis was performed on the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort, including subjects with complete data for the primary immunogenicity endpoints and not fulfilling any elimination criterion. The lot-to-lot vaccine equivalence analysis was performed on participants aged18&#x02013;49 years in the according-to-protocol immunogenicity cohort who received H5N1 vaccine. The descriptive MN antibody analysis was performed on a randomly selected subset of H5N1 vaccine recipients.</p><p>Solicited AEs were tabulated per subject, including severity scores and duration of symptoms. Unsolicited AEs were coded by preferred term and primary system organ class using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>].

The majority of participants in all age strata retained A/Indonesia/05/2005 HAI titers of &#x02265;1:40 at 6 months. In addition, the immunogenic consistency of 3 consecutive lots of antigen, combined with 3 consecutive lots of adjuvant, was revealed by adjusted GMT ratios at day 42. These observations validate the selection of an AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted formulation previously based on phase I/II data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>].</p><p>In addition to developing antigen-sparing pandemic vaccines, it has been suggested that national pandemic and prepandemic planning incorporate vaccination strategies whereby a population is primed with stockpiled avian influenza vaccine, then subsequently vaccinated with a pandemic vaccine matched to the emergent influenza strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>]. Such a strategy would require vaccines that induce cross-reactivity against drift variant viruses, since influenza viruses can evolve into phylogenetically and antigenically distinct clades, and stockpiled vaccine might not exactly match the eventual pandemic strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>]. Protective cross-reactive responses have been demonstrated in preclinical studies in which ferrets that received AS03-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine subsequently survived a lethal vaccine-heterologous challenge with A/Indonesia/05/2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>], and clinical studies have shown that a 2-dose series of AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted A/Vietnam/1194/2004 vaccine elicits cross-reactive immune responses against clade 2 strains when doses are given 21 days apart, and 6 or 12 months apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>]. This study provides additional evidence of cross-reactive MN immune responses against clade 1 A/Vietnam/1194/2004 following administration of AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted A/Indonesia/05/2005 vaccine.</p><p>None of the 18&#x02013;64-year-old group and 0.3% of the &#x02265;65-year-old group had HAI antibody titers of &#x0003e;1:10 against the vaccine strain at baseline. However, &#x0003e;70% of participants aged &#x02265;65 years were seropositive for MN antibodies against the vaccine-homologous and/or drift-variant strain before vaccination, including 11 of 12 participants aged &#x02265;75 years who were seropositive for A/Vietnam/1194/2004. This phenomenon has been observed in previous studies, and it is thought that elderly people with prolonged natural exposure to seasonal influenza viruses and/or multiple lifetime vaccinations may develop antibodies with antigenic cross-reactivity with H5N1 strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>].</p><p>Previous exposure to seasonal influenza vaccination has been reported to reduce immune responses to subsequent pandemic influenza vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>]. Recent experience with AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine showed that although licensure criteria for immunogenicity against the vaccine strain were consistently fulfilled, postvaccination antibody titers were lower in subjects who had recently received trivalent seasonal influenza vaccination, compared with those who had not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>]. The influence of preexisting antibody levels, previous influenza vaccination, or intercurrent seasonal influenza on immune responses to pandemic influenza vaccine was beyond the scope of this study. The substantial immune responses in both age strata suggest that preexisting cross-reactive antibody does not have a dominating impact on immunogenicity to AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine that would impede its general use to address an advancing pandemic. While we cannot evaluate the possibility that intercurrent seasonal influenza might have negatively influenced immune responses in some subjects, the virtual absence of antibody increases in the concurrent placebo group suggests that intercurrent seasonal influenza infections did not inflate our estimates of vaccine immunogenicity. Moreover, although elderly people are noted to have reduced seroconversion to influenza vaccines, all immunogenicity criteria were met for older persons in this study, albeit with lower GMTs than achieved in younger adults.</p><p>The acceptability of vaccine programs, even in the absence of severe or substantial AEs, must be considered in the development of new vaccines. The incidences of injection site pain, muscle aches, headache, and fatigue were higher among H5N1 vaccine recipients than among placebo recipients, although about 20% of placebo recipients also reported these AEs. The duration of these transient reactions was typically 2&#x02013;3 days, and grade 3 reactions were uncommon; adherence to second doses was &#x02265;95%. Rates of all unsolicited AEs, objectively assessed enlargement of the axillary and/or supraclavicular nodes, and symptomatic lymphadenopathy did not differ meaningfully between treatment groups. Nine participants discontinued participation because of an AE, and these were balanced between the H5N1 vaccine and placebo groups. Serious AEs were uncommon, occurring in 4% and 3.2% of placebo and H5N1 vaccine recipients, respectively. Thirty percent of participants in each group experienced at least 1 medically attended event.</p><p>Twelve H5N1 vaccine recipients and 1 placebo recipient had 1 of a heterogenous group of AESI/pIMDs, with 1 subject in the H5N1 vaccine group reporting both polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis. The disease process predated receipt of the vaccine or had a potential alternative etiology in at least one-third of participants. The overall rate of AESI/pIMDs was &#x0003c;0.3%, and this clinical trial did not have sufficient power to evaluate any potential association of these rare events with the vaccine. Although these events will be closely monitored in future trials, large postmarketing surveillance databases would likely be needed to detect such associations given the low background incidence of these diagnoses, their heterogeneous pathophysiology, and the need to account for factors such as age, sex, and temporal and geographical clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>].</p><p>In summary, a 2-dose schedule of AS03<sub>A</sub>-adjuvanted 3.75 &#x003bc;g A/Indonesia/05/2005 HA elicited immune responses that fulfilled licensure criteria in adults and elderly adults, including participants aged &#x02265;75 years. The vaccine was associated with a higher rate of transient injection site reactions and systemic symptoms than was placebo.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (Potters Bar, UK) for providing virus strains for in-vitro testing and also to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA) for supplying the A/Indonesia/05/2005 (IBCDC-RG2) vaccine strain.
