Despite this evidence, we know little about protective factors for mitigating the deleterious effects of stress on problem-solving. Building on previous research showing that self-affirmation can buffer stress, we tested whether an experimental manipulation of self-affirmation improves problem-solving performance in chronically stressed participants. Eighty undergraduates indicated their perceived chronic stress over the previous month and were randomly assigned to either a self-affirmation or control condition. They then completed 30 difficult remote associate problem-solving items under time pressure in front of an evaluator. Results showed that self-affirmation improved problem-solving performance in underperforming chronically stressed individuals. This research suggests a novel means for boosting problem-solving under stress and may have important implications for understanding how self-affirmation boosts academic achievement in school settings.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant #924387 and the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Greenhouse Opportunity Fund.

For example, acutely stressful contexts, such as completing problem-solving tasks under negative social evaluation, have been shown to impair performance on a variety of tasks, such as anagrams and remote associate problems <xref rid="pone.0062593-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Martindale1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Feeling chronically stressed produces similar performance impairments. For example, Liston and colleagues found that participants who reported high levels of stress over the previous month demonstrated impaired attention-shifting performance compared to participants who reported low levels of stress <xref rid="pone.0062593-Liston1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Liston2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Moreover, these stress-induced performance impairments were reversed when the high-stress participants completed the tasks after a one-month low stress period <xref rid="pone.0062593-Liston1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although this body of research provides supportive evidence indicating that acute and chronic stressors can impair problem solving, little is currently known about stress management approaches for mitigating the effects of stress on problem solving.</p><p>An emerging body of research suggests that self-affirmation may be one such effective stress management approach. Self-affirmation theory posits that the goal of the self is to protect one&#x02019;s self-image when threatened and that one way to do this is through affirmation of valued sources of self-worth <xref rid="pone.0062593-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Steele1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In order to manipulate self-affirmation, experimental studies commonly have participants rank-order personal values (e.g., politics, relations with friends/family), and then participants in the self-affirmation condition are asked to respond to questions or complete a short essay on why their #1 ranked value is important (control participants complete a similar activity about why a lower ranked value might be important to someone else) <xref rid="pone.0062593-McQueen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. As a result, participants in the self-affirmation condition have an opportunity to affirm a valued self-domain or characteristic <xref rid="pone.0062593-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-McQueen1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Studies using this experimental approach have found that self-affirmation can buffer threats to the self in variety of domains <xref rid="pone.0062593-Sherman1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, with several recent studies showing that self-affirmation can buffer stress responses to laboratory stressors <xref rid="pone.0062593-Creswell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Creswell2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and naturalistic academic stressors <xref rid="pone.0062593-Sherman2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Collectively, this work suggests that if self-affirmation can reduce stress, it may also promote problem-solving performance under high stress conditions, although no previous studies have tested the effects of self-affirmation manipulations on actual problem-solving performance <xref rid="pone.0062593-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0062593-Wakslak1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>In the present study, we test whether a brief self-affirmation can buffer the negative impacts of chronic stress on problem-solving. Specifically, we used a well-known measure of problem-solving and creativity (the Remote Associates Task (RAT)) <xref rid="pone.0062593-Bowden1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0062593-Sandkhler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> to test three hypotheses. First, we tested whether chronic stress is related to poorer problem-solving performance. Second, we tested whether self-affirmation improves problem-solving. Third, we tested whether these two main effects are qualified by a chronic stress &#x000d7; self-affirmation interaction, such that self-affirmation will improve problem-solving in chronically stressed participants, whom are likely to have impaired problem-solving, compared to participants who are low in chronic stress.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This research was approved by the Carnegie Mellon University Institutional Review Board.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Eighty students from two urban universities in Pittsburgh participated for course credit or $20.

Participants were informed that a trained evaluator would administer the performance task. Prior to completing the RAT and while the evaluator was ostensibly preparing to administer the test, participants were asked if they would be willing to complete a questionnaire and writing activity that was being piloted for an unrelated experiment on personal values (all agreed). Participants were randomly assigned either to the self-affirmation or control condition. In both cases, they rated 11 values (i.e., art, business, friends/family) in order of personal importance. Next, they wrote about their first ranked value and why it was important to them (self-affirmation condition) or their ninth ranked value and why it might be important to others (control condition) <xref rid="pone.0062593-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Following the self-affirmation writing task, as a manipulation check, participants were asked to respond to two items assessing how important the value they wrote about was, using a 6-point response scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Strongly Disagree to 6&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;Strongly Agree). Items were, &#x0201c;This value has influenced my life&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;This value is an important part of who I am&#x0201d; (study &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.96). Participants then completed a state mood adjective checklist assessing state positive mood (5 items: proud, content, joyful, love, and grateful; study &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.84) and state negative mood (3 items: sad, angry, scared; study &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.65) (PANAS-X; <xref rid="pone.0062593-Watson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Watson2" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>).</p><p>Participants&#x02019; heart rate and mean arterial pressure were measured at 2-minute intervals using an automatic sphygmomanometer and inflatable cuff on their left arm (Dinamap Carescape V100, General Electric Company, Finland) during three different periods: an eight-minute baseline period, followed by the RAT (about 9 minutes), and a five-minute recovery period. All readings in each period were averaged. Heart rate was included because it is a useful indirect marker for task engagement <xref rid="pone.0062593-Blascovich1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Dienstbier1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which may be affected by our self-affirmation manipulation. Mean arterial blood pressure was collected to measure cardiovascular reactivity to the laboratory challenge task.</p><p>The experimenter was blind to participant condition, and a separate RAT evaluator (also blind to condition) administered the 30-item RAT performance task. 144 RAT items have been normed for difficulty <xref rid="pone.0062593-Bowden1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and pilot testing indicated that our undergraduate sample population can solve all easy RAT items. We thus selected 30 challenging RAT items ranging in difficulty from moderately to extremely difficult (the items are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0062593.s001">Table S1</xref>). For each RAT item, participants saw three words on a computer screen (e.g., flake, mobile, cone) and were asked to generate a fourth word (e.g., snow) that when combined with each of the three stimulus words results in a common word pair used in everyday English language (e.g., snowflake, snow mobile, snow cone). They were given 12 seconds to provide an answer verbally. The evaluator provided veridical verbal performance feedback (incorrect, correct) after each response and recorded each response. In order to create performance pressure, the evaluator provided evaluative feedback three times during the 30 RAT trials (&#x0201c;I need you to try harder&#x0201d;).</p><p>After completing the performance task, the evaluator left the room and the experimenter re-entered and indicated that the participant was to rest quietly (5 minute recovery period). Participants then completed individual difference measures, including the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale <xref rid="pone.0062593-Cohen4" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> to assess perceived stress over the last month (all items were summed to form a composite index of chronic stress, study &#x003b1;&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.87). To reduce potential confounding effects, we administered these measures at the end of the experimental session because previous studies indicate that completing individual difference measures at the beginning of an experimental session may act as an affirmation manipulation (i.e., they have carry-over effects) <xref rid="pone.0062593-Steele2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. We had no reason to expect that the experimental task would bias participants&#x02019; responses when self-reporting their chronic stress levels over the past month, and a one-way ANCOVA indicated that the self-affirmation manipulation did not affect perceived stress over the last month (<italic>F</italic>(1, 72)&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.95, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;.22, <italic>&#x003b7;</italic>

First, although we have shown in several studies that self-affirmation can reduce acute stress experiences <xref rid="pone.0062593-Creswell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0062593-Sherman2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, previous research has not tested whether self-affirmation can be protective in the context of chronic (or ongoing) stressors. Moreover, until now it has been unclear whether the stress buffering benefits of self-affirmation translate into improved performance outcomes on actual problem solving tasks. Our present study suggests that a brief self-affirmation activity is sufficient to buffer the negative effects of chronic stress on task performance and can improve the ability to problem solve in a flexible manner during high stress periods <xref rid="pone.0062593-Martindale1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Nijstad1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. It is important to note that the task used in the present study (RAT) is a common measure of creativity performance and insight <xref rid="pone.0062593-Bowden2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-JungBeeman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, and hence our study suggests that self-affirmation may increase creativity and insight in stressed individuals <xref rid="pone.0062593-Wakslak1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Mednick1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>.</p><p>Second, our study suggests that self-affirmation may be effective at boosting performance in academic tasks requiring associative processing and creativity, particularly for students who experience stress on such tasks <xref rid="pone.0062593-Mednick1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. Thus, our findings identify a potential mechanism by which a self-affirmation intervention at the beginning of a school term can improve at-risk students&#x02019; academic achievement, reducing achievement disparities between African Americans and European Americans and between women and men in science <xref rid="pone.0062593-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0062593-Miyake1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.</p><p>Finally, two limitations of our study should be mentioned. It is possible that the stress buffering effects of self-affirmation on problem-solving performance that we obtained are specific to evaluative performance settings, since all of our participants completed difficult RAT items under time pressure in front of a critical evaluator. (We note that the problem-solving task we used produced significant cardiovascular stress reactivity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062593-g002">Figures 2</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0062593-g003">3</xref>), comparable to other well-known psychosocial stress-challenge tasks <xref rid="pone.0062593-Benschop1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>.) Future studies should therefore experimentally test whether social evaluation is a necessary condition for self-affirmation problem-solving effects. Another limitation of our study is that we measured chronic stress using a self-report measure, and this measure was collected at the end of our study session (although there were no experimental (self-affirmation manipulation) effects on chronic stress scores). We elected to use this procedure given that completing individual difference measures may have carry-over effects if completed immediately prior to self-affirmation activities <xref rid="pone.0062593-Steele2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Future studies using other measures for assessing chronic stress (e.g., selecting chronically stressed vs. matched control groups) <xref rid="pone.0062593-Liston1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> would therefore be useful.</p><p>The present research contributes to a broader effort at understanding how stress management approaches can facilitate problem-solving performance under stress. Despite many studies showing that acute and chronic stressors can impair problem-solving <xref rid="pone.0062593-Arnsten1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Alexander1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Liston1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, we know little about stress management and coping approaches for buffering stress during problem-solving <xref rid="pone.0062593-Jamieson1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our work suggests that self-affirmation may be a relatively easy-to-use strategy for mitigating stress and improving problem-solving performance in evaluative settings. It will be important for future studies to consider the mechanisms linking self-affirmation with improved problem solving. We show here that our self-affirmation effects are unlikely to be explained by changes in positive affect or task engagement. The fact that we did not see any differential effects of self-affirmation on a physiological measure of task engagement (heart rate) also suggests that these effects are not driven by changes in persistence or motivation <xref rid="pone.0062593-Nijstad1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. A more likely possibility, to be tested by future research, is that self-affirmation facilitates a more open and flexible attentional stance (e.g., <xref rid="pone.0062593-Wakslak1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>), which increases working memory availability <xref rid="pone.0062593-Beilock1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Schmader1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref> for problem-solving in evaluative contexts.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study builds on previous research showing that self-affirmation has stress protective effects in performance settings <xref rid="pone.0062593-Creswell1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Cohen1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Cohen2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0062593-Miyake1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, providing an initial indication that self-affirmation can buffer the effects of chronic stress on actual problem-solving in performance settings.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0062593.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
