We investigated effects of endothelin-1 (ET-1) LYS198ASN SNP and discriminatory stress exposure upon impact of 12-week behavioral interventions upon ambulatory BP (ABP) among 162 prehypertensive African American adolescents. Following genotyping, completion of questionnaire battery, and 24-hour ABP monitoring, participants were randomized to health education control (HEC), life skills training (LST), or breathing awareness meditation (BAM). Postintervention ABP was obtained. Significant three-way interactions on ABP changes indicated that among ET-1 SNP carriers, the only group to show reductions was BAM from low chronic stress environments. Among ET-1 SNP noncarriers, under low chronic stress exposure, all approaches worked, especially BAM. Among high stress exposure noncarriers, only BAM resulted in reductions. If these preliminary findings are replicated via ancillary analyses of archival databases and then via efficacy trials, selection of behavioral prescriptions for prehypertensives will be edging closer to being guided by individual's underlying genetic and environmental factors incorporating the healthcare model of personalized preventive medicine.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Essential hypertension (EH) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and EH incidence among youth is increasing [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. African Americans (AAs) experience a higher prevalence, earlier onset, and greater severity of EH-related complications than other ethnic groups [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. From late childhood onward, AAs display increased levels of resting and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) compared to other ethnic groups [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. BP levels are monotonically associated with future CVD morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Stage I prehypertensive adults (i.e., SBP/DBP 121&#x02013;129/81&#x02013;84&#x02009;mmHg) have a 40% increased risk and adults with stage II prehypertension (i.e., SBP/DBP 130&#x02013;139/85&#x02013;89&#x02009;mmHg) are twice as likely to develop CVD compared to those with optimal BP (&#x0003c;120/&#x0003c;80&#x02009;mmHg) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. BP percentile ranking tracks from late childhood into adulthood [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] placing AA adolescents with BP between the 50th and 95th percentiles for age and sex at an increased risk of future EH and CVD development [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>EH, like other multifactorial chronic diseases, results from a complex interplay between an individual's genetic underpinnings, lifestyle behaviors, psychosocial factors, and exposures to various environmental toxins. Over time, this dynamic interplay eventuates in adverse structural and functional changes in biological organ systems culminating in disease manifestation [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among the myriad of environmental toxins, psychosocial stress such as repeated exposures to unfair treatment and discrimination associated with socioeconomic status (SES) inequality and race have been implicated as contributing to EH, especially among AAs [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. </p><p>Few pediatric studies have addressed impact of unfair treatment and discrimination upon BP. Clark and Gochett [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] found perceived racism to be positively associated with increased resting SBP among AA youth who reported a strong intolerance to racist attitudes. Matthews and colleagues observed unfair treatment to be associated with increased daytime ABP and night/day ABP ratios in adolescents [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], especially among AA adolescents living in lower SES neighborhoods [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. </p><p>AAs' BP control abnormalities are frequently associated with increased vasoconstrictive tone [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Studies involving normotensive youth and young adults have shown that higher levels of resting BP and exaggerated BP responses to physical and behavioral stressors between AAs and European Americans (EAs) are often due to higher levels and/or greater increases in vasoconstrictive tone [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Associations between psychosocial stress-related factors and autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysregulation indicate that excessive endothelial activation also plays a contributory role [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells produce endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF; a potent vasodilator). Imbalances between circulating concentrations, and/or receptor sensitivity may lead to exacerbations of vasoconstrictive mediated BP control compounding the contributions of ANS dysregulation. Among hypertensive adults and normotensive adolescents and adults, AAs have exhibited higher plasma ET-1 levels compared to EAs [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Among normotensive adolescents and young adults, AAs have shown greater behavioral stress induced plasma ET-1 increases compared to EAs [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A recent study by Cooper et al. found that among AA adults, greater self-reported discrimination exposure was associated with higher ET-1 levels, regardless of SES [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The ET-1 gene is localized on chromosome 6, spans 5.5&#x02009;kb, and contains 5 exons and 4 introns. It has been identified as a candidate gene for EH and CVD [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A G-to-T transversion predicting a Lysine-Asparagine change at amino acid 198 (Lys198Asn) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been associated with increased BP levels from adolescence to middle age in Japanese EAs and AAs [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The Lys198Asn SNP has also been associated with exaggerated BP reactivity to laboratory stressors, particularly within the context of background stress-related factors. For example, in a previous study, T allele carriers from lower SES backgrounds exhibited the greatest BP increases to a video game challenge compared to all other subgroups [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Rabineau et al. [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] found vasoconstrictive reactivity to behavioral stress was the highest among T-allele carriers with poor anger management skills. These latter sets of findings along with other recent studies [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] lend support to the gene &#x000d7; environment model of stress-induced EH [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. That is, individuals with genetic susceptibility for EH, who are exposed to frequent environmental stress and/or other stress-related potentiating factors (e.g., ineffective coping skills), will be most likely to exhibit the greatest BP stress reactivity and to eventually develop EH and CVD.</p><p>Behavioral stress reduction interventions (e.g., meditation, cognitive behavioral coping skills, etc.) implemented to improve BP control and other CVD risk factors have primarily involved adults and quality of research designs and results have been mixed [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Rainforth et al. [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] reviewed 107 stress reduction BP control studies and conducted a meta-analysis involving 20 studies that were classified as well-designed randomized control trials (RCTs). All but two of the studies involved prehypertensive and hypertensive adults. Collectively, Transcendental Meditation (TM) was the only treatment found to significantly reduce resting and/or 24 hour BP.</p><p> Far fewer RCTs have been conducted involving youth, but findings are promising. Black et al. [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] reviewed 16 pediatric sitting-meditation RCTs, including breathing awareness meditation (BAM). Median effect sizes ranged from 0.16 to 0.29 for physiologic outcomes including resting and ambulatory BP, heart rate, and total peripheral resistance [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In a recent study, BAM showed significantly greater reductions in ambulatory SBP and sodium excretion compared to cognitive behavioral skills training (LST) and health education control (HEC) among a group of AA prehypertensive teenagers [<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Increased SNS activation and increased endothelial system activity (i.e., increased ET-1 levels) have both been shown to increase sodium appetite [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. The reduced sodium excretion may be indicative of reductions in sodium appetite as a result of improvements in ANS regulation and/or ET-1 activity.</p><p>The above review indicates that among stress reduction RCTs, meditation is consistently associated with significant BP reductions. However, even among the meditation RCTs showing significant BP reductions, noticeable inter-individual differences have been observed both across and within studies [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. For example, in Rainforth et al.'s [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] meta-analysis, the 95% confidence interval for resting SBP change from 6&#x02009;TM studies was (&#x02212;2.3 to &#x02212;7.6&#x02009;mmHg), with net changes between TM and health education ranging from &#x02212;1.1 to &#x02212;10.7&#x02009;mmHg. Recently, in a group of college students, Nidich et al. [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] found TM to provide an average change of &#x02212;2.0&#x02009;mmHg for resting SBP. A subgroup identified as high-risk for EH (i.e., family history of EH) showed a reduction of &#x02212;5.0&#x02009;mmHg.</p><p>The variability within and across RCTs using meditation interventions with comparable study samples and adherence rates may partially be due to combined influences of heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility for physiological responsivity to stress and propensity for exposure to stressful events. In genetics, penetrance represents the percentage of cases carrying a gene or allele among those displaying the phenotype of interest; expressivity represents variations or magnitude in a phenotype expression. Phenotypes can vary in penetrance and expressivity by a number of factors including exposure to environmental factors, allelic variation, and complex gene by environment interactions [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. A growing literature is indicating that higher genetic penetrance and/or expressivity may adversely impact the degree of benefit obtained from behavioral as well as pharmacologic programs aimed at improving relevant phenotypes. For example, among smokers who participated in cognitive behavioral interventions plus pharmacologic smoking cessation therapies, the carriers of nicotine metabolizing genetic variants, particularly those from high tobacco smoke exposure-laden environments, exhibited lower cessation rates and earlier relapse compared to noncarriers [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Similarly, ancillary analyses of the highly successful Diabetes Prevention Program which involved at-risk adults from obese laden environments receiving placebo, metformin, and lifestyle interventions revealed carriers of the TCF7L2 genetic variant associated with diabetes, had significantly higher incidence of diabetes acquisition during the study than noncarriers irrespective of the treatment they received [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. </p><p>The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate the potential modulating influences of genetic variability in the ET-1 SNP and differential discrimination-based stress exposure upon changes in ambulatory BP after 12-week exposure to BAM, LST, and HEC among prehypertensive AA adolescents. We hypothesize that ET-1 carriers will be less likely to respond to any stress reduction treatment given the purported propensity of a greater genetic predisposition to ANS/ET-1 imbalances related to BP control. Following, we expect ET-1 carriers who report high levels of discrimination will have the most difficulty reducing ambulatory BP compared to other subgroups due to the combination of having higher genetic penetrance for an ANS/ET1 imbalance related to BP control, combined with increased likelihood of expressivity of the ANS/ET1 imbalance as a result of high levels of chronic stress exposure. Among the treatment groups, we hypothesized that BAM would have greater beneficial impact upon ambulatory BP reduction compared to LST and HEC. </p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Discussion</title><p>In this preliminary study, we hypothesized that individuals who were ET-1 SNP carriers would have greater difficulty in responding to any of our intervention treatments for improving ambulatory BP. In the following, we also expected ET-1 SNP carriers who reported high levels of discrimination to be the most difficult to show ambulatory BP reductions. Finally, we hypothesized that BAM would have greater beneficial impact upon ambulatory BP reduction compared to LST and HEC. Our hypotheses were partially supported. BAM participants exhibited greater reductions in 24-hour, daytime and nighttime SBP and DBP compared to the LST and HEC groups. The modulating influences of ET-1 SNP status and EDS were similar across all three ambulatory indices for SBP and DBP. Among ET-1 SNP carriers, the only subgroup to show a consistent reduction in SBP and DBP was BAM recipients who also reported low EDS. In many cases, the other subgroups showed relatively little reduction or even increases in BP. Among ET-1 SNP noncarriers, all three treatments were helpful in reducing BP among those who reported low EDS. Only BAM was beneficial in reducing BP among those who reported high EDS.</p><p>The ET-1 Lys198Asn SNP has been shown to play a significant role in vasoconstrictive mediated BP control in normotensive and hypertensive youth and adults [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our findings provide further indirect support for the significant role of the ET-1 SNP in BP control among AAs. For all ambulatory SBP indices, ET-1 carrier status was a significant main effect showing fewer improvements compared to noncarriers. As noted above, BAM was the only treatment approach to have success in reducing SBP among ET-1 SNP carriers and only if they reported low EDS. It appears that among AAs, behavioral stress BP reduction programs such as BAM and LST may have difficulty in countering the combination of increased genetic propensity for stress-activated ANS imbalance/ET-1 activation and high frequency of environmental stress exposure [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. </p><p>The cognitive skills-based program (LST) only benefitted ET-1 noncarriers and only if they reported low EDS. Participants who reported high EDS displayed a slight increase in ambulatory SBP. Acquisition of the LST skills (e.g., reflective listening, assertiveness without aggressiveness, etc.) may require the entire 12 weeks. Perhaps implementation of these newly learned skills in interpersonal conflict prone environments initially results in augmented vigilance and sympathetic/endothelial system activation, rather than reductions of such. The slight increase in ambulatory SBP among LST subjects who reported high EDS supports this rationale. Future studies would benefit from the utilization of repeated ambulatory BP and biomarker monitoring evaluations (e.g., total peripheral resistance, cardiac output, and nocturnal dipping), along with concomitant self monitoring of stressful encounters, affective states, coping responses, rumination, and using technological advances in cell phone capabilities.</p><p>Although provocative, these results should be interpreted cautiously. This was an exploratory ancillary analysis of an RCT, and subgroup cell sizes were relatively small. We examined potential confounding influences of sex, BMI, physical activity, and smoking and did not detect significant subgroup differences at preintervention or in response to the interventions. The issue of relatively small sample sizes within the three-way interactions can best be addressed by replication with larger sample sizes. One approach to consider would be to capitalize upon archival BP reduction RCTs that involved stress reduction programs and if not available, we would aquire DNA samples from the participants. We speculate that BP control improvements among BAM participants may have been partially a result of improved ANS balance/ET-1 activity. Several previous findings showed that BAM also reduced overnight sodium excretion purportedly through a reduction in sodium appetite. However, decreased sodium appetite is a correlate and not an adequate surrogate measure of ANS/ET-1 activity. The dynamic interplay between biological systems related to BP control warrants inclusion of biological measures of multiple systems and investigation of the interactions among pathways including the endothelial, ANS, renin-angiotensin and aldosterone, and HPA axis [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p> As noted earlier, retrospective post hoc analyses of meditation based BP RCTs involving prehypertensives and hypertensives (especially those involving AAs) may lend some support to whether the relationships found in this study translate to others. Finding similar patterns of ambulatory BP changes among ET-1 SNP status and other indices of chronic stress exposure would augment support for BAM as a viable approach for inclusion in nonpharmacologic programs aimed at the prevention of EH and CVD among certain subgroups of individuals (e.g., ET-1 SNP noncarriers, and carriers from low stress environments). The ease of BAM administration allows it to be practiced in virtual any setting (i.e., public schools, churches, recreation centers, and homes) adding to its utility to become part of multifaceted dissemination efforts to help decrease CVD morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>].</p><p> Unfortunately, our study found none of the behavioral stress reduction programs were beneficial among ET-1 SNP carriers who reported high EDS exposure. If our results are replicated, exploration of alternative behavioral and/or pharmacologic approaches that target endothelial function is warranted. Part of the study inclusion requirements was no current or planned engagement in a formal exercise, health promotion, or organized sports programs outside of regular school physical education courses, and the measures we used for physical activity were not differently influenced by the subgroups. However, behavioral interventions that are directed specifically at enhancing high-intensity physical activity may be beneficial. Aerobic exercise training has been shown to inhibit vasoconstrictive (e.g., endothelin-1) and promote vasodilatory (i.e., nitric oxide) mechanisms related to BP control providing evidence as a potentially effective therapeutic strategy [<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Specific to the ET-1 LYS198ASN SNP, Rankinen et al. [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] found a two fold higher risk of hypertension among low aerobically fit carriers, whereas, aerobically fit carriers' hypertension risk was comparable to noncarriers. Additional research is needed to determine if physical activity can specifically benefit AA ET-1 carriers who report high levels of background stress. </p><p>For some individuals, a gene x environment personalized behavioral intervention approach may not improve BP control to desired levels. If this occurs, pharmacogenomics-based primary prevention interventions should be considered. Several large-scale pharmacologic RCTs have proven beneficial in reducing onset of EH in prehypertensive adults [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Among ET-1 SNP carriers, an endothelin type A receptor antagonist may help foster vasodilation-mediated BP control. In a recent study, Weber et al. found Darusentan, a selective endothelin type A antagonist, to control treatment resistant hypertension [<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. </p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the findings provide preliminary evidence of some of the underlying contributors that may have moderated BP reductions but were not examined in previous meditation RCTs. &#x0201c;One-size fits all&#x0201d; approaches to primary and secondary preventive health-care are being replaced with strategies described as preventive, predictive, personalized, and participatory [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Increasingly, behavioral and pharmacologic interventions are being tailored on the basis of individual's underlying genetic propensities and environmental factors (e.g., attitudes, stress exposure, etc.). Personalized medicine is in its infancy, but eventually, via empirical scrutiny, more efficacious best practice prevention and treatment approaches will evolve. The end result will help reduce the incidence of chronic diseases and improve the quality and longevity of life among those with these diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank superintendents, teachers and staff at Richmond County Public High Schools for their assistance and cooperation in providing the facilities for this study.
