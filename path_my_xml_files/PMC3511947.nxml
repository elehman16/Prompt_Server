The benefits of adding lower neostigmine dose to potentiate fentanyl analgesia, however, have not been evaluated to date.</p><p>We planned to determine whether combination of low-dose (1 mcg) neostigmine IT would enhance analgesia from a fixed IT dose of fentanyl, in patients undergoing unilateral total knee replacement (TKR) surgery with SA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>After obtaining the institutional ethics committee clearance and written informed consent, 45 adult patients of American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) 1 or 2, undergoing unilateral TKR surgery under regional anesthesia, were included in the study. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 15 patients each. The concept of visual analog scale (VAS), which consisted of a 10-cm line with 0 equaling &#x0201c;no pain at all&#x0201d; and 10 equaling &#x0201c;the worst possible pain,&#x0201d; was introduced before surgery.</p><p>Patients were premedicated with 0.1&#x02013;0.2 mg/kg oral diazepam on the morning of surgery. Intravenous (IV) preloading was done with Ringer's lactate as a bolus of 6&#x02013;8 ml/kg given over 15 min before SA. A 19-G epidural catheter was introduced through the L3&#x02013;L4 interspace with patient in the sitting position, followed by SA through the L3&#x02013;L4 interspace. A total volume of 3.5 ml was injected IT, at a rate of 0.25 ml/sec, using a 26-G spinal needle. The IT drug injected was 15 mg hyperbaric bupivacaine (3 ml) plus the test drug (0.5 ml). The test drug was normal saline (0.5 ml) in Group I; fentanyl 20 mcg (0.4 ml) and normal saline (0.1 ml) in group II; and fentanyl 20 mcg (0.4 ml) and neostigmine (Neostigmine, Norris Medicines Ltd., Ankleshwar, India) 1 mcg (0.1 ml) in group III [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Patients were placed in the supine position immediately after spinal injection. One anesthesiologist prepared the drug and administered the IT drug, while another anesthesiologist, who was blinded to the drug randomization, monitored the intraoperative and postoperative period.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Study groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-28-486-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Intraoperative sensory loss assessment was done using pin-prick test at 5, 10, 15, 20 min after IT injection of the study drug and every 30 min thereafter, until the end of surgery. Motor blockade of lower extremities was measured using 4-point modified Bromage scale at 5 min intervals for the first 20 min after injection of the IT drug. Blood pressure was monitored noninvasively every 5 min throughout the surgery, and heart rate and oxyhemoglobin saturation were monitored continuously throughout the surgery. A decrease in mean arterial pressure of greater than 25% below the baseline preanesthetic value or less than 60 mmHg was treated by incremental doses of 6 mg mephenteramine IV. A decrease in heart rate of more than 15% below the baseline or 50 beats per min, whichever was lesser, was defined as bradycardia and was treated by atropine 0.5 mg IV.</p><p>Postoperative assessment included pain scores, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) scores (5-point scale), and sedation scores (4-point scale), recorded at 30-min interval for first 4 h and then 4 hourly thereafter, for 24 h postoperatively. Duration of complete analgesia was taken as the time until VAS pain scores remained &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; following IT injection of the study drug. Duration of effective analgesia was the time until VAS pain scores were &#x02265;3 cm or when the patient's first requested for supplemental analgesia, whichever appeared first. Subsequently, an epidural top up of 8 ml of 0.125% bupivacaine was administered as the rescue analgesic. If the pain score remained &#x02265;3 even 30 min after epidural top up, additional analgesia with intramuscular diclofenac 1.5 mg/ kg was administered. The total number of rescue analgesics administered in 24 h was noted. &#x0201c;Overall 24-h VAS score&#x0201d; was obtained as a measurement of total pain experienced by the patient.</p><p>Nausea was scored by the patient using a 5-point scale. One or more emetic episodes were treated using ondansetron 4 mg IV. For patients experiencing more than one episode of nausea, the scores were averaged.</p><p>Sample size was selected to detect a projected difference of 75% between the neostigmine&#x02013;fentanyl&#x02013;bupivacaine and bupivacaine groups and 29% between the neostigmine&#x02013;fentanyl&#x02013;bupivacaine and fentanyl&#x02013;bupivacaine groups, with respect to the primary variable, duration of effective analgesia, a type I error of 0.01, and a power of 0.85, and was based on a pilot study with 12 patients. Data from the pilot study for neostigmine&#x02013;fentanyl&#x02013;bupivacaine (mean 1 = 252 min), fentanyl-bupivacaine (mean 2 = 196 min), and bupivacaine (mean 3 = 144 min) groups with an estimated SD of 35 showed that 12 patients were required in each group. However, to compensate for possible dropouts, we included 15 patients in each group. The data were analyzed statistically. Demographic data (age, weight, height, gender) and duration of surgery were compared among the groups by one-way analysis of variance. Blood pressure, heart rate, maximum level and time to attain peak level of sensory block, time to complete motor blockade, and VAS scores were compared among the groups by two-way analysis of variance followed by Mann&#x02013;Whitney test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant. The duration of complete analgesia, duration of effective analgesia, and the number of rescue analgesics in 24 h was compared using Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test, applied along with Mann&#x02013;Whitney test. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 45 patients were recruited for the study.

However, the study was underpowered. Moreover, the risk of delayed respiratory depression with the use of neuraxial morphine is a great concern. We therefore hypothesized that 1 mcg IT neostigmine would augment the analgesic efficacy of IT fentanyl and bupivacaine, without increasing the incidence of untoward side effects. As TKR surgery involves severe pain in the postoperative period, we performed our study in this subset of patients.</p><p>We report an enhancement of the analgesic action of 20 mcg fentanyl IT by 1 mcg neostigmine IT in patients undergoing TKR surgery. The addition of a low dose of neostigmine increased the duration of complete analgesia and effective analgesia by 75% and 78%, respectively. All patients who received IT neostigmine in combination with IT bupivacaine and fentanyl required less epidural top ups in 24 h. &#x0201c;Overall 24-h VAS scores&#x0201d; were also better in these patients. However, no increase in the incidence of nausea and vomiting was noted with addition of 1 mcg neostigmine IT to fentanyl&#x02013;bupivacaine IT combination.</p><p>IT injection of neostigmine produces analgesic effects. The inhibition of spinal cholinesterase by neostigmine results in an increase of endogenous acetylcholine, which is most likely released from intrinsic cholinergic neurons within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] These cholinergic neurons terminate in the vicinity of primary afferent express muscarinic receptors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] The endogenous acetylcholine produces analgesic effect through muscarinic presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic afferents, similar to how it has been described in the neostriatum.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] Muscarinic receptor antagonists have been shown to reverse the analgesic effects of IT neostigmine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] A tonic cholinergic activity is an important prerequisite for the effectiveness of neostigmine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] The enhanced analgesic efficacy of IT neostigmine results from greater release of spinal acetylcholine from the more intense and prolonged discomfort of postoperative pain,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] and consequent action at muscarinic M1 and M3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] and presynaptic nicotinic receptors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] present in the cholinergic interneurons at the lamina III and V of the dorsal horn.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] An action at nicotinic receptors at the dorsal horn ganglion[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] and at the spinal meninges[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] has also been suggested.</p><p>A possible explanation for the effect of small doses of IT neostigmine in enhancing the duration of analgesia produced by opioid relates to the mechanism of action of opioids in producing analgesia. Opioid increases the concentration of norepinephrine in lumbar cerebrospinal fluid which in turn produces analgesia in part by activating spinal cholinergic neurons to release acetylcholine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] This effect gets further accentuated in patients under noxious stimuli such as surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the time to reach maximum level of sensory block and the peak level attained was not influenced by the use of IT neostigmine. Similar effect was demonstrated by Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] in patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. This is possibly due to a difference in the onset of action of IT neostigmine[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] and IT bupivacaine.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] The time to development of complete motor block was also not altered. No patient in the IT neostigmine&#x02013;fentanyl&#x02013;bupivacaine group developed intraoperative hypotension or bradycardia requiring treatment. Although similar effects on hemodynamics during SA using low-dose IT neostigmine were observed by few researchers,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] this could not be explained on the basis of cardiostimulatory effect of spinal neostigmine as this requires large doses in humans.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>]</p><p>Use of low-dose IT neostigmine in an attempt to reduce the incidence of untoward side effects, particularly PONV, while retaining its analgesic efficacy has been tried by many investigators. In patients undergoing below knee surgery, Lauretti <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] showed a dose-independent reduction of postoperative analgesia requirement, but a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of PONV following addition of various doses of IT neostigmine (ranging from 25 to 100 mcg) to 15 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5%. Even the dose as low as 6.25 mcg has been associated with high incidence of PONV.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Almeida <italic>et al</italic>, demonstrated a trend toward more nausea with doses higher than 1 mcg in patients undergoing major gynecological surgeries.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] These observations are further supported by the present study. We observed a lower incidence of emesis and lesser need for antiemetic (though not significant) in patients receiving 1 mcg IT neostigmine as an adjunct to IT bupivacaine and IT fentanyl. This could be due to lower VAS scores in this group. Neostigmine 1 mcg IT can be considered a safe dose for retaining the analgesic efficacy while avoiding PONV. All patients were either awake or arousable to command in the postoperative period.</p><p>The commercially available preparation of neostigmine containing methylparaben as an antioxidant was used in the present study. Although solutions containing preservatives should not be injected IT, methyl- and propyl-paraben have not been demonstrated to be toxic. Phase I tolerability and safety study of the commercially available neostigmine formulations in human volunteers found no evidence of toxicity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] Moreover, preservative-free preparation of neostigmine is no longer available and all studies on IT neostigmine utilized neostigmine solutions containing preservatives.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>]</p><p>In conclusion, the addition of 1 mcg neostigmine IT increased the duration of postoperative analgesia and decreased the analgesic consumption in TKR surgery. There was no increase in the incidence of adverse effects.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn
