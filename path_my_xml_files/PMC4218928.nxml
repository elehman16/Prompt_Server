In the present study, we evaluated the efficiency and the safety of Harmonic scalpel when compared to conventional suture ligation in open total thyroidectomy. We enrolled 265 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for multinodular disease since October 2011 up to October 2013. They were randomized into two groups: 141 in group HS (Harmonic Scalpel), 124 in group CT (Conventional tecnique). We recorded the following data: operative time, post-operative blood loss, length of hospital stay and complications. The patients were monitored for 48 hours after surgery. Several differences were observed between the two groups (HS vs CT): the use of Harmonic scalpel was associated to a significant reduction of surgical operative time (110 min in CT vs 79.36 min in HS, p = 0.00001) and also associated to a lower blood loss (97.38 ml in CT vs 68.72 ml in HS, p = 0.00001). The length of stay was significantly shorter in the HS group (2.75 days in CT vs 1.93 days in HS) Complication rate was similar in the two groups. According to our experience, the Harmonic scalpel represents a safe alternative to conventional haemostasis in thyroid surgery, allowing for a significant reduction of operative time, blood loss and hospitalization. The rate of complication demonstrated no significant difference among the two groups.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Total thyroidectomy</kwd><kwd>Harmonic</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The technique of thyroidectomy was born in 19<sup>Th</sup> century (Hannan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), but during the last year various technique of hemostasis, neuromonitoring and surgical excision (MiVATT, loupes assisted, endoscopic, robotic, ToVAT) are invented. Total thyroidectomy is performed in several thyroid diseases and a meticulous hemostasis is important to preserve the parathyroid glands and recurrent nerves. In the traditional technique, the hemostasis relies on knot tying and electrocoagulation. Whereas suture ligation is a time-consuming procedure, the electrocautery implies the potential risk of injuring surrounding tissues because of heat dispersion. In the 1990, the Harmonic scalpel was developed by Ethicon as an alternative to conventional hemostatic tecniques: the device allows simultaneous cutting and coagulation of vessels by using mechanical vibration at a frequency of 55.5 KHz. Although it was introduced for abdominal and laparoscopic surgery (Laycock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1996</xref>; Amaral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1994</xref>), the Harmonic scalpel device demonstrated some advantages in thyroidectomy in several published studies (Bandi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Ferri et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>; Ecker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this prospective randomized study is to evaluate the real benefits of the Harmonic when compared with conventional ligation, in terms of operative time, postoperative blood loss, length of stay and complications.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We enrolled 265 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy for multinodular disease from October 2011 to October 2013.

Either preoperative and postoperative data were collected by the surgical staff.</p><p>The clinical endpoints of this study included intraoperative and post-operative parameters. Intraoperative parameters included operative time (between skin incision and the end of wound closure) and blood loss (blood loss was measured from the increase in weight of the bloodied swabs or measured from intraoperative drainage). Postoperative parameters included volume of drainage fluid in millimeters at 48&#x000a0;hours after surgery, drainage was maintained for 48&#x000a0;hours in some cases due to the presence of blood, (Abdovac<sup>TM</sup> FG 14 vacuum drain circuit: average pressure -25&#x000a0;mmHg/3.3 kPa), serum calcium and PTH values (mg/dl) measured either preoperatively and 48&#x000a0;hours after surgery, hypocalcemia (temporary or permanent), wound complication (such as seroma and hematoma), RLN palsy (temporary or permanent), and length of hospital stay. Hypocalcemia was defined as permanent when it was associated with a need for calcium replacement after six months. The preoperative evaluation and the postoperative follow-up of vocal cord mobility was obtained via laryngoscopy performed prior to the surgery and 1&#x02013;2 days after the surgery. Any reduction in vocal cord movement was recorded as postoperative cord paralysis. Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy was considered permanent when it persisted more than 6&#x000a0;months after surgery.</p><p>Research was carried out according to the institution&#x02019;s ethical guidelines and all patients gave informed consent to take part in the study.

Therefore a careful hemostasis is crucial in order to avoid some complications as hematomas and/or seromas that sometimes may cause a potentially lethal asphyxia (Rosato et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>). The use of the conventional technique requires more time to perform an adequate haemostasis.</p><p>Over the years new instruments were introduced, such as monopolar or bipolar electrocoagulation: they have demonstrated the disadvantage of thermal diffusion that could damage adjacent structures and especially the inferior laryngeal nerves.</p><p>The Harmonic Scalpel is the latest ultrasonic device designed for thyroid surgery, offering significant benefits in the size and weight of its hand piece, hand-activated trigger system, and versatility.</p><p>Shemen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>) has largely demonstrated the effectiveness of the Harmonic scalpel in thyroidectomy analysis of 105 cases. Siperstein et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2002</xref>) have successfully used the Harmonic Scalpel to hemostasis of all the vessels also describing the technique of &#x0201c;double bind&#x0201d; that consists in the double coagulation of two successive areas of the vessel.</p><p>The advantages of using the Harmonic scalpel have been demonstrated also in our study, as described above. Is necessary to underline that great care should also be taken in consideration when in close proximity to delicate structures such as the inferior laryngeal nerves.</p><p>Also when performing thyroid surgery the collaboration of the entire surgical team is important: in our experience the surgeon usually highlights the vase to tie and the first assistant applies the Harmonic scalpel. The use of drainage after thyroidectomy is still a source of debate, in fact Papavramidis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>) in his scientific research has concluded that there is no advantage or disadvantage in the use of drainage after thyroid surgery. The incidence of hematoma not change with both the drainage that without drainage, and also in cases where there is a relative increase in the incidence of hematoma this is attributable to the size of the gland. It is also seen that the onset of hematoma after 24&#x000a0;h occurs mostly in patients who have undergone resection of a substernal goiter or with cardiac comorbidities. So in conclusion it was found that the drainage only gives discomfort to the patient and which is used for the serenity of the surgeon. According to our study we observed a difference in operative time (about 20&#x000a0;minutes shorter in the HS group) and a shorter length of hospital stay, as also demonstrated by Papavramidis et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2014</xref>), likely due to lower amount of blood loss collections when compared to the conventional technique. There were no cases of postoperative hypocalcemia in either groups (Costanzo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>), in fact, the values of serum calcium and parathyroid hormone, which are considered predictors of hypocalcemia (Cordon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2005</xref>; Koutsoumanis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2007</xref>; Grodski and Serpell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>), were within standard values. This may lead to cost advantages because of the shorter length of hospital stay and shorter time of anesthesia duration/operatory room use thus increasing the number of daily procedures (Cannizzaro et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1993</xref>; Melck and Wiseman <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2010</xref>; Duan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>According to our results, the Harmonic scalpel reduces the operative time, postoperative blood loss and length of hospital stay. In contrast some postoperative parameters (serum calcium at 12 and 48&#x000a0;hours, hypocalcemia, RLN palsy) showed no statistical difference.</p><p>Therefore we conclude that the use of Harmonic scalpel during surgery for total thyroidectomy is advantageous, however a scrupulous and careful care of the surgical technique and hemostasis should always be observed.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MAC has performed surgeries, wrote the manuscript and participated in the preparation and correction of the manuscript.
