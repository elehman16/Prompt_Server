Between January 1987 and March 1990, 341 consecutive previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma received chemotherapy within the prospective, multicentre, randomized Protocol MM87. Survival was evaluated in patients aged &#x0003e; or &#x0003c; or = 66 years (the median age for the whole series) and in a subgroup of patients aged &#x0003c; 55 years. These groups were similar for main clinical characteristics, including results of cytostatic treatment. As of May 1996, 271 (79%) of the 341 patients had died, and median follow-up of the 70 (21%) living patients was 82 months. Overall, younger patients survived longer than older ones. In fact, in patients &#x0003e; and &#x0003c; or = 66 years, median survival was 31 and 44 months (P &#x0003c; 0.00095) and the percentage of patients surviving over 72 months was 17% and 32% (P = 0.0018) respectively; in patients &#x0003c; 55 years, these figures were 57 months and 35% respectively (P = 0.02 and 0.01, with respect to patients aged &#x0003e; 55 years). In all groups, about 50% of the patients surviving over 72 months had stage I disease. For multiple myeloma patients treated with chemotherapy, survival is favourably affected by relatively young age and early stage of disease.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00079-0137.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="485" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00079-0138.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="486" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00079-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="487" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00079-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="488" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00079-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="489" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00079-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="490" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/><graphic xlink:href="brjcancer00079-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="491" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
