However, the relationship between sleep quality and academic performance has not been examined in Sudan; this study assessed the relationship between sleep quality and academic performance among Sudanese medical students.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A case&#x02013;control study was conducted among 165 male and female medical students at two Sudanese universities. Excellent (A) and pass (C) academic groups were invited to respond to a self-administered questionnaire, using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Students also completed a diary detailing their sleep habits for 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to filling out the questionnaire. Various parameters of sleep quality were then compared between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A significant difference (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) between the excellent and average groups was found for overall sleep quality, subjective sleep rating, bedtime later than midnight, sleep latency, and daytime dysfunction (during driving, preparing a meal, etc.). No differences were found between groups for the use of sleep medications. The mean sleeping hours was (7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.9) and (6.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.9) for the excellent and pass groups respectively (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). A significant difference (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) between the excellent and average groups was found for weekday and weekend bedtime, weekend wake-up time, and weekend wake-up delay. No differences were found between groups for the weekday&#x02019;s wake- up time, and bedtime delay during weekends. Besides, snoring was present in 9.2&#x000a0;% of the excellent group versus 28&#x000a0;% in pass group (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.005).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sleep quality</kwd><kwd>Academic performance</kwd><kwd>Medical students</kwd><kwd>Sudan</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Physiologic and cognitive function in humans varies considerably during the day along the circadian rhythm. The sleep and wakefulness cycle is extensively regulated through intrinsic neural mechanisms (e.g., suprachiasmatic nucleus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, the timing and expression of sleep and wakefulness are highly influenced by environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Sleep deprivation of varying occasions and durations can substantially impair physical, cognitive, and emotional functions. Medical students and house medical staff work for long hours daily, and this continuous shifting without recuperation time has raised concerns about the severe effects of poor sleep quality in student training, medical errors, and patient safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Many factors alter sleep habits including coffee and tea intake, overuse of the internet and other social media, and the use of sleep medications. Furthermore, various medical problems profoundly disrupt sleep, including obstructive sleep apnea, depression, chronic sleep deprivation, narcolepsy, cataplexy, and idiopathic hypersomnia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>While these various factors all contribute to sleep quality, the relationship of the academic achievement to sleep habits is a key issue, especially for medical students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Poor sleep quality has been associated with reduced academic achievement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and sleep quality has also been reported to be related to negative effects on health, emotional feelings and well-being in college students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Sleep quality affect medical student physical, mental health, and working capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which in turn influence the community in the form of accidents and medical error. No data are currently available regarding the effect of sleep quality on medical student performance in Sudan. Sudan is one of the largest countries in Africa, taking about 2&#x000a0;% of the earth&#x02019;s surface, so the previous studies may not generalize to Sudan, due to environmental conditions, social conditions, and school environment. Therefore, we conducted the current study to understand the sleep habits of Sudanese medical students and whether they like those in Western countries had poor sleep quality.</p><p>In the current study, we examined the relationship between the sleep quality and academic performance among medical students by comparing groups with different levels of academic performance. Measures to improve both living condition and sleep quality are recommended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Subjects and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This case&#x02013;control study based on academic performance was conducted at two universities (University of Omdurman and Bahri) in Khartoum, Sudan.</p></sec><sec id="Sec44"><title>Subjects</title><p>This study aimed to encompass all the students in the fifth and sixth classes who score A (excellent) and C (pass) in the previous semester (they were selected from the total number of 300 medical students registered for these classes), those with score B (good) and score D (fail) were excluded from the study. One hundred sixty-five, medical students responded to the questionnaire, response rate 81.6&#x000a0;% (165/202). Twenty-five medical students who did not record their grades were also excluded. School performance was stratified as A, (excellent), B (good), C (pass), and D (fail). An orientation meeting was arranged with the participants, and they were orally briefed by two of the researchers (HM, and MA) about the research objectives and how to fill the questionnaire. Group leaders from all the semesters helped to distribute the questionnaire. Participation was voluntary and unpaid. All the participants signed a written informed consent form.</p><p>Subjects were asked to maintain a diary documenting sleep and wake times for 2&#x000a0;weeks and then they completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). This instrument has been previously validated for college students in sub-Saharan Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and was shown to be consistent with objective measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The PSQI contains seven components, each with a score from 0 to 3 with 3 indicating the greatest dysfunction. The global sleep quality score ranged from 0 to 21, and candidates with PSQI of more than 5 were labeled as having poor sleep quality, and those with PSQI of less than or equal 5 as good sleep quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The PSQI (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sleep.pitt.edu/content.asp?id=1484&#x00026;subid=2316">http://www.sleep.pitt.edu/content.asp?id=1484&#x00026;subid=2316</ext-link>) measures sleep-related habits in the past month including sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep disturbance, subjective sleep quality, daytime dysfunction, and sleep medication use. Sleep efficiency is the ratio of time spent in sleep (total sleep time) to the amount of time spent in bed.</p><p>The bedtime delay is the (weekday bedtime-weekends bedtime), and wake-up time delay is the (wake-up time during weekdays-wake-up time during weekends) A sleep time difference of more than an hour between weekdays and weekends was considered irregular bedtime [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Data were collected at times other than examination days to avoid stress during the preparation for exams.

In the current study, sleep duration ranged from 3 to 8&#x000a0;h with a mean of 7.00&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.9 in the excellent group, and 6.30&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.0 in the average student group, and a significant difference was found between the two groups of medical students (P&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.047). Similar to our result, is the study conducted in Saudi Arabia by Bahammam [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] who concluded that decreased nocturnal sleep time is negatively associated with academic performance in medical students. Furthermore Bahammam demonstrated that, late bedtime on weekdays and weekends is associated with lower academic performance, and going with the present finding in which, the excellent student weekdays bedtime was earlier than average students, 11.54&#x000a0;pm&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.54&#x000a0;h versus 1.12 am&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.42&#x000a0;h in average students (P&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), and F&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15.628. The excellent student&#x02019;s weekend&#x02019;s bedtime was also earlier than the average students, 12.54 am&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.36&#x000a0;h, and 2.48 am&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.12&#x000a0;h respectively.</p><p>In the current study, students delayed their bedtime by 1.2&#x000a0;h in excellent students, and 1.6&#x000a0;h in average students, similarly a study published by Colette et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] showed that university students delay their bedtime by 1.5&#x000a0;h.</p><p>The outstanding result of the present study is that 61.4&#x000a0;% of the study group had bad sleep quality and is higher than studies conducted in Malaysi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] in which 20&#x000a0;% of medical students had bad sleep quality and Estonia which showed that 6 and 1&#x000a0;% of medical students were poor and very poor sleepers respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Due to demands of the academic environment, most medical students are involved in the late- night study and excessive internet use and some also consume stimulants to stay awake at night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The present data showed that; the majority of the average student study group (69.2&#x000a0;%) goes to bed later than midnight during weekdays; similarly a study conducted in Lebanon among university students and concluded that 89.9&#x000a0;% of the responders went to bed after 11&#x000a0;pm on weekdays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec8"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The current results are appropriately interpreted with certain caveats. The present study was conducted at only two colleges, so generalizability cannot be ensured; further multi- center larger studies including students with all grades focusing on those with grade D (fail) are needed. Comparison between public and private medical schools with different living environments and class timetable can also be done. The reliance on the self-administered questionnaire to collect data is subjective as students may not have accurately reported their sleep habits. Research suggests that people may overestimate or underestimate self- reported values.</p><p>Being a cross-sectional study we cannot determine a causal relationship between sleep quality and academic performance. In the present study we excluded those with grade D (failing) which is the most important group to focus on; also we were not able to control for potential confounders like stress and class attendance. Experiments conducted on humans showed that sleep deprivation leads to impairments of memory, concentration and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Due to the growing concerns about the association of poor sleep quality with many physical and mental diseases, it is imperative to conduct additional research to examine potential causes, and implement appropriate preventive measures and treatment when needed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A strong relationship is evident between good sleep quality and high academic performance.
