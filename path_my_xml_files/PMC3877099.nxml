</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Study Examinations</title><p>Prior to randomization, a standard eye examination was performed, including measurement of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), a dilated slit lamp examination with grading of lens opacities, digital macular photography using a Canon CR6-45NM Non-Mydriatic Retinal Camera (Saitama, Japan) and a variety of retinal visual function tests. Baseline assessment also included questionnaires on demographics, general medical history, dietary intake, medications, ethnic origin, and family history of AMD. Blood samples were collected to test for liver function, lipid profile, C-reactive protein levels, and genetic polymorphisms.</p><p>Biannual follow-up examinations were conducted for three years after randomization. At each review visit, participants underwent a full eye examination and blood tests. If clinically indicated, fluorescein angiography was undertaken to exclude/confirm CNV.

Compliance was determined using self-reporting, counting unused tablets and by measuring each subject's lipid profile every 6 months. Liver function tests were conducted at each review. Adverse events were reviewed by a safety monitoring committee with severe adverse events reported to the ethics committee. The trial would be stopped if rates of drug-related adverse events were found to be significantly higher in the active treatment group.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Assessment of AMD status</title><p>Fundus examination and photography were performed at each visit. Digital images of each macula were graded according to the International Classification and Grading System for AMD by two trained graders, masked to treatment allocation.<xref rid="pone.0083759-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> Grading was conducted using the &#x02018;OptoMize PRO&#x02019; software from Digital Healthcare Image Management System (Digital Healthcare Ltd (DH), Cambridge, UK). Each macula was graded within a 6000 um diameter grid centred on the fovea for type, size, location, number, centrality and area covered by AMD features. Thus, drusen type (intermediate, soft distinct or soft indistinct), number (1&#x02013;9, 10&#x02013;19, 20 or more), size (&#x0003e;63 &#x000b5;, &#x0003e;125 &#x000b5;, &#x0003e;175 &#x000b5;, &#x0003e;250 &#x000b5;), centrality (fovea, central, middle, outer subfields or outside the grid), and area covered (&#x0003c;10%, &#x0003c;25%, &#x0003c;50%, &#x0003e;50% of the areas delineated by the central, middle and outer circles of the grid) were determined. For pigment changes, differences in size, centrality, and area covered were assessed. Advanced AMD was defined as presence of either CNV or GA. CNV was confirmed on angiography and GA was defined as an area of hypopigmentation &#x0003e;175 &#x000b5;m with a choroidal vessel in its base on colour photography. Fundus autofluorescence and Optical Coherence Tomography images were not available when this study was conducted. Any discrepancies in grading were resolved through adjudication by senior clinicians (LR, RG). Kappa for inter-grader and intra-grader agreement for the study graders ranged from 0.64 to 0.76 and from 0.60 to 1.00, respectively and has been published elsewhere.<xref rid="pone.0083759-Aung1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>

Our results indicate that dose of 40 mg daily was well tolerated in people with normal lipid profiles and that simvastatin appears to have a role in slowing progression of bilateral intermediate AMD. In those who had already developed advanced AMD in their fellow eye, we did not detect a beneficial effect for the eye with non-advanced AMD. The effect of simvastatin was more pronounced in those who were homozygous for the <italic>at risk</italic> C allele of the Y402H SNP of the <italic>CFH</italic> gene.</p><p>Almost all participants in this study had at least one C allele at Y402H, which is consistent with many AMD studies, including our own.<xref rid="pone.0083759-Baird1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> The reference group consisted mainly of individuals who were heterozygous at this SNP. However, as specific targeting of genetically predisposed individuals was not a factor in initial recruitment, this should not be considered problematic. The detection of the benefit of simvastatin predominantly amongst those homozygous for the at-risk CC genotype of Y402H of the <italic>CFH</italic> gene suggests that in future studies, genotype should be taken into consideration when assessing the potential effect of statins in AMD. Previous studies examining the effect of statins in AMD may have missed a beneficial effect by not stratifying their analysis by genotype.</p><p>Statins, initially used as cholesterol-lowering agents,<xref rid="pone.0083759-Alberts1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083759-Alberts2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> have a variety of well recognized modes of action, some of which may benefit individuals presenting with AMD. By binding to HMG-CoA reductase's active site, statins inhibit hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and reduce serum levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The non-lipid-related actions of statins include improvement of endothelial functions, decrease of LDL oxidation, as well as reduction of inflammation and angiogenesis &#x02013; all potentially important factors in AMD pathogenesis.<xref rid="pone.0083759-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0083759-Guymer1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>

</p><p>Recruiting participants into this study was extremely challenging, as many potentially eligible individuals with AMD were already taking statins or had lipid profiles where lipid-lowering agents were recommended. Whilst our study provides some support for a potential role for statins in AMD, a larger RCT would be required to provide a definitive result. With criteria for recommending statin use having widened in recent years, it will be even more difficult to attempt a RCT of statin use in AMD. It would, however, be possible to search for corroborating evidence by returning to the large population-based studies on AMD and repeat analyses, stratifying by genetic risk and the presence of unilateral advanced AMD.</p><p>The strengths of this study include its prospective, randomized, double masked design, the high rate of compliance, detailed grading of the macular photographic images, side-by-side assessment of baseline and follow-up images and the availability of angiographic findings to confirm CNV. The associations of AMD progression with age, smoking, and <italic>CFH</italic> polymorphism in this study were all consistent with other studies, indicating the similarities of our study cohort to the broader AMD-affected population. The limitations of the study are its relatively small sample size, the relatively high attrition rate, and a slightly higher number of participants in the simvastatin group who had no follow-up data. The use of only a moderate dose of simvastatin, and only three years of follow-up may also have limited the magnitude of the observed effect.</p><p>The relatively small sample size did not allow us to fully assess the effects of simvastatin on the incidence of advanced AMD. A moderate dose of simvastatin (40 mg per day) was chosen to minimize the risk of adverse events in a cohort of patients with normal lipid profiles; however there is a possibility that the effect could have been greater with a higher dose of simvastatin. As AMD progresses slowly, a longer follow-up could have provided more information on long-term effectiveness of simvastatin use in AMD. The observational Blue Mountain Eye Study was unable to detect any association of statins with AMD progression at a 5 year follow-up, <xref rid="pone.0083759-vanLeeuwen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> but after 10-years they were able to show that statins appeared to be associated with slowing the development of soft drusen.<xref rid="pone.0083759-Tan1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>
</p><p>Although randomization was used to reach comparability between study arms, this randomization resulted in an imbalance in the distribution of smoking and advanced AMD in one eye at baseline between the two treatment groups. This imbalance meant that those most likely to progress (smokers and the unilateral advanced disease) were over represented in the treatment group. Although theoretically this made it more difficult to show a beneficial effect of the intervention, a protective association was still found.</p><p>In all sub-analyses the effect consistently fell on the side of favouring simvastatin. This is re-assuring and makes the chance association less probable. However given the sample size, the results stratified by the genotypes should not be overstated and further research into the use of statins in AMD, particularly profiled by genotype, would be invaluable. Statins are drugs with a well-defined safety profile and are currently taken by millions of people worldwide. If truly beneficial in slowing progression of AMD, their implementation would be low risk and rapid. The results presented here strongly indicate the importance of further determining the potential role of statins in slowing progression of AMD towards vision loss.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0083759.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
