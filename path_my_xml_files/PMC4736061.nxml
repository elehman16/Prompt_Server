Increasing production of vaccines during the late nineteenth and throughout the twenties has also led to substantial improvements in personal and social health.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] According to national planning, Iranian healthcare centers provide 6-month-old infants with diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DPT), hepatitis B, and poliomyelitis vaccines. Although vaccines protect against diseases, they can also cause a diverse range of mild to severe complications.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] While the most common complications, e.g., soreness, swelling, fever, and rash are mild, severe complications such as critical allergic reactions or seizures may also be scarcely induced.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] According to previous research, acetaminophen can be administered to decrease common complications after vaccination.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Considering parents&#x02019; concerns about postvaccination complications and the possible effect of acetaminophen on decreasing such issues, we aimed to assess the effects of administering prophylactic acetaminophen on short-term postvaccination complications among 6-month-old infants admitted to a private pediatric clinic in Rasht (Iran) during 2002&#x02013;2013.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>This quasi-experimental study was conducted on 696, 6-month-old infants admitted to a pediatric clinic in Rasht before vaccination during 2002&#x02013;2013. Of these infants, 31 were excluded during the course of study. The participants were allocated to the intervention and control groups (<italic>n</italic> = 322 and 343, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Procedures and variables assessment</title><p>In the intervention group, prophylactic acetaminophen with normal dose (10&#x02013;15 mg/kg/dose) was administered 2 h before vaccination. The same dose of acetaminophen was administered 2 h after vaccination in the control group. The two groups were compared in terms of complications such as fever, drowsiness, anorexia, seizure, long and excessive crying, mood change, and pain/wound at the site of injection, abscess, induration, limb swelling, and erythema. The time of occurrence of each complication was also recorded and compared between the groups.</p><p>Fever was considered as body temperature over 38&#x000b0;C as assessed by a rectal thermometer. Mild and severe fevers were defined as body temperatures between 38&#x000b0;C and 39&#x000b0;C and over 39&#x000b0;C, respectively.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Infants with Glasgow Coma Scale scores &#x02264;14 were regarded as drowsy. Seizure was indicated by a sudden flow of electrical activity in the brain which made reversible changes in mental status or somatosensory function. Anorexia was present if the mothers reported the infants&#x02019; decreased desire to eat. Long and excessive crying was confirmed based on parents&#x02019; reports of continuous crying for at least 3 h. Muscle stiffness larger than 2 cm in diameter was considered as inoculation. Ultrasound was used to verify the presence of an abscess or deep accumulation of pus. Finally, the researchers examined the infants to find any existing wounds in the site of injection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics was used to report the results.

The intervention and control groups had no significant difference in terms of sex distribution (<italic>P</italic> = 0.53). Therefore, as previously suggested by Talebian <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] acetaminophen exerts similar effects on both sexes.</p><p>While short-term complications were seen in 45% of all participants, their frequency was significantly lower in the intervention group (38.5%) then in the control group (51%) (<italic>P</italic> = 0.001). Likewise, Hayat <italic>et al</italic>. (2013) showed prophylactic acetaminophen to have valuable effects on decreasing short-term postvaccination complications in 6&#x02013;18-month-old infants. Consistent with our findings, they reported fever as the most significant complication after vaccination. They introduced anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties of acetaminophen to be responsible for significant reductions in fever. Nevertheless, they did not notice any significant difference in pain, swelling, and induration between the intervention and control groups.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, Moshe <italic>et al</italic>., concluded that prophylactic acetaminophen reduced the frequency and severity of common complications after DPT and poliomyelitis vaccines.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] However, Uhari <italic>et al</italic>. rejected the significant effect of prophylactic acetaminophen on complications, e.g., fever, after DPT vaccine.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Similarly, according to Jackson <italic>et al</italic>., prophylactic ibuprofen had no significant effect on topical acellular complications of DPT vaccine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Although Jackson <italic>et al</italic>. suggested that acetaminophen might reduce the risk of postvaccination fever and fussiness,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] there is still controversy about the appropriate time for administering acetaminophen.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>Prymula <italic>et al</italic>. and Yal&#x000e7;in <italic>et al</italic>. highlighted the significant effects of prophylactic acetaminophen on pyretic reactions.
