On either side of the recti, the abdominal wall comprises three layers of thin muscle: from external to internal, they are external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus abdominis. Each muscle layer is surrounded by a sheath of connective tissue. Pain from the abdominal wall is transmitted by the anterior branches of seven spinal nerves[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] which travel in a plane between the internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles known as the transversus abdominis plane (TAP) representing an anatomical potential space.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The nerves then leave the plane to innervate the abdominal muscles and overlying skin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] On the basis of anatomic studies, the lumbar triangle of Petit, a potential access point to this neurofascial plane, was identified.</p><p>This triangle is bounded posteriorly by the latissimus dorsi muscle and anteriorly by the external oblique, with the iliac crest forming the base of the triangle, and is a fixed and easily palpable landmark.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] By introducing local anesthetics into the TAP via the triangle of Petit, it is possible to block the sensory nerves of the anterior abdominal wall before they pierce the musculature to innervate the abdomen. The degree of block achieved can be unpredictable mainly due to the lack of clearly defined anatomic landmarks, leading to uncertainty regarding the exact needle positioning, and the lack of a clear indication that the local anesthetic is being deposited in the correct anatomical plane.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Approval was obtained from the hospital ethical committee. Patients undergoing abdominal surgery at S. N. Medical College and Hospital, Agra, between June 2010 and May 2011, were included in the study. Sixty patients of either sex of ASA grade 1 and 2 who underwent major gynecological or surgical operation were enrolled for this study. Informed consent was obtained from all who agreed to participate in this study. The patients were randomly assigned into two groups. Each group had equal number (<italic>n</italic> = 30) of patients.</p><p>Group 1: Test group: Patients received TAP block.</p><p>Group 2: Control group: Patients received no TAP block</p><p>All the patients received a standard general anesthetic with standard monitoring. Anesthesia was induced by rapid sequence induction using thiopental 5 mg/kg and succinylcholine 2 mg/kg. Vecuronium was used for muscle relaxation. Anesthesia was maintained with oxygen, nitrou oxide and isoflurane. All patients also received fentanyl 1&#x02013;2 mg/kg. At the end of the operation, patients were extubated after reversal with neostigmine and atropine. Standard monitoring, including electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), arterial oxygen saturation, and end-tidal carbon dioxide monitoring, was done throughout, and patients were placed in supine position. Patients with hepatic and renal abnormalities, those who were hypersensitive to the drug, and those who were receiving medical therapies considered to result in tolerance to opiates were excluded from the study.</p><p>During preoperative visit, patients received a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, which was explained to them. The assessments ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (unbearable pain), and these assessments were performed in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and at 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. All patients were instructed about how to use the patient controlled analgesia PCA device during preoperative visit.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Technique</title><p>All patients randomized to undergo TAP block, had the block performed after completion of surgery. The iliac crest was palpated from anterior to posterior until the latissimus dorsi muscle could be felt.</p><p>The triangle of Petit was then located just anterior to the latissimus dorsi muscle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. Using a short bevel 24-G spinal needle, the skin was pierced just cephalad to the iliac crest over the triangle of Petit [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. The needle was then advanced at right angles to the skin, in a coronal plane, until resistance was encountered. This resistance indicated that the needle tip was at the external oblique muscle.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Gentle advancement of the needle resulted in a &#x0201c;pop&#x0201d; sensation as the needle entered the plane between the external and internal oblique fascial layers. Further gentle advancement of the needle resulted in a second pop, which indicated entry into the transversus abdominis fascial plane.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] After careful aspiration to exclude vascular puncture, 20 ml of 0.375% bupivacaine solution was injected through the needle. The TAP block was then performed on the opposite side, using an identical technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] After completion of the procedure; patients were transferred to the PACU. PCA with tramadol was started in the postoperative ward once the patient was fully conscious and oriented.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Surface anatomy of lumber triangle of petit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JNSBM-4-177-g001"/></fig><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Site of needle insertion in lumber triangle of petit</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JNSBM-4-177-g002"/></fig><p>Loading dose/bolus of 2.5 mg/kg of tramadol was administered by slow intravenous injection before starting PCA. Tramadol solution was diluted to 10 mg/ml. The devices were set to deliver 10 mg i.v. bolus dose of tramadol with 10 min lockout time. All patients who had nausea or vomiting were treated with i.v. metoc1opramide 10 mg and those who had pruritus were treated with i.v. chlorpheniramine 10 mg.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Data collection</title><p>The presence and severity of pain, nausea, and sedation were assessed systematically. These assessments were performed in the PACU and at 2, 4, 6, 24, and 48 h postoperatively. All patients were asked to give scores for their pain at rest and on movement, and for the degree of nausea at each time point.</p><p>Pain severity was measured using both a VAS (0, no pain; 10, worst imaginable) and a categorical pain scoring system (none, 0; mild, 1; moderate, 2; severe, 3).</p><p>Nausea was measured using a categorical scoring system.

Effective pain control also facilitates rehabilitation and accelerates recovery from surgery. Other benefits of effective regional analgesic techniques include reduced pain intensity, decreased incidence of side effects from analgesics, and improved patient comfort.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p>Direct blockade of the neural afferent supply of the abdominal wall, such as abdominal field blocks, ilioinguinal and hypogastric nerve blocks, has long been recognized as capable of providing significant postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing abdominal surgical procedures such as cesarean delivery[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] and inguinal herniorrhaphy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] However, the lack of clearly defined anatomic landmarks has meant that the full potential of abdominal wall blockade in patients undergoing major abdominal procedures remains to be realized. An alternative, simple, reliable, and effective regional analgesic technique is required.</p><p>The TAP provides a space into which local anesthetic can be deposited to achieve myocutaneous sensory blockade.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Deposition of the local anesthetic dorsal to the mid-axillary line also blocks the lateral cutaneous afferents, thus facilitating blockade of the entire anterior abdominal wall. The lumbar triangle of Petit offers an easily identifiable, fixed, and palpable landmark, and is located dorsal to the mid-axillary line.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] The transversus abdominis neurofascial plane can easily be accessed via this triangle, and local anesthetic deposited into this plane, using the loss of resistance technique.</p><p>In this randomized, single-blind clinical trial, the TAP block produced effective and prolonged postoperative analgesia, when compared with standard therapy, in patients undergoing surgery via a midline abdominal wall incision. The TAP block reduced postoperative pain scores, both at rest and on movement, and reduced postoperative opioid requirements. Overall, during the first 24 postoperative hours, the TAP block reduced mean i.v. tramadol requirements by more than 70%. This reduction in opioid requirement resulted in fewer opioid-mediated side effects. The incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting PONV was reduced by more than half in the TAP block group. Sedation scores were also modestly reduced in the patients who underwent TAP blockade.</p><p>Thus, we conclude that the TAP block seems to hold considerable promise in producing effective and prolonged postoperative analgesia for patients undergoing surgical procedures involving abdominal wall incisions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>We conclude that the TAP block holds considerable promise as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen after abdominal surgeries. The TAP block was easy to perform, and provided reliable and effective analgesia in this study, and no complications due to the TAP block were detected.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
