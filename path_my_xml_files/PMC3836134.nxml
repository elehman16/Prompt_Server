Metformin is the recommended first-line antidiabetes agent for patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). However, in order to achieve and maintain glycemic control as the disease progresses, patients often require therapies in addition to metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p><p>Despite the availability of a number of antihyperglycemic agents, the side effects associated with existing treatments and their gradual loss of efficacy over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) mean that many patients with type 2 diabetes do not reach therapeutic goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). In addition, treatment is often complicated by common comorbidities of type 2 diabetes such as obesity and hypertension, which are not addressed by existing oral antidiabetes agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>Inhibition of sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2), located in the proximal tubule of the kidney, represents an approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes that is independent of &#x003b2;-cell function and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). SGLT2 mediates most of renal glucose reabsorption, and inhibition of this transporter leads to reduced reabsorption of filtered glucose and increased urinary glucose excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), resulting in reduced plasma glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In addition, this mechanism leads to weight loss owing to the loss of calories via urinary glucose excretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of SGLT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), which in patients with type 2 diabetes causes urinary glucose excretion of up to 90 g/day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). In two placebo- and active-controlled, dose-finding trials, treatment with empagliflozin for 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes was generally well tolerated and resulted in placebo-corrected reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> of up to 0.72% (7.9 mmol/mol) and placebo-corrected reductions in weight of up to 1.7 kg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In these studies, reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub> were comparable to those of the active comparators metformin and sitagliptin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The objective of this study was to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, sitagliptin, and metformin in a 78-week, open-label extension study of two dose-finding trials.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase IIb, randomized, active-controlled, open-label extension trial. The trial was conducted at 132 trial sites in 21 countries (Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Korea, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Ukraine, and U.S.). The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00881530) and was carried out in compliance with the protocol and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. The trial was approved by respective institutional review boards, and independent ethics committees, and competent authorities according to national and international regulations. All patients provided signed and dated informed consent prior to participation in the extension study.</p><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes were eligible for inclusion in the extension study if they had successfully completed one of two 12-week, blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled dose-finding trials (study 1 and study 2). In these preceding trials, male and female patients with type 2 diabetes were eligible for inclusion if they were aged &#x02265;18 and &#x02264;79 years with a BMI &#x02264;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and had insufficient glycemic control (HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x02265;7.0 to &#x0003c;10.0% [&#x02265;53 to &#x0003c;86 mmol/mol]) at the start of the placebo run-in period.

At inclusion in the preceding blinded trial, patients were either treatment na&#x000ef;ve (study 1) or had been on a stable dose of metformin immediate release (IR) of &#x02265;1,500 mg/day or maximum tolerated dose for &#x02265;10 weeks (study 2). In study 1, treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients were randomized to receive 5, 10, or 25 mg empagliflozin once daily (qd), placebo (all double blind), or open-label metformin-IR (up to a maximum of 1,000 mg twice daily or the maximum tolerated dose) for 12 weeks. In study 2, patients on stable metformin background therapy were randomized to receive 1, 5, 10, 25, or 50 mg empagliflozin qd, placebo (all double blind), or open-label sitagliptin (100 mg qd) for 12 weeks.</p><p>In the current open-label extension trial, patients from the comparator arms of the preceding trials (study 1, metformin monotherapy, or study 2, sitagliptin as add-on to metformin) continued open-label treatment for an additional 78 weeks and patients on 10 mg or 25 mg empagliflozin in the preceding trials continued on the same dose for a further 78 weeks (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0663/-/DC1">Supplementary Fig. 1</ext-link>).

Safety and tolerability were assessed descriptively based on the frequency of adverse events (AEs), the frequency of hypoglycemic events (plasma glucose of &#x02264;70 mg/dL [&#x02264;3.9 mmol/L]), changes from baseline in vital signs, and changes from baseline in clinical laboratory parameters. Only AEs and hypoglycemic events that occurred during the extension trial were analyzed. Events consistent with urinary tract infection and genital infection were identified from AEs reported spontaneously by the investigator based on a special search of MedDRA preferred terms. The baseline source for analyses of changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory parameters was before the first intake of active treatment in either the preceding trial (study 1 or study 2) or extension trial. In addition, changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation, were analyzed over 90 weeks in patients who were randomized to 10 or 25 mg empagliflozin, metformin, or sitagliptin in the preceding trials without rerandomization in the extension trial.

In empagliflozin groups, mean uric acid values decreased by 44&#x02013;51 &#x003bc;mol/L from baseline compared with increases of 25 &#x003bc;mol/L with metformin and 7 &#x003bc;mol/L with sitagliptin as add-on to metformin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0663/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). Treatment with empagliflozin resulted in small changes in lipid profiles. Mean changes from baseline in LDL cholesterol were &#x02212;0.01 to 0.16 mmol/L in empagliflozin groups, &#x02212;0.14 mmol/L with metformin, and 0.06 mmol/L with sitagliptin as add-on to metformin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0663/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>). HDL cholesterol levels increased from baseline by 0.15 to 0.18 mmol/L in empagliflozin groups, 0.14 mmol/L with metformin, and 0.09 with sitagliptin as add-on to metformin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc13-0663/-/DC1">Supplementary Table 1</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s9"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>This open-label extension trial investigated long-term safety and efficacy of empagliflozin, metformin, and sitagliptin. Significant reductions in HbA<sub>1c</sub>, FPG, and body weight with empagliflozin compared with placebo have already been reported in the preceding 12-week dose-finding trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This extension trial demonstrated that long-term empagliflozin treatment provided sustained glycemic control and body weight loss in patients with type 2 diabetes for up to 90 weeks.</p><p>Furthermore, long-term treatment with empagliflozin was well tolerated. In this extension trial, the proportion of patients with at least one AE in empagliflozin groups was similar to that with metformin and sitagliptin as add-on to metformin. Most AEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Serious AEs were reported more frequently with sitagliptin compared with empagliflozin or metformin. The range in the number of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation in empagliflozin groups was similar to the number with metformin and sitagliptin as add-on to metformin. The number of patients with hypoglycemic events was low in all groups. The range in the number of patients with events consistent with urinary tract infection was similar between empagliflozin and comparators on the same background therapy, but more patients on background metformin therapy reported events compared with those on monotherapy. This may be due to differences in patient demographics or investigator or patient reporting; the effect of background metformin therapy is unlikely to cause these differences. In phase III trials of empagliflozin (data not published) and other SGLT2 inhibitors as monotherapy or add-on to metformin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), the overall frequency of events consistent with urinary tract infections did not differ by background therapy. Events consistent with genital infection were reported more frequently in empagliflozin groups compared with metformin or sitagliptin as add-on to metformin, but events were mostly mild and few led to treatment discontinuation. Changes in eGFR were small and comparable among treatment groups.</p><p>Long-term safety and efficacy data are important for agents that may be used for chronic treatment. In this trial, empagliflozin showed a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio with clinically meaningful and sustained efficacy with good tolerability for up to 90 weeks. However, its open-label design, and the fact that only 73.3% of patients from the preceding trials continued in the extension study, may impact on the overall benefit-to-risk assessment of empagliflozin. Phase III trials will provide further information on the efficacy and safety of empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In conclusion, this extension trial demonstrated that treatment with empagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes provided sustained glycemic control and weight loss over 90 weeks and was generally well tolerated. These data provide support for the evaluation of empagliflozin as a treatment for type 2 diabetes in phase III trials.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
