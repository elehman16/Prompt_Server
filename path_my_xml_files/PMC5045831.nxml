This study evaluates the effects of two citrus fruit juices, lemon and Seville orange, on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in male healthy subjects following a single oral dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We conducted an open-label, three-way crossover study in nine healthy male volunteers. Participants received a single oral dose of sildenafil (50&#x000a0;mg) after pretreatment with 250&#x000a0;mL of either water (control), undiluted lemon juice, or Seville orange juice for 3 consecutive days. All subjects were monitored for adverse effects during the study period. Plasma samples were collected for 12&#x000a0;h after dosing and analyzed for sildenafil concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Compared with pretreatment with water, Seville orange juice significantly increased the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity and the peak plasma concentration of sildenafil by 44&#x000a0;% (90&#x000a0;% confidence interval [CI] 30&#x02013;60) and 18&#x000a0;% (90&#x000a0;% CI 108&#x02013;129), respectively, without affecting the time to reach peak plasma concentration. Additionally, Seville orange juice significantly reduced the apparent oral clearance of sildenafil by 30&#x000a0;% (90&#x000a0;% CI 63&#x02013;75) without affecting its elimination half-life. In contrast, lemon juice did not cause any significant alterations in the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil. There was no significant treatment-related adverse effects reported during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although it is considered as a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor, Seville orange only caused a mild increase in exposure to sildenafil after a single oral dose, without manifestation of any adverse effects. The enhanced bioavailability of sildenafil by Seville orange may be attributed to inhibition of its intestinal first-pass effect (CYP3A4 and or p-glycoprotein).

Sildenafil is the first available phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor used by more than 30 million men worldwide for the treatment of erectile dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sildenafil is a substrate for the intestinal and hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, which accounts for the extensive first-pass effect and an oral bioavailability of only 40&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Owing to the significant contribution of CYP3A4 in the biotransformation of sildenafil, the concomitant intake of drugs or herbal remedies that inhibit CYP3A4 may cause serious drug interactions.</p><p>Consumption of citrus fruit and their juices is very common worldwide owing to their presumed health-promoting effects, mainly anti-oxidative and anti-proliferative activities. Since the discovery of the potential for grapefruit juice to significantly impact the pharmacokinetics, and hence, the pharmacological actions of CYP3A4 substrates, great attention has been drawn to fruit juice&#x02013;drug interactions in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It has been well established in the published literature that modulation of CYP3A4 activity could impact the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil and lead to significant drug&#x02013;drug or drug&#x02013;food interactions. However, the outcome of these interactions has been inconsistently reported. For example, grapefruit juice increases the bioavailability and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of sildenafil by 23&#x000a0;% without affecting its maximum plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Additionally, co-administration of ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin significantly increases sildenafil bioavailability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In contrast, pummelo juice, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, reduces the rate and extent of sildenafil absorption to around 60&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Seville orange, one of the common varieties of the <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> species, previously called <italic>Fructus aurantii</italic>, is also the botanical name of a plant commonly known as bitter orange, sour orange, or green orange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Seville orange has been used as an ingredient of dietary supplements marketed for weight loss aid owing to its claimed effects on metabolism, increasing the basal metabolic rate and lipolysis, and also as an appetite suppressant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Lemon (<italic>Citrus lemon</italic>) is a yellow fruit used for both culinary and cleaning purposes primarily for its juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Many physicians in the Middle East recommend the use of lemon juice with sildenafil to enhance its effects. However, to our knowledge, there is no scientific evidence supporting these claims.</p><p>Both Seville orange and lemon are safe for daily intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Chemotaxonomically, they belong to the same genus as grapefruit and share many common constituents, especially furanocoumarins. Theoretically, these citrus juices may have similar potential for causing food&#x02013;drug interactions by inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4. Medications metabolized by the intestinal CYP3A4 enzyme (potent first-pass effect) such as sildenafil are required to be evaluated for potential interaction with juices affecting intestinal CYP3A4 enzyme in clinical research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Seville orange and lemon juices on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil in healthy volunteers after a single 50-mg oral dose.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Nine healthy male volunteers were included in the study.

Consumption of Seville orange juice, but not lemon juice, significantly enhanced the extent of absorption of sildenafil. This increase in the systemic exposure of sildenafil was not associated with any adverse effects. Additionally, neither of these citrus fruit juices altered the rate of absorption as <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> was reached at approximately 1&#x000a0;h in all groups. Therefore, we do not anticipate any delay in the onset of action from sildenafil after drinking lemon or Seville orange juices.</p><p>Previous animal studies were in agreement with our results. Bioavailability of amiodarone, a CYP3A4 substrate, was increased dramatically in rats pre-treated with Seville orange extract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Both grapefruit and Seville orange revealed a similar significant increase in felopdipine pharmacokinetics by increasing AUC of felopdipine by 76 and 93&#x000a0;%, respectively, through inactivation of intestinal CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although very few human studies are available, they report conflicting conclusions regarding the effect of Seville orange on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates. Di Marco et al. revealed that the bioavailability of dextromethorphan was increased significantly with Seville orange juice and the effects lasted 3&#x000a0;days, suggesting an irreversible inhibition of gut CYP3A4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In another study in healthy subjects, the AUC of cyclosporine was increased only with grapefruit juice but not with Seville orange juice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Unexpectedly, both the rate and the extent of absorption of colchicine, a CYP3A4 substrate, were significantly impaired by Seville orange juice in healthy volunteers as reflected by a 1-h delay in <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> with a 24 and 20&#x000a0;% decrease in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Few studies report the inhibitory effects of <italic>C. lemon</italic> on CYP3A4 enzymes. In 2001, Baltes et al. reported the first study for a potential interaction of lemon juice with hydroxytestosterone through inhibition of CYP3A4 activity. Lemon juice significantly inhibited 6-hydroxytestosterone production in an in-vitro model of human lymphoblastoid cell line (h3A4/OR)-expressing CYP3A4 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In another in-vitro study, lemon juice inhibited CYP3A4-mediated hydroxylation of both testosterone and midazolam with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 6.20 and 19.10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;M, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Contrary to these published reports, when sildenafil was administered with lemon juice in the current study, no significant changes on the absorption or elimination pharmacokinetics of sildenafil were observed. To our knowledge, we report the first in-vivo or human study regarding the effects of lemon juice on the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil.</p><p>Like grapefruit, bergamottin and 6-,7-dihydroxybergamottin (the main furanocoumarins in Seville orange and lemon juice) are expected to be the primary compounds affecting CYP3A4 inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Other components such as naringin, the major flavonoid in Seville orange, also showed inhibitory effects in human liver microsomes in vitro. However, the amounts of these components in grapefruit juice are too low to account for the inhibition of CYP3A4 by grapefruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>It has been reported that naringin, the second major compound found in citrus fruits, is an inhibitor of p-glycoprotein (p-gp)-mediated efflux in the intestinal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Both Seville orange and lemon contain similar concentrations of bergamottin to grapefruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, and according to our results, pharmacokinetic interactions were only significant with Seville orange but not with lemon juice. These results suggest that bergamottin and 6-,7-dihydroxybergamottin are not the only compounds responsible for CYP3A4 inhibition and other compounds may also have a role in these pharmacokinetics alterations. In the case of Seville orange, the enhanced AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> could be attributed to inhibition of intestinal CYP3A4 and/or intestinal p-gp activity. A reduction in CL/<italic>F</italic> without any significant effect on <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> may support the hypothesis that the enhanced increase in exposure to sildenafil by Seville orange is attributed only to inhibition of the intestinal first-pass effect. The unexpected findings with lemon juice, although believed to have similar ingredients as grapefruit and Seville orange, may be owing to the difference in concentrations of these compounds, especially bergamottin, 6-,7-dihydroxybergamottin, and naringin.</p><p>Therefore, further investigations are required to study the effect of each compound on CYP3A4 and p-gp activities. A recent in-vitro study has shown that sildenafil is a substrate for both CYP3A4 and efflux transporters such as p-gp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, it may be possible that both CYP3A4 and p-gp would contribute to the low oral bioavailability of sildenafil in a concerted manner, and the inhibitory effect of Seville orange juice on intestinal CYP3A4 and/or p-gp may explain the enhanced bioavailability of sildenafil in the current study.</p><p>Because sildenafil is commonly indicated in an on-demand basis, this study only examined the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of sildenafil in adult male volunteers. However, it should be noted that sildenafil is also indicated for pulmonary arterial hypertension and may be prescribed to male and female adults, children, and neonates. Owing to the potential sex- and age-related differences in CYP3A4 activity in humans, extrapolation of the results of our study to female individuals, children, and to chronic treatment conditions may require further investigation.</p><p>Although only healthy Egyptian subjects were included in this study, it has been reported that Egyptian and Middle East populations show similar incidences to Caucasians with regard to allelic frequencies of the tested variants of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. Therefore, the effects of Seville orange and <italic>C. lemon</italic> juices are expected to be similar to that of European people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We report that short-term consumption of Seville orange juice causes an increase in systemic exposure of sildenafil, without causing any adverse effects. In contrast, we report that short-term consumption of lemon juice did not appear to have any effect on sildenafil pharmacokinetics. Further investigation of the impact of each major constituent of the citrus fruits is necessary to understand their effects on CYP3A4 and drug transporters.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Pharmaceutical Research Center in the Tanta University Faculty of Pharmacy for their assistance in the clinical study and HPLC analysis.
