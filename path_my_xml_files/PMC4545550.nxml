In the YHIP study (Yoga&#x02019;s effect on Hypertension In Primary care) of yoga in primary health care patients with hypertension, we showed that a short home-based yoga program had an antihypertensive effect and improved self-rated quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Persistent hypertension increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), such as heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The metabolic biomarkers HbA1c, fasting plasma (FP-) glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) are known risk factors for CVDs and they are often associated with elevated blood pressure as part of the metabolic syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The opposite applies to high density lipoproteins (HDL), where high levels seem to protect against CVD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The metabolic syndrome is a combination of certain risk factors that multiply the risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. To be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome, a patient has to have at least three of the following five conditions: Central obesity (waist circumference&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;102&#x000a0;cm or&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;88&#x000a0;cm in male and female respectively); Blood pressure&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;130/85&#x000a0;mmHg (or receiving drug therapy for hypertension); Triglycerides&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1.7&#x000a0;mmol/L (or receiving therapy for hypertriglyceridemia); HDL&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.0&#x000a0;mmol/L or&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1.3&#x000a0;mmol/L in male and female respectively) and; FP-glucose &#x02265;5.6&#x000a0;mmol/L (or receiving drug therapy for hyperglycemia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Other studies have shown that dietary intervention combined with yoga has a positive effect on these metabolic biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>The inflammatory blood tests high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) reflect the degree of inflammation in the body, and high levels of hs-CRP (&#x02265;2.78&#x000a0;mg/L) and IL-6 (&#x02265;3.19&#x000a0;pg/mL) have been associated with increased risk of death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. High levels of hs-CRP also seem to be a predictor of cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. IL-10 is a cytokine with anti-inflammatory effects. Some studies suggest that yoga practice lowers the levels of hs-CRP and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and increases levels of anti-inflammatory proteins that in turn increases IL-10 levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Previous studies also indicate a connection between hypertension alone and systemic low-grade inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>The effects of yoga on inflammatory biomarkers and metabolic risk factors have, however, not been studied in a primary care setting, although most patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome are treated in primary care. The aim of the study was to assess the benefit of yoga on inflammatory biomarkers and metabolic risk factors in a high risk population of primary health care patients with hypertension.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>The YHIP study, from which the blood samples are taken, was a prospective three-arm single-center study of the effects of two types of yoga on BP and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There were two intervention groups and one control group. The study was designed as a matched controlled open clinical trial. Blood tests, BMI-, waist circumference-, BP measurements and assessments of lifestyle, health status and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] were carried out at baseline and after 12&#x000a0;weeks of intervention. The groups were matched based on SBP after baseline assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients and recruitment</title><p>In January 2011, adult patients with diagnosed hypertension were identified by electronic charts search at Svedala Health Care Center in Southern Sweden. Patients were invited to participate if their BP when most recently measured at the health care center was between 120 and 160/80 and 100&#x000a0;mm Hg (e.g. normal, high normal and grade 1 hypertension levels). The patients who agreed to participate were invited to the health care center for baseline assessments. Patients with BP values of 120&#x02013;179/&#x0003c;110&#x000a0;mmHg in the baseline check were eligible for enrollment. Fasting blood samples were collected and analyzed for HbA1c, FP-glucose, cholesterol, TGs, HDL, LDL and hs-CRP. For each patient three cryo tubes with blood were frozen for future analysis of IL-6 and IL-10. Baseline assessments and study questionnaires (lifestyle and health status survey and quality of life were completed after written informed consent was obtained from the participants.</p><p>All participants were requested not to change their medication during the study, and any change in medication was registered at follow-up after 12&#x000a0;weeks.

Intervention group 1 (28 persons) was divided into three smaller groups, each consisting of 8&#x02013;12 participants. Each group met once a week for 60&#x000a0;min at the health care center to practice yoga with a yoga instructor. The participants were encouraged to practice yoga 30&#x000a0;min every day at home between the yoga classes. The participants in intervention group 2 (28 persons) were each given a doctor&#x02019;s appointment (20&#x000a0;min) during which they received instructions for two yoga exercises to perform at home for a combined total of 15&#x000a0;min a day. No changes were made for the participants in the control group, who received treatment as usual. In order to evaluate compliance with yoga practice, each participant received a yoga calendar in which to record when they did yoga. For further details regarding the interventions please refer to our previously published article [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome</title><p>The main outcome measure was change in blood inflammatory and metabolic factor levels. We chose to analyze inflammatory and metabolic factors with known or suspected connections to CVD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Measurements</title><p>Blood samples were collected at baseline and follow-up for assessment of the following factors: HbA1c, FP-glucose, cholesterol, TGs, HDL, LDL and hs-CRP. The blood samples were drawn in the morning after a fast since midnight.</p><p>HbA1c was analyzed using the Bio-Rad Variant II chromatographic method (reference range 31&#x02013;44&#x000a0;mmol/mol) by Swedish Mono-S high-performance ion-exchange liquid chromatography. Due to an instrument change at the laboratory during the intervention period, the following were analyzed by different methods at baseline and follow-up: FP-glucose, cholesterol, TGs and HDL. At baseline, they were measured in plasma using an LX20 analyzer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA). At follow-up the above samples were analyzed using a cobas 6000 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, SA). LDL level was calculated using the Friedewald formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The results from follow-up were recalculated according to regression equations provided by the laboratory to compensate for any differences due to the change in instrument.</p><p>The blood samples from baseline and follow-up were used for IL-6 and IL-10 levels. Serum was isolated from blood by centrifugation at 10,000&#x000a0;g at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min. Samples were analyzed using Bio-Plex Pro human cytokines assay (Bio-Rad Inc., Hercules, CA), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions with a few modifications. Briefly, samples were diluted 1:3 in the sample diluent provided with the kit and incubated with magnetic beads coupled to specific antibodies. IL-6 and IL-10 were detected with premixed detection antibody. Beads were read on a Bio-Plex Suspension Array System and the data were analyzed using Bio-Plex Manager&#x02122; software (version 4.0). Absolute concentrations were measured from a standard curve generated from nine serially diluted standards provided with the kit. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. Values are presented in pg/mL. Each run included controls of known concentration for each cytokine and a blank.</p><p>The health status and lifestyle survey was designed for this study and is not validated. The survey contains questions regarding comorbidity for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, smoking and drinking habits and physical activity.</p><p>The participants were instructed to mark the dates they completed the yoga training.

However, the average total time spent on yoga practice was higher in the yoga class group than in the yoga at home group (about 24&#x000a0;h vs. 16&#x000a0;h).</p><p>We also did separate analyzes for those patients whose BP decreased during the study (group one and two), without finding any significant change in any of the blood test before and after intervention (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We recorded no evidence that yoga altered inflammatory or metabolic biomarkers in our high risk population of primary health care patients with hypertension. Although previous studies have shown that yoga can reduce BP, our study could not detect any effects on the other metabolic risk factors examined. The effects of yoga on inflammatory biomarkers and metabolic risk factors have not been studied previously in this particular group, although most patients with hypertension and metabolic syndrome are treated in primary health care and although there is increasing interest in and uptake of yoga at community level.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that yoga practice can reduce levels of inflammatory factors such as hs-CRP and IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, none of these studies focused on patients with hypertension or metabolic syndrome, but on patients with chronic heart failure and breast cancer respectively. Nor did they look at yoga&#x02019;s effect on BP and metabolic risk factors, but on exercise capacity, mood and fatigue.</p><p>Other studies have looked at yoga&#x02019;s effect on metabolic parameters such as glucose and lipid levels in patients with CVDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In these studies, in contrast to our study, the yoga interventions were combined with other measures such as changes in diet. Two out of the three studies showed effects on the metabolic parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>One explanation for the lack of significant results of our study could be that the patients have already influenced their biomarker levels through their medication (BP-lowering, anti-inflammatory aspirin and lipid-lowering statins) to the extent that yoga has no additional affect. There are studies suggesting that antihypertensive treatment alone attenuates circulating levels of IL-6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Since 92&#x000a0;% of the study participants were already on antihypertensive medication at baseline, the possibility of further reducing IL- 6 levels could thus have been adversely affected.</p><p>Another reason for the lack of effect is that there are many different yoga schools, and we can&#x02019;t exclude the possibility that certain types of yoga have greater impact on inflammatory and metabolic blood factors. The yoga intervention design in the above described studies varied and the length of the intervention ranged from 8 to 12 weeks, making it difficult to compare the interventions in terms of effectiveness. However, the findings could also mean that yoga cannot contribute to improve the metabolic profile or decrease inflammation in these patients.</p><p>The study has a number of strengths. Primarily, it is more comprehensive compared to other similar yoga studies.</p><p>It also investigated the effect of yoga on a large number of biomarkers and risk factors. The study focused on a high risk population, where there is often a need for additional treatment to achieve treatment goals. Strengths of this study also include excellent adherence with minimal attrition: only 3 of 83 patients failed to attend the follow-up.</p><p>On the other hand the study has a number of limitations. Our study is limited to a single form of yoga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. It may be that other schools of yoga or other yoga programs have a better impact on the biomarkers and risk factors that we studied. The participants were matched at a group level and not randomized. However, since there was no change in blood factor levels in any of the groups throughout the study, it is unlikely that randomization would have made a difference to the outcome in this case. Our rationale for matching the groups was that we wanted to ensure similar SBP values at baseline. A weakness of the study also concerns the self-reported data (yoga calendar), which is a problem in all studies of this kind. Due to an instrument change at the laboratory during the intervention period, four out of nine blood samples were analyzed by different instruments at baseline and follow up. Even though we had regression equations to compensate for the differences, we cannot exclude the possibility that the instrument change influenced the results of these tests to some extent.</p><p>For yoga to be considered a viable and accepted treatment alternative for patients with high BP and increased risk of CVD, we need research that can not only show yoga&#x02019;s effects on BP and on CVD related risk factors, but also help us understand its mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although yoga can lower BP and increase quality of life, our study, which is the first in this particular group of patients, could not confirm that the yoga performed had any effect on the biomarkers examined. Further research is needed to confirm the antihypertensive effect of yoga and to clarify how yoga affects BP and other risk factors for CVDs in hypertensive patients in a primary health care setting.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BP</term><def><p>Blood pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CVDs</term><def><p>Cardiovascular diseases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DBP</term><def><p>Diastolic BP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FP-glucose</term><def><p>Fasting plasma glucose</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HDL</term><def><p>High density lipoproteins</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>hs-CRP</term><def><p>High sensitive C-reactive protein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-6</term><def><p>Interleukin 6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-10</term><def><p>Interleukin 10</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMY</term><def><p>Institute for Medical Yoga</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LDL</term><def><p>Low density lipoproteins</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OC</term><def><p>Observed cases</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPS</term><def><p>Per-protocol set</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RAAS</term><def><p>Renin angiotensin aldosterone system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBP</term><def><p>Systolic BP</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TGs</term><def><p>Triglycerides</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interest.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>MW is the principal investigator.
