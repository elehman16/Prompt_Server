This review evaluates the incidence and impact of constipation on the lives of patients with OAB being treated with darifenacin.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Constipation data from published Phase III and Phase IIIb/IV darifenacin studies were reviewed and analyzed. Over 4000 patients with OAB (aged 18&#x02013;89 years; &#x02265;80% female) enrolled in nine studies (three Phase III [data from these fixed-dose studies were pooled and provide the primary focus for this review], three Phase IIIb, and three Phase IV). The impact of constipation was assessed by discontinuations, use of concomitant laxatives, patient-reported perception of treatment, and a bowel habit questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the pooled Phase III trials, 14.8% (50/337) of patients on darifenacin 7.5 mg/day and 21.3% (71/334) on 15 mg/day experienced constipation compared with 12.6% (28/223) and 6.2% (24/388) with tolterodine and placebo, respectively. In addition, a few patients discontinued treatment due to constipation (0.6% [2/337], 1.2% [4/334], 1.8% [4/223], and 0.3% [1/388] in the darifenacin 7.5 mg/day or 15 mg/day, tolterodine, and placebo groups, respectively), or required concomitant laxatives (3.3% [11/337], 6.6% [22/334], 7.2% [16/223], and 1.5% [6/388] in the darifenacin 7.5 mg/day or 15 mg/day, tolterodine, and placebo groups, respectively). Patient-reported perception of treatment quality was observed to be similar between patients who experienced constipation and those who did not. During the long-term extension study, a bowel habit questionnaire showed only small numerical changes over time in frequency of bowel movements, straining to empty bowels, or number of days with hard stools.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While constipation associated with darifenacin was reported in &#x02264;21% of the patient population, it only led to concomitant laxative use in approximately one-third of these patients and a low incidence of treatment discontinuation. These data suggest that constipation did not impact patient perception of treatment quality.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>antimuscarinics</kwd><kwd>tolerability</kwd><kwd>overactive bladder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Overactive bladder (OAB) is a chronic condition characterized by urinary urgency, with or without urge incontinence, usually with increased frequency of micturition and nocturia, and in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dhps-4-127">1</xref> It is estimated that OAB affects approximately 11% of adults in Europe and Canada.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dhps-4-127">2</xref> The condition is associated with considerable impairment of many aspects of patients&#x02019; quality of life, such as sleep and mental health,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dhps-4-127">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dhps-4-127">4</xref> while &#x02265;65% of sufferers with OAB report a negative impact on daily living.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5-dhps-4-127">5</xref> The total economic costs of OAB are estimated to be approximately US$12 billion in the USA<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dhps-4-127">6</xref> and &#x020ac;4 billion in Europe.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dhps-4-127">7</xref></p><p>Antimuscarinic drugs remain a first-line pharmacologic treatment option for OAB.

Amongst available antimuscarinics, darifenacin has the highest relative affinity for the M<sub>3</sub> receptor over other receptor subtypes (including M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>) compared with other commonly prescribed antimuscarinics, including oxybutynin (selective for M<sub>3</sub> over M<sub>2</sub>), propiverine (nonselective), solifenacin (selective for M<sub>3</sub> over M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>), and tolterodine (nonselective).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dhps-4-127">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dhps-4-127">17</xref></p><p>Muscarinic receptors are also present in the gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle in similar proportions to that observed in the bladder<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-dhps-4-127">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23-dhps-4-127">23</xref> and it is currently thought that M<sub>3</sub> receptors are primarily responsible for gastrointestinal muscle contractions.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24-dhps-4-127">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-dhps-4-127">26</xref> As a result, antagonism of M<sub>3</sub> receptors may slow colonic transit and consequently lead to altered bowel habits and symptoms of constipation. However, in mice lacking the M<sub>3</sub> receptor, small but significant contractions in the ileum remained, suggesting that M<sub>2</sub> receptors may play a larger role in gut motility than thought previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-dhps-4-127">27</xref></p><p>Constipation, defined as a functional bowel disorder that presents as persistently difficult, infrequent, or seemingly incomplete defecation, which does not meet irritable bowel syndrome criteria,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-dhps-4-127">28</xref> is highly prevalent in the general population.

Upon completion of the placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to 12 weeks&#x02019; double-blind treatment with study medication (placebo or fixed-doses of darifenacin 7.5 mg or 15 mg once daily). One study also included a tolterodine treatment group, who received 4 mg/day (2 mg twice daily). The main inclusion criteria were: men and women aged &#x02265;18 years with symptoms of OAB for &#x02265;6 months; 5&#x02013;50 IEs/week; an average of &#x02265;8 micturitions/day; and at least one urgency episode/day. For all studies, patients with severe constipation (&#x0003c;3 defecations a week) were excluded. Tolerability and safety were evaluated from withdrawal rates and AEs. AEs were reported by the patients during treatment and 14 days after the end of treatment, recorded by the investigator and coded in the study databases using coding symbols for a thesaurus of adverse reaction terms (COSTART) criteria.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47-dhps-4-127">47</xref> AEs were tabulated by body system, eg, digestive system, nervous system, and body as a whole.

However, AEs may arise as a result of the action of these drugs on muscarinic receptors located throughout the body. Constipation is one such side effect that is commonly reported in association with antimuscarinic treatment and most likely manifests due to antagonism of muscarinic receptors in the gut. Different incidence rates for constipation have been reported in published material on oral antimuscarinic treatments. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-dhps-4-127">34</xref> However, the incidence of constipation with placebo also varies between studies; when adjusting for the differences in placebo rates, the odds ratios for constipation seen on active treatments ranged from 1.3 to 3.0 (oxybutynin and solifenacin, respectively) compared with placebo,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34-dhps-4-127">34</xref> with higher frequency seen with higher doses of individual compounds.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dhps-4-127">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33-dhps-4-127">33</xref> In pooled Phase III studies for darifenacin, the observed rates of constipation were between 2.39 and 3.4 times the placebo rate, for the low (7.5 mg) and high (15 mg) doses, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dhps-4-127">11</xref></p><p>Focusing on the pooled Phase III data, the proportion of patients with constipation who discontinued treatment in the darifenacin dose groups was numerically similar to placebo (4%, 5.6%, and 4.2% for darifenacin 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and placebo, respectively). This low rate of discontinuation due to constipation seen in the darifenacin studies may indicate that patients did not perceive their symptoms to be particularly bothersome.</p><p>Furthermore, the overall use of laxatives in these studies could be considered low across treatment groups (5.9% and 9.5% for darifenacin 7.5 mg/day and 15 mg/day, respectively, compared with 6.1% for placebo). Only a slight increase in the use of laxatives in patients reporting constipation as an AE compared with those not reporting constipation was noted (3.3%, 6.6%, and 1.5% in patients on darifenacin 7.5 mg, 15 mg, and placebo respectively, compared with 2.7%, 3.0%, and 3.1%, respectively). These results support the observation that most reported occurrences of constipation were mild in severity. In addition, patients in the pooled Phase III studies experiencing constipation (ie, with recorded symptoms of constipation) did not differ from those without constipation (ie, no recorded incidences of constipation) in terms of satisfaction with treatment, willingness to re-use drug, or preference for the received medication compared with previous OAB therapy. The observation that constipation occurring during darifenacin treatment has only limited impact on patients&#x02019; experience is further supported by observations from the long-term use of darifenacin. Patient-reported bowel symptoms, such as constipation, did not change substantially in the 2-year extension study, compared with short-term (12-week) treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-dhps-4-127">42</xref></p><p>This long-term study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-dhps-4-127">42</xref> and a study in patients with OAB aged &#x02265;65 years<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46-dhps-4-127">46</xref> both utilized bowel habit questionnaires. Results of the questionnaire in older patients (as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-dhps-4-127">Figure 4B</xref>) showed no significant deterioration in bowel habit parameters compared with placebo, despite constipation being reported at a comparable rate to that seen in other darifenacin studies. These results were in line with those observed for bowel habits of the patient population in the 2-year long-term extension study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42-dhps-4-127">42</xref> Therefore, the symptoms described by patients may have been reported as constipation but the changes in bowel habits may not have been significant nor seen as bothersome in many cases. This may indicate that the procedures for reporting AEs in clinical trials could lead to the incidence of constipation with darifenacin being overstated. Patients who report a reduction in bowel movements may be categorized under the standard term constipation, although the level of bother experienced by the individual patient may not be sufficient to necessitate a clinical diagnosis of constipation.</p><p>In general, trials in OAB have concentrated on clinical outcomes such as the proportion of patients experiencing a particular AE. However, other parameters such as patient-reported outcomes may offer a truer picture of the impact of a drug&#x02019;s tolerability and the impact on the patient. In the pooled analysis of Phase III studies, those patients who experienced constipation reported levels of satisfaction and willingness to re-use darifenacin similar or even more positive than those who did not report constipation symptoms.</p><p>Although this type of analysis is useful for generating hypotheses and providing large patient numbers, there are limitations to both the analysis and the original studies. In the current analysis the small patient numbers in some subsets should be taken into account when interpreting the data. It should also be noted that although the original studies provide data on constipation they were not designed to address the question on the impact of constipation on patients. Furthermore, in the original studies, the grouping of several different COSTART terms as constipation may also be a contributing factor to relatively high rates of AEs being reported. The incidence rates may have been lower if the more stringent Rome III criteria (Rome Foundation Inc, Raleigh, NC) had been used, as this would have required a specific combination of symptoms to be present to permit a diagnosis of constipation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-dhps-4-127">29</xref> The Rome III diagnostic criteria for functional constipation are: loose stools are rarely present without the use of laxatives with insufficient criteria for irritable bowel syndrome; plus two or more of the following: fewer than three defecations per week; straining, lumpy or hard stools in at least 25% of defecations, sensation of incomplete evacuation in at least 25% of defecations, sensation of anorectal obstruction/blockage in at least 25% of defecations, or manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation (eg, digital evacuation, support of the pelvic floor) in at least 25% of defecations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49-dhps-4-127">49</xref> These criteria must be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset and at least 6 months prior to diagnosis.</p><p>In conclusion, the data reviewed here from published Phase III and Phase IV darifenacin clinical studies indicate that although constipation associated with darifenacin use was a common occurrence, it is principally a tolerability issue with the vast majority of cases reported as mild or moderate in severity. Few patients discontinued treatment due to constipation and overall, patients who reported constipation tended to have the same overall satisfaction with darifenacin treatment as patients who did not report constipation as an AE. Therefore, constipation should not be a main factor influencing the use of darifenacin for treatment of OAB.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Funding for editorial support, drafting, and revising the manuscript by ACUMED<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> and for the analysis was provided by Novartis Pharma AG.
