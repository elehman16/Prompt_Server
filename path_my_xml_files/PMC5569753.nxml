However, less is known of the value of ProCore fine needle biopsy (FNB). This prospective, comparative study compares the outcomes of EUS-guided FNA (EUS FNA) and FNB, in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy and masses of unknown origin.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Results were compared for cellularity and adequacy for all patients who had cytological/histological specimens taken. Patients were randomized into Group A (undergone EUS FNA only) and Group B (EUS FNA + FNB). Patients were followed up for 3 months and final diagnosis was made.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Sixty-one patients underwent EUS for mediastinal lymphadenopathy and had specimens taken through FNA, FNB, or both. Four patients lost to follow-up and therefore were excluded from analysis. Of the remaining 57 patients, adequacy and inadequacy of EUS FNA sample were seen in 41 (71.93%) and 16 (21.07%), respectively. Of the 29 patients undergoing both procedures, the adequacy in FNA and FNB were 20 (68.97%) and 23 (79.31%), respectively. The difference was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The diagnostic sensitivity of aspirated material obtained using EUS-FNA needle and ProCore needle in mediastinal masses and lymph nodes was comparable in our study.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
