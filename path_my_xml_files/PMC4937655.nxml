Results from the PLATelet inhibition and patient Outcomes (PLATO) phase III trial showed that, compared with clopidogrel&#x02009;+&#x02009;aspirin, ticagrelor&#x02009;+&#x02009;aspirin significantly reduced the rate of myocardial infarction/stroke/death from vascular causes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS)<xref rid="C2">2</xref>. Subsequently, ticagrelor has been approved for use in the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult ACS patients in more than 70 countries, including the EU<xref rid="C3">3</xref> and the United States<xref rid="C4">4</xref>. Recently updated European guidelines recommend ticagrelor combined with aspirin as one of several antiplatelet therapies for managing ACS patients with non-ST-segment elevation<xref rid="C5">5</xref>. Furthermore, updated European guidelines also gave ticagrelor a Class I recommendation for patients presenting with persistent ST-segment elevation<xref rid="C6">6</xref>.</p><p>The complexity of ACS necessitates the use of multiple drugs to manage the disease and a wide variety of co-morbidities<xref rid="C7">7</xref>,<xref rid="C8">8</xref>. Consequently, drug&#x02013;drug interactions may occur which could result in altered exposure to a co-administered drug, thereby affecting efficacy and safety<xref rid="C9">9</xref>,<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. The most abundant drug-metabolizing enzyme in the liver is cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A<xref rid="C11">11</xref>,<xref rid="C12">12</xref>, and clinically important interactions involving this enzyme are well documented<xref rid="C12">12</xref>. Although ticagrelor is a direct-acting antiplatelet agent, it is metabolized to at least ten metabolites<xref rid="C13">13</xref>. The major metabolite, AR-C124910XX, which is present at approximately 30&#x02013;40% of the levels of ticagrelor<xref rid="C13 C14 C15 C16 C17">13&#x02013;17</xref>, is approximately equipotent in inhibiting platelet aggregation (AstraZeneca, data on file). Experiments with human liver microsomes demonstrated that ticagrelor is principally metabolized by CYP3A<xref rid="C18">18</xref>.</p><p>AR-C124910XX is further metabolized by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase to a highly polar glucuronidated metabolite, or via hydroxylation by an unknown isoenzyme to a minor hydroxylated derivative. Given that the glucuronidated metabolite is highly polar and expected to be excreted rapidly in the urine, and the hydroxylated metabolite is minor, the pharmacological relevance of these biotransformations is likely to be minimal<xref rid="C13">13</xref>.</p><p>The evaluation of potential drug&#x02013;drug interactions is important in drug development. Known inhibitors of CYP3A are commonly used as model compounds to investigate such interactions<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. Diltiazem is a calcium channel blocker used to treat angina pectoris and mild-to-moderate arterial hypertension<xref rid="C19">19</xref>. This compound is an inhibitor of CYP3A activity<xref rid="C20">20</xref>,<xref rid="C21">21</xref> and is classified as a moderate inhibitor of this enzyme<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. The antifungal agent, ketoconazole<xref rid="C22">22</xref>,<xref rid="C23">23</xref>, also inhibits CYP3A<xref rid="C24">24</xref> and is considered to be a strong CYP3A inhibitor<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. Both of these agents are commonly used in evaluating the effects of CYP3A inhibition on the pharmacokinetic parameters of co-administered drugs<xref rid="C10">10</xref>,<xref rid="C21">21</xref>,<xref rid="C25">25</xref>.</p><p>Given the key role of CYP3A in drug metabolism, including that of ticagrelor, and multidrug use in ACS, two drug&#x02013;drug interaction studies in healthy volunteers were conducted. The primary objectives of these studies were to assess the effects of co-administration of a moderate (diltiazem) and a strong (ketoconazole) CYP3A inhibitor on ticagrelor pharmacokinetic parameters. Secondary objectives included: assessment of AR-C124910XX pharmacokinetic parameters; effect of ticagrelor on pharmacokinetic parameters of diltiazem and ketoconazole; safety and tolerability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S6"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec id="S0006-S2001" disp-level="2"><title>Study populations</title><p>Key inclusion criteria for both studies were: males or females (post-menopausal or surgically sterile); age 18&#x02013;45 years; body weight &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg; and a body mass index (BMI) of 18&#x02013;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>.

Moreover, these results were also comparable with findings from studies in healthy volunteers<xref rid="C14">14</xref>. For example, following a single oral dose of ticagrelor (100&#x02009;mg) in healthy volunteers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9), mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation (SD) for AUC was 3683&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;753 and 1460&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;408&#x02009;ng&#x000b7;h/mL for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX, respectively<xref rid="C14">14</xref>. The consistency of pharmacokinetic parameters for ticagrelor and AR-C124910XX in the present studies with other results confirms their validity in investigating drug&#x02013;drug interactions with model CYP3A inhibitors.</p><p>Our findings demonstrated that moderate inhibition of CYP3A by diltiazem resulted in a near doubling of ticagrelor&#x02019;s half-life, and significantly increased <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> (69%) and AUC (174%) for ticagrelor. The metabolism of ticagrelor was also reduced as shown by the significant reduction in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and the slight decrease in AUC for AR-C124910XX, such that the metabolite:parent ratio was reduced from approximately 30% (without diltiazem) to 10% (with diltiazem). These results demonstrate that CYP3A is involved in the conversion of ticagrelor to AR-C124910XX and confirm the <italic>in vitro</italic> findings<xref rid="C18">18</xref>.</p><p>It is well-recognized that there is a wide overlap of substrates between CYP3A and P-glycoprotein<xref rid="C29">29</xref>, and studies have shown that ticagrelor is a substrate for both proteins<xref rid="C18">18</xref> (AstraZeneca, data on file). Given that diltiazem is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein<xref rid="C10">10</xref>, its action in increasing ticagrelor exposure may result from inhibition of both CYP3A and P-glycoprotein.</p><p>Increased exposure to ticagrelor and reduced metabolism to its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) resulting from diltiazem co-administration are unlikely to affect the efficacy of ticagrelor. Both the parent compound and AR-C124910XX directly inhibit platelet aggregation<xref rid="C30">30</xref> and are approximately equipotent in this respect (AstraZeneca, data on file). Therefore, the decreased exposure to AR-C124910XX may offset some of the effect of the increased exposure to the parent compound. However, as increased exposure to ticagrelor may result in prolonged inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA), the incidence of bleeding events may also increase. No such events were reported in the ticagrelor-diltiazem study, albeit with a single 90-mg ticagrelor dose in healthy volunteers (who may not have the same propensity for bleeding as ACS patients).</p><p>Similar proportional increases in exposure to ticagrelor have been reported in patients with atherosclerosis receiving 200&#x02009;mg ticagrelor twice daily (mean AUC 15,104&#x02009;ng&#x000b7;h/mL, CV 39%) compared with those receiving 100&#x02009;mg ticagrelor twice daily (5337&#x02009;ng&#x000b7;h/mL, CV 45%), at 28 days, i.e. a 283% increase in exposure compared with a dose similar to the recommended dose of ticagrelor<xref rid="C16">16</xref>.

As with diltiazem, ketoconazole is also an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. As discussed above, the action of ketoconazole in increasing ticagrelor exposure may result from inhibition of both CYP3A and P-glycoprotein. Further studies are needed to assess the respective contributions of these pathways to increased ticagrelor exposure.</p><p>Of the 14 healthy volunteers in the ticagrelor-ketoconazole study, two bleeding events were recorded, possibly due to the higher exposure to ticagrelor. In contrast, the maximum tolerated single dose of ticagrelor (900&#x02009;mg) in healthy volunteers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) resulted in a much higher exposure to ticagrelor (mean [% CV], <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> 5153 [42]&#x02009;ng/mL; AUC 39,153 [38]&#x02009;ng&#x000b7;h/mL) and no bleeding-related AEs were recorded<xref rid="C26">26</xref>,<xref rid="C27">27</xref>. However, both of these healthy volunteer studies were of short duration and only investigated a single ticagrelor dose. As the co-administration of the strong CYP3A inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in a &#x02265;5-fold increase in ticagrelor AUC, this finding indicates a significant drug&#x02013;drug interaction<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. Thus, long-term co-administration of ticagrelor with drugs classified as strong CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended<xref rid="C3">3</xref>,<xref rid="C4">4</xref>.</p><p>In addition to inhibiting CYP3A activity, diltiazem and ketoconazole are also substrates for CYP3A<xref rid="C33">33</xref>,<xref rid="C34">34</xref>. Ticagrelor has been shown to be a weak-to-moderate inhibitor of CYP3A activity <italic>in vitro</italic><xref rid="C18">18</xref>. However, in the current studies, a single dose of ticagrelor did not affect the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem or the ability to achieve steady-state ketoconazole plasma levels. In contrast, while the current data do not apparently support <italic>in vitro</italic> observations, other healthy volunteer studies have demonstrated that ticagrelor can have a clinically significant effect by increasing exposure to other CYP3A substrates, such as atorvastatin and simvastatin. A recent study demonstrated that ticagrelor increased mean atorvastatin <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC by 23% and 36%, respectively<xref rid="C35">35</xref>. Similarly, simvastatin <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC were increased by 81% and 56% with ticagrelor<xref rid="C35">35</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that all volunteers in the diltiazem study were Hispanic, whereas the majority of volunteers in the ketoconazole study were Caucasian. As some differences in CYP3A activity have been observed between different races<xref rid="C36">36</xref>, some caution should be used in applying these data more broadly.</p><p>Patients with ACS have a wide variety of co-morbidities and often receive multiple drugs<xref rid="C7">7</xref>,<xref rid="C8">8</xref>. The results of the present studies indicate that clinically significant drug&#x02013;drug interactions with ticagrelor are likely to occur with co-administration of strong, but not moderate, CYP3A inhibitors. Examples of drugs which are strong CYP3A inhibitors include certain antifungal agents (e.g., itraconazole), antibiotics (e.g., clarithromycin, telithromycin), antiretroviral drugs (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir) and antidepressants (e.g., nefazodone)<xref rid="C10">10</xref>. Thus, co-administration of such agents is contraindicated with ticagrelor, and alternative drugs should be considered<xref rid="C3">3</xref>,<xref rid="C4">4</xref>. However, ticagrelor can be co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors and no dose adjustment is required<xref rid="C3">3</xref>,<xref rid="C4">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, co-administration of ticagrelor with CYP3A inhibitors resulted in higher exposure to ticagrelor and lower exposure to its metabolite, AR-C124910XX. The magnitude of these effects suggests that moderate CYP3A inhibitors can be co-administered with ticagrelor without the need to modify the dose of ticagrelor. In contrast, co-administration of ticagrelor with strong CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the Principal Investigators, Dr K.
