They are multifactorial, but most common etiology is specific species of the microorganisms present in supra- and sub-gingival plaque.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Hence, removal of plaque is one means to prevent disease as it brings about a change in habitat of the oral cavity.</p><p>Established methods of plaque removal include different mechanical and chemical processes. By far, mechanical plaque removal remains the common way to control plaque. Manual toothbrush is the most common vehicle used in mechanical method. At present, different types of toothbrushes are available. Although plaque removal by mechanical method is important for prevention and maintenance of periodontal disease, majority of the population do not brush in a proper manner, which results in poor oral health status of the individuals.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>In the 1960s, electric toothbrush was introduced by Dr. Philippe Guy Woog. The ease of use was cited as a potential advantage of powered toothbrush over manual toothbrush especially among differently abled population who may lack manual dexterity required for optimum oral hygiene maintenance.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Poor oral hygiene among differently abled population may be due to their functional limitations and limited access to undergo oral examination.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>A significant number of studies have been done comparing plaque removing efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Literature comparing the plaque-removing efficacy between manual and powered toothbrushes has given contradictory results with few studies claiming superiority of powered toothbrushes over manual toothbrushes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] While few studies found no such difference.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Moreover, published literature comparing plaque-removing efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes among the differently abled adults is sparse. Hence, the present study was undertaken with the hypothesis &#x02013; &#x0201c;Is Powered toothbrush better than Manual toothbrush in removing dental plaque?&#x0201d; among differently abled in Mysore City.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a double-blind, crossover, randomized controlled trial conducted in an institution for differently abled in Mysore city, India. Study was conducted in accordance with Declaration of Helsinki. Ethical clearance for the study was obtained from Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC). Before the start of the study, permission from the head of the differently abled institution was obtained. Study was conducted over a period of 1 month from December 2016 to January 2017.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Training and calibration</title><p>Training and calibration of principal investigator involved in data collection were undertaken at Department of Public Health Dentistry. Turesky's Modification of Quigley-Hein plaque index was discussed with subject experts to clarify ambiguity related to scoring before the calibration procedure was undertaken. Calibration was done on ten participants.</p><p>Participants were allotted in a random manner when examination procedures were undertaken. Allotment of participants was done by faculty, and assessment was done in their supervision. Clinical oral examination was done using sterile instruments under adequate illumination. Cronbach's alpha for intraexaminer reliability was 0.78.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Sample size</title><p>This study was undertaken on twenty differently abled participants selected from a school. Sample size estimation was done using nMaster software for hypothesis testing for two means (equal variances). Assuming a mean difference of 0.3 between the two methods, for an effect size of 1.2 at 5% &#x003b1; error and 80% power, sample size was computed to be 9 per group. The sample size was rounded off to 10 anticipating 10% drop out. Total sample size turned out to be 20 in view of crossover design.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Selection of study participants</title><p>After obtaining permission from the head of the differently abled institute, individuals were screened initially. Individuals and their respective care taker and in-charge staff were explained about study procedures and confidentiality of their participation. Individuals who were willing to participate and satisfied eligibility criteria were included in the study. Participants who could brush on their own (mentally undisturbed, assessed by participant's medical record available in institution office) were included while those with orthodontic appliances and implants were excluded. Twenty participants were recruited after initial screening. Informed consent was obtained before the start of the study. These twenty participants were randomly allocated into two groups through computer-generated random allocation sequence. Each participant in Group I were given an oral hygiene kit coded I, while participants in Group II were given an oral hygiene kit coded II in Phase I of the study. Group allocation and distribution of coded oral hygiene kit were done by coordinator who was not involved in data collection. Investigator collecting data on dental plaque was blinded. Each participant received coded oral hygiene kit consisting of manual/powered toothbrush and toothpaste.</p><p>Participants who received the manual toothbrushes were instructed to follow their routine practice while those receiving powered toothbrush followed manufacturer's instructions. Study schedule was handed out to all concerned care takers. On the 8<sup>th</sup> day following distribution of oral hygiene kits, staff in-charge reminded participants on returning their coded oral hygiene kit. Before their oral hygiene kits were collected back, plaque status was assessed before and after brushing. Participants were requested to refrain from oral hygiene practices for 6 h on the scheduled day of assessment (8<sup>th</sup> day). Plaque disclosing agent was dispensed into disposable plastic cups. Participants were instructed to swish the agent for 1 min and then expectorate into same disposable cup. Then, he/she was sent into examination hall where the principal investigator clinically examined these participants. Plaque scores were assessed using Turesky-Gilmore-Glickman modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index by the investigator. Then, participant was allowed to brush for 3 min. Staining and scoring of postbrushing plaque scores were done as described earlier. Allotment of participant for clinical examination in both pre- and post-brushing was done by the coordinator in a random order to ensure blinding of the investigator.</p><p>A washout period of 1 week was allowed where the participants followed their routine practice they had before the start of study. After 1 week, the groups were switched. Participants in Group I received oral hygiene kits coded II, while participants in Group II received kits coded I. Assessment of plaque status was done on the 8<sup>th</sup> day following the distribution of oral hygiene kits using the method described in Phase I of the study. No changes were made in the research protocol after the commencement of the study, and final analysis was done after completing Phase II of the study with no interim analysis.</p><p>The CONSORT flow diagram of the study is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT flow diagram of the study; <italic>n</italic>: number of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-21-138-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was done using SPSS version 22 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).

According to National Sample Survey Organization, it was estimated that 1.8% of population were disabled in the country.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Literature suggests that these people have poorer general and oral health in comparison with general population. This was attributed to their restricted activity and limited access to health care and oral health has always been neglected.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Major thrust for introduction of powered toothbrush was to improve ease of use among differently abled population with limited dexterity.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Various short- and long-term studies that assessed pre- and post-brushing plaque reduction among general population without any physical or mental disabilities using manual and powered toothbrushes found mixed results. Few studies claim superiority of powered toothbrushes over manual toothbrushes while others claim no such difference.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Vibhute and Vandana in their systematic review found no significant difference between powered and manual toothbrushes.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Yaacob <italic>et al</italic>. in a systematic review comparing manual and powered toothbrushes found powered toothbrushes to be more effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis compared to manual toothbrushes.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>However, studies comparing efficacy of these powered toothbrushes with manual brushes among disabled population are sparse.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] In view of this, the present study was undertaken to compare plaque removal efficacy of powered and manual toothbrush among differently abled in Mysore city.</p><p>In the present study, we found no significant difference in mean plaque reduction between manual and powered toothbrushes in both Phase I (<italic>P</italic> = 0.9) and Phase II (<italic>P</italic> = 0.19). The pooled data analysis combining the results of Phase I and II also found no significant difference in mean plaque reduction between manual and powered toothbrushes (<italic>P</italic> = 0.24). This clearly indicates that even the manual toothbrushes were equally effective compared to powered toothbrushes which have been specifically developed to enhance efficacy of plaque control among individuals lacking manual dexterity. These results were similar to the findings of a study by Goyal <italic>et al</italic>., who also found no significant difference in mean plaque scores among brushes in mentally challenged children (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05).[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Parizi <italic>et al</italic>. in their study also found manual toothbrushes to be equally effective in comparison with powered toothbrushes similar to our results.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Postbrushing mean plaque scores in the present study, with manual and powered toothbrush, were 1.93 &#x000b1; 0.5 and 1.96 &#x000b1; 0.4, respectively. These scores were slightly higher (postbrushing manual = 0.62 &#x000b1; 0.03, postbrushing powered = 0.93 &#x000b1; 0.03) in comparison with study conducted by Williams <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Our results were contradictory to the findings of studies who found plaque reduction to be more with powered toothbrushes.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The contradiction could be attributed to difference in study participants, study design, and methods employed to measure plaque scores. In the present study, we assessed the efficacy of plaque reduction by manual and powered toothbrushes in a single brushing. In the light of no significant differences between manual and powered toothbrushes, it is worthwhile to undertake more such studies among population with different levels of disabilities. This will enable us to understand and comment on cost-effectiveness of powered toothbrushes. However, powered toothbrushes will always be a choice when patients require assisted brushing such as those severely diseased and disabled. Compliance was found to be good with no adverse consequences reported in the present study.
