This study compares a commercially available 3-chamber bag (study group) with a conventionally compounded monobag regarding nutrition efficacy, safety, and regimen preparation time. <italic>Materials and Methods</italic>: This prospective, randomized, single-blind study was conducted at 5 Chinese hospitals from October 2010&#x02013;October 2011. Postsurgical patients requiring PN for at least 6 days were randomly assigned to receive the study or control regimen. Plasma concentrations of prealbumin and C-reactive protein (CRP), regimen preparation time, length of hospital stay (LOS), 30-day mortality, safety laboratory parameters, and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. <italic>Results</italic>: In total, 240 patients (121 vs 119 in study and control groups) participated in this study. Changes in prealbumin concentrations during nutrition support (&#x00394;<sub>Prealb(StudyGroup)</sub> = 2.65 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001 vs &#x00394;<sub>Prealb(ControlGroup)</sub> = 0.27 mg/dL, <italic>P</italic> = .606) and CRP values were comparable. Regimen preparation time was significantly reduced in the study group by the use of 3-chamber bags (t<sub>(StudyGroup)</sub> = 4.90 &#x000b1; 4.41 minutes vs t<sub>(ControlGroup)</sub> = 12.13 &#x000b1; 5.62 minutes, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). No differences were detected for LOS, 30-day mortality, safety laboratory parameters, and postoperative AEs (37 vs 38 in study and control groups). <italic>Conclusion</italic>: The PN regimen provided by the 3-chamber bag was comparable to the compounded regimen and safe in use. Time savings during regimen preparation indicates that use of 3-chamber bags simplifies the process of regimen preparation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>parenteral nutrition</kwd><kwd>3-chamber bags</kwd><kwd>multichamber bags</kwd><kwd>compounding</kwd><kwd>efficacy</kwd><kwd>patient</kwd><kwd>parenteral nutrition solutions</kwd><kwd>nutritional support</kwd><kwd>treatment outcome</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-0884533617701883"><funding-source id="funding1-0884533617701883"><institution-wrap><institution>B.

Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany), or the control regimen that was conventionally compounded and provided by monobags. Total caloric and amino acid intakes of both groups were set to 24 kcal/kg body weight/d and 1.2 g/kg body weight/d, respectively. Both mixtures provided comparable amounts of carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, and electrolytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1-0884533617701883">Table 1</xref>). Lipid composition differed between study and control regimens: while the study regimen contained a mixture of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and long-chain triglycerides (LCTs) in a 1:1 ratio, the control regimen provided LCT only. Both regimens were prepared at the compounding unit of the hospital. Three-chamber bags were mixed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions while compounding of monobags followed hospital routine. Vitamins (10 mL Soluvit N and 10 mL Vitalipid) and trace elements (10 mL Addamel N) were added to the infusion bag as required. All supplements were purchased from Fresenius Kabi (Bad Homburg, Germany). To ensure blinding, infusion bags were covered with an opaque bag and labeled with the randomization number that was assigned according to a software-generated master randomization list. Randomization was stratified for study centers. Both regimens were suited for central as well as peripheral administration and were delivered intravenously via central venous catheters, peripherally inserted central catheters (PICCs), or peripheral lines at room temperature over a period of 12&#x02013;20 hours. The maximum rate of infusion was 2.5 mL/kg body weight/h. Up to 1 bag of PN was administered corresponding to a volume of 1875 mL and 1886.5 mL for study and control regimen, respectively. Oral and/or enteral nutrition (EN) covered up to 20% of the daily caloric intake. Laboratory parameters were determined on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 7 at the laboratory of each center and included hematological parameters (hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell count, platelet count, percentage of granulocyte and hematocrit), parameters of blood coagulation function (prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time), liver function parameters (alanine aminotransferase, &#x003b3;-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, serum albumin), blood chemistry and electrolytes (triglycerides, total cholesterol, blood glucose, serum urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, and phosphate), and C-reactive protein (CRP) and prealbumin (as short-term marker for nutrition status<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup>). The change of prealbumin levels between POD 1 (ie, before administration of PN) and POD 7 (ie, after administration of PN for 6 consecutive days), &#x00394;<sub>Prealb</sub>, as the primary variable was used as an indicator for the efficacy of both PN regimens, with &#x00394;<sub>Prealb</sub> = 0 indicating maintenance of nutrition status. Compliance of PN therapy was assessed via the ratio volume<sub>administered</sub>/volume<sub>prescribed</sub>. Poor compliance was assumed for ratios &#x0003c;0.8 or &#x0003e;1.2. Time needed for PN preparation was recorded on PODs 1 and 5 to assess the workload associated with regimen preparation. Length of hospital stay (LOS) and 30-day mortality were determined via a follow-up call around POD 30. All adverse events (AEs) were recorded to assess the incidence of postoperative complications. AEs were classified according to intensity, frequency, action taken, causal relationship with the study medication, seriousness, and outcome. AEs were coded according to MedDRA system organ class (SOC) and lowest level term (LLT).</p><table-wrap id="table1-0884533617701883" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Composition of Parenteral Nutrition Regimens.</p></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_0884533617701883-table1"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Component (per Bag)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Three-Chamber Bag (NuTRIflex Lipid Peri)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Compounded Monobag</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Carbohydrates (glucose), g</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">120</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">120</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amino acid, g</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">61</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total nitrogen, g</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.6</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.7</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Lipids</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;LCT, g</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">75</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;MCT, g</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.5</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" rowspan="1">Electrolytes</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Sodium, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">75/75</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">77/77</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Potassium, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">45/45</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">30/30</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Magnesium, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5/9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4/8</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Calcium, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.5/9</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.2/4.4</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Chloride, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">72/72</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">107/107</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Zinc, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.045/0.089</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Phosphate, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.25/33.75</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.75/2.25</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02003;Acetate, mmol/mEq</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">60/60</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total energy, kJ (kcal)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6000 (1435)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">6015 (1439)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Volume, mL</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1875</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">1886.5</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Osmolarity, mOsm/L</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">840</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">818</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn1-0884533617701883"><p>LCT, long-chain triglyceride; MCT, medium-chain triglyceride.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec id="section5-0884533617701883"><title>Statistics</title><p>The study was designed to show noninferiority of the commercial 3-chamber bag in comparison to the compounded monobag.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria for participation in this clinical study ensured that PN support was used according to current guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Total caloric intake was calculated based on standard estimates of energy requirements. Since calculating caloric requirements may severely overestimate nutrition requirements of obese patients and underestimate requirements of patients with very low body weight,<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> only normal-weight participants (average body mass, Asian population: 57.7 kg<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>) were considered for study participation. Because of that, assessment of nutrition efficacy of study and control regimens in this study was restricted to normal-weight patients undergoing abdominal surgery, and transferability to other patient populations, especially obese or underweight patients, might be limited.</p><p>Prealbumin changes during nutrition therapy as a primary variable remained stable in the control group and increased by ~2.6 mg/dL in the study group. Reliability of prealbumin as a biomarker for nutrition state, however, is limited since prealbumin is a negative acute phase protein and serum levels are influenced not only by nutrition but also by the inflammatory state.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> It is now recognized that visceral proteins such as serum albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin reflect the dynamic and catabolic response to surgery, injury, or infection in postoperative patients and are not suitable to measure adequacy of nutrition support.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> At the time of protocol development, prealbumin was a commonly used marker for nutrition status due to its small pool size and short half-life. To increase the validity of prealbumin measurements, the change in prealbumin levels during nutrition treatment was investigated together with CRP levels, as suggested by Raguso et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> CRP levels revealed a comparable inflammatory state in both groups, indicating that surgery-induced inflammatory processes were comparable in study and control groups. Nevertheless, prealbumin data presented have to be interpreted carefully. Of note, study and control nutrition regimens differed in terms of lipid composition: MCTs/LCTs in the study group vs LCTs in the control group. MCTs are known to undergo faster clearance and oxidation and to allow better energy provision and nitrogen sparing than LCTs.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The increase in prealbumin of ~2.6 mg/dL observed in the study group could probably be attributed to the MCT content of the study regimen.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> The different lipid compositions administered in study and control group can also be considered a limitation of this study.</p><p>The clinical outcome reflected by the secondary outcome parameters of LOS and 30-day mortality was similar between both regimens.</p><p>The use of 3-chamber bags intends to obviate time-consuming and demanding compounding procedures by simple mixing of solutions already contained in the bag. This was confirmed by a significantly shorter preparation time for 3-chamber bags at all participating sites with saving of time ranging between 6 and 16 minutes depending on the clinical setting. By simplifying processes, use of 3-chamber bags could thus contribute to reduce workload and manpower costs, especially at the hospital pharmacy. This is in line with other studies that demonstrated differences in preparation time for monobags and 3-chamber bags in a comparable magnitude (eg, time saving using 3-chamber bags ~11 min<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and 25.9 min<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>) and showed that 3-chamber bags are more economical than compounded monobags in Swiss<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> and Spanish hospitals.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> A detailed cost analysis was not in the scope of the present clinical trial. This would be an interesting aspect to be included in further studies.</p><p>In addition to the simplification of regimen preparation, 3-chamber bags offer further advantages. Although providing a standardized PN regimen, 3-chamber bags allow safe modification by addition of supplements directly to the infusion bag. Furthermore, 3-chamber bags ease the PN regimen supply: while AIO admixtures have to be stored refrigerated and administered within 30 days, 3-chamber bags can be stored at room temperature with a shelf-life of 2 years. A particular advantage of the 3-chamber bag used in this study is its osmolarity that allows for central as well as peripheral administration and thereby contributes to further facilitate nutrition support.</p><p>Several studies indicate that use of industrially manufactured PN regimens may reduce the risk of bloodstream infections compared with compounded regimens.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-0884533617701883" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Three-chamber bags could therefore contribute to increase patient safety during PN therapy. In this study, no bloodstream infections were recorded and reported as AEs in the study and control groups. Both regimens were well tolerated and appeared safe as revealed by safety laboratory parameters and the comparable rate of electrolyte imbalances and other AEs/SAEs in the study and control groups.</p><p>In conclusion, this study showed that nutrition efficacy of a standardized PN regimen provided by 3-chamber bags was comparable to the conventionally compounded regimen. Use of 3-chamber bags was safe and well tolerated. Preparation of the standardized PN regimen was significantly shorter for 3-chamber bags than for compounded monobags. Three-chamber bags therefore have the potential to reduce manpower costs. Taking into account potential safety advantages, the central or peripheral venous administration of the 3-chamber bag used in this study should be considered for patients with nutrition requirements that can be covered using standardized PN regimens.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Shi Pan, PhD, B.
