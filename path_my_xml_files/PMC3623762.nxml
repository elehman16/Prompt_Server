During cycling exercise across the heavy and severe intensity domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], energy is provided more and more by anaerobic glycolysis. This leads to an increased rate of accumulation of metabolites, which have been linked with muscle fatigue (<italic>e.g.</italic> P<sub>i</sub>, ADP, H<sup>+</sup>, and extracellular K<sup>+</sup>). Cycling exercise at the threshold between the heavy and severe domain, <italic>i.e.</italic> at &#x02018;Critical Power&#x02019; (CP), can, in contrast to the theoretical concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], only be sustained for as long as 20 to 40&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] before task failure. Furthermore, it was shown that CP overestimates the highest possible metabolic steady state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and, consequently, that exercise at or above CP is associated with a decline in muscle and blood pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. An activity-induced decrease in intracellular pH has been suggested to limit exercise because it inhibits glycogenolysis and glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], increases muscular K<sup>+</sup>-release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and inhibits sarcoplasmatic Ca<sup>2+</sup>-release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Furthermore, it induces a metabolic acidosis that might impair muscle function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and compromise performance. To blunt the fall in intracellular pH and prolong time-to-exhaustion (<italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub>), nutritional modulation might be a promising avenue. With respect to endurance exercise, to date especially sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) has gained much attention. However, the mechanisms by which NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ingestion may enhance performance are not fully understood. It is believed that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ingestion leads to an increase in blood bicarbonate concentration ([HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]), which in turn increases extracellular buffer capacity. More precisely, it is proposed that the higher [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] gradient between blood and the intramyocellular compartment enhances H<sup>+</sup>-efflux out of the muscle cell, thereby delaying the fall in intracellular pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], which in turn may delay an impairment in optimal muscle function and performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation would be expected to improve <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP if muscle pH is a limiting factor for exercise tolerance.</p><p>Basically, three types of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation protocols can be applied: acute (single dose), chronic (multiple dose) and multiday acute supplementation (one dose per day before competition for consecutive days of competition). During the acute delivery mode participants take one single dose (mostly 0.3&#x000a0;g&#x02219; kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) 60 to 90&#x000a0;min before the start of competition. During the chronic delivery mode participants take a daily amount of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> (mostly 0.5&#x000a0;g&#x02219; kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass), divided in 2 to 3 portions, for several days before competition takes place. On the day of competition, no NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is consumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The multiday acute delivery mode comprises the ingestion of acute doses on consecutive days of competition. In contrast to the chronic loading protocol, acid&#x02013;base balance is perturbed on every day during the multiday acute delivery mode. This fact leads to major differences regarding the acid&#x02013;base status and accordingly the underlying mechanisms as well as the effectiveness of the different delivery modes. While the acute and chronic supplementation protocols are scientifically well described, data on the effects of multiday acute supplementation are lacking. There are several studies, which investigated NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ingestion during tournament-like sports, but only for single events. For example, it was shown that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation increases tennis performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] but does not affect prolonged intermittent cycling exercise performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, up to date, no study investigated the effect of a consecutive multiday supplementation on consecutive multiday performance. Since consecutive, acute-load daily use of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> might represent an interesting option to increase performance during multiday competitions or tournaments that involve exercise in the heavy and severe intensity domains, further research is warranted. In particular, scientific knowledge is limited with respect to the recovery of the body&#x02019;s acid&#x02013;base balance after high-intensity exercise with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation and consequently, the initial positions on the following days remain elusive.</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind interventional crossover study was to investigate if multiday acute NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation in well-trained endurance athletes leads to changes in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP during constant-load cycle ergometer trials on a day-to-day basis with daily acute NaHCO<sub>3</sub><italic>vs.</italic> placebo supplementation for 5&#x000a0;days. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate if differences in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> can be explained by alterations in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] and if the high amount of ingested Na<sup>+</sup> influences plasma volume (PV) and thus [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]. Given that exercise at or above CP leads to muscle and blood acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and that [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] increases extracellular buffer capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], we hypothesized that consecutive, acute-load daily supplementation of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> increases <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> relative to placebo. We assumed that an increase in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] after the first intake is responsible for the rise in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub>. Since during multiday NaHCO<sub>3</sub> intake, a high amount of Na<sup>+</sup> is ingested and absorbed, detrimental effects on endurance performance are possible. In fact, a higher [Na<sup>+</sup>] leads to water retention and thereby results in PV expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. An increase in PV decreases blood ion concentrations, and as such results in a diminished [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], which in turn could counteract the benefits associated with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> intake. It is therefore questionable, whether [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] can be increased beyond the concentration reached after the first day of supplementation on all subsequent days of supplementation. Consequently, we hypothesized that PV expands following a high Na<sup>+</sup> intake, limiting any further increase in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], and consequently <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub>, beyond that observed after the first day of supplementation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Eleven well-trained male cyclists and triathletes volunteered to participate in this study. The participants were recruited from different cycling or triathlon clubs. Two of them were excluded from the analysis because they contravened our instructions. One participant did not refrain from high-intensity exercise and the other markedly increased the training volume during or before the second testing sessions (see below). Another participant had to abort the measurements because of illness. The physical characteristics of the remaining eight participants were (mean &#x000b1; SD) age 31.4 &#x000b1; 8.8&#x000a0;years, height 184.6 &#x000b1; 6.5&#x000a0;cm, body mass 74.1 &#x000b1; 7.4&#x000a0;kg, peak power output (<italic>P</italic><sub>peak</sub>) during ramp test 402.0 &#x000b1; 29.1&#x000a0;W, peak oxygen uptake (<italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2peak</sub>) 61.0 &#x000b1; 4.3&#x000a0;ml&#x02219; kg<sup>-1</sup>&#x02219; min<sup>-1</sup>. These athletes were all involved in their early preparation phase of training (pre-season). During this phase, the training consisted of constant-load rides at low-intensity. The participants were instructed to maintain their individual, low-intensity training programs. Additionally, they were advised to refrain from any high-intensity exercise during the testing sessions and to continue their nutritional habits. The determination of CP after the wash-out phase served to ascertain that no training effect occurred during the first phase of the study. None of the participants included was currently using buffer substances or any other ergogenic agents that may have compromised the administration of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Participants were fully informed about the purposes, benefits and risks associated with this study and completed a routine health questionnaire before giving written informed consent. This study was approved by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH) ethics committee and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental overview</title><p>Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind interventional crossover design, all participants completed two exercise periods, each consisting of ten testing sessions (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These periods were separated by at least one week and on average 2.3 &#x000b1; 2.1&#x000a0;weeks of washout, during which the participants maintained their low-intensity training programs. During both periods, the first five tests were conducted to determine CP and consisted of one incremental test and four constant-load tests to volitional exhaustion. The determination of CP was followed by a five-day intervention period, which was conducted either with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or sodium chloride (NaCl) supplementation. On each day during the intervention period, a constant-load trial at CP was performed. All tests were carried out under temperature-controlled laboratory conditions (19&#x02013;24&#x000b0;C) and at the same time of day. The participants had a 23&#x000a0;h 34&#x000a0;min &#x000b1; 53&#x000a0;min and 23&#x000a0;h 22&#x000a0;min &#x000b1; 45&#x000a0;min rest period between the single tests during the placebo and NaHCO<sub>3</sub> trials, respectively. All test devices were calibrated before, and whenever indicated after each test under the terms of the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. An independent researcher randomly assigned the two conditions to the participants and administered the non-distinguishable placebo or NaHCO<sub>3</sub> tablets without revealing the ingredient. The investigator performing the tests was also blinded to the treatment. No feedback on test performance was given to the participants until all trials had been finished.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study design.</bold> C, constant-load trials at &#x02018;Critical Power&#x02019; (CP); E, constant load tests; R, incremental ramp test.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1550-2783-10-16-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Supplementation</title><p>NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was administered orally as tablets (Bullrich Salz Magentabletten, delta pronatura Dr. Krauss &#x00026; Dr. Beckmann, Egelsbach, Germany). The NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and placebo tablets (NaCl, delta pronatura Dr. Krauss &#x00026; Dr. Beckmann, Egelsbach, Germany) were matched by shape and taste. During the two conditions either 0.3&#x000a0;g&#x000b7;kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or 0.045&#x000a0;g&#x02219; kg <sup>-1</sup> body mass of NaCl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] had to be ingested 90&#x000a0;min before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] each of the five consecutive constant-load trials. Each supplement was consumed during a 15-min period with 0.75&#x000a0;dm<sup>3</sup> still water to minimize gastrointestinal discomfort or any other adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. One NaHCO<sub>3</sub> tablet contained 850&#x000a0;mg of NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, whereas one placebo tablet contained 130&#x000a0;mg of NaCl, which assured the intake of equal number of pills during the varying conditions (<italic>i.e.</italic> 0.35 tablets&#x02219; kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass). If a participant&#x02019;s body mass was such that they required to consume a non-round number of tablets, the participants were instructed to consume the number of pills rounded to the nearest whole pill required to obtain the dose. To minimize falsification of the pill count, participants were given an unknown (to them) number of pills in excess of needs and were asked to return any remaining pills at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of &#x02018;critical power&#x02019;</title><p>Five cycle ergometer tests were performed to determine CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. On the first visit, the seat and handle bar of the cycle ergometer (Ergoselect 200&#x000a0;K, Ergoline, Bitz, Germany) were adjusted. These settings were adopted for all consecutive trials. Participants started with a ramp cycle ergometer test to determine <italic>P</italic><sub>peak</sub> and <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2peak</sub>. After a 3-min rest, the ramp test started at 100&#x000a0;W and involved power increases of 9&#x000a0;W every 18&#x000a0;s (30&#x000a0;W&#x02219; min<sup>-1</sup>) until volitional exhaustion. For all tests, participants were asked to maintain a cadence of 80 revolutions per min throughout the test. Volitional exhaustion, <italic>i.e.</italic> task failure, for all cycling tests was defined as the point in time when participants stopped pedaling or the cadence fell below 75 revolutions per minute for &#x0003e; 5&#x000a0;s. On each of the following testing days, one constant-load trial at different power output was completed to determine CP. After a 3-min rest, participants started with a 5-min warm-up at 75&#x000a0;W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].

First, multiday NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation for 5&#x000a0;days increased <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP on each day relative to placebo in highly trained athletes. Second, there was no difference in the increased <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> over the 5&#x000a0;days of supplementation with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> or NaCl. Third, the increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> was paralleled by increases in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], pH and ABE. Fourth, [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] and [Na<sup>+</sup>] in the blood stabilized over time in the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> condition. Fifth, calculated PV increased during the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> more than in the placebo intervention.</p><p>We found that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation led to an increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP and that the improvement in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> was paralleled by an increase in blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], pH and ABE, indicating that the alteration in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> appears to be linked to an elevated extracellular buffer capacity. In fact, it has been shown that an increased [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] gradient between the intra- and extramyocellular compartment leads to an amplified H<sup>+</sup>-efflux from the muscle cell and delays the fall in intramyocellular pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We observed a trend for higher [La<sup>-</sup>] during the constant-load tests following NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation (<italic>P</italic> = 0.070, data not shown), supporting the notion that the increased H<sup>+</sup>-concentration resulted from a lactate-proton symport. A fall in intramyocellular [H<sup>+</sup>] is associated with muscle fatigue due to 1) an inhibition of glycogenolysis and glycolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], 2) increased muscular K<sup>+</sup> release, 3) lesser contractility of the heart muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], 4) inhibition of the sarcoplasmatic calcium release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and 5) inhibition of the actin-myosin interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, delaying the fall in intramyocellular pH might postpone the fatigue process and prolong intact muscle function. Indeed, our results showed that the ingestion of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> induced metabolic alkalosis, which in turn enhanced <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP and thus improved high-intensity exercise in the range of 10 to 20&#x000a0;min duration.</p><p>As hypothesized, <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP could be increased with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation. This is in contrast to the theoretical model, which states that an intramyocellular metabolic steady state exists at exercise intensities up to CP. However, our results support the notion that CP overestimates the metabolic steady state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, our result that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> increased <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP extends previous findings showing that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation increases exercise above CP relative to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In the latter studies, short high-intensity tests, during which intramyocellular pH falls rapidly from the beginning of exercise, were completed. During these types of tests, the finite work capacity above CP (<italic>W</italic><sup><italic>&#x02032;</italic></sup>) is drawn on after the start of exercise and becomes reduced. In light of our findings, these results might be interpreted to mean that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> simply increases <italic>W&#x02019;</italic>. However, Vanhatalo <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] showed that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> does not increase <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> during a 3-min all-out test, and concluded that changes in intramyocellular pH might not influence <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> in this particular test setting, and that for short all-out exercise, [PCr] dynamics is more important in determining <italic>W&#x02019;</italic>. In our constant-load trials at CP, <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> was supplied to a large extent by anaerobic glycolysis. Therefore, we assume that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation increases <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> in conditions where acidification occurs during exercise. Our result that the estimated <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2</sub> slow component was not different between the two interventions lends further credence to this notion, although the influence of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> on the <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2</sub> slow component remains ambiguous (reduction: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; no change: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). In our study, the identical <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2</sub> slow component for both, the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and placebo condition, indicated that <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2peak</sub> was attained at the same point in time. Based on the fact that the depletion of <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> coincides with the attainment of <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2peak</sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], our results indicate that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> ingestion did not increase the rate of <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> utilization but rather <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> itself. Further support for our assumption comes from another study, where average power in a 60&#x000a0;min cycling time trial was found to be higher with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> as compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. During a 60&#x000a0;min time trial, power output will fluctuate around CP with power peaks occurring <italic>e.g.</italic> at the start and during (final) sprints<italic>.</italic> In these occasions, <italic>i.e.</italic> when exercising above CP, <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> will be reduced. Consequently, a higher <italic>W&#x02019;</italic> can increase performance during tests of longer duration, especially if pacing strategies are implemented.</p><p>We also found that five bolus intakes on five consecutive days did not result in an increase of <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> beyond the value observed after the first intake. Thus, multiday administration of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> did not lead to a cumulative effect on endurance capacity. Accordingly, [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], blood pH, and ABE after multiday NaHCO<sub>3</sub> administration also remained unchanged relative to the initial rise after the first bolus. The most obvious explanation would be that during each CP-trial a certain amount of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was used, leading to lower values for [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], pH and ABE post <italic>vs.</italic> pre test. During the following 24&#x000a0;h of recovery, the body would then be expected to re-establish the resting values. On the following day, the participants then would start the CP trial at similar (complete recovery) or lower [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], blood pH, and ABE (incomplete recovery) relative to the first day, whereby an additional increase in performance would not be expected. Although we did not measure [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], pH and ABE before supplementation on the following days, these two described cases can be most likely excluded. The reason for this is that [Na<sup>+</sup>] also did not increase during the consecutive 5&#x000a0;days of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation despite the fact that Na<sup>+</sup>, unlike HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, was not used as a buffer during the CP trials, and that the high amount of ingested Na<sup>+</sup> could not be used completely through sweating. The predicted sweating rate during exercise of 1&#x000a0;dm<sup>3</sup>&#x02219; h<sup>-1</sup> water, with a sweat [Na<sup>+</sup>] of 50&#x000a0;mEq&#x02219; dm<sup>3</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] would have led to a Na<sup>+</sup> loss of ~0.36&#x000a0;g. This calculated sweat-induced loss of Na<sup>+</sup> corresponds to ~20% of the daily Na<sup>+</sup> intake during the placebo intervention. Regarding the substantially higher Na<sup>+</sup> intake during the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> intervention, the sweat-induced loss of Na<sup>+</sup> was negligible during this intervention.</p><p>As shown in this study, the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> intervention led to an increase in [Na<sup>+</sup>] and plasma osmolality after the first bolus administration. This increase was counteracted by an expansion in PV. The increase in PV was to such an extent that pre-exercise blood [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], pH, and ABE remained constant during the 5&#x000a0;days of testing. This proposed mechanism of PV expansion has already been described by M&#x000e1;ttar <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], who showed that plasma [Na<sup>+</sup>] and plasma osmolality were increased after NaHCO<sub>3</sub> injections in acute cardiac resuscitation. Other mechanisms to counteract increases in [Na<sup>+</sup>] and plasma osmolality comprise a shift of fluid from the intra- to the extramyocellular compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], a stimulation of arginine vasopressin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], which leads to an intensified water retention from the kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], and a stimulation of the thirst center whereby more fluid is consumed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In accordance with our results, McNaughton <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] found an increase in plasma [Na<sup>+</sup>] after the first of five doses of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> but no further increase of plasma [Na<sup>+</sup>] on the following days. The elevation of PV in the present study is mirrored by the measured increase in DXA whole-body lean mass. In the DXA two-component soft tissue model, lean mass comprises water, proteins, glycogen and non-bone minerals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As increases in protein, glycogen and non-bone minerals can virtually be excluded (see below), the increase in whole-body lean mass must have resulted from an increase in whole body water, which led to an expansion in PV. Our findings are in accordance with the report of Lands <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] who found a significantly higher value for DXA-derived whole-body lean mass after saline infusion given to healthy male participants. Finally, our finding that HR<sub>CLT</sub> was reduced lends further credence to our result that PV increased as a consequence of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation, because PV expansion simultaneously increases stroke volume and reduces sympathetic nervous activity, leaving <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2,CLT</sub> unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In our study, DXA-derived leg lean mass did neither change between interventions nor over time (Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). As with each gram of glycogen stored in muscle tissue 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;g of water is bound [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and body water is present within the lean soft tissue compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], a decrease in leg lean mass in such a short time (2&#x000a0;days) would indicate a loss of glycogen. In turn, glycogen loss would implicate incomplete regeneration, which would manifest itself in a reduced anaerobic work capacity and, accordingly, decreased performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Since our participants displayed neither a reduction in leg lean mass nor performance, the provided regeneration drink and the participants&#x02019; daily nutritional intake were sufficient to restore glycogen from day to day, allowing them to perform maximally on each day.</p><p>Our results have at least two practical implications. First, since the [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] gradient between intramyocellular compartment and blood did not decrease over time, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> can be taken daily in multiday competitions or tournaments lasting &#x02264; 5 d without the risk of reducing performance. Second, the apparent PV expansion in response to the high ion intake (see above) blunted any further increase in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]. If the same mechanism would be true for the chronic supplementation protocol, the effectiveness of this protocol should be questioned, as it seems that [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] cannot be increased limitlessly, <italic>i.e.</italic> that it probably reaches a ceiling. The observed ceiling effect was probably based on a metabolic compensation mechanism preventing a disproportionate increase in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>]. A respiratory compensation mechanism is unlikely to have occurred in our study because there were no differences between the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and placebo intervention for <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>CO<sub>2</sub> (<italic>P</italic> = 0.903, data not shown) and RER (<italic>P</italic> = 0.556, data not shown) during the resting measurements before the constant-load tests. Of further note is that the standard chronic protocol comprises a daily dose of 0.5&#x000a0;g NaHCO<sub>3</sub> kg<sup>-1</sup> body mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], which might accentuate the increase in PV and possible side effects. Thus, one adequate dose of NaHCO<sub>3</sub> administered before the competition should be effective in mediating all of the performance-enhancing effects without the need of a &#x0201c;loading phase&#x0201d;. In this context, our results expand the findings of McNaughton and Thompson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] as well as Siegler <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], who compared different acute and chronic protocols and found that there are no differences between these ingestion protocols with respect to exercise performance.</p><p>It may be argued that the present findings could be limited by 1) differences in performance ability throughout the study period and 2) decreasing motivation. Regarding the first point we have shown that CP was neither different between the first and second intervention period nor before the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and placebo condition. An increase in CP from the first to the second intervention would have indicated a training effect, whereas a decrease in CP would have indicated incomplete recovery. Hence, we can assume that the participants had the same performance ability throughout the study, allowing a comparison of <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> between the two conditions. Regarding the second point, decreasing motivation in a single participant would be evident from a decrease in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> within or between interventions. Considering the single variations in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> irrespective of condition, during which no distinct increases or decreases in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> over time (<italic>i.e.</italic> from the second to the fifth test day) were identified, a decreasing motivation can be excluded for all participants. In addition, <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2,CLT</sub>, <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>CO<sub>2,CLT</sub> and RER<sub>CLT</sub> were not different between conditions and days of testing. This indicates that the participants&#x02019; effort was constant during the whole study period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, multiple acute, consecutive day NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation led to an increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> at CP after the first bolus intake. However, while <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> remained elevated in the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> condition, it was not further altered with prolonged NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation. The increase in <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> was accompanied by a higher [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>] gradient between the blood and the intramyocellular compartment, which stabilized over time in the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> intervention. In contrast to the theoretical CP-model, where metabolites should reach a steady state during exercise at CP, and consequently, buffer substances should be ineffective in enhancing <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub>, we showed that in practice <italic>T</italic><sub>lim</sub> can be increased with NaHCO<sub>3</sub> supplementation. Furthermore, the high amount of ingested Na<sup>+</sup> caused a sustained elevation in PV, which inhibited a further increase in [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>], and consequently limited the performance-enhancing effect. Therefore, this study indicates that NaHCO<sub>3</sub> can be taken daily in multiday competitions or tournaments to maintain performance ability throughout the whole duration of the competition.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ABE: Actual base excess; CP: Critical power; DXA: Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; [HCO3-]: Blood bicarbonate concentration; HRCLT: Heart rate during the constant-load trials at CP; NaCl: Sodium chloride; NaHCO3: Sodium bicarbonate; Ppeak: Peak power output; PV: Plasma volume; RERCLT: Respiratory exchange ratio during the constant-load trials at CP; Tlim: Time-to-exhaustion; &#x00056;&#x00307; O2peak: Peak oxygen uptake; &#x00056;&#x00307; O2,CLT: <italic>&#x00056;&#x00307; </italic>O<sub>2</sub> during the constant-load trials at CP; &#x00056;&#x00307; CO2,CLT: Carbon dioxide output during the constant-load trials at CP; W&#x02019;: The finite work capacity above CP</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>SMM, SMG, MT designed the study.
