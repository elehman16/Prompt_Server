The results indicated that the primary endpoint was not achieved using the HBV DNA vaccine.

There is no specific symptoms and the diagnosis is based on the clinical description accompanied by laboratory findings (IgM anti-HBc-negative and positive results for HBsAg, HBeAg, or HBV DNA)[<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The CHB burden is global, but more significant in Asia, Pacific Islands, Sub-Saharan Africa, Amazon, and Eastern Europe[<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. HBV infection is endemic in China, with about 110 million HBV carriers and at least 300000 people dying from HBV-related diseases each year[<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Antiviral therapy aiming at clearing or radically inhibiting virus replication is the most effective treatment for CHB, and consists of interferon and reverse transcriptase inhibitors of oral nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) such as lamivudine (LAM), adefovir (ADV), entecavir (ETV), and tenofovir (TDF). Impaired host immune responses in patients with CHB constitute an obstacle to virus clearance. Therefore, alternative therapeutic strategies using vaccines have been suggested[<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Compared with protein vaccines, DNA vaccines mediate the <italic>de novo</italic> intracellular viral protein expression and synthesis in host cells, consequently boosting host-specific T cell-mediated response against HBV[<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, a recent study revealed that DNA vaccines have limited efficacy[<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The humoral and cellular immune responses to an HBV PreS2/S DNA vaccine were lower in chronic HBV carriers than in healthy volunteers[<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, alternative gene delivery strategies are being considered, including <italic>in vivo</italic> electroporation (EP), which has been studied in animal models and approved for a phase I trial among healthy individuals[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In order to enhance the cellular immune response to DNA vaccines, we developed a construct encoding an interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN-&#x003b3;) fusion protein to potentiate local antigen presentation by antigen-presenting cells, and consequently to increase immunogenicity against HBV[<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, we conducted a phase IIa study in which patients with CHB received LAM with or without EP-mediated dual-plasmid HBV DNA vaccine (ED-DNA). The vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunologically effective, with the HBV-specific T-cell responses induced under LAM chemotherapy showing a correlation with suppression of viral replication[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. LAM is a well-tolerated suppressor of viral replication with a strong antiviral potential, and its effects are similar in Asian and Western populations[<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, it was reported that a large number of CHB patients under LAM monotherapy develop drug resistance mutations and virological breakthrough (VBT)[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. As suggested by a previous study[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], adding vaccine therapy to LAM could be effective to prevent VBT. The aim of the present study was to further assess the efficacy and safety of the dual-plasmid strategy with LAM in patients with CHB compared with placebo plus LAM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, approved by the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) (license number: 2006L03542). Patients with CHB on a 72-wk LAM treatment (100 mg daily; GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceutical Corporation, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, China) were enrolled at 18 centers. This trial was registered in ClinicalTrials.org (NCT01487876) and approved by the ethics committee of the Peking University First Hospital, as well as by the committee of each of participating center. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant prior to enrolment. The study was conducted between April 2011 and October 2013 and in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was monitored by Beijing Guoxin Ze Ding International Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (China), an independent contract research organization.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>CHB diagnosis was carried out based on clinical symptoms and liver function tests[<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Inclusion criteria were: (1) 18-55 years old; (2) HBsAg and HBeAg positivity for at least 6 mo with HBV DNA &#x0003e; 10<sup>6</sup> copies/mL (1.79 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> IU/mL) within 4 wk prior to randomization; and (3) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 2-10 times the upper limit of normal within 4 wk before randomization. Exclusion criteria were: (1) suspected hepatic tumors or alpha-fetoprotein &#x0003e; 100 ng/mL; (2) cirrhosis; (3) co-infection with hepatitis A, C, D, or E virus; (4) co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus; (5) other causes of liver disease; (6) serious medical or psychiatric illness; (7) abnormal serum creatinine, thrombocyte count, hemoglobin, or serum total bilirubin; or (8) pregnancy. Previous treatments for CHB were allowed, but not within 6 mo before study participation.</p><p>Between April 2011 and October 2013, 229 patients were screened and randomly assigned to LAM + vaccine (vaccine) and LAM + placebo (control) groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>); 111 patients were randomized to the vaccine arm and two were excluded due to loss to follow-up or protocol violation; 118 patients were randomized to the control arm and two were excluded (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Therefore, the 225 patients that received at least one dose of study medication were designated as the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, including 109 in the vaccine group and 116 in the control group; 222 patients were analyzed as the modified ITT (mITT) population, excluding two patients with HBV M204V mutant in the vaccine arm and one who discontinued the allocated study agent in the control arm. Finally, 102 (91.9%) and 113 (95.7%) patients with good compliance and no additional dosing were included in the per-protocol set (PPS) analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Patient disposition and different analysis populations.

The S2.S gene was amplified from the plasmid pHBV&#x003b1;1 with the whole HBV S gene fragment (type ayw) by PCR, and then inserted in the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1+ after the use of the <italic>EcoR</italic> I enzyme. Supplementary Figure 1A shows a representative map of the vaccine plasmid pS2.S of the HBV DNA vaccine. Total RNA was extracted from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription. PCR was carried out to amplify the recombined gene fragments of hIL-2 and hIFN-&#x003b3;. The fusion gene was named hIIF. The hIIF gene was cloned conventionally into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.1- after digestion with <italic>EcoR</italic> I. Supplementary Figure 1B shows a representative map of the adjuvant plasmid pFP of the HBV DNA vaccine. The pharmaceutical grade dual-plasmid was re-constituted in phosphate-buffered saline and evaluated for efficacy, toxicity, and safety in animals as an investigative new drug[<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].

The primary endpoint was the rate of undetectable HBV DNA or HBeAg seroconversion (defined as loss of HBeAg and presence of HBeAb). The secondary endpoints included: (1) HBV DNA load suppression (number of patients who had a decrease of HBV DNA &#x0003e; 2 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL); (2) occurrence of LAM-resistant mutations or VBT; and (3) normalization of ALT levels.</p></sec><sec><title>Laboratory assays</title><p>At the end of follow-up, all serum samples were assayed in a central laboratory or at each participating center, as previously described[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. HBV serological markers at each visit were assayed using the same lots of reagents. Serum HBsAg/HBeAg status and HBV DNA levels were detected at the central laboratory (AxSYM test, dynamic range of HBsAg was 0.05-250 IU/mL, Abbot, Chicago, IL, United States; COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HBV Test, ranging from 20 to 1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> IU/mL, Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).</p><p>Venous blood samples were obtained and PBMCs were separated for immunologic response test. The number of IFN-&#x003b3;-secreting T lymphocytes among PBMCs was assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay using the hIFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT kit (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, United States), as previously described[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Peptides synthesized by GL Biochem Ltd (Shanghai, China), including HLA-2 restricted CTL epitope peptides and proteins in HBV (preS2 + S) T cell antigen, were used to stimulate the cells during the ELISPOT assays. The number of IFN-&#x003b3; spots was counted on an AID ELISPOT reader system (AID, Germany). Data are expressed as mean SFCs/10<sup>6</sup> PBMCs. On the other hand, PBMCs were cultured under stimulation with HBsAg. After 9 d, supernatants were assessed for HBV antigen-specific IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).</p><p>PBMCs were used for cytotoxicity analysis by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lake, NJ, United States) as follows. PBMCs were first stained with PerCP-conjugated &#x003b1;-CD3 and APC-conjugated &#x003b1;-CD8. Then, fixation and permeabilization were performed, followed by staining with PE-conjugated IFN-&#x003b3; monoclonal antibodies (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lake, NJ, United States). Results were analyzed using the FlowJo software (version 5.7.2; Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, United States).</p></sec><sec><title>Post-treatment immuno-memory tests</title><p>Among all participants, 45 patients were recruited 50-70 wk after the 72-wk LAM treatment period and before unblinding. Then, IFN-&#x003b3; levels in PMBC supernatants were detected by ELISA after 9 d of <italic>in vitro</italic> culture after HBsAg stimulation. In this case, a positive T-cell response was defined as an increase in IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by two times compared to the control level. Therefore, the threshold of &#x0003c; 100 pg/mL upon 9 d of culture of PBMCs stimulated by HBsAg was selected. A positive response of CD8<sup>+</sup> intracellular INF-&#x003b3; secreting T-cells in PMBCs was defined as no less than 0.1% frequency of CD8 cells showing positive IFN-&#x003b3; intracellular staining, measured by flow cytometry (FACS), upon stimulation by various HBV envelope antigens.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>All health-related events were documented during the 72-wk treatment period. Physical examinations, vital signs, hematology tests, and urinalysis were performed. In addition, anti-nuclear antibodies and anti-DNA antibodies were measured in all subjects. Patients with a failure to LAM antiviral therapy or with VBT occurrence received ADV (10 mg/d) as add-on treatment.</p><p>The adverse events were evaluated by clinicians and defined as mild (transient, tolerable, and minor symptoms disappearing by themselves in the intervals of drug administration), moderate (relatively long-lasting symptoms affecting daily life of the patients and requiring reduction of drug dose or administration frequency), or severe (long-lasting symptoms causing disability to the patients who only recovered after drug discontinuation and with appropriate treatments).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>We assumed that 40% of patients would have an HBV DNA loss in the DNA vaccine group compared with 20% in the placebo arm at EOT. Therefore, 106 patients per group (a total of 212 patients) were needed to achieve a 90% power with a two-sided significance level of 0.05. Assuming a drop-out rate of 15%, 240 patients were required.</p><p>A database was established using Epidata 3.1 (<uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.epidata.dk/">http://www.epidata.dk/</uri>). SAS 9.2 (SAS institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States) was used for statistical analyses. Data double entry was performed, including range and consistency checks. Analysis was conducted on all eligible patients according to the ITT principle. A dynamic PPS (dPPS) analysis was performed to take into account the patients who received ADV as add-on treatment. All categorical data were analyzed using the <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test, Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, or Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, as appropriate.

Our results indicated that the primary endpoint was not achieved using the ED-DNA. The HBV DNA vaccine could only be beneficial in subjects that have achieved initial virological response under LAM chemotherapy.</p><p>The efficacy did not reach the pre-set primary endpoint as per the registered protocol, but the mITT analysis showed that serum HBV DNA and HBeAg levels decreased, and the secondary efficacy measures of the treatment were better in the DNA vaccine + LAM group than in the placebo + LAM group. There was a higher number of patients with a decrease in HBV DNA &#x0003e; 2 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL in the vaccine group at week 12 after EOT compared with the control group. There were tendencies toward a difference in the number of patients with undetectable HBV DNA at week 28 after EOT and that with a decrease in HBeAg of &#x0003e; 1 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL at week 36 after EOT. The vaccine was safe, well tolerated, and resulted in a rate of adverse events comparable to that of the control group. Again, the secondary efficacy measures of the vaccine was more obvious in the dPPS analysis, in which there was a higher number of patients with a decrease in HBV DNA &#x0003e; 2 log<sub>10</sub> IU/mL in the vaccine group at weeks 12 and 28 after EOT, as well as that with undetectable HBV DNA at week 28 after EOT. The discrepancy between the data sets is that we took into account the patients who needed add-on therapy with ADV in the PPS population and thus suggests that the added value of the DNA vaccine, as a kind of HBV-specific immune modulatory therapy upon LAM antiviral therapy, might be achieved in easy-to-treat patients with CHB but without antiviral failure. Therefore, these results suggest that the effect of the vaccine could be better in highly selected patients, but additional studies are necessary to identify these patients adequately.</p><p>In the present study, the frequency of VBT was higher than that in our previous phase IIa study[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in which the occurrence rate of VBT in patients receiving LAM + vaccine was 50.0% <italic>vs</italic> 63.5% in the LAM + placebo at week 72, compared with 55.1% <italic>vs</italic> 56.0% in the present study. In addition, the numbers of patients achieving a decrease in HBV DNA &#x0003e; 2 log<sub>10</sub> at week 72, as well as the numbers of patients with undetectable HBV DNA, were comparable between the two groups, which are in disagreement with our previous phase IIa trial[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Many reasons could explain these discrepancies. There is a possibility that some patients were not na&#x000ef;ve to NUCs and some mutations could already have been present. The patients enrolled in the present study were different from the ones originally recruited in the phase IIa trial, which included only four centers in Beijing, while the present study involved many centers across China. Nevertheless, the results of the stratified analysis are similar to our previous findings[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], and may suggest that the lower HBV DNA load at week 72 is probably due to lower rates of VBT and YMDD mutations, but this needs to be confirmed.</p><p>In the stratified analysis of 30 patients with a viral load &#x0003c; 1000 copies/mL (1.79 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup> IU/mL) at SOT, more patients achieved HBeAg seroconversion in the vaccine group than among controls. In addition, less VBT and YMDD mutations were observed in the vaccine group. If HBeAg seroconversion is selected as trial endpoint for the DNA vaccine, the baseline serum HBsAg at SOT should be considered in this stratified analysis, as it favors HBeAg seroconversion at the end[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Interestingly, baseline serum HBsAg levels at SOT were higher in the vaccine group than among controls, probably due to the higher ALT levels at week 0 among controls, which is an indicator of host cellular immune response and would have been favorable for viral clearance among the patients of this group. During the trial course or at the endpoint, serum HBsAg tended to decrease slightly in the vaccine group, while remaining at the relatively same level with some elevation in the control group. ALT flare-ups occurred only in the vaccine arm, but were not associated with VBT in one case. Such host-induced flare-ups have been reported in patients responding to pegylated interferon-alpha 2a (peg-IFN), and are thought to reflect the immune clearance of HBV[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>HBeAg seroconversion has been used as a reliable criterion for evaluating therapeutic efficacy of antiviral treatments and could be the impetus for HBsAg loss and seroconversion[<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. It is considered a therapeutic endpoint and has been associated with immune restoration or control, and with reduced morbidity and mortality of CHB patients[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In the present study, LAM showed good efficacy during the first stage of viral suppression, and the adjusted results provided clinical evidence that DNA vaccine can induce an immune control of HBV infection in CHB patients who had already achieved initial virological responses under LAM antiviral therapy. Indeed, treatment guidelines suggest that therapy may be discontinued after 2-3 years of consolidation therapy in HBeAg-positive non-cirrhotic CHB patients that achieve HBeAg seroconversion during an antiviral therapy[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. It was reported by recent studies that patients with NUC therapy either switching to or adding peg-IFN achieve higher rates of sustained response than those continuing NUC monotherapy[<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Combination therapy of antivirals and immunomodulators, either to improve response to NUCs, IFN, or newly developed therapeutic vaccines, is considered crucial for investigators to achieve &#x0201c;functional&#x0201d; cure of HBV, defined as HBsAg loss or off-therapy immune control[<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The present study suggests that for patients receiving long-term therapy, it might be possible to enhance the chances of HBeAg seroconversion by adding a finite course of immunomodulatory therapy, especially an HBV-specific one.</p><p>Patients with CHB often present immune defects such as weak or undetectable helper and cytotoxic T cell-mediated immune responses[<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and immune modulation therapy aims to induce a sustainable HBV-specific multi-epitope and polyclonal T cell response. Therapeutic HBV DNA vaccine, as an HBV-specific immunomodulator, might be superior to interferon, as a non-specific one, in terms of adverse effects and dosing regimens, given that vaccine therapy was well tolerated and only four injections were administered in our present and previous studies. A previous study in macaques revealed that DNA vaccine may induce some immune memory[<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Results from our phase IIa trial showed that the patients receiving the DNA vaccine had a significant elevation of HBV-specific IFN-&#x003b3;-secreting T cell count compared with baseline[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], suggesting that the DNA vaccine plays a role in boosting the host cellular immune responses in favor of viral eradication among CHB patients. Because local laboratories were not equipped to assess T cells and because of logistics issues for shipping fresh samples to a central laboratory, we could not assess T cells in the present phase IIb trial. Nevertheless, we attempted to evaluate immune response in this cohort by recalling the patients who completed the follow-up and before unblinding. Compared with the control group, there was a higher proportion of positive responses against HBsAg and HBV T-cell related peptides in terms of IFN-&#x003b3; secretion and phenotypes of T cells from the PBMCs of patients receiving DNA vaccination. Additional studies are necessary to determine the optimal doses and administration strategies.</p><p>This study is not without limitations, as the sample size was small in the stratified analysis, it potentially prevented us from reaching a conclusion on its efficacy. In addition, the follow-up duration was short, which prevented us from evaluating the long-term efficacy and the beneficial outcome of the HBeAg seroconversion achieved with the vaccine. In the present study, only one vaccine administration schedule was tried, based on our previous phase IIa trial[<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], but additional studies could explore the best administration schedule. Last but not the least, we failed to assess the real-time HBV-specific T-cell immune responses of the subjects during the trial.</p><p>Even though the clinical efficacy as a whole was a minor outcome in this trial, our findings are still of relevance for future studies, in which DNA vaccine will sequentially be combined with more potent NUCs or NUCs less susceptible to drug resistance, like ETV or TDF. Since there were only four doses of the vaccine in the present trial, investigations on more appropriate strategies of vaccination including the number of injections and timing, either in animals or small-scale clinical trials, are crucial before large-scale trials. The results of positive memory T-cell responses in the present study would be implicative for these further studies, aiming to intensify and prolong the HBV-specific T-cell responses induced by the vaccine under NUC chemotherapy among CHB patients.</p><p>In conclusion, the primary endpoint was not achieved using the HBV DNA vaccine. The HBV DNA vaccine might only be beneficial in subjects that have achieved initial virological response under LAM chemotherapy. Additional studies are necessary to identify the subset of patients that could benefit the most from the EP-mediated DNA vaccination.</p></sec><sec><title>COMMENTS</title><sec><title>Background</title><p>Chronic hepatitis B infection leads to serious morbidity and mortality.
