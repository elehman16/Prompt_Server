<italic>Xingnao Kaiqiao</italic> acupuncture involves needling of the <italic>Neiguan</italic> (PC6), <italic>Renzhong</italic> (DU26), and <italic>Sanyinjiao</italic> (SP6) acupoints. The technique has a significant clinical effect in many neurological diseases. In the present report, we have developed a protocol for a scientific trial to analyze whether <italic>Xingnao Kaiqiao</italic> can be used to treat gastrointestinal dysfunction after laparoscopic surgery. In this context, we intend to execute a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of <italic>Xingnao Kaiqiao</italic> acupuncture via intradermal needling.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This will be a single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial.

Thus, patients have trouble passing flatus and defecating, and this causes abdominal distension, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms affect postoperative recovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Severe cases can result in further complications, such as intestinal adhesions and obstructions, which affect patients&#x02019; quality of life. Currently, Western medicine treats postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction using alvimopan. However, the side effects of this drug, which include nausea and vomiting, limit its widespread use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In the case of abdominal surgery, successful postoperative rehabilitation would promote the early recovery of gastrointestinal function and minimize side effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par20">Acupuncture has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases, and considerable accumulated experience has highlighted its efficacy and advantages. Indeed, in 1997, the US National Institutes of Health published a consensus statement declaring that acupuncture can be an effective treatment for postoperative nausea and vomiting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. More recent research has shown that acupuncture promotes the recovery of gastrointestinal function after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These results have allowed practitioners to improve their use of acupuncture to treat postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction.</p><p id="Par21">Other research has shown that peripheral ghrelin is largely responsible for regulating gastrointestinal function, and that ghrelin in the central nervous system can influence gastrointestinal physiological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. High concentrations of ghrelin are found in the cell bodies and synapses of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and gastrointestinal vagus nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Therefore, it may be that acupuncture regulates gastrointestinal function by stimulating nerves, especially the vagus nerve. Specifically, the stimulation of acupoints may promote the release of ghrelin in both the central and peripheral nervous system. By way of comparison, one study reported that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of <italic>Zusanli</italic> (ST36) may alleviate limb muscle spasms caused by stroke-induced injury to motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. It is believed that this effect is mediated by neurotransmitters. Another study reported that acupuncture causes chain reactions in the peroneal and tibial branches of the sciatic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The same study showed that electrostimulation of ST36 stimulates the peroneal nerve, which then propagates the impulse through the sciatic nerve to the vagus nerve, causing the release of aromatic <sc>l</sc>-amino acid decarboxylase and leading to elevated levels of neurotransmitters. Similarly, electrostimulation of <italic>Neiguan</italic> (PC6) stimulates sensory fibers in the median nerve, which in turn excite the nucleus tractus solitarius of the vagus nerve causing neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In vagotomized patients, the central effects of ghrelin are blocked, indicating that vagus nerve stimulation promotes ghrelin release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">In 1972, Professor Xuemin Shi, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, suggested that <italic>Xingnao Kaiqiao</italic> acupuncture (XNKQAT) can be used to treat encephalopathy. XNKQAT involves the use of needling acupoints to activate the brain&#x02019;s nourishment of the liver and kidneys, as well as to promote the <italic>flow of qi</italic>. The principal acupoints of this technique are PC6, <italic>Renzhong</italic> (DU26), and <italic>Sanyinjiao</italic> (SP6). Since its inception 40&#x000a0;years ago, the application of XNKQAT has gradually been improved through clinical practice, clinical trials, and laboratory research, and it is used to treat a continuously expanding spectrum of diseases.</p><p id="Par23">Neuroanatomical study of acupoints has shown that PC6 corresponds to the median nerve and that SP6 corresponds to the tibial nerve (a branch of the sciatic nerve), which, as described above, can excite the vagus nerve and promote the release of ghrelin. By the same token, DU26 corresponds to the buccal branches of the facial nerve and the second branch of the trigeminal nerve. The ends of the visceral afferent fibers of the vagus nerve and the somatic afferent fibers of the trigeminal nerve overlap in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, which only receives somatosensory input from the face and mouth. Hence, stimulation of DU26 causes nerve impulses to integrate at the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and this excitation can be transferred to the vagus nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">More importantly, in the XNKQAT, the manipulation standard of DU26 stimulation is &#x0201c;moistening of the eye&#x0201d;, that is, tear production. Relatedly, sensation in the lacrimal gland is mainly provided by the ends of parasympathetic fibers, almost all of which merge into the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the trigeminal nerve to form the lacrimal nerve, which in turn branches into the lacrimal gland and the eyelid. Only intense, long-lasting DU26 stimulation can excite the sensory neurons of the lacrimal nucleus sufficiently to produce tears. Indeed, the appearance of tears in such cases indicates that the sensory neurons of the trigeminal nerve and the parasympathetic neurons of the facial nerve have been excited; the end result of such vagus nerve excitation is ghrelin release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the &#x0201c;refreshment and resuscitation&#x0201d; technique for treating premature ovarian failure takes fully into account meridians, acupoints, and manipulation standards. Based on application theory research into meridians, acupoints, and acupuncture treatments, we hypothesized that XNKQAT systematically improves gastrointestinal function by stimulating ghrelin release.</p><p id="Par25">XNKQAT can be applied using different acupuncture methods, such as needling, acupressure, electroacupuncture, moxibustion, and others. Of these, intradermal needling is now commonly used; using this method, practitioners must accurately locate the correct acupoints to ensure that patients are treated effectively. However, few studies have reported successful treatment of postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction using intradermal needling. Therefore, this article proposes a rigorously designed, double-blind, randomized controlled clinical trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of intradermal needling-based XNKQAT to treat gastrointestinal dysfunction after laparoscopic surgery. The trial is designed to provide high-quality scientific evidence that will promote the clinical application of XNKQAT.</p><p id="Par26">A pilot trial has been conducted in six patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery. These subjects were randomly assigned to the &#x0201c;XN group&#x0201d; (XNKQAT) or the &#x0201c;SH group&#x0201d; (sham stimulation). The patients adhered strictly to the evaluation and treatment processes of this study, and we observed that XNKQAT via intradermal needling of PC6, DU26, and SP6 is effective in the treatment of gastrointestinal dysfunction after laparoscopic surgery. Specifically, the average time until the patients&#x02019; first postoperative flatus was shorter in the XN group (15.21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.89&#x000a0;h) than in the SH group (28.32&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.31&#x000a0;h). This supports the hypothesis that XNKQAT via intradermal needling promotes the recovery of gastrointestinal function after laparoscopic surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p id="Par27">This is a protocol for a double-blind, single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial that conforms to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT 2010) guidelines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), as well as to the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Controlled Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].

Treatment will be repeated every 12&#x000a0;h thereafter until a total of six treatments have been administered. Each treatment will last for 3&#x000a0;min. Each time, the intradermal needles (or sham needles) will be attached to the surface of the acupoints. Six hours after surgery, immediately before the first treatment, the first evaluation will be carried out. The subjects will be evaluated every 12&#x000a0;h thereafter until a total of seven evaluations have taken place. Acupoints will be located in accordance with the World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The acupoints used will be PC6, DU26, and SP6. The nurse administering the treatment will stand next to the subject&#x02019;s bed and help them to find a comfortable supine position.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Treatment (XNKQAT) group</title><p id="Par39">This group of subjects will receive XNKQAT intradermal needling treatment at PC6 on both forearms, at SP6 on both ankles, and at DU26; that is, at a total of five acupoints (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). After standard disinfection of the acupoints with 75% ethanol solution, the nurse will position the disposable medical intradermal needles (0.22&#x000a0;mm diameter&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.5&#x000a0;mm length) perpendicular to the skin at the subject&#x02019;s acupoints and then needle them into the skin. During the approximately 3-min treatment, the nurse will alternatively press the five intradermal needles for 15&#x000a0;s; a 20-s pause will occur between the repeated pressing intervals. To avoid injury to the skin or infection at the acupoints, the needles will not be twisted. The subject should feel a prick at the needled location. This study will use a visual analogue scale (VAS; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) for pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] to determine the needle pressing force. Based on the VAS evaluation performed in the pilot trial, the pressing force will be limited to 40&#x000a0;mm. More importantly, in the XNKQAT, the manipulation standard of DU26 stimulation is &#x0201c;moistening of the eye,&#x0201d; that is, tear production (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Since the subjects will undergo a long pre-operative fasting period, excitation of the acupoints may trigger a hypoglycemic response. Therefore, it will be important to monitor the subjects&#x02019; faces during treatment to ensure they do not become pale or apathetic. If these signs occur, treatment will be stopped, the subjects&#x02019; blood glucose will be tested immediately, and appropriate management will be performed.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>

Acupuncture is an important component of traditional Chinese medicine. It is technically simple to perform and easy to teach. Some research has indicated that acupuncture promotes postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, few high-quality studies support the technique in this regard. Therefore, to improve treatment, we conceived of the clinical method used in the pilot trial. In the proposed study, we will use XNKQAT intradermal needling to treat gastrointestinal dysfunction after laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, since the time until the first postoperative flatus has clinical significance in postoperative recovery of gastrointestinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], we will use it as the primary outcome in the trial.</p><p id="Par68">A lot of studies have focused on acupuncture, its therapeutic effects, and its procedures, which are based on thousands of years of empirical practice. Furthermore, acupuncture is now used worldwide to treat diseases, and many studies have applied advanced molecular biology methods to study acupuncture. However, since traditional Chinese medicine is based on a different philosophy from translational medicine, it is difficult to incorporate acupuncture into treatment regimens. Nevertheless, recent advances in neuroendocrinology and immunology have allowed a better understanding of acupuncture. From a translational medicine perspective, we herein present a clinical trial protocol that adheres to scientific standards to evaluate the safety and efficacy of XNKQAT in the treatment of postoperative gastrointestinal dysfunction. The results of the trial will determine whether this treatment should be more widely applied in clinical practice. In addition, we intend to use this work to emphasize that the effects of acupoint stimulation on the human endocrine system must be mapped; this will enable further integration of acupuncture into current scientific practice. Herein, we present a promising new approach to the fusion of acupuncture and mainstream medicine, and we use XNKQAT as an example.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par69">Recruitment for this trial is currently ongoing.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec26"><p>
