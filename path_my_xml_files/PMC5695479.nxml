Two types are distinguished: simple and complicated appendicitis. Non-operative treatment (NOT) of children with simple appendicitis has been investigated in several small studies. So far, it is deemed safe. However, its effectiveness and effect on quality of life (QoL) have yet to be established in an adequately powered randomised trial. In this article, we provide the study protocol for the APAC (Antibiotics versus Primary Appendectomy in Children) trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This multicentre, non-inferiority, randomised controlled trial randomises children aged 7&#x02013;17 years with imaging-confirmed simple appendicitis between appendectomy and NOT. Patients are recruited in 15 hospitals. The intended sample size, based on the primary outcome, rate of complications and a non-inferiority margin of 5%, is 334 patients.</p><p>NOT consists of intravenous antibiotics for 48&#x02013;72 hours, daily blood tests and ultrasound follow-up. If the patient meets the predefined discharge criteria, antibiotic treatment is continued orally at home. Primary outcome is the rate of complications at 1-year follow-up. An independent adjudication committee will assess all complications and their relation to the allocated treatment. Secondary outcomes include, but are not limited to, delayed appendectomies, QoL, pain and (in)direct costs.</p><p>The primary outcome will be analysed both according to the intention-to-treat principle and the per-protocol principle, and is presented with a one-sided 97.5% CI. We will use multiple logistic and linear regression for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively, to adjust for stratification factors.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The protocol has been approved by the Medical Ethics Review Committee of the Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam.

However, based on epidemiological, immunological and pathology data, several experts have stated<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;6</xref> that appendicitis is not necessarily a progressive disease. Rather, they endorse the idea that two types of appendicitis exist: simple or uncomplicated appendicitis and complicated appendicitis. Over the years, there has been a shift towards non-operative treatment (NOT) strategies for diseases which were historically treated surgically, for instance, stomach ulcers and uncomplicated diverticulitis. More recently,&#x000a0;NOT of acute uncomplicated appendicitis (AUA) has become the subject of investigation. This strategy consists of initial treatment with intravenous antibiotics and reserves appendectomy for non-responders and those with recurrent appendicitis.</p><p>Several randomised controlled trials (RCT) looked at the NOT of AUA in the adult population. Results, however, vary. Most trials conclude that NOT is safe, but the reported reduction in complications varies from no significant differences<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8</xref> to 86% reduction.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Recurrent symptoms resulting in delayed appendectomy occur in roughly one in four patients.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 8 10</xref> These numbers are interpreted in different ways, as illustrated by the conclusions of three recent systematic reviews, which range from indicating NOT as the preferred treatment<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> to rejecting it as a routine treatment due to insufficient knowledge about its impact on quality of life (QoL).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Approximately one-third of all cases of appendicitis occur under the age of 20 years. Regarding the distribution of uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis in the paediatric population, the percentage of uncomplicated appendicitis is reported to range from 68% to 90% in children aged 5&#x02013;18 years.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 11</xref> The percentage of complicated appendicitis increases with age,<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> thus reducing the amount of patients suitable for initial NOT strategy. Potential benefits of initial NOT strategy might therefore be higher for the paediatric population than for the adult population. Data in the paediatric population on the outcome of NOT for uncomplicated appendicitis are scarce and consist mainly of uncontrolled studies with small patient numbers. Recently, a systematic review was published, including 10 studies (1 pilot RCT, 6 prospective cohorts and 3 retrospective cohorts) with a total of 413 children treated with NOT.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Overall complications where reported in five of the six comparative studies. One out of 175 (0.6%) patients in the NOT group suffered complications versus 9/239 (3.8%) patients in the primary appendectomy group. Follow-up ranged from 8 weeks to 4 years, with 82% of the NOT patients not having undergone appendectomy at follow-up completion. Recurrent appendicitis occurred in 68/396 (17%) patients; this included 19 children who were treated with a second course of antibiotics.</p><p>The evidence regarding the outcome of NOT in the paediatric population is far from sufficient. As of today, apart from the trial described in this article, four large clinical studies (three RCTs<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> and one prospective patient preference study<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) are recruiting children for a comparison of primary appendectomy with NOT. In the APAC&#x000a0;(Antibiotics versus Primary Appendectomy in Children) trial, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of the initial NOT strategy (reserving appendectomy for those not responding or with recurrent disease) compared with immediate appendectomy in terms of complications, health-related QoL and costs in children aged 7&#x02013;17 years with AUA.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>The APAC trial is a multicentre, non-inferiority&#x000a0;RCT.

It would thus be sufficient to demonstrate that the outcome in terms of complications is not worse in the NOT group compared with the immediate appendectomy group.</p><p>In our pilot study,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> we followed the children eligible for NOT who refused participation in that study and received immediate appendectomy instead of antibiotic treatment. The frequency of postoperative complications in this group at 1-year follow-up was approximately 10% (unpublished data), meaning that 90% was successfully treated without complications in the operative group. If the difference in complication rate between NOT and operative treatment is less than 5% in favour of appendectomy, non-inferiority is assumed. We will not be testing for the superiority of NOT. Using a one-sided alpha of 2.5% in accordance with the non-inferiority design, 150 patients per group are needed to achieve 90% power for the exclusion of a difference in favour of the usual care group of more than 5%. Although in our pilot study<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> the dropout rate after 1&#x02009;year was only 2%, we take into account a dropout rate of 10%. Therefore, the number of patients to be included is 334.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Study setting and feasibility</title><p>Eligible patients are recruited in 15 hospitals across the Netherlands.

Since the implementation of a guideline in the Netherlands promoting preoperative imaging, the per-operative finding of non-inflamed appendices was reduced to 3.3%,<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> which is low compared with, for example, the UK, where it is 20.6%.<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> We postulate that our use of elaborate and, where possible, evidence-based patient selection methods enhances the chance of successful non-operative management. To warrant the safety of patients undergoing NOT, this protocol dictates systematic and frequent evaluation (by clinical assessment, laboratory tests and imaging studies). We expect this will identify patients not responding to the antibiotic treatment at an early stage.</p><p>The non-inferiority design does not allow for a superiority comparison for the rate of complications. The design choice was based on the argument that both treatment strategies are 100% effective in treating appendicitis, because when antibiotic treatment is not successful and when recurrent appendicitis occurs, appendectomy is performed. We postulate that the non-operatively treated patients who do not require appendectomy will have a reduction in costs, better QoL and the avoidance of the complications associated with appendectomy. Essential for the possible acceptance of this new strategy is that it is not inferior when it comes to the risk of complications. To determine the severity of possible complications and their relation with the allocated treatment, we consider the support of an independent adjudication committee a great asset.</p><p>The inclusion and exclusion criteria of this trial are mostly based on data that allow for distinguishing complex from uncomplicated appendicitis. Criteria that predict the risk of NOT failure would be more adequate. However, more data and more experience are needed to be able to develop such criteria. Data from the APAC trial will also be used to analyse predictors of failure.</p></sec><sec id="s5b"><title>Choice of primary outcome</title><p>Determining the appropriate primary outcome measure in studies comparing NOT with operative treatment remains challenging. In our opinion, both strategies will be effective in treating patients with appendicitis, and therefore effectiveness or failure is not an appropriate outcome measure. Therefore, we decided to use a composite outcome measure, that is, complications. Such outcome measures (morbidity and mortality) are necessary in order to start the debate whether or not NOT strategy can be integrated in clinical practice.</p><p>Furthermore, our goal is to compare the initial NOT strategy (reserving an appendectomy for those not responding or with recurrent appendicitis) with direct operative treatment strategy. In this view, stating that delayed appendectomy for the indication of failed antibiotic treatment or recurrent appendicitis is a complication would not be appropriate as it is integrated in the treatment strategy. Postoperative complications after delayed appendectomy are however considered as complications of the initial NOT&#x000a0;strategy. The amount of delayed appendectomies (for both non-responders and recurrent appendicitis) needs to&#x000a0;be included in the debate whether or not initial NOT strategy can be implemented in daily practice. It is therefore reported as a secondary outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s5c"><title>Complicated appendicitis</title><p>Reluctance of some surgeons towards NOT might be explained by the fear of missing complicated appendicitis and delaying appropriate treatment. In 4.5%&#x02013;6.5% of the adult population treated with NOT who underwent delayed appendectomy, complicated appendicitis was found.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7 10</xref> The outcome in terms of postappendectomy complications after delayed appendectomy (6.9%) is comparable to that for primary appendectomy (8.8%).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5d"><title>Exclusion of patients with appendiceal faecalith</title><p>We excluded patients with a suspicion of an appendiceal faecalith on preoperative imaging studies because it is associated with a higher failure rate of NOT. In the adult population, a NOT failure rate of 50% after 1&#x02009;month was reported in the group with a faecalith versus 14% in the group without a faecalith.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> One study only including children with appendicitis and a faecalith on imaging had to terminate inclusions early because of a NOT failure rate of 60% at a median of 4.7 months&#x02019; follow-up.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Faecaliths are also associated with a higher long-term recurrence risk in children, with recurrences of 47.4% vs 23.7%.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5e"><title>Follow-up/long-term effects</title><p>Information regarding long-term results of NOT in simple appendicitis is limited and it is scarce in children. One study in children with an average follow-up of 4.3 years reported that 22 of 78 (29%) children treated with NOT experienced recurrent appendicitis,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> with a median time to recurrence of 6 months. Eight per&#x000a0;cent of all non-operatively treated children experienced recurrence after more than 1&#x02009;year. The APAC trial has a follow-up of 1&#x02009;year. However, all participants who have not been operated at the end of the study will be asked to participate in long-term follow-up. The long-term effects in children of losing the function of the appendix have also not yet been cleared up. The appendix might play a role in immunity and there is evidence that it is involved in preserving a healthy gut microbiome.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5f"><title>Choice of antibiotic regime</title><p>Most of the data on antibiotic susceptibility in appendicitis is derived from studies in adults, patients with complicated appendicitis and mixed patient groups. There is some evidence available concerning children. A study analysing cultures from children in Ireland with complicated appendicitis revealed that the combination therapy of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and aminoglycosides would be appropriate in 99% of children with bacterial appendicitis-related peritonitis.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Since antibiotic resistance rates are greatly dependent on geography, we can expect comparable or even better results in the Netherlands, considering it has the lowest rates of antibiotic use in Europe.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Combined with a low rate of complications and extensive experience with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and gentamicin, we consider it the most sensible regime. Further research is carried out by our research group analysing the microbiome in simple and complicated appendicitis. Hopefully, this will contribute in determining the best antibiotic regime. If NOT of appendicitis is shown to be non-inferior in this trial, further research should determine the most sensible regime and treatment duration. The first pilot RCT evaluating outpatient conservative management in a mixed group (children and adults) has already been published.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p></sec><sec id="s5g"><title>Antibiotic resistance</title><p>A possible downside of NOT as opposed to surgery could be increased antibiotic resistance.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Interestingly, a study evaluating bacterial resistance in complicated appendicitis in children showed no significant increase in resistance rates over the past 20&#x02009;years.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> How this translates to bacterial resistance when simple appendicitis is treated with antibiotics is unclear. The use of multidrug treatment regimens has been pointed out as one of the possibilities to reduce the development of resistant bacteria.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Our choice for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and gentamicin prevents us from having to use so-called reserve antibiotics, unlike most of the other known studies in children, in which for instance piperacillin-tazobactam is the drug of choice. Also when the symptoms do not resolve under the chosen antibiotic regimen, appendectomy is performed; we do not switch to other antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="s5h"><title>Value of histological evaluation</title><p>An occasionally mentioned argument<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> against NOT of appendicitis is the risk of missing other underlying causes of appendicitis, such as a carcinoid. One study repeated the abdominal ultrasound in children 1&#x02013;3 months after NOT to ensure the diameter of the appendix returned to normal.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The value of this strategy is unknown. In an analysis of 241 histopathological appendectomy samples in children with simple appendicitis, 4 (1.6%) showed unexpected findings.<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Three parasitic infections and one Walthard cell rest were found; none of the findings required further treatment or investigation. The frequency of appendiceal carcinoid tumours in children undergoing appendectomy was 0.2%,<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and in less than 20% of these cases lymphovascular or mesenteric involvement was present. This seems a negligible risk and it is yet unclear if patients who are excluded or unresponsive to NOT are also the patients with the highest risk of having a malignancy as underlying cause.</p><p>Unique for the APAC trial is its primary outcome measure; total number of complications after 1&#x02009;year. Delayed appendectomy or recurrence is not reported as the primary endpoint or as a complication. Because in our opinion there is a place for the appendectomy in non-operative management as a step-up approach for children unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. As a result, 8 or 9&#x000a0;out of every 10 children with uncomplicated appendicitis would no longer have to undergo an appendectomy. Furthermore, if we are able to identify specific predictive preoperative variables, we might identify a group of patients with even better (long-term) outcomes. Finally, this trial should answer the question whether the advantages of NOT are also reflected in the reported QoL and diminished costs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e188" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018145.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e189" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018145.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Due to the multicentre and multidisciplinary nature of the trial, not all supporting researchers can be mentioned by name.
