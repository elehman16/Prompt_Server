This is probably due to differences in genetic and environmental factors.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] It is the fourth leading cause of death in developed countries, affecting 3% of the population and 5&#x02013;10% of those over 65 years old.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Diabetes can be managed by drug therapy and non-pharmacological therapy. The cornerstone of non-pharmacologic therapy is lifestyle modifications, including nutritional therapy, physical activity and avoidance of smoking.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Education of the patient in diabetes self-care, including self-monitoring of blood glucose levels, is also vital.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] The role of pharmacists in diabetes management is essential for identifying patients, assessment, education, referral and continuous monitoring. Pharmacists can help identify patients with diabetes through regular screening procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Patient education should be provided immediately after a diagnosis of diabetes or any other diseases. Later on, patient assessment can be performed, and the patient can be educated to reinforce concepts and provide a motivational boost.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] The role of the community pharmacists in monitoring and educating diabetic patients is not well defined. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the role of the community pharmacists in improving knowledge and glycemic control of type 2 diabetes in patients in villages of Coimbatore district, Tamil Nadu.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The study design involved a repeated intervention versus control design. Two community pharmacies in a rural area of Coimbatore district in the state of Tamil Nadu were selected for the study. The study was carried out for 8 months, from May to December 2005. The study design and protocol were accepted by the proprietors of the community pharmacies. The study protocol and informed consent form were approved by the Institute Human Ethics Committee of Sri Ramakrishna Institute of Paramedical Sciences. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.</p><p>Fifty patients were interviewed, of whom 39 participants met the inclusion criteria and were enrolled in the study. The literate (more than higher secondary level) and chronic diabetic patients (history of type 2 DM of more than 3 years) were included in the study and illiterate, children below 12 years of age, pregnant women, nursing mothers, type 1 DM patients and subjects with any other chronic disorders were excluded from the study. Twenty of these participants were allocated randomly to the control group and 19 were allocated to the intervention group. Pharmacists had a discussion about the study with the eligible patients or their caregivers when prescriptions for diabetes medications were issued. Subjects were included if they had type 2 DM and gave informed consent.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient background questionnaire</title><p>The study participants completed a seven-item demographic questionnaire, providing information about their sex, age, marital status, education, income level, type of diabetes, length of time since diagnosis of diabetes and presence of other specific health problems.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Diabetes Care Profile: An instrument of the study</title><p>The data were collected using Diabetes Care Profile (DCP)&#x02014;a questionnaire developed by J.J. Fitzgerald of the Michigan Diabetes Research and Training Center (MDRTC), University of Michigan Medical School, Michigan. DCP was developed as an instrument to assess social and psychological factors related to diabetes and treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The questionnaire was translated into the local language, as is frequently done. The questionnaire was self-administered. It consists of 234 items including information on demography and self-care practices and 116 questions divided into 16 profile scales, including health status understanding, control problem and social and personal factors scales. The items were scored using a variable five-point Likert scale, in which 1 = good and 5 = poor,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] and item scores were summed to gain a total score. Each scale was scored by summing certain item scores and dividing the sum by the appropriate number of items. The interval between two visits was 2 months, and all the study subjects in the intervention group were interviewed a minimum of four times. DCP was performed in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> months, and the results were compared. The study subjects were interviewed for a duration of 20&#x02013;40 min.</p><p>Patients&#x02019; knowledge about diabetes and its management were tested at the baseline and final visits using the MDRTC Brief Diabetes Knowledge Test Questionnaire. The questionnaire tests knowledge of 15 test items. Correct answers scored one point and wrong answers scored zero points. It took approximately 10 min to complete this questionnaire.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>Fasting blood glucose levels were measured for all patients initially and 4 and 8 months after the initial meeting of the patient and the pharmacist. The demographic characteristics of the study subjects were collected at every visit. A capillary blood sample was collected by pricking the skin of the finger, and the fasting blood glucose level was measured using a one-touch blood glucose monitor (Accusure, MicroGene Diagnostic Systems [P.] Ltd., New Delhi, India).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Patient counseling</title><p>Patients in the intervention group received diabetic medication counseling, printed educational material and instructions on dietary regulation, exercise and lifestyle modifications from the community pharmacist, while the control group patients did not receive any counseling till the end of the study. Through dietary modifications, type 2 DM patients had to attain and maintain their ideal body weights. The modifications included reducing the intake of fats, increasing the intake of high-fiber carbohydrates, reducing the intake of refined sugars and salts, restricting alcohol consumption, spacing meals evenly (4&#x02013;5 h apart), maintaining regular eating habits and eating fruits in moderate amounts (preferably raw and partially ripe fruits). In the intervention group, the study subjects were advised to perform any one exercise regularly to improve blood sugar control and body weight control and to increase the body's sensitivity to insulin. This regular exercise included walking, jogging, aerobics, dancing and swimming for 30&#x02013;45 min at least three times a day.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>The patients in the intervention group were also advised to consult a physician before starting any exercise and modifying the diet; patients with poorly controlled blood glucose levels, patients with specific complications such as diabetic retinopathy, sensitive feet or hypertension and those with an increased risk of diabetic complications were excluded. All the study subjects were advised to keep sugar or something sweet handy to avoid low blood sugar levels, and were advised to always have someone around who can detect symptoms of hypoglycemia.</p><p>Diabetic eye disease silently robs adults between the ages of 27 and 74 years of their sight, making diabetes a leading cause of blindness. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause permanent damage to the eyes (retinopathy). In the intervention group, the subjects were advised to (a) undergo scheduled yearly eye exams to ensure that diabetic eye diseases are detected before causing permanent loss of vision, (b) control the blood pressure within normal limits and (c) avoid risk factors that induce high blood pressures, such as smoking and alcoholism.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>The subjects in the intervention group were educated on protecting their feet to avoid gangrene, and counseling on drugs was given. Counseling on drugs includes general instructions on the importance of the following: (a) following the prescribed diet, exercise and medical regimen, (b) taking a dose immediately if it has been missed, unless it is almost time to take the next dose, (c) avoiding doubling the doses, (d) avoiding alcohol and products containing alcohol, (e) learning to recognize and manage hyperglycemia, (f) avoiding smoking, (g) understanding that therapy relieves symptoms but does not cure the disease, (h) wearing or carrying medical identification regarding diabetic status and (i) avoiding other medications, including over-the-counter drugs, without medical approval.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] Flow diagram of requirement, allocation and follow-up of participants are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Requirement, allocation and follow-up of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PCR-3-26-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the values in the following are the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD).

They ranged in age from 33 to 80 years. The control group had a mean age of 57.05 &#x000b1; 12.06 years, and the intervention group had a mean age of 51.47 &#x000b1; 9.99 years. The duration over which these patients had suffered diabetes ranged from 1 to 25 years, with the mean duration of the control group being 5.80 &#x000b1; 5.34 years and that of the intervention group being 5.21 &#x000b1; 4.88 years. All patients with type 2 diabetes take an average of two oral drugs to treat their diabetes. Of the 39 patients, 38 were on only oral hypoglycemic agents. One patient was on insulin alone, and none of the patients were on both oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin. In addition to the medications for treatment of diabetes, 12 patients were taking drugs for co-morbidities, including hyperlipidemia, hypertension and asthma.

The blood glucose levels dropped and the patients&#x02019; quality of life and knowledge about diabetes management improved. This is one of the few studies that have used a controlled research design and documented the clinical and humanistic outcomes in the pharmaceutical care intervention delivered in a community pharmacy in a rural area of Tamil Nadu.</p><p>Intensive interventions were undertaken, especially with respect to blood glucose monitoring, education about the disease and about medications and lifestyle (diet and exercise). Interventions were tailored according to individual patients&#x02019; needs. All interventions were documented to measure the effectiveness. Strict control of diabetes can result in significant risk reduction in terms of the onset of complications. Intensive blood glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes has also been shown to be cost-effective in terms of managing these complications.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>In this study, it was possible to achieve clinically important and statistically significant drops in the mean blood glucose level in the intervention group over the duration of the study compared with control patients. The service was able to achieve a mean reduction in the blood glucose level of 47.47 mg/dL in patients who received pharmaceutical care, while the mean blood glucose values in the control patients increased by 19.4 mg/dL at the end of the study. This reduction in blood glucose level in the intervention group is an excellent achievement given that the service was provided for such a short period of time. A similar study conducted by Berringer<italic>et al</italic>. in two community pharmacies in the USA showed that blood glucose levels decreased in the intervention group by 19.3 mg/dL in 6 months.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The frequency of symptomatic episodes of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia was significantly reduced in the intervention group.</p><p>From the study, it is evident that the rural population knew very little about diabetes and lifestyle modifications. The pharmacists&#x02019; intervention produced statistically significant improvements in the intervention group. The improved diabetes knowledge scores among the patients in the intervention group show that the participants successfully retained the information delivered over the duration of the study.</p><p>A lack of knowledge about the disease and its management can be considered as an important reason for improper control of DM. Another study conducted in Bangalore in 2005 showed that patient counselling by pharmacists on diabetes significantly increased patients&#x02019; knowledge about all aspects of DM and its management.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>The pharmacist is an integral member of a healthcare team and assumes varied functional roles including the procurement and supply of medicines to pharmaceutical care services and helping ensure that patients receive the best treatment. Involvement of pharmacists in patient care has reduced the number of hospital admissions and patient visits for medical emergencies. As Dr. Hans V. Hogerzeil, WHO Director of Medicines Policy and Standards, said, &#x0201c;Pharmacists have an important role to play in health care, which is much more than selling medicines.&#x0201d;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>At the end of the study, the intervention group showed a noticeable improvement in the mean of DCP subscale score. All the four subscales (health status [subscale I], understanding [subscale II], control problems [subscale III] and social and personal factors [subscale IV]) showed statistically significant improvements in the intervention group compared with the control group.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Community pharmacists are in a unique position to monitor and counsel rural patients with DM. The need for increased diabetes care presents an excellent opportunity for community pharmacists to become more involved in the management and follow-up of people with diabetes. This study demonstrates the positive impact that the community pharmacist can have in achieving the primary therapeutic goal in diabetes patients of overall diabetes control.
