However, there is paucity of literature comparing caudal fentanyl and ketamine on NESR. The present study was aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of these caudal adjuvants and their effect on (NESR) in children undergoing infraumbilical and perineal surgery.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>A total of 60 children undergoing infraumbilical surgery were included in this randomized, double-blind study. Three groups of 20 each were assigned to receive caudal block with bupivacaine 0.25% 1 ml/kg along with either 0.9% normal saline (Group I) 1 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl (Group II) or 0.5 mg/kg ketamine (Group III). Modified visual analogue scale (VAS) was used for assessment of post-operative pain, and stress response was assessed by blood glucose, serum cortisol and insulin levels at various time intervals</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>VAS scores were significantly lower in the ketamine group at all-time intervals upto 4 h (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Patients in ketamine group required rescue analgesia significantly later (8.23 h) when compared to fentanyl (5.95 h) and bupivacaine group (4.10 h). Caudal block led to significant decrease in cortisol and insulin levels within the groups however this significance was not achieved between groups.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Caudal ketamine in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg provides prolonged analgesia when compared to fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg. Blunting of the NESR was observed in all the groups though the indicators of the response were lowest with ketamine.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Caudal</kwd><kwd>children</kwd><kwd>epidural</kwd><kwd>ketamine</kwd><kwd>neuroendocrine stress response</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interest in combining regional and general anesthesia to offer the possibility of pain free post-operative period has increased in recent years.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Caudal block is the most commonly used regional technique for post-operative analgesia in children.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] It is a reliable and safe technique that can be used with general anesthesia for intra and post-operative analgesia in children undergoing infraumbilical and lower limb surgeries.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Various pharmacological agents have been used and studied as adjuvants to local anesthetic drugs in order to achieve better quality and longer duration of analgesia in the post-operative period.

Semple <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] reported that caudal ketamine in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg when used as adjuvant caused effective analgesia with minimal behavioural disturbances in children. We used similar dosages in our study.</p><p>We used already established methods for pain assessment &#x02014; viz., modified VAS score, and serum cortisol, serum insulin and blood glucose levels as indicators of stress response in accordance with studies conducted by other workers.</p><p>The results of the present study confirm and support previous reports that caudal administration of ketamine and fentanyl exert modulatory influences on post-operative pain mechanisms. We achieved good pain relief with very low VAS scores in all the three groups in immediate post-operative period. However, in children who received bupivacaine alone, we found that rescue analgesia was required at a much earlier time, approximately 4 h as compared to 8 h in ketamine and 6 h in fentanyl group.</p><p>This finding is in agreement with previous studies by Martindale <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Naguib <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and Lonnquist.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Patients receiving Fentanyl showed significantly lower VAS scores as compared to bupivacaine until 4 h post-operatively indicating a better quality of analgesia with fentanyl.</p><p>Our results are comparable to those of Constant <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Desai <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] who concluded that duration of analgesia with fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg as adjuvant was 5.04 &#x000b1; 0.35 h and 4.21 &#x000b1; 1.75 h respectively. In our study, duration of analgesia with Fentanyl was 5.95 &#x000b1; 0.63 hrs.</p><p>With ketamine added to Bupivacaine, VAS scores were lowest when compared to bupivacaine alone and bupivacaine with fentanyl at all-time points. This difference was statistically significant up to 4 h post-operatively. Rescue analgesia in this group was required at 8 hrs. post-operatively.</p><p>Several studies have shown a longer duration of analgesia with ketamine when used as adjuvant with caudal block in children. Semple <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and Cook <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] demonstrated that caudal ketamine provided a longer median duration of analgesia. Our study confirms that ketamine in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg as adjuvant provides longer duration and better quality of analgesia when compared to bupivacaine alone and bupivacaine with fentanyl, with no incidence of motor weakness or urinary retention.</p><p>Patients in ketamine group were significantly more sedated as compared to the other two groups. However, this sedation was seen only up to 30 min post-operatively. This finding is consistent with that of Martindale SJ <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] who also documented similar findings in their study. Campbell <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] noted no difference in sedation scores between patients receiving caudal bupivacaine and bupivacaine-fentanyl mixture which is in corroboration with our findings.</p><p>With bupivacaine alone, glucose concentration increased significantly at 30 min after surgical incision and 60 min post-operatively from baseline values in all three groups. However this increase in blood glucose was not significant between the groups. Akbas <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] reported comparable increase in blood glucose levels in both groups of patients receiving ketamine or bupivacaine and concluded that addition of ketamine has no further advantage over caudal analgesia with bupivacaine alone in suppressing hyperglycemic response to surgery.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Tuncer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] measured glucose concentration in children who received caudal or general anesthesia. In both groups glucose concentration increased, however glucose concentration was lower in caudal group than control group. In our study blood glucose was significantly increased in all three groups though the values were within normal range. This may be due to hepatic glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis and insulin resistance at cellular level. Thus normal regulation of glucose homeostasis is ineffective peri-operatively and hyperglycemia is inevitable.</p><p>Serum cortisol levels on the other hand, decreased significantly within the groups in all three groups. However, there was no statistical significance between the groups. This is in agreement with the findings of Murat <italic>et al</italic> [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Nakamura and Takasaki[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and Tuncer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who concluded that epidural anesthesia blocks afferent neurogenic impulses from the site of surgery and hence reduces the cortisol response to surgery in children during the first 24 h as compared to general anesthesia alone Similar study carried out by these authors on comparison between clonidine and ketamine added to ropivacaine caudally, on stress hormone levels, found that cortisol levels were reduced in all the groups and opined that there was no added effect of clonidine or ketamine in modifying the stress response.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>We found that serum insulin values decreased significantly within the group in all three groups, though, there was no statistical significance between the groups throughout the study period.</p><p>In a study conducted by Nakamura and Takasaki,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] plasma insulin concentration remained unchanged in the caudal group in children. They suggested that insulin secretion during surgery is suppressed by the direct effect of anesthesia and by activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They stated that this may have resulted from moderate and constant levels of plasma glucose and catecholamines during surgery.</p><p>Our observations are similar to that of Tuncer <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] wherein insulin levels remained lower following caudal block, though in our study all children received caudal block with general anesthesia.</p><p>Thus, from the results of our study we can conclude that ketamine at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg when used as an adjuvant to bupivacaine is better than fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg in terms of analgesia as well as blunting of stress response.</p><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>The patient profile of our study makes it difficult to distinguish between sedation and analgesia as a pain free child is comfortable and asleep. According to Beyer <italic>et al</italic>, self-reporting and behavioral pain measures may be discordant in children between 3 and 7 years of age.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>As the power calculation of the study was based on a difference in analgesia, the difference in stress response may be better highlighted in a larger study. This study can thus serve as a pilot study to indicate difference in stress response by addition of an adjuvant like ketamine and fentanyl to caudal bupivacaine.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
