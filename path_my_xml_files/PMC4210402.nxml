facilitation (PNF) respiration exercise increases the pulmonary function of normal adults.
[Subjects and Methods] Twenty-eight normal adults in their 20s were randomly assigned to
an experimental group (n=14) or control group (n=14). Over the course of four weeks, the
experimental group participated in PNF respiration pattern exercises for 30 minutes three
times per week. Subjects were assessed pre-test and post-test by measurement of pulmonary
function (tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, inspiratory
capacity, and vital capacity). [Results] Our findings show that the experimental group had
significant improvements in expiratory reserve volume and vital capacity. In the
comparison of the two groups, the experimental group had higher pulmonary function than
the control group. [Conclusion] In this study, the experimental group showed greater
improvement in pulmonary function than the control group, which indicates that the PNF
respiration exercise is effective at increasing the pulmonary function of normal
adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pulmonary function</kwd><kwd>Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation</kwd><kwd>Respiration</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Given that the goal of breathing exercise interventions is to minimize disabilities
resulting from diseases and to prevent recurrence, rather than complete recovery from
disease, developing and applying diverse programs that can prevent decreases in respiratory
activities and promote the functional performance of breathing is very important<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Respiratory muscle strength and endurance
can be improved by various breathing exercises which can consequently improve respiratory
functions<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Thus far, breathing exercises using direct interventions that improve respiratory functions
have been performed by diverse subjects. Many studies have been conducted, including studies
of vital capacity using high frequency inspiratory muscle training for normal persons<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, respiratory muscle training for normal

pulmonary functions are improved through direct respiratory function strength training, it
is true that these studies comprise simple self-breathing exercises or one-dimensional basic
resistive breathing exercises. A study conducted by Dietz<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup> indicated that muscle strength can be improved through
three-dimensional spiral large scale resistive exercises using proprioceptive neuromuscular
facilitation (PNF). Therefore this study examined the improvement of respiratory functions
induced by direct respiratory muscle resistive exercises through the PNF respiration
pattern. Although this study was limited in that the experimental subjects were normal
persons, clinical grounds for actual implementation of the exercises will be prepared based
on its results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study subjects were 28 university students attending N University in Cheonan,

and it consisted of 30 minutes of PNF breathing exercises a session. When performing the
PNF breathing exercises were performed, the subjects were in a supine position. A
therapist placed his open hands on the lateral surfaces on both sides of the 8, 9, 10, and
11th ribs of the subject. The therapist instructed the subjects by saying, &#x0201c;Take a deep
breath&#x0201d;. As the subjects&#x02019; ribs moved upward and laterally, the therapist assisted the
movement of the subjects&#x02019; ribs to promote the subjects&#x02019; respiration pattern. At the
subjects&#x02019; maximum inspiration, the therapist said, &#x0201c;Hold your breath for five seconds&#x0201d;
while dorsomedially applying soft manual resistance to the lower rib regions on both
sides. When the subjects&#x02019; breathed out, the therapist said, &#x0201c;breathe out Maximally&#x0201d;. At
this time, the subjects&#x02019; ribs moved downward and medially. At maximum expiration, the
therapist pushed the lower rib regions on both sides upward while gathering the regions
dorsomedially, and the therapist shook the region to assist with the discharge of the air
remaining in the lungs<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The control group performed 30 minutes of diaphragmatic breathing exercises a session
three times per week for four weeks. The subjects prepared by adopting a supine position.
For the breathing exercises, a therapist placed his hands on the top of the rectus
abdominis, immediately below the anterior costal cartilage, and then requested the
subjects to breathe in slowly and deeply with the nose, to relax, and to not move the
upper chest while allowing only the ascent of the abdomen. Next, the therapist instructed
the subjects to exhale all the air slowly<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>If any subject reported fatigue or dizziness during the breathing exercise, he or she was
given a rest was given and the exercise was performed again. The therapist reviewed the
exercise methods with the subject two to three times before the experiment so that the
subject knew what to expect.</p><p>Measurements were conducted in the sitting position using Fit Mates (COSMED Srl, Italy),
which are measuring instruments for pulmonary function tests. To ensure accuracy,
explanations and demonstrations of the procedures were given prior to the measurements.
The experimental group and the control group were instructed to use a mouthpiece, and the
subjects&#x02019; noses were closed during the measurement so that air could not be inhaled or
exhaled through the nose. Beginning from expiration, the subject was instructed to slowly
breathe out completely, and then breathe in slowly when the tester gave a signal. The
values of the tidal volume (TV), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV), expiratory reserve
volume (ERV), inspiratory capacity (IC), and volume capacity (VC) were measured. The
measurements were conducted three times both before and after the experiment, and the
average values of the three measured values were used in the analysis. A resting time of
five minutes was given after each measurement<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, SPSS ver. 12.0 was used to examine the general characteristics of the
subjects and to obtain the means and standard deviations of individual groups. The paired
sample t-test was used to compare pulmonary functions before and after the intervention,
and the exercise and independent sample t-test was used to examine the differences between
the measurements taken before and after the experiment between the groups. The statistical
significance level was chosen as 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Here we review the comparison of vital capacities before and after the intervention between

practice in Korea many problems with respiration appear as chronic disease patients age, and
interventions rely on simple self-breathing exercises, ventilator tube exercises, or drug
treatments. However, as Korea becomes more westernized, the number of subjects who require
breathing exercises will increase. Since the usefulness of direct manual resistive exercises
has been extensively proven<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, diverse breathing exercise intervention methods that will
implement direct interventions should be developed. The present study examined the effects
of a PNF pattern exercise that can induce large scale spiral movements of the lower chest
walls on the pulmonary functions of normal persons in their 20s. The number of repetitions,
the duration, and the length of rest time should be considered to minimize subjects&#x02019; muscle
fatigue and efficiently increase muscle strength<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Given that interventions are effective only when implemented for
at least 20&#x02013;30 minutes, two to five times per week for 4&#x02013;12 weeks<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, in this study, the interventions were conducted for 30
minutes, five times per week for four weeks.</p><p>Vital capacity measurements are indicators that reflect the reserve capacity of
ventilation. The subjects were instructed to breathe normally before breathing in
completely, and then slowly breathe out as completely as possible, regardless of time, to
measure TV, IRV, IRV, IC, and VC<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
results are regarded as being normal when they fall within &#x000b1;20% of the estimated normal
value for the sex, age, height, and weight of the patient<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pulmonary function tests were conducted after four weeks of intervention. The experimental
group showed significant increases in TV, ERV, and VC after the intervention compared to
measurements taken prior the intervention, but they did not show significant increases in
IRV or IC. The control group showed no significant increases in any of the measured items.
In the examination of pretest-posttest changes in the experimental group and the control
group, although the experimental group showed larger increases than the control group in all
measurements, the differences were significant only for ERV and VC. The large increases in
vital capacity are attributable to the fact that when the subject was breathing in, the
therapist promoted the activities of the diaphragm and other assistant inspiratory muscles.
This was done first with an increase of intra-abdominal pressure through the resistive
inspiration movement caused by pushing both sides of the subject&#x02019;s chest walls toward the
head to cause spiral movements. When the subject was breathing out, the mobility of the
chest walls was increased as much as possible to induce maximum lung ventilation by giving
assistive movements with medial gathering of the lower chest walls.</p><p>Enright et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that vital
capacity, total vital capacity, inspiratory muscle strength, and inspiratory muscle
endurance were significantly increased by high frequency inspiratory training performed by
normal persons, and Townsend<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> found that
when breathing exercises were performed by normal persons, the results of inspiratory volume
and those of expiratory volumes showed large differences. Estenne et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> reported an increase of 47% in expiratory
reserve volume in quadriplegia patients they performed pectoralis major muscle strengthening
exercises. Liaw et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that
after resistive inspiratory muscle strengthening exercises were performed by spinal cord
injury patients; the experimental group showed a 67% change in vital capacity, while the
control group showed a 27% change. Jones et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that respiration volume per breath cycle at normal times
were increased by diaphragmatic breathing exercises performed by COPD patients, and that
increases in final inspiration volumes and momentary amounts of ventilation appeared in COPD
patients after pursed-lip breathing exercises. Increases in respiration volumes of patients
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease occurred after pursed-lip breathing
exercises<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Scherer et al.<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that after continuous breathing
exercises, COPD patients saw significant increases in ventilatory and inspiratory threshold
load and expiratory pressure, and Satori et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> observed that feedback breathing exercises significantly increased
fibrous cyst patients&#x02019; forced expiratory volume in 1 second. In previous studies, pulmonary
functions were improved by diverse exercises aimed at improving the respiratory activities
of normal persons, lung disease patients, and nervous system disease patients. PNF breathing
exercises showed similar effects to those of direct breathing exercises, for normal
persons.</p><p>The experimental group showed greater improvements in the pulmonary functions of TV, IRV,
ERV, IC, and VC than the control group. In the experimental repetitive PNF breathing
exercises, the mobility of the subjects&#x02019; chest walls increased, which led to improvements in
pulmonary function. Breathing physical therapy has not yet been universalized in
rehabilitation centers in Korea. Given that breathing physical therapy has already been
universalized in advanced countries, when breathing physical therapy interventions become
more popular in Korea through the development of diverse physical therapies, many
opportunities to implement effective breathing intervention programs for patients with weak
cardiopulmonary functions will appear.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This Research was supported by the Korean Nazarene University Research Grants 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Han</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>[The effects of a pulmonary rehabilitation program for
