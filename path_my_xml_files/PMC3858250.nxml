Improvements in systemic and regional chemotherapy as well as surgical technology has allowed an increasing number of patients to be candidates for resection with curative intent. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Poston1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> Liver resection has been accepted as the most effective therapy for resectable MCRC isolated to the liver with documented 5-year survival rates of up to 58% for well selected patients. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Tomlinson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081680-Pawlik1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> However, even with complete resection, the majority of patients develop recurrence, commonly within the liver remnant, and a high proportion of this group dies within 2&#x02013;3 years. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Farid1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> Therefore, accurate risk stratification is essential to optimize individual decision making in selection of surgery, and use of adjuvant therapies.</p><p>Multiple prognostic scoring systems have been proposed using clinical criteria to stratify the risk of recurrence and cancer-related death after liver resection for patients with MCRC. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Zakaria1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Cady1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0081680-Nordlinger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> However most systems are based on single-institutional data and are therefore steeped with bias related to local referral patterns, patient selection and treatment approaches.

All the patients provided written consents for tissue procurement and use of them for research purpose. Fresh-frozen tumor specimens of MCRC in resected liver specimens were obtained from our departmental tissue bank on a separate IRB approved tissue harvesting protocol. All archived metastatic tumors in the tissue bank were collected at the time of surgery from patients who underwent liver resection at our institution. The clinical information for corresponding patients including demographics, pathologic findings and stage, perioperative therapy and follow-up data was obtained from a prospectively maintained hepatic resection database and supplemented by medical record review.</p><p>The authors&#x02019; approach to hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer has been described previously. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Tomlinson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Fong1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> In general, patients were submitted to operation when a therapeutic benefit was considered likely and treatment of all disease was technically feasible. Preoperative imaging included contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with additional imaging performed at the discretion of the treating physician. Colonoscopy was performed within 1 year of liver resection. Decisions regarding the use of hepatic arterial infusion (HAI), adjuvant and/or neo-adjuvant systemic chemotherapy were made on an individual basis in conjunction with consulting medical oncologists. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Kemeny1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> Patients were followed with periodic clinical evaluations, serum CEA levels and CT scans of chest/abdomen/pelvis.</p><p>Our unit has previously published a clinical risk score (CRS) using preoperative variables in an effort to stratify patients in terms of survival following hepatic resection for MCRC. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Fong1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> The factors that comprise the CRS include 1) lymph node status of the primary tumor, 2) disease free interval (&#x0003c;12 months or &#x02265;12 months), 3) serum CEA level prior to liver resection (&#x0003e;200 ng/ml or &#x02264;200 ng/ml), 4) number of hepatic tumors (1 or &#x0003e;1) and 5) tumor size (&#x02264;5 cm or &#x0003e;5 cm). Patients receive 1 point for each adverse factor, and the CRS represents the sum. Patients were then divided into two groups: high risk (CRS&#x02265;3) and low risk (CRS&#x0003c;3).</p><p>The study endpoints were disease-specific survival (DSS), overall recurrence-free survival (RFS) and liver recurrence-free survival (LRFS). DSS was measured from the time of liver resection to death or last follow-up. RFS and LRFS were measured from the time of liver resection to the time when 1<sup>st</sup> recurrence and liver recurrence was detected, respectively.</p><p>From January 2000 through August 2007, a total of 446 specimens from patients who underwent liver resection for MCRC were banked. Patients with extrahepatic metastasis, those who underwent a margin positive resection, those with missing CRS score data and those without adequate follow-up were excluded. After these exclusions, frozen sections of 307 OCT-embedded samples were evaluated. After histological verification under hematoxylin and eosin staining, 187 of them were found to have at least 70% viable tumor cells. Those frozen tissue samples were macrodissected from the selected area of OCT block and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA quality of these 187 samples was then assayed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technology, Palo Alto, CA), and 96 of them were found to be optimal quality for microarray analysis with RNA integrity number (RNI) &#x02265;7.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Microarray Analysis</title><p>Extracted total RNA was reverse-transcribed by a previously published method <xref rid="pone.0081680-vantVeer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> and the resulting complimentary DNA template was applied to gene expression analysis. The target cDNAs were hybridized to Illumina HumanHT-12 Gene Chip containing a total of 47,231 annotated gene probe sets (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Arrays were scanned by using standard Ilumina protocols and scanners. Microarray data are available in the ArrayExpress database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress">www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</ext-link>) under accession number E-MTAB-1951.

The data from the training set cohort was used to select prognostic genes and to construct molecular risk scores (MRS), and the data from the testing set cohort was used for its validation.</p><p>The microarray data were log2 transformed and quantile normalized. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Quackenbush1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> The supervised principal components method was used to identify prognostic gene signatures as described previously. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Bair1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> In brief, first, the univariate regression coefficients for each gene associated with specific outcomes (DSS, RFS, or LRFS) in the training data were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model <xref rid="pone.0081680-Cox1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Second, the genes significantly associated with the outcome (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) were ranked in the order of their regression coefficient and the top genes with the coefficient about the threshold value were selected as &#x0201c;principle component&#x0201d;. The threshold value was estimated and determined using cross-validation. Third, the first principal component was used to create the MRS, which was defined as the linear combination of weighted expression signals with the standardized Cox&#x02019;s regression coefficient as the weight.</p><p>The patients in the training set cohort were classified into a high and low-risk group based on the median value of the MRS. The median MRS was chosen as the threshold in order to eliminate the effect of extreme values in the training set and to have equal numbers of patients in the high and low risk groups. Survival probabilities were estimated using the method of Kaplan and Meier <xref rid="pone.0081680-Kaplan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and compared using the Log-Rank test. Of note, although we attempted to construct an MRS for DSS, RFS and LRFS, we could not calculate an adequately prognostic MRS for RFS. Therefore, the presented analysis focused on DSS and LRFS.</p><p>As some patients with MCRC died of extra-hepatic recurrence, the event of liver recurrence and cancer-specific death can compete with each other. To evaluate the effect of cancer death without liver recurrence on gene analysis for liver-specific recurrence, genes associated with liver-recurrence were assessed by two analytical methods; competing risk analysis in which cancer-specific death was considered as competing risk and Cox-regression analysis in which it was considered as censoring. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Satagopan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>For the validation of the MRS models we assessed the discrimination of DSS and LRFS by the MRS when applied to the test set cohort. The MRS and the threshold value derived from the training set cohort were not re-estimated, but directly applied to the test set. Discrimination was quantified using the concordance-index. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Oakes1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> Concordance indices range from 0 to 1, with a value of 1 indicating that the model perfectly discriminates between patients with higher and lower risk of death (or recurrence), and a value of 0.5 indicating that the predictive ability of the model is no better than chance alone. The statistical relationship between the MRS and CRS was assessed using multivariate Cox-regression analysis. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0081680-g001">Figure 1</xref> outlines the experimental flow of the study.</p><fig id="pone-0081680-g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0081680.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study profile.</title><p>Ninety-six samples were selected from our departmental tissue bank.

The MRSs were validated to be able to independently predict DSS and LRFS. Importantly, this prognostic ability was independent of our best clinical predictor, the CRS.

Recent increased use of effective chemotherapy has expanded the indication for surgical therapy and made more patients potentially eligible for resection. As a result, the additional heterogeneity of treatment backgrounds has added to the complexity of this patient population further limiting the broad applicability and prognostic power of clinicopathological variables. Azye et al recently demonstrated a significant difference in the predictive power of several clinical risk scoring systems for patients with MCRC who did and did not receive chemotherapy prior to liver resection. Furthermore, in the patients who received chemotherapy prior to resection the clinical risk scoring systems were more accurate when measured after response to therapy was accounted for. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Ayez1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> This observation further highlights the limitations of clinical staging schemes in the current era.</p><p>Despite the fact that 75% of our patients received various chemotherapy regimens as adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy, the CRS was shown to be a reasonably accurate predictor of cancer death and liver recurrence (concordance indices 0.65 and 0.66, respectively). This finding is consistent with previously reported outcomes from our institution. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Tomlinson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Ito1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Fong1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> However, the CRS is imperfect for clinical use as a guide to individualize therapy for patients with resectable hepatic MCRC. First, the predictive ability of the CRS does not consistently predict outcomes in similar patient populations in different institutions. For example, Zakaria, et al reported a much lower concordance index (0.56) for our CRS when it was applied to their cohort of patients at the Mayo Clinic. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Zakaria1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Secondly and more importantly, the difference in outcomes for patients with high and low CRSs is not great enough to impact clinical management. For example, the median survival of patients with a high CRS in this study was 38 months, making it difficult to recommend against resection for these patients. Therefore, our goal was to identify a genetic biomarker that could identify patients with such favorable or poor outcomes that clinical decisions could be rendered; avoiding futile surgery or performing surgery in patients with apparently poor clinical characteristics.</p><p>Global gene expression profiling in MCRC will likely provide greater insight into the underlying biology and clinical behavior of specific patients. It also seems likely that this genetic profiling will ultimately provide prognostic signatures that can dictate specific treatment regimens based on superior outcome prediction. It is not surprising that our MRS, based on gene profiling, was a powerful and independent prognostic tool for cancer-related death and recurrence patterns. A critically important finding in this study was that there was a significant discrepancy in risk-stratification by CRS and MRS and that these prognostic scores were independently predictive based on a multivariate analysis. For example, among the patients who classified as high risk for cancer death by MRS, more than half (53%) of them was classified as low risk by CRS (&#x0003c;3). This finding indicates that combining clinical and molecular prognostic tools may be the most powerful method of predicting outcome and impacting treatments decisions for patients with resectable hepatic MCRC.</p><p>In addition to cancer-specific death, overall and liver recurrence was chosen as one of the end points of treatment failure in the current study. No accurate predictor of overall RFS could be determined. Although the reason why a gene signature failed to be associated with overall recurrence is not clear, one possible explanation is inaccuracy in diagnosis of extrahepatic recurrence, especially in lymph nodes. Tsunoda et al. reported only 75% of accuracy in diagnosis of lymph node metastasis of colorectal cancer by PET/CT. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Tsunoda1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> It should be noted that in this study, the recurrence was defined based on imaging studies and histological confirmation was not necessary obtained. Although HAI chemotherapy is well known to reduce liver recurrence after hepatectomy for MCRC <xref rid="pone.0081680-Kemeny1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Kemeny2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, it has not been universally accepted due to the difficulty in administering this therapy and concerns over biliary toxicity. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Ito2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> Accurate prediction of liver-specific recurrence would be useful to select patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant regional therapies such as HAI chemotherapy. In this study, one third of our patients received HAI chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. However, the fraction of patients who received HAI chemotherapy was not higher in the group with a high MRS for liver recurrence than in the one with a low MRS. As was the case for DSS, the CRS and MRS were independent of each other in their ability to predict liver recurrence and were powerful in combination in predicting this event.</p><p>MRS provides additional prognostic information over the CRS and the combination of these two significantly improves risk stratification following liver resection. Among the entire cohort, 90% of the patients classified as high risk by both CRS and MRS developed liver recurrence and more than 65% died within 3 years, while more than 85% of those classified low risk both by CRS and MRS were liver recurrence free and 90% were alive at 3 years. Identification and further validation of such high and low risk groups could lead to consideration of individualized therapy for these patients. For example, non-operative approaches could be considered for patients at high risk of early death and adjuvant regional strategies such as HAI chemotherapy could be considered for patients at high risk of liver recurrence. Conversely, patients with a low risk of failure could be considered for surgery alone without additional chemotherapy. Prospective evaluation of the use of such powerful prognostic data on the selection of patients for novel therapeutic approaches is warranted.</p><p>The genes that constitute the risk scores were selected in a purely statistical manner from the pool of genes in the array, and a mechanistic role in colorectal cancer progression has not been defined for many. However, some of the selected genes have been shown to play an important role in cancer biology. For example, <italic>FGFBP1</italic> (fibroblast growth factor binding protein 1) was identified as one of the genes with the highest impact on both DSS and LRFS. This gene is shown to play a critical role in promoting tumor angiogenesis in various cancers including colorectal. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Czubayko1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> Another predictive gene identified in this study was <italic>BAG3</italic> (BCL-2 associated athanogene 3) which is known to have anti-apoptotic effects in cancer cells and enhance resistance to chemotherapy. <xref rid="pone.0081680-Ammirante1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref> The list of predictive genes we have identified may also provide insight and direction into the study of the biology of resectable metastatic colorectal cancer to the liver, as well as provide potential new targets for therapeutic development. On the other hand, it is important to note that this study was not designed to explore related biological pathways and that the expression signatures do not include all relevant genetic events to explain underlying tumor biology.</p><p>Limitations of the current study include its retrospective nature, selection bias of the tumor samples and limited sample size. Due to the technical limitations of the Illumina gene chip, only patients with banked frozen tissue could be included. Additionally, some of the tissue samples with poor quality RNA were excluded in order to obtain accurate data. In fact, 31% of our patients were excluded from this study because the tumor did not contain enough viable cells on screening histological examination. Furthermore, tumors with a radiologic complete response to chemotherapy were not in our tumor bank. Therefore, prospective evaluation of the MRS using tissues obtained prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy is an important consideration. Fortunately, newer technology that allows genomic profiling of partially degraded samples, such as formalin-fixed tissue <xref rid="pone.0081680-Hoshida1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Rimsza1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> is being developed and used. Furthermore, the performance of current hybridization-based array technologies continues to improve, while costs decrease <xref rid="pone.0081680-Ammirante1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Rimsza1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The genetic heterogeneity of multiple metastatic tumors may be another limitation of this study. The majority of the patients had multiple tumors but only one tumor per patient was assayed. Two studies evaluating the gene expression profiles both of primary colorectal cancer and corresponding hepatic metastasis have demonstrated remarkably similar gene expression profiles between the primary and metastatic tumors. <xref rid="pone.0081680-DArrigo1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0081680-Koehler1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref> Given the similarity in gene profile between primary and metastatatic tumors it is likely that the gene expression of multiple liver metastases in a single patient are similar. Chemotherapy prior to liver resection theoretically might alter the gene expression of metastatic tumors. However, this has never been definitively proven and does not compromise the prognostic importance of MRS, as we directly correlated the snap shot of gene expression profile at the time of surgery (regardless of prior chemotherapy) with long-term outcomes. Furthermore, the MRSs among patients who received chemotherapy prior to liver surgery were not significantly different from the MRSs of those who did not.</p><p>With further improvements in technology and the clear need for better prognostication in cancer, molecular predictive tools will very likely play a more prominent role. Further clinical validation of the MRSs developed in our study will be needed before it is introduced into clinical practice and such technological advances will make large-scale validation studies possible. A custom gene chip of the 19 genes associated with survival in the current study may be useful in the complete staging of patients with resectable MCRC isolated in liver. Molecular staging incorporating MRSs with other clinicopathological features will likely provide better and clinically meaningful risk-stratification for patients with hepatic MCRC than current TNM staging.</p><p>In summary, this global gene expression analysis of tumors from patients undergoing hepatectomy for MCRC allowed us to construct a novel molecular marker to predict long-term prognosis. These molecular risk scores predicted liver recurrence and cancer death better than and independent of the clinical risk score. Furthermore, the combination of the CRS and MRS provided very powerful and clinically meaningful prediction of outcomes. While further validations of these gene signatures using larger multi-institutional cohorts are needed, these new staging systems incorporating clinicopathological and genetic variables may provide more accurate risk stratification, and the potential for individualized therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0081680.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
