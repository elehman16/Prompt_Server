</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Achievement of recommended glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) targets in patients with diabetes requires optimisation of postprandial glucose control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The development of rapid-acting insulin analogues (insulin aspart, insulin lispro and insulin glulisine) has provided improved postprandial glycaemia through accelerated absorption and earlier onset of action compared with regular human insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nonetheless, even with rapid-acting insulin analogues, absorption is too slow to achieve optimal control of postprandial glucose when administered at the start of the meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It has been shown that administration of current rapid-acting insulin approximately 15&#x000a0;min before the start of the meal provides the best possible postprandial glycaemia with these products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The injection&#x02013;meal interval compensates for the delay from subcutaneous injection until the circulating insulin concentration becomes sufficient to match the carbohydrate uptake following a meal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]; however, in accordance with current labelling, and for ease and convenience, many patients with diabetes use a shorter or no injection&#x02013;meal interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for insulins with more rapid pharmacological properties that better mimic the endogenous prandial insulin secretion in healthy individuals.</p><p>Faster-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is insulin aspart in a new formulation including two well-known additional excipients, <sc>l</sc>-arginine and niacinamide, which provide a stable formulation with faster early absorption. <sc>l</sc>-arginine and niacinamide are both listed in the US FDA inactive ingredient database, in products for injection, at higher concentrations than used in faster aspart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a previous trial in subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), a single dose of faster aspart 0.2&#x000a0;U/kg provided twice as fast onset of appearance, twofold greater early insulin exposure and 50% greater early glucose-lowering effect within the first 30&#x000a0;min after injection compared with insulin aspart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In patients with diabetes, mealtime insulin requirements can vary substantially depending on carbohydrate content and glycaemic index of the meal. It is therefore important to assess whether the improved pharmacological properties of faster aspart versus insulin aspart at 0.2 U/kg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] are also found across a broader dose range. Moreover, as reliable titration of an insulin product depends on an established dose&#x02013;response relationship, it is pertinent to investigate the dose&#x02013;concentration and dose&#x02013;response relationships of any new insulin. Finally, the degree of variability in insulin action between similar consecutive insulin injections has considerable impact on the ability to achieve strict glycaemic control without the risk of hypoglycaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Thus, it is highly relevant to investigate within-subject variability in the glucose-lowering effect of faster aspart.</p><p>In this glucose clamp study, we compared faster aspart and insulin aspart with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties across three clinically relevant dose levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 U/kg). Furthermore, we investigated the dose&#x02013;concentration and dose&#x02013;response relationships of faster aspart, and compared the within-subject variability in glucose-lowering effect between faster aspart and insulin aspart. The study was conducted in subjects with T1DM, who are regarded as the optimal population in glucose clamp studies because the glucose-lowering effect can be compared between exogenous insulins without interference from endogenous insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design and Participants</title><p>This was a randomised, single-centre (Profil, Neuss, Germany), double-blind, eight-period, crossover trial.

All subjects received three dose levels (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4&#x000a0;U/kg) of faster aspart and insulin aspart to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties between treatments, and to investigate the dose&#x02013;concentration and dose&#x02013;response relationships. To estimate the within-subject variability, subjects were randomised to receive either two additional doses of faster aspart 0.2&#x000a0;U/kg or two additional doses of insulin aspart 0.2 U/kg (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Moreover, in order to estimate the within-subject variability, subjects received two additional doses of either faster aspart 0.2 U/kg or insulin aspart 0.2 U/kg.

</p><p>The trial products were faster aspart (100 U/mL; Novo Nordisk, Bagsv&#x000e6;rd, Denmark) and insulin aspart (NovoRapid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; 100 U/mL; Novo Nordisk), both in a blinded PDS290 pen-injector prefilled pen (Novo Nordisk). Trial products were administered by subcutaneous injection into a lifted skinfold of the lower abdominal wall above the inguinal area by a qualified person with no other tasks in the study, to keep its double-blind nature.</p><p>At each dosing visit, subjects attended the clinical site in the morning after having fasted since 2200&#x000a0;h the evening before (except for water ad libitum and&#x000a0;&#x02264;20&#x000a0;g of rapidly absorbable carbohydrate if needed to prevent hypoglycaemia). A euglycaemic glucose clamp procedure (ClampArt<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Profil) was then conducted as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Initially, subjects received a variable intravenous infusion of regular human insulin [15&#x000a0;IU Actrapid<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (100&#x000a0;IU/mL; Novo Nordisk) in 49&#x000a0;mL saline and 1&#x000a0;mL of the subject&#x02019;s blood] or glucose (20%) for 1&#x02013;4&#x000a0;h before dosing to obtain a blood glucose target level of 5.5&#x000a0;mmol/L (100&#x000a0;mg/dL). The intravenous insulin infusion rate was manually adjusted by attending staff based on actual blood glucose measurements, while the intravenous glucose infusion rate was automatically adjusted by ClampArt<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in order to keep blood glucose at the target level throughout the glucose clamp. Dosing of the trial product occurred after blood glucose concentration had been stable for &#x02265;1&#x000a0;h, with no infusion of glucose. After dosing, the rate of intravenous insulin infusion (if any) was gradually reduced and terminated completely when blood glucose had fallen by 0.3&#x000a0;mmol/L (5&#x000a0;mg/dL). The intravenous glucose infusion was then initiated. The clamp lasted for up to 12&#x000a0;h after dosing, but was stopped earlier if blood glucose consistently exceeded 11.1&#x000a0;mmol/L (200&#x000a0;mg/dL) without the need for intravenous glucose infusion during the last 30&#x000a0;min. Mean profiles of intravenous insulin infusion from &#x02212;60&#x000a0;min until blood glucose had fallen by 0.3&#x000a0;mmol/L (5&#x000a0;mg/dL), and mean profiles of blood glucose concentration from &#x02212;60&#x000a0;min until 30&#x000a0;min, are shown in Online Resource 1, Fig. S1.

This finding may imply that faster aspart has the potential to provide clinical benefits over current rapid-acting insulin analogues in terms of improved postprandial glucose control in subjects with diabetes. Indeed, in a phase III study in subjects with T1DM treated in a basal-bolus regimen, faster aspart showed superiority over insulin aspart with respect to change from baseline in 2-h postprandial glucose increments in a standardised meal test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In addition, a statistically significant difference in favour of faster aspart was observed with respect to change from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increments. Consistent with the pharmacodynamic time profiles of faster aspart versus insulin aspart, the treatment difference in the meal-test was more pronounced after 1&#x000a0;h than after 2&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In the same study, HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction was shown to be statistically significantly greater for faster aspart versus insulin aspart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In another phase III study in subjects with T2DM treated in a basal-bolus regimen plus metformin, the reduction from baseline in 1-h postprandial glucose increments was statistically significantly greater for faster aspart versus insulin aspart in a meal-test, while the difference in the reduction from baseline in 2-h postprandial glucose increments in favour of faster aspart did not reach statistical significance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In that study, non-inferiority in HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction was demonstrated for faster aspart versus insulin aspart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. No statistically significant differences were observed in overall rate of severe or confirmed hypoglycaemia in either of the two studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Current rapid-acting insulins provide the best possible prandial glucose control if administered approximately 15&#x000a0;min before the start of the meal to compensate for the lag time occurring from subcutaneous injection until sufficient insulin has been absorbed into the circulation to handle the carbohydrate uptake after meal ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Despite this, a lot of patients with diabetes use no, or only a very limited, injection&#x02013;meal interval in line with approved labelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The improved pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart versus insulin aspart would be expected to facilitate mealtime dosing, thereby reducing the need for an injection&#x02013;meal interval with faster aspart. Moreover, the pharmacodynamic properties of faster aspart may open for the option of postmeal dosing when needed. Thus, treatment with faster aspart at 20&#x000a0;min postmeal has been investigated and showed non-inferior HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction versus insulin aspart administered at mealtime in addition to comparable overall rates of severe and confirmed hypoglycaemia in subjects with T1DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, it is reassuring to observe that the within-subject variability in early, as well as total, glucose-lowering effect was at the same low level for faster aspart as for insulin aspart, being in the range of 18&#x02013;25%. Insulin aspart has previously been shown to have a within-subject variability in glucose-lowering effect of approximately 15&#x02013;25%, which is comparable to that of regular human insulin, insulin lispro and insulin glulisine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This is in contrast to the somewhat higher within-subject variability in glucose-lowering effect of 48&#x02013;99% reported for several basal insulin preparations, such as insulin glargine 100&#x000a0;U/mL, neutral protamine hagedorn (NPH) insulin and protaminated insulin lispro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. At the same time, it is on par with the within-subject variability of 20 and 27% shown for insulin degludec and insulin detemir, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. With the relatively low variability in glucose-lowering effect of faster aspart between subsequent administrations, it is anticipated that its faster onset and greater early exposure and glucose-lowering effect will be consistent from day to day in clinical practice. Between-subject variability was also shown to be comparable for faster aspart and insulin aspart in the current study, although this is less clinically relevant since insulin should always be titrated according to individual needs.</p><p>We have no immediate explanation for the fact that the increase in AUC<sub>IAsp,0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub> and <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> with increasing dose of faster aspart was slightly greater than dose proportional. The same was observed for insulin aspart in the present study and has also been previously observed for the insulin aspart component of insulin degludec/insulin aspart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The deviation from dose proportionality observed in the present study corresponds to a 12% increase in total exposure and maximum concentration in response to a 10% increase in the faster aspart dose. Such a minor deviation is not considered to impose any practical implications in the clinical setting.</p><p>We observed a slight levelling off for both AUC<sub>GIR,0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic></sub> and GIR<sub>max</sub> when the dose increased from 0.2 to 0.4&#x000a0;U/kg of faster aspart and insulin aspart. The same has been observed previously in dose&#x02013;response studies with regular human insulin, insulin glulisine and insulin aspart at dose levels of 0.3&#x02013;0.35&#x000a0;U/kg, presumably indicating saturation of glucose-lowering effect in some subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Thus, at dose levels of 0.3&#x02013;0.4&#x000a0;U/kg, some subjects may approach their maximum rate of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, which on average lies in the range of 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;mg/kg/min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, it is important to note that saturation of glucose-lowering effect is mainly an experimental phenomenon caused by the fixed-dose levels administered in a glucose clamp study. In the clinical setting, individual insulin titration should ensure that subjects remain on the linear part of their insulin dose&#x02013;response curve.</p><p>In the present study, <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> for the 0.1&#x000a0;U/kg dose was slightly lower, and <italic>C</italic>

However, importantly, GIR<sub>max</sub> was similar between faster aspart and insulin aspart at all three dose levels. Therefore, a fully reliable comparison between treatments was possible for the corresponding pharmacodynamic endpoint, <italic>t</italic>
