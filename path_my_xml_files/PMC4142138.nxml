The objective of the study was to evaluate the relative bioavailability, including the inter-subject variability, of a conventional immediate-release (IR) formulation and two prototype bioenhanced formulations of danirixin during gastric acid suppression in a healthy, elderly population. A single-centre, crossover study in healthy male and female volunteers aged 65&#x02013;80&#x000a0;years was conducted. Subjects were randomised to receive danirixin 50&#x000a0;mg IR in the fed and fasted states and danirixin 50&#x000a0;mg Bioenhanced Formulation 1 and 2 in the fasted state. All subjects also received omeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg each morning beginning 4&#x000a0;days prior to the first treatment period and continuing through danirixin dosing in the final treatment period. Twenty subjects were randomised and completed the study. Bioenhanced Formulation 2 in the fasted state demonstrated the highest adjusted geometric means for AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;<italic>t</italic>)</sub>, AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;inf)</sub>, AUC<sub>(0&#x02013;24)</sub> and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>. Danirixin IR demonstrated adjusted means that were higher in the fed state compared with the fasted state. For all formulations tested, there was substantial inter-subject variability (CVb &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;% for all formulations). The overall incidences of adverse events (AEs) were 10&#x000a0;% for danirixin IR (both in the fed and fasted states) and 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% for the bioenhanced formulations. The majority of AEs were mild in intensity. There were no serious AEs. Concomitant use of omeprazole resulted in large inter-subject variability in the exposure to danirixin. Bioenhanced formulation strategies could not overcome the effect of omeprazole on exposure and variability between subjects.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Bioavailability</kwd><kwd>Chemokine receptor antagonist</kwd><kwd>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>Danirixin</kwd><kwd>GSK1325756</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Danirixin (GSK1325756) is a small, non-peptide, high-affinity (IC<sub>50</sub> for CXCL8 binding 12.5&#x000a0;nM), selective and reversible CXCR2 antagonist. Danirixin has demonstrated potent antagonism of CXCR2 activity, both in vitro and in vivo in preclinical studies (GSK, data on file). Its oral potency and duration of action support its potential use as an oral, anti-inflammatory agent in the treatment of disorders associated with the accumulation of neutrophils.</p><p>CXCR2, one of a family of CXC chemokine receptors, is necessary for the chemokine-mediated recruitment of neutrophils to sites of inflammation (Chapman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). The neutrophil is thought to be an important contributor, via the release of tissue-destructive proteases and other mediators, to excess mucus production, airway stenosis, and destruction of the lung parenchyma which, in part, is responsible for the decline in lung function associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or COPD (Stockley <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2002</xref>; Quint and Wedzicha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>). Levels of CXCL8 (interleukin-8) and other CXCR2 ligands (e.g. CXCL5 or ENA-78) are elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the sputum of patients with COPD (Mukaida <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>). Several molecules with CXCR2 antagonist activity have been shown to reduce neutrophils migration to the lung in experimental medicine studies and in diseased subjects (Holz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>; Lazaar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Nair et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>; Rennard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2013</xref>). Selective antagonism of the CXCR2 receptor provides a potential strategy for reducing the underlying inflammation that contributes to the progression of COPD and other neutrophil-mediated diseases (Chapman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>).</p><p>Danirixin has its highest solubility at pH <underline>&#x0003c;</underline>2. The formulation strategy for the clinical development of danirixin has been focussed on optimising dissolution in the stomach to deliver a solution of the drug for absorption in the small intestine. A raised intra-gastric pH could have a significant impact on the dissolution and hence absorption of danirixin. In fact, inter-subject variability in danirixin exposure in elderly subjects, particularly in the fasted state and when given on a background of proton pump inhibitor use has been demonstrated, raising an important consideration for designing clinical trials of danirixin in patient populations (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013b</xref>).</p><p>Proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2-receptor antagonists are widely used for the management of disorders associated with excess gastric acid production (Blume et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). Because these drugs are typically used for long-term treatment, the potential for clinically significant drug interactions exists. Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a co-morbidity associated with COPD (Bor et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2010</xref>) and gastric acid-suppressing medications are commonly used by COPD patients. Though metabolic drug interactions (e.g. with the cytochrome P450 system) are a concern with several proton pump inhibitors, these agents may also alter the exposure to drugs for which a low gastric pH is required for optimal dissolution and subsequent absorption (Shi and Klotz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2008</xref>; Blume et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>; Budha et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2012</xref>). Additionally, reduced production of gastric acid in some elderly subjects may also contribute to altered pharmacokinetics of some drugs in this population (Russell et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1993</xref>).</p><p>The aims of the current study were to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, with particular attention to inter-subject variability of several formulations of danirixin, including two bioenhanced formulations under conditions of gastric acid suppression in healthy elderly subjects. The bioenhanced formulations were developed to determine if the impact of a raised gastric pH on the pharmacokinetics of danirixin could be overcome through an alternative formulation approach.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Danirixin formulations</title><p>The structure of danirixin is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

These formulations were developed with the potential to enhance bioavailability compared to the initial immediate-release formulation under conditions of higher gastric pH. Tablets contained 25&#x000a0;mg of danirixin free base. The two formulations were similar to the original IR formulation with the exception of the addition of citric acid in Bioenhanced Formulation 1 (BE1) and both citric acid and poloxamer 407 in Bioenhanced Formulation 2 (BE2). In BE1, these modifications were made to enhance the solubility&#x000a0;of danirixin in higher pH environments by reducing the localised pH around the disintegrating tablet, and in BE2 poloxamer was also added to improve wetting of the drug to aid dissolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>In vitro solubility testing of danirixin</title><p>The determination of the pH solubility profile of danirixin was performed by adding excess danirixin to the appropriate pH Britton&#x02013;Robinson buffer solutions in a vial.

Though the effect of omeprazole was expected based on the pH solubility profile of danirixin free base, this drug interaction might limit the use of danirixin in patient populations in which use of proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2-receptor antagonists is common. The primary goal of the present study was to determine if bioenhanced formulations of danirixin free base could reduce the wide inter-subject variability in exposure on a background of concomitant proton pump inhibitor use (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013b</xref>). The study evaluated the relative bioavailability, including the inter-subject variability of danirixin IR in the fed and fasted states and of two prototype bioenhanced formulations of danirixin in the fasted state during gastric acid suppression.</p><p>All formulations of danirixin, regardless of fed or fasted state, exhibited substantial inter-subject variability (CVb values &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;% for all formulations). This wide variability in exposure is consistent with the results of a previous study that investigated danirixin in the fed and fasted states (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013b</xref>). However, the previous study did demonstrate reduced variability in exposure when danirixin was administered with food. The lack of improvement in variability with the bioenhanced formulations of danirixin in the present study indicates that the tested formulations cannot overcome the effects of gastric acid suppression on danirixin pharmacokinetics. Regular, daily use of proton pump inhibitors such as omeprazole will increase intragastric pH levels to above 4.0 (Blum et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>) and this likely accounts for the reduction in exposure and the inter- and intra-subject variability observed in the present study.</p><p>Systemic exposure to danirixin, in terms of AUC and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, was generally highest following Bioenhanced Formulation 2 compared with the other formulations in the fasted state, but this was not associated with any reduction in inter-subject variability. Systemic exposure following the danirixin IR formulation was higher in the fed state compared with the fasted state. The estimated terminal <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values were similar for the different danirixin formulations in this study (7&#x02013;9&#x000a0;h) and were in line with previously determined values, suggesting that the elimination of danirixin was independent of formulation dose or fed/fasted status, supporting the conclusion that dissolution and absorption in the gastrointestinal track are major determinants of systemic exposure following oral administration (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013b</xref>).</p><p>In the present study danirixin exposures in Treatment Period 1 were higher than exposures for the subsequent treatment periods. It is unclear whether this unexpected &#x02018;period&#x02019; effect is real as the exposure and variability of danirixin are consistent with a prior study in which the omeprazole interaction was evaluated (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2013b</xref>). The possibility of some variability over time in gastric pH due to omeprazole is a potential explanation, though neither gastric pH nor the PK of omeprazole was measured. Steady-state levels of omeprazole should have been achieved prior to dosing on Day 1 of Treatment Period 1. It does not appear that lack of compliance with the omeprazole dosing regimen during any of the treatment periods was a factor.</p><p>Overall, all formulations of danirixin were well tolerated in the healthy elderly population assessed in this study and no major safety concerns were identified. The safety profile was similar to that observed in prior studies (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref>) and was not different between danirixin IR in the fed and fasted states. The incidence of reported AEs with the bioenhanced formulations was similar, but slightly higher than for danirixin IR. In the current study, there were no reports of neutropaenia or sustained decreases in neutrophil count, which is also consistent with previous single- and repeat-dose danirixin studies (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref>).</p><p>This study has several strengths and potential limitations. Overall, the study results are largely consistent with those from a previous study of danirixin (GSK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">b</xref>) and the collective results from both studies will help to guide selection of the most appropriate formulation/dosing regimen for future investigations. The observed (and statistically significant) treatment period effect was unexpected and remains unexplained. However, this did not interfere with the study objectives as the results with the conventional immediate-release formulation were consistent with previous studies.</p><p>In conclusion, although systemic exposures were higher for Bioenhanced Formulation 2 of danirixin in the fasted state than for any other formulation of danirixin during either fasted or fed states, the bioenhanced formulations do not confer any advantage over a conventional immediate-release formulation with regard to inter-subject variability on a background of concomitant proton pump inhibitor use. Concomitant use of gastric acid suppressing medications will need to be a consideration in the selection of appropriate subjects for further clinical development of danirixin.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support in the form of development of a manuscript first draft in consultation with the lead author, fact checking, referencing and assembling tables was provided by Tara N Miller, PhD at Gardiner-Caldwell Communications (Lyndhurst, US), and support in the form of graphic services was provided by Laura Maguire, MChem at Gardiner-Caldwell Communications (Macclesfield, UK); editorial support was funded by GlaxoSmithKline.
