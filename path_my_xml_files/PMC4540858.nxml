expiratory rib cage compression and expiratory abdominal compression in patients on
prolonged mechanical ventilation, with a focus on tidal volume. [Subjects and Methods] The
subjects were 18 patients on prolonged mechanical ventilation, who had undergone
tracheostomy. Each patient received expiratory rib cage compression and expiratory
abdominal compression; the order of implementation was randomized. Subjects were
positioned in a 30&#x000b0; lateral recumbent position, and a 2-kgf compression was applied. For
expiratory rib cage compression, the rib cage was compressed unilaterally; for expiratory
abdominal compression, the area directly above the navel was compressed. Tidal volume
values were the actual measured values divided by body weight. [Results] Tidal volume
values were as follows: at rest, 7.2 &#x000b1; 1.7&#x02005;mL/kg; during expiratory rib cage compression,
8.3 &#x000b1; 2.1&#x02005;mL/kg; during expiratory abdominal compression, 9.1 &#x000b1; 2.2&#x02005;mL/kg. There was a
significant difference between the tidal volume during expiratory abdominal compression
and that at rest. The tidal volume in expiratory rib cage compression was strongly
correlated with that in expiratory abdominal compression. [Conclusion] These results
indicate that expiratory abdominal compression may be an effective alternative to the
manual breathing assist procedure.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Expiratory abdominal compression</kwd><kwd>Expiratory rib cage compression</kwd><kwd>Prolonged mechanical ventilation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Manual breathing assist technique is aimed at increasing tidal volume (VT), decreasing the
workload of breathing, and improving airway clearance. In Japan, expiratory rib cage
compression (ERCC) is commonly performed<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>;
ERCC involves providing manual rib cage compression during physiological expiration<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. ERCC is suitable for use in a range of
patient groups, including patients receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV), and
those with acute pneumonia, with postoperative respiratory complications, or chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>With advances in medical treatments, the number of patients that receive mechanical
ventilation is gradually increasing over time. Depending on the medical treatment
administered in the acute stage, patients can be removed from mechanical ventilation;
however, there are patients who require mechanical ventilation over a month. Such patients
frequently experience respiratory muscle weakening and decreased rib cage mobility.
Consequently, it can become difficult for patients on PMV to increase their expiratory flow
rate and VT, which are important factors in phlegm expulsion. The use of ERCC can increase
VT; as such, ERCC is an effective therapeutic technique for patients who cannot have their
mechanical ventilator settings changed. However, it is necessary to be mindful of secondary
osteoporosis, due to prolonged immobility<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Compression of the rib cage in ERCC can also lead to rib
fracture.</p><p>Expiratory abdominal compression (EAC) stimulates expiration by the application of
abdominal pressure<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, and is aimed at
increasing VT and aiding coughing for mucus clearance<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Suitable candidates include patients with muscular dystrophy or
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as postoperative patients. In terms of assisted
coughing, the abdomen is pressed forcefully, in synchronization with coughing, as in the
Heimlich maneuver<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. EAC, which aims at
clearing mucus, is performed by gently pressing the abdomen in synchronization with
expiration. We consider EAC effective in facilitating sputum expectoration in patients at a
high risk of rib fracture due to secondary osteoporosis, or in patients who have undergone
surgery or sustained trauma, where the application of pressure to the chest wall is
difficult. While previous research clearly indicates that EAC increases VT in healthy
subjects<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>, the strength of manual
expiratory compression has never been quantified. To the best of our knowledge, there have
been no reports on the use of EAC in patients on PMV.</p><p>The present study was conducted to compare EAC with ERCC in patients on PMV, using VT as
the primary outcome measure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects were patients at Heiseikai Hospital that had undergone tracheostomy and were
receiving artificial ventilation, due to a central nervous system disorder or
neurodegenerative disease. All subjects were managed for a minimum of 1 month, using a Servo
s ventilator (Fukuda Denshi, Ltd., Tokyo) in synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation
mode. Eighteen subjects participated in the study. Subjects were excluded if synchronizing
the mechanical ventilator was problematic; a thoracotomy tube was inserted; pneumothorax or
a rib fracture was sustained; pneumonia developed within 2 weeks of the study period; the
circulatory dynamics were unstable.</p><p>This prospective observational study was conducted according to the principles of the
Declaration of Helsinki (1975, revised 1983) and Japanese clinical study ethics guidelines.
Informed consent was obtained from the subject, or their legally acceptable representative.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of Heiseikai Hospital (No. 11H23).</p><p>During the administration of ERCC and EAC, the subject was placed in a 30&#x000b0; lateral
recumbent position, a position generally used for preventing bedsores<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The order in which ERCC and EAC were implemented was
decided using random number tables, and 1:1 randomization. Before the measurements, the
absence of water retention in the ventilator breathing tubes, and the absence of sputum
retention, was confirmed by visual observation and auscultation.</p><p>The compression site chosen for ERCC was the level of the 7th rib, between the midaxillary
line and the midclavicular line unilaterally at the anterior aspect; the compression site
for EAC was the navel. Compression was applied using a hand-held dynamometer (HHD) (&#x003bc;TasF-1,
Anima Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Compression strength was set at 2-kgf, based on the previous
literature in which 2-kgf compression was shown to have left no soreness or discomfort in
healthy subjects<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. We applied
compression in synchronization with expiration, and released compression immediately before
inspiration, while monitoring the HHD monitor screen to ensure that a 2-kgf compression
administered. Neither vibration nor springing was employed. According to the HHD, the
intraclass correlation coefficients for expiratory compression of the rib cage and the
abdomen were 0.964 and 0.987, respectively. Reproducibility was confirmed prior to
conducting the experiments.</p><p>Data including subject age, gender, and weight, disease leading to the need of mechanical
ventilation, and duration of ventilator use, were collected from the subjects&#x02019; medical
records. The level of consciousness of each subject was evaluated using the Glasgow coma
scale<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The rib cage expansion difference was measured, using a tape measure, at 3 sites: the level
of the axilla, the level of the xiphisternum, and the level of the 10th rib. Abdominal
expansion difference was measured at the point of maximal abdominal protrusion. Each site
was measured 3 times, and the maximum score was used.</p><p>VT was measured over 10 breaths in which there were no synchronization issues with the
mechanical ventilator at rest. From the 10 breaths, the maximum and minimum values were
excluded, and the mean of the 8 remaining breaths was divided by body weight; the resultant
value was used as VT. The process was repeated for each of ERCC and EAC. For respiration
rate (RR), the mean value displayed on the ventilator monitor screen at the time of the 8
breaths was used. The values for pressure control (PC), pressure support (PS), positive
end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and inspiratory pressure range (PIP &#x02212; PEEP: &#x00394;P) were taken
directly from the mechanical ventilator display screen. We also calculated dynamic pulmonary
compliance (Cdyn = VT at rest/&#x00394;P).</p><p>One-way analysis of variance was used to assess for differences in VT (at rest, during
ERCC, and during EAC). If a significant statistical difference was observed, a multiple
comparison with Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test was performed. VT-related factors during ERCC and EAC
were analyzed using the Pearson&#x02019;s product-moment correlation coefficient. Further, we also
calculated the regression equation for VT during ERCC and EAC.</p><p>Statistical processing was performed using SPSS software version 19 (SPSS Japan Inc.,
Tokyo, Japan), and the significance level for each analysis was set at 5%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the study subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Variable</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Values</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age, yrs</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 69.7 &#x000b1; 15.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender M/F, N</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 9/9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight, kg</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">47.6 &#x000b1; 9.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI, kg/m<sup>2</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.5 &#x000b1; 3.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Disease, N (%)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 (38.9)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Chronic respiratory failure</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (22.2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cerebrovascular disease</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3 (16.7)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Spinal cord injury</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 2 (11.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Neurodegenerative disease</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"> 2 (11.1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glasgow coma scale score<sup>&#x02020;</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.0 (3.0&#x02013;6.0)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rib cage expansion difference, mm</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Axilla</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4 &#x000b1; 2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Xiphisternum</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.4 &#x000b1; 1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10th rib</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.2 &#x000b1; 1.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Abdomen expansion difference, mm</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.0 &#x000b1; 1.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ventilator settings</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PS (cmH<sub>2</sub>O)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.1 &#x000b1; 2.9</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PEEP (cmH<sub>2</sub>O)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.7 &#x000b1; 1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" style="padding-left:10pt" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cdyn</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.7 &#x000b1; 10.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Values are expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD unless otherwise indicated. <sup>&#x02020;</sup>Median

strong relationship between VT during ERCC and VT during EAC. Further, VT increased
significantly during EAC, compared with that at rest. This demonstrates that when increasing
VT by manual expiratory compression, EAC is useful, and is more effective than ERCC.</p><p>McCarren et al. observed an increase in intrathoracic pressure as well as in the amount of
ventilation achieved during manual expiratory compression using an esophageal balloon<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. ERCC raises the intrathoracic pressure
through compression of the rib cage, increasing the expiration level and resulting in a
relative increase in inspiration level. Our study included patients on PMV; therefore, most
patients had a low level of consciousness, and autonomous movement was difficult. Although
the artificial ventilation, known as positive pressure ventilation, spreads to the rib cage
in the inspiration level, it does not lead to contraction of the rib cage in the expiration
level. Therefore, rib cage mobility probably decreases due to disuse. Moreover, it has been
reported that the mobility of the rib cage is reduced by 36.9% in elderly subjects, compared
with young subjects<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. In view of this
decreased mobility of the rib cage, we do not consider VT during ERCC to have sufficiently
increased. In contrast, with EAC, the rise in intraabdominal pressure from abdominal
compression, which is minimally affected by decreased mobility of the rib cage, mobilizes
the diaphragm upward<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result,
intrathoracic pressure rises, the expiration level is increased, and there is a relative
increase in inspiration volume. This explains the significant increase in VT during EAC.</p><p>In the present study, VT during EAC was 9.1 &#x000b1; 2.2&#x02005;mL/kg, which is lower than that reported
in a previous study by Kaneko et al<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Previous reports on ERCC have indicated compression strengths ranging between 1.7-kgf and
5.4-kgf<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. While the 2-kgf compression
strength used during EAC in this study falls within the range used in previous studies. The
study by Kaneko et al. did not quantify the compression strength used during EAC; however,
between-study differences in compression strengths may influence VT.</p><p>Further, the results of the present study clarify the relationship between VT during EAC,
and abdominal expansion difference, Cdyn, and VT at rest. In our study, we quantified the
compression strength. Allowing the abdomen to move easily may increase the strength of
abdominal compression, thus increasing intra-abdominal pressure more efficiently. We
therefore believe that we have identified a relationship between differences in abdominal
expansion and VT during EAC. It is considered that Cdyn is affected by RR; in our study, we
did not observe significant differences between RR at rest, during ERCC, and during EAC. As
a result, we consider that Cdyn indicates the ease with which the lungs and rib cage expand.
Given that the mechanical ventilator was set to pressure control ventilation, we believe
that Cdyn and VT are related.</p><p>It is important to note the practical differences between EAC and ERCC. Caution is required
while performing EAC, because compressing the abdomen stimulates the vagal reflex, causing
reflux of the stomach contents. Although no adverse events were observed in this study, it
is necessary to pay attention to vital signs such as blood pressure. Further, the advantages
and disadvantages of performing EAC must be reviewed when the subject has a sense of
abdominal fullness, for example, immediately after a meal.</p><p>The present study has 2 main limitations. First, we did not examine the influence of the
indication for PMV. The number of cases requiring PMV is likely to increase in future, and a
review according to each illness will be necessary. Second, manual expiratory compression
techniques are affected not only by compression strength, but also by body position and the
site, direction, and duration of compression. In the present study, patients were examined
in only one position. It is necessary to be careful with generalizing our conclusions to all
manual expiratory compression techniques. Future studies evaluating patients in different
positions are warranted.</p><p>The results of the present study demonstrated that EAC is more effective, in terms of VT,
than ERCC, in patients on PMV. EAC can be safely used as a method of rehabilitation for
patients who are at risk for rib fracture due to osteoporosis, associated with chronic
artificial respiration and prolonged immobility.</p><p>The present study examined the use of EAC in patients on PMV, with regard to changes in VT.
The results clearly demonstrate that the increase in VT during EAC is higher than that
during ERCC. This indicates that EAC may be a new manual expiratory compression procedure
that can be used as an alternative to ERCC in patients on PMV.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">AARC: <article-title>AARC
