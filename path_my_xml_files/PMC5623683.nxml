Here, we examine for the first time xenon&#x02019;s possible effect in attenuating early brain injury (EBI) and its influence on posthemorrhagic microglial neuroinflammation in an <italic>in vivo</italic> rat model of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).</p></sec><sec id="ST2"><title>Methods</title><p>Sprague-Dawley rats (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) were randomly assigned to receive either Sham surgery (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9; divided into two groups) or SAH induction <italic>via</italic> endovascular perforation (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13, divided into two groups). Of those randomized for SAH, 7 animals were postoperatively ventilated with 50 vol% oxygen/50 vol% xenon for 1&#x02009;h and 6 received 50 vol% oxygen/50 vol% nitrogen (control). The animals were sacrificed 24&#x02009;h after SAH. Of each animal, a cerebral coronal section (&#x02212;3.60&#x02009;mm from bregma) was selected for assessment of histological damage 24&#x02009;h after SAH. A 5-point neurohistopathological severity score was applied to assess neuronal cell damage in H&#x00026;E and NeuN stained sections in a total of four predefined anatomical regions of interest. Microglial activation was evaluated by a software-assisted cell count of Iba-1 stained slices in three cortical regions of interest.</p></sec><sec id="ST3"><title>Results</title><p>A diffuse cellular damage was apparent in all regions of the ipsilateral hippocampus 24&#x02009;h after SAH. Xenon-treated animals presented with a milder damage after SAH. This effect was found to be particularly pronounced in the medial regions of the hippocampus, CA3 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.040), and dentate gyrus (DG <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.040). However, for the CA1 and CA2 regions, there were no statistical differences in neuronal damage according to our histological scoring. A cell count of activated microglia was lower in the cortex of xenon-treated animals. This difference was especially apparent in the left piriform cortex (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.017).</p></sec><sec id="ST4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In animals treated with 50 vol% xenon (for 1&#x02009;h) after SAH, a less pronounced neuronal damage was observed for the ipsilateral hippocampal regions CA3 and DG, when compared to the control group. In xenon-treated animals, a lower microglial cell count was observed suggesting an immunomodulatory effect generated by xenon. As for now, these results cannot be generalized as only some hippocampal regions are affected. Future studies should assess the time and localization dependency of xenon&#x02019;s beneficial properties after SAH.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>subarachnoid hemorrhage</kwd><kwd>early brain injury</kwd><kwd>animal model</kwd><kwd>xenon</kwd><kwd>neuroprotection</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="33"/><page-count count="8"/><word-count count="5304"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="S1-1"><title>Background</title><p>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a subtype of stroke occurring at a relative young age causing either death or disability in many patients (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Few people recover without impairments (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The annual incidence is estimated to be about 9.1 patients per 100,000 (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). In around 85% of spontaneous SAHs, the underlying cause is the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The resulting increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), disruption of the blood&#x02013;brain barrier and global ischemia contribute to early brain injury (EBI) (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). These injuries within the first 72&#x02009;h of the initial ictus account for the later development of vasospasm and delayed cerebral ischemia (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). There is a substantial interest in EBI and in ways to reduce initial cerebral damage and thus indirectly attenuate secondary injuries.</p><p>The neuroprotective effect of the noble gas xenon has been well established in animal experiments for focal and global cerebral ischemia (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Xenon has a proven additive neuroprotective effect to hypothermia in models of neonatal asphyxia (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). So far, xenon treatment has not been examined in the context of SAH. Multiple animal models of SAH have been established. The two most commonly used are the cisternal injection model and the endovascular perforation model (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We opted for the latter as it better mimics the pathophysiology of an aneurysm rupture, and it is probably more suitable to investigate EBI (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In this trial, the neuroprotective properties of the noble gas xenon were examined in the early phase after SAH using an endovascular perforation rat model. Despite its cost, xenon has demonstrated minimal side effects in extensive anesthesia studies, making it an interesting future treatment in human trials aiming for neuroprotection (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Furthermore, xenon has already been approved in Europe for use as a general anesthetic.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study Design</title><p>We performed a randomized four group controlled animal trial examining the neuroprotective effects of xenon inhalation (50 vol% for 1&#x02009;h) with treatment initiation 1&#x02009;h after SAH induction.</p></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Ethical Statement</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the government agency for animal use and protection (Protocol number: TVA 10416G1 approved by &#x0201c;Landesamt f&#x000fc;r Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz NRW,&#x0201d; Recklinghausen, Germany), all experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Research Council, and the Committee for the Update of the Guide for the Care and Use of laboratory Animals; 8th edition 2011).</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 300&#x02013;400&#x02009;g, Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were housed for at least 1&#x02009;week before surgery with free access to food in a specific pathogen-free environment maintaining a 12-h light/dark cycle.

A quarter of the initial dosage was injected in 30&#x02013;45&#x02009;min intervals to maintain anesthesia. Postoperative analgesia was started directly after surgery <italic>via</italic> intramuscular injection of metamizole (20&#x02009;mg/kg) and continued until euthanasia (24&#x02009;h after SAH induction). Animals were intubated using an 18 gauge i.v. cannula. Blood pressure was monitored by cannulation of the tail artery, electrolytes, and blood gases were monitored by repeated arterial blood gas analysis and body temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C via a heating pad (Physitemp Instruments, Inc., Clifton, NJ, USA). After anesthesia induction, two laser Doppler flowmetry probes were fixated in proximity of the bregma to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), as previously described (Moor Instruments, Axminster, Devon, UK) (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). A left side parietal ICP probe was inserted for continuous ICP monitoring (Microsensor/Codman ICP Express Monitor, Codman/De Puy, Raynham, MA, USA). Baseline recordings of blood pressure, bilateral rCBF, heart rate, and ICP were done prior to surgery, during intervention, and 90&#x02009;min thereafter (PowerLab, ADInstruments, Spechbach, Germany). SAH was induced by the polypropylene monofilament perforation technique initially described by Bederson et al. and modified by Veelken et al. (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). The procedure was performed as previously described (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). After exposing the left common carotid artery, the left internal carotid artery (ICA) was identified and a 3&#x02013;0 polypropylene suture with a diameter ranging from 200 to 250&#x02009;&#x000b5;m (Prolene suture, Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ, USA) was advanced intravascularly. Perforation of the vessel and subsequent SAH was verified by a sudden increase in ICP and a bilateral decrease in rCBF. Sham-operated animals underwent the same anesthesia and surgical procedure, but the monofilament was advanced into the ICA without perforation of the vessel.</p><p>One hour after SAH induction or Sham surgery, the animals were ventilated for 1&#x02009;h with either a mixture of 50 vol% O<sub>2</sub>/50 vol% xenon (Air Liquide, Paris, France) or 50 vol% O<sub>2</sub>/50 vol% N<sub>2</sub> (control group). After treatment, anesthesia was stopped and animals were allowed to recover spontaneously. Analgesic treatment with metamizole (20&#x02009;mg/kg intramuscular application every 8&#x02009;h) was carried on until euthanasia (24&#x02009;h after SAH induction). Euthanasia was performed 24&#x02009;h after SAH induction by exsanguination under deep anesthesia followed by decapitation. Brains were harvested and cut into 2&#x02009;mm coronal slices, fixated in paraformaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5"><title>Histology/Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Sections of 2&#x02009;&#x000b5;m thickness were cut from the paraffin-embedded brain slices and placed on silane-coated slides. Of every animal, the same section 3.60&#x02009;mm posterior to the bregma was searched based on anatomical landmarks. After deparaffinization, a section was routinely hematoxylin/eosin (H&#x00026;E) stained. Two consecutive sections were de-waxed, rehydrated, and heated in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. After blocking of non-specific binding by incubation in PBS containing 2% normal goat serum, one slide per animal was incubated for 1&#x02009;h with anti-NeuN (Millipore, MA, USA) as primary antibody diluted in blocking solution and one slide with anti-Iba-1. Appropriate biotinylated secondary antibodies were used (1:200, Vector Laboratories Ltd., Peterborough, UK) for 15&#x02009;min, followed by DAB visualization (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA, USA). Appropriate negative controls without the primary antibodies were performed.</p></sec><sec id="S2-6"><title>Neuronal Cell Damage</title><p>Neuronal cell damage was measured and quantified in four regions of the left hippocampus, in H&#x00026;E and NeuN-stained section: CA1, CA2, CA3, and dentate gyrus (DG). A single high power field (HPF) was focused on the center of each of these four region of interest (ROI) and the image was photographed with an Axioplan microscope (ZEISS, Germany). An absolute neuronal cell count as well as a cell count of all ischemic damaged neurons was done using ImageJ/Fiji v 1.50 (ImageJ Software downloaded at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij</uri>). See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>. Neuronal cell damage was cytomorphologically defined as a combination of hypereosinophilia, shrunken cytoplasm, and pyknotic nuclei. This counting process was done twice by a single investigator blinded to treatment allocation on two different time-points and results were compared for incongruence. In case of incongruence or doubt, the consecutive NeuN stained slices was consulted and the process was repeated. The ratio of damaged neurons too the complete neuronal cell count was graded into five categories (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x02013;20%, 2&#x02009;=&#x02009;20&#x02013;40%, 3&#x02009;=&#x02009;40&#x02013;60%, 4&#x02009;=&#x02009;60&#x02013;80%, and 5&#x02009;=&#x02009;80&#x02013;100%).

To compare treatment groups, the four scores (0&#x02013;5) for each hippocampus were summed up to obtain a single score per animal between 0 and 20. Sham animals presented with mild baseline cell damage in all four hippocampal regions. The Sham N<sub>2</sub> group had a summed-up score of 4.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.83. The Sham Xe group presented with a summed-up score of 10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.05.

Activated microglial cells are morphologically characterized by cellular branches and are easily identified using confocal microscopy. We determined the presence of activated microglia within three cortical regions for each hemisphere. Two regions are located at the base of the brain, close to the source of the induced hemorrhage (PLCo1 and Pir1). One region was chosen more distal to the bleeding source in the cranial parietal cortex (Pta). Iba-1-positive cells were software-assisted quantified in a HPF, focusing on the center of each ROI. In comparison to Sham-operated rats, SAH animals showed a clear increase in Iba-1-positive cells in all three cortical regions, reflecting the early inflammatory response after SAH. Once the absolute cell count of all three regions was summed up per animal, it became apparent that xenon-treated animals showed a lower overall microglial cell count compared to the control groups. See Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>. Also in all SAH animals, those regions closer to the initial bleeding source (left side Pir1 and PLCo1) showed a higher number of activated microglia reflecting the spatial distribution of severity of neuronal damage around the area of primary hit. This effect has been previously described in a rat SAH perforation model (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>).

Although a xenon-mediated protective effect was seen in all hippocampal regions, the protective effect of xenon was enhanced in the CA3 and DG regions. Second, we have shown a reduction in cortical microglial activity in xenon-treated animals. An intraparenchymal accumulation of microglia cells was more pronounced in regions closer to the site of vessel perforation. This effect has been previously demonstrated in animal as well as human tissue samples (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In this trial by Schneider et al., a centrifugal spreading of microglia accumulation developed over time, from the base of the cortex of both hemispheres, resembling a wave of intracerebral immune cell activation. Similarly, we saw a gradual decrease of microglial activation in regions farther away from the site of primary hit. In the base of the left hemisphere, the regions with the highest accumulation of inflammatory cells, the immunomodulatory effect of xenon was the largest. Microglia plays a major role in the pro-inflammatory cytotoxic response and participates in the immunosuppressive processes contributing to further tissue damage (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). We postulate a possible immunomodulatory mechanism of xenon reducing microglial activation and contributing to a decrease in neuronal cell damage.</p><p>Although not significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.168), it is unclear why the Sham Xe group presented a higher summed-up score and thus more hippocampal damage, compared to the Sham N<sub>2</sub> group. It could be that Xenon has no effect on the background damage occurring in our Sham animals indicating that the neuroprotective effect of Xenon cannot be generalized.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated a reduction in mortality after argon post-conditioning in a SAH animal model (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Here, we present for the first time the beneficial effect of xenon treatment after experimental SAH with a reduction of hippocampal neuronal cell loss and a decrease in cortical microglial cell activity. Until now, the neuroprotective effects of xenon have been accredited to the inhibition of the NMDA receptor (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> research has shown that NMDA receptor stimulation triggers microglia activation and the secretion of neurotoxic factors (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). This could very well explain the immunomodulatory mechanism observed in our xenon-treated animals. Xenon may be a potential clinical treatment for EBI under carefully defined conditions. By attenuation of the complex inflammatory mechanisms, some of the devastating secondary injuries may be prevented and outcome in SAH patients could be improved.</p><sec id="S4-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The primary weakness of our trial was the limited number of included animals. We estimated that a higher number of included animals could demonstrate a more pronounced therapeutic effect. Second, per ROI, only a single HPF was evaluated for calculation of neuronal cell loss (in H&#x00026;E and NeuN Staining) and for the evaluation of microglial activation in Iba-1 staining. In the initial trial design, neuronal cell loss was manually counted in the entire hippocampus. As the trial continued, we observed a good congruence between these results and the estimated damage using only a single HPF. Additionally, to estimate neuronal cell loss, we only looked at the right hippocampus. This was done because the insertion of the ICP probe on the left side caused additional damage to the left hemisphere introducing potential bias. ROIs in the left hemisphere were included for the assessment of microglial activation since they were located at the base of the brain, farther away from the regions of iatrogenic damage.</p><p>Until now, we did not examine whether the xenon-mediated reduction in Iba-1-positive cells coincided with a reduction in cortical damage. Because of its higher cell count, estimating cortical damage is more time consuming but could be the focus of future research projects. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that Iba-1 is not a specific marker for microglia and unspecific binding of the antibody could have compromised our results.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first time that a neuroprotective effect of xenon has been shown. The effect is potentially mediated by an inhibitory effect on microglial activation.
