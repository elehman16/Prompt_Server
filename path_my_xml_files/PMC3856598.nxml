However, there are controversies regarding the effects of timing of cell administration and initial insult severity on inflammatory response.

Several studies have addressed the therapeutic benefits of bone marrow-derived cells, such as bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMDMCs) and mesenchymal stromal cells, in murine models of extrapulmonary ARDS induced by intraperitoneal administration of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Bone marrow-derived cells have been shown to mitigate systemic and pulmonary inflammation, as well as decrease lung edema and enhance bacterial clearance, resulting in lower mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, the potential effects of the severity of ARDS on inflammatory response and the time course for lung damage, which may play a role in the outcome of treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], have not been addressed in the literature. It may also be argued that these effects are mediated by the specific characteristics of different types of injury.</p><p>In the present study, the beneficial effects of cell therapy were tested in light of the hypothesis that BMDMCs may exert distinctive effects on lung inflammation and remodeling depending on the initial insult. To this end, murine models of LPS and CLP-induced pulmonary injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] were used, and lung mechanics, histology, and humoral and cellular parameters of lung inflammation and remodeling were analyzed at 1, 3 and 7 days after induction of ARDS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Carlos Chagas Filho Institute of Biophysics, Health Sciences Center, and Federal University of Brazil (CEUA-CCS, IBCCF 019).

Briefly, bone marrow cells from male BALB/c mice were flushed from femurs and tibias with Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium. After a homogeneous cell suspension was achieved, cells were centrifuged (400&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> for 10 minutes), resuspended in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium and added to Ficoll-Hypaque. The isolated cells were counted in a Neubauer chamber with Trypan Blue for evaluation of viability. Saline or BMDMCs were injected into the jugular vein.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental protocol</title><p>BALB/c mice (age 8 to 10 weeks) were used: 98 females and 10 male donors (weight 20 to 25 g). Numbers were given to each cage and letters were given to each experimental group for the randomization process, and afterwards each number was linked to a letter. A member of the laboratory that was blind to the experimental procedure performed the randomization process. Animals in the control groups received saline intraperitoneally (0.5 ml, group C) or were subjected to sham surgery (sham group). Mice in the ARDS groups received <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS intraperitoneally (5 mg/kg in 0.5 ml saline; LPS group) or underwent CLP (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In the CLP groups, polymicrobial sepsis was induced as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with sevoflurane and a midline laparotomy was performed. The cecum was carefully isolated and a 3&#x02013;0 cotton ligature was placed below the ileocecal valve to prevent bowel obstruction. Finally, the cecum was punctured twice with an 18-gauge needle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the sham group, an abdominal incision was made with no cecal ligation and perforation. Both layers of the abdominal cavity were closed with 3.0 silk sutures, followed by fluid resuscitation with 0.5 ml/10 g body weight of prewarmed sterile saline subcutaneously. Sham and CLP animals received tramadol (0.05 mg/kg body weight subcutaneously) for postoperative analgesia, repeated every 8 hours. After this step, animals returned to their cages, where they received water and food <italic>ad libitum</italic>. All manipulations described were performed by the same investigator to ensure consistency. Twenty-four hours after lung injury, animals in group C and the ARDS group were further randomized to receive saline (0.05 ml) or BMDMCs (2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> BMDMCs in 0.05 ml saline) intravenously. At day 1, these models had similar degrees of lung mechanical compromise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Flowchart and timeline of study design.</bold> Control (group C) animals received saline intraperitoneally (ip).

This is the first study to compare cell therapy effects in two different experimental models of extrapulmonary ARDS (LPS and CLP). In previous studies from our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] we observed that cell therapy had distinct effects on lung inflammation and remodeling depending on ARDS etiology (pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary). In this context, we hypothesized that even in the same etiology of ARDS, depending on the primary insult (LPS and CLP), cell therapy could have beneficial yet distinct effects. Demonstrating this hypothesis, in the clinical scenario when patients are treated according to ARDS etiology (pulmonary vs. extrapulmonary), we should be aware of therapy effects, since there may be different outcomes related to lung inflammation and remodeling.</p><p>In previous studies with LPS-induced ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and CLP-induced ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], bone marrow cells were administered only a few hours after injury. This administration limits the applicability of results to clinical practice, because the time course for lung damage is not taken into consideration. In order to produce a more clinically relevant scenario, in the present study BMDMCs were injected intravenously 1 day after the initial insult (LPS or CLP), once the lung mechanical and morphologic changes had already been established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The effects of BMDMC therapy were evaluated at days 3 and 7. We are aware that most previous studies of ARDS have used mesenchymal stromal cells; nevertheless, mesenchymal stromal cells require culture conditions that are detrimental for cell transplantation and pose a risk of contamination and immunological reactions. Bearing these limitations in mind, and on the basis of some promising results from previous research conducted by our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we employed BMDMCs because they can be easily and safely administered on the day of harvest and are known to reduce lung inflammation and fibrogenesis and thus restore lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Because it has already been demonstrated that stem cell engraftment is not required for BMDMCs to exert their beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we did not address this issue.</p><p>Several studies have suggested that the endothelium plays an important role in the pathophysiology of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Our results suggest endothelial cell activation by increased expression of cell adhesion molecules and increased production of cytokines. Adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and VCAM-1) of endothelial cells interact with integrins expressed on neutrophils that stabilize cell&#x02013;cell interactions, providing firm adherence and thus facilitating cell transmigration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. ICAM-1 mRNA expression increased after intratracheal administration of endotoxin or CLP-induced ARDS, in accordance with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Nevertheless, despite the increase in mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 as well as chemokines (MCP-1 and KC), BMDMC administration resulted in fewer mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells within the lung parenchyma. Nevertheless, we observed an increase in BALF mononuclear cells in both LPS-SAL and LPS-BMDMC groups at day 3. Additionally, when KC protein expression was analyzed we did not observe an increase after BMDMC therapy, in accordance with our polymorphonuclear cell count findings.</p><p>BMDMC administration reined in the inflammatory process, reducing inflammatory cell counts and modulating the levels of inflammatory mediators (such as IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-10) in lung tissue. IL-10 appears to play a pivotal role in controlling the magnitude of inflammatory responses during either systemic or pulmonary inflammation, and has been proposed as a key mediator of beneficial effects in CLP-induced experimental sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Nevertheless, other studies investigating bone marrow cell therapy, including those previously conducted by our group, suggest that the beneficial effects of BMDMC extend beyond an effect on a single mediator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. IL-1&#x003b2; is mainly produced by activated macrophages as a pro-peptide and is cleaved by caspase-1 within the inflammasome into an active enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. IL-1&#x003b2; can upregulate cell-surface expression of leukocyte and vascular adhesion molecules and stimulate the production of chemokines required for leukocyte recruitment and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Increased levels of IL-1&#x003b2; in ARDS patients correlate with development of pulmonary fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this context, we observed that BMDMC decreased lung collagen fiber content both in the LPS and CLP groups. Nevertheless, this reduction was not associated with differences in TGF-&#x003b2; mRNA and protein expressions in lung tissue, suggesting another signaling pathway (for example, collagenases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Studies using endotoxin models for the induction of sepsis have provided a wealth of important knowledge. Nevertheless, the clinical relevance of the LPS experimental model has been questioned, as administration of a bolus of endotoxins does not reflect the complex pathophysiology of sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Alternative experimental models of sepsis have thus been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], such as CLP, a model of polymicrobial sepsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Polymicrobial sepsis and endotoxemia have been reported to have differing temporal cytokine responses, innate defense mechanisms, and signaling molecules involved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], which is consistent with our findings. Additionally, as recently defined by the American Thoracic Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], the diagnosis of ARDS in animals should be based on at least three of four main features of evidence: histology, inflammation, physiological dysfunction, and permeability. Our experimental models of LPS and CLP produced histological evidence of lung injury, inflammatory response and physiological dysfunction, meeting the American Thoracic Society criteria.</p><p>In this context, our study has some limitations. First, mortality was higher in the ARDS-CLP group (60%) than in the ARDS-LPS group (0%). Second, the CLP model is one in which there is an ongoing septic insult, with worsening injury over time. In contrast, the LPS model is one of a single insult, making it difficult to compare BMDMC effects across models. We plan future studies to compare the BMDMC therapy in two bacterial (septic) models. Third, inflammatory mediators were measured in lung tissue. The balance between local and systemic inflammation was therefore not evaluated. Fourth, collagen fiber content was evaluated using a histology technique, but future studies should be performed using either hydroxyproline or soluble collagen assay. Fifth, the study endpoint was 7 days after LPS administration or CLP for induction of ARDS. Nonetheless, to better evaluate the effects of BMDMC therapy on lung inflammation and remodeling, further studies of later time points would be interesting. Sixth, previous studies have used fibroblasts as control cells for cell therapy studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; however, some have demonstrated that administration of fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells without stem cell properties, may not only be ineffective but may worsen injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Accordingly, saline was chosen as the control. Finally, the effects of BMDMCs on adhesion molecules might be of interest; however, further research, such as the use of knockout mice, is required to assess this issue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Specific beneficial effects of BMDMC therapy were observed for each type of initial insult triggering extrapulmonary ARDS. BMDMC therapy at day 1, once lung mechanical and histological changes had already been installed in ARDS, successfully reduced inflammation and remodeling in both extrapulmonary ARDS models.
