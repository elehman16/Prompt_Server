The disease is easily transmissible and common in multi-cat environments where even vaccinated cats can develop clinical signs of respiratory or ocular disease or both when exposed to the virus. Prior to the work reported here, there was no licensed treatment for the disease on the market. We hypothesized that polyprenyl immunostimulant (PI), an immunomodulatory veterinary biologic, would be useful in treating feline rhinotracheitis by reducing the severity of respiratory or/and ocular disease. We conducted double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials in experimentally infected cats to establish the efficacy of PI. Specific pathogen-free cats were administered a placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) or PI (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20) starting on the day of FHV-1 experimental challenge. Trained, masked observers applied a standardized scoring system daily in clinical examinations for 14&#x02009;days after the FHV-1 challenge. The cats treated with PI had significantly lower disease severity scores over the course of the experiment compared to the cats in the placebo group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). The safety studies, including a field safety study involving 390 owned cats in 10 states, showed that PI was safe to use in cats as young as 8&#x02009;weeks of age.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>feline rhinotracheitis</kwd><kwd>polyprenyl immunostimulant</kwd><kwd>feline herpesvirus</kwd><kwd>upper respiratory tract disease</kwd><kwd>clinical trials</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd><kwd>clinical efficacy</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="4"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="21"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="7671"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) is a common illness in cats that occurs worldwide. The principal agents of URTDs in domestic cats are feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) that causes rhinotracheitis and feline calicivirus (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). FHV-1 is highly contagious and easily spread between susceptible cats. URTD is a major cause of morbidity in multi-cat households such as breeding colonies, boarding catteries and shelters, and exposure of na&#x000ef;ve cats to those environments leads to a high incidence of the disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). FHV-1 causes respiratory or ocular disease or both that may range from mild to severe upper respiratory signs and systemic disease with lethargy, inappetence, and sneezing accompanied by nasal and ocular discharges. The acute infection may cause severe turbinate and nasal mucosal damage (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) that might predispose the cats to lifelong bouts of bacterial nasal infection and sinusitis in sites of previous viral damage (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). During the course of an FHV-1 infection, the virus establishes itself in the trigeminal nerve ganglia (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In times of stress and/or steroid administration, the latent herpesvirus may cause reactivation of respiratory and ocular signs and viral shedding (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The persistence of the latent virus is usually lifelong (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>Treatment and control of FHV-1 infections in multi-cat households have been difficult. Adding lysine to the diet was beneficial in a research environment (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) but a recent study in a shelter environment found that supplementation with lysine may worsen the signs of FHV-1 infections (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The treatment of acute infections with systemic interferon and antiviral drugs has been recommended in cats with FHV-1 infections. There was no benefit from ocular administration of feline recombinant interferon omega or human recombinant interferon alpha-2b on the clinical signs or viral shedding on cats with rhinotracheitis (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Studies using famciclovir in a clinical trial and a series of case studies showed an antiviral benefit of the drug (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>), but it caused adverse events in 17% of the cats in the field application (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>The herpesvirus disease can be controlled <italic>via</italic> cell-mediated immune response (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Polyprenyl immunostimulant (PI) is a veterinary biologic that modulates the immune response (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). We tested its ability to modulate and reduce the severity of the clinical disease. Our evaluation of clinical outcomes was based on the model that uses sign severity scores for nasal and ocular discharges on a scale from 0 (no disease) to 2 (severe disease) based on the veterinarian standard of practice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The studies presented here were carried out in compliance with U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 9, and other laws governing research with veterinary biologics and animal studies at institutional, local, state, and federal levels.

The study was overseen by veterinarians working with these cats.</p><p>Participating veterinarians were provided with PI, consent and observation forms. They were instructed on the product administration, record keeping, and reporting adverse events during and post-trials. The forms also included a preprinted list of reportable adverse events, and the owners and veterinarians were instructed to report those. PI was administered 0.5&#x02009;mg/kg orally twice daily for at least 14&#x02009;days by owners at their homes. The doses were calculated by the veterinarians.

Frequencies and percentages were reported for categorical outcomes.</p><p>The baseline clinical characteristics of the cats from the second trial were compared to those in the first trial using inferential statistics to confirm that the test subjects were virtually identical. These characteristics included weight, age, and gender. Independent samples <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for weight and age, while Chi-square was used for the gender comparison. Statistical significance was assumed at an alpha value of 0.05 and all analyses were conducted using SPSS Version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).</p><p>In our evaluation of the severity of the disease, which is the primary outcome, we used a composite score for two outcomes: nasal and ocular discharge. The severity of nasal and ocular discharges was used to denote modulation of disease states for each day of observation; the scores of 0 (no disease present), 1 (moderate disease), and 2 (severe disease) were added together to yield a composite score.

Control of the herpesvirus disease requires support of the immune response where severity of signs and time to resolution depend on the equilibrium between viral evasion of the immune system and effective immune protection (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). We hypothesized that control of signs of feline rhinotracheitis can be achieved through modulation of the immune response and therefore PI, an immunomodulator, should decrease the severity of the clinical disease.</p><p>Feline herpesvirus type 1 can produce severe illness especially in young cats and presents a higher threat to younger cats and kittens; therefore, in our safety study, we specifically focused on the safety in younger kittens, and 128/390 cats (32.8%) on our study were under 8&#x02009;weeks of age. Adverse reactions in 4/390 cats (1%) included an immediate onset of diarrhea (1) and an active dislike of the taste or smell of the PI (3). Whereas the intent was to assess safety in normal cats/kittens, a number of the participants tried PI in their sick cats. The 24 lethal events reported as adverse on the evaluation forms were due to preexisting diseases and not considered PI-related (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>), including FIP (6/24), feline leukemia virus infection (1/24), an undiagnosed, preexisting severe respiratory problem (1/24), and malnourishment in neonatal, orphaned kittens (16/24). PI caused no adverse events at the 10&#x000d7; therapeutic dose in the acute toxicity study.</p><p>The experimental study was designed as randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled and involved SPF cats challenged with a standard strain used in the development and evaluation of rhinotracheitis vaccines by other groups (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). The challenge followed by an immediate treatment was similar to the clinical trials with famciclovir (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).</p><p>The trial was intended as an efficacy study for licensing of PI by the USDA and was conducted under the legal requirements for clinical trials. Those requirements [reviewed by Kleist (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>)] directed the selection of the outcomes and the scoring system. In line with the regulations, our definition of clinical disease included two disease-defining: upper respiratory disease scored by the severity of nasal discharge and ocular disease scored by the severity of ocular discharge. The scoring of each sign was limited to 0&#x02013;1&#x02013;2 (no sign&#x02013;moderate&#x02013;severe) to allow unequivocal and reproducible evaluation based on the obvious differences between serous and mucopurulent discharges.</p><p>Individual variability in the severity of the signs within the groups was the reason we did not see a significant difference between the scores in the groups in our first trial in 2007 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09); there was insufficient statistical power of the sample (too few cats). Twenty cats were considered the maximum number of cats that could be reasonably studied at one time with the available resources, e.g., room size, team size, and evaluation requirements. US regulations allow combining data from separate clinical trials provided that the trials are similar. Our two challenge experiments were virtually identical with respect to protocol, therapeutic dose, number of cats in the groups, age of cats, challenge regimen, and research team. The cats came from the same source, and there was no statistically significant difference between signalments in the cat samples in both studies. Furthermore, the course of the disease in the groups in both studies was identical. The difference in the scores between the groups was significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) after the data from the two trials were combined. USDA accepted the data from the combined trials and licensed PI.</p><p>The signs of upper respiratory and ocular disease have been extensively used as markers of the efficacy of vaccines designed to protect against rhinotracheitis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). We used the composite score for the disease comprising two primary, measurable outcomes. The composite score did not include secondary outcomes such as nasal obstruction or non-specific signs such as fever, anorexia, dehydration, and salivation. The effect of PI on secondary outcomes (i.e., non-specific signs) was analyzed separately, for each sign, as required by the regulations (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), and no significant difference in the severity of secondary outcomes was found between the treatment and placebo groups.</p><p>In our studies, we used a scale similar to vaccine and drug efficacy studies. Serous nasal and ocular discharges were considered as less severe (score of 1) than mucopurulent discharges [score of 2; Ref. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>)]. The absence of a sign received a score of 0. While nasal obstruction and sneezing are commonly mentioned as signs of the disease, we excluded those from our analysis because those signs are highly variable over short periods of time, making it difficult to grade them consistently.</p><p>All cats in both groups developed signs of FHV-1 infection at some time in the study, and the progress of the disease was as described by others (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We restricted our analysis to days 0&#x02013;14 DPC, which is the well-recognized duration of the virus-induced phase of the disease (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Even in SPF cats of the same age and infected with the same strain of the FHV-1 virus, severity of the clinical signs varied a great deal within both groups in our study, in line with those previously reported in natural (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) and experimental (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) infections. One cat in the placebo group developed only minimal signs, two kittens in the placebo, and two kittens in the PI group developed an extremely severe disease.</p><p>The overall analysis identified a statistically significant decrease in severity of the nasal and ocular signs of rhinotracheitis in the group treated with PI compared to placebo-treated cats in spite of considerable individual variations in both groups (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). PI also reduced summary scores for individual kittens in the treated group compared to placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05). No significant difference was observed between the groups in the duration of the persistence of the signs (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06), although the result may be due to the insufficient sample size.</p><p>Reducing the severity of clinical signs is beneficial in improving the quality of life of the cats while they are recovering from FHV-1 infection and may be associated with a reduction of the epithelial necrosis and the damage to the turbinates that occurs with herpesvirus, thereby reducing the long-term sequelae such as chronic nasal infections and sinusitis. FHV-1 replicates in the nasal turbinates (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and can cause permanent damage. Damaged turbinates provide an area for secondary bacterial infections that can cause permanent signs of rhinitis.</p><p>Treatment of rhinotracheitis has been difficult and has consisted mainly of supportive care such as maintaining hydration and electrolyte balance, cleaning nasal discharges, broad spectrum antibiotics to prevent secondary infection, and encouraging eating (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Recent studies done in a shelter environment noted worsening of the respiratory signs in cats supplemented with lysine (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Earlier studies with valacyclovir found it to be too toxic for use in cats with FHV-1 infections (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a number of groups reported the use of famciclovir, an antiviral drug (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the comparable model with the experimental infection, Thomassy et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) demonstrated that in the experimental infection, famciclovir reduced viral load and severity of the disease. We cannot make a direct comparison between the efficacy of PI and famciclovir because the scoring was done in very different ways. The clinical efficacy of famciclovir was evaluated by a composite score of five primary and secondary outcomes: the sum of interrelated endpoints consisting of upper respiratory signs (sneezing and nasal discharge) and interrelated ocular signs (conjunctivitis, blepharospasm, and ocular discharge), with more scoring grades, and a potential highest score of 24 versus the highest potential score of 4 in our study. While the use of composite scores and the increase in the number of scoring grades adds power to the sample and requires fewer cats and fewer observation points, we chose not to combine primary and secondary and interrelated outcomes because this method may affect the validity of the conclusions (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Based on our safety studies, PI was much safer than famciclovir, which caused adverse reactions in 17% of the treated cats (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>Polyprenyl immunostimulant reduces clinical severity of the disease probably through immunity upregulation but has no effect on viral or antibody titers. Because of the dosage frequency and its application as an oral liquid, PI is easier to administer than pills. Simultaneous treatment with antiviral and immunomodulatory compounds has been successfully used in human medicine for HIV, hepatitis C, and other diseases and may be an option in the management of feline rhinotracheitis. PI and famciclovir represent two separate classes of treatments and both appear to reduce the severity of FHV-1 infections. No studies have been done to see if the famciclovir and PI effects can complement each other.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>AL: conception and design of the work, interpretation of the data, revising the manuscript critically for important intellectual content, and final approval of the version to be published.
