From week 24, patients not in remission (Disease Activity Score (28 joints) &#x02265;2.6) received a second course of rituximab; patients initially assigned to placebo switched to rituximab 2&#x000d7;500 mg.

Significantly higher proportions of patients achieved the primary end point (ACR20) and this was supported by significant improvements in the majority of secondary measures including change in DAS28-ESR, EULAR and ACR50 responses, DAS28-ESR LDA and remission. There were also statistically significant and clinically important improvements in physical function, as indicated by the HAQ-DI end points, and in FACIT-F and SF-36. These data are consistent with previously reported studies showing clinical improvement with rituximab in patients with an inadequate response to DMARDs or TNF inhibitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref></p><p>In contrast to previous studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> this study was conducted over a longer observation period (48 weeks vs 24 weeks) and included a second course of rituximab. Using a repeat treatment criterion based on targeting DAS28-ESR remission, the majority of patients (90%) received a second course between weeks 24 and 48, with the majority of these given at 24&#x02013;30 weeks. In rituximab-treated patients, efficacy outcomes at week 48 were comparable to those at week 24; additionally, improvement was observed for several clinically important end points, including an approximate doubling in the proportion of patients achieving LDA in the rituximab (2&#x000d7;1000 mg) + MTX dose group from week 24 to week 48 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">table 3</xref>).</p><p>The current study continued to explore the effect of two dosing regimens of rituximab, 2&#x000d7;500 mg and 2&#x000d7;1000 mg. Although a previous study,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref> suggested higher levels of efficacy (ACR70, EULAR good response and DAS28-ESR LDA) in patients receiving rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg, the results of the current study do not appear to suggest any clinical difference between the doses, either at 24 or 48 weeks. Recent data in patients with early RA have also shown similar clinical responses for both rituximab doses; however, only the 2&#x000d7;1000 mg dose significantly slowed progression of joint damage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref> Therefore, despite similar clinical outcomes, the absolute requirement to also prevent joint damage would suggest that rituximab 2&#x000d7;1000 mg is the optimal therapeutic dose.</p><p>A consistent treatment effect for both rituximab groups compared with placebo was observed at week 24 across several clinically relevant subgroups, including baseline autoantibody status. This finding is in contrast to the more pronounced effect in patients who were RF/anti-CCP seropositive observed in a previous study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref> However, the superior response of patients who were seropositive strengthened over time, as shown by greater decreases in disease activity and enhanced ACR responses at week 48 in rituximab-treated patients who were seropositive compared with patients who were seronegative.</p><p>The safety profile observed in this study is also consistent with that of previous short-term and long-term observations of rituximab in patients with RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref> As previously reported, IRRs are a primary safety concern, with the incidence highest during the first infusion of the first course. This was most evident in patients treated with rituximab (2&#x000d7;1000 mg) + MTX; however, the second infusion of the first course and both infusions of the second course had IRR rates that were lower than the IRR rate of the initial infusion and were comparable between rituximab doses. Irrespective of course or rituximab dose, there were no serious IRRs reported; however, three patients receiving rituximab (2&#x000d7;1000 mg) + MTX discontinued treatment due to IRRs.</p><p>Infections, particularly serious infections, remain a concern with all biological treatments for RA. Encouragingly, the rate of infection observed in patients receiving rituximab + MTX was low and comparable to patients receiving MTX alone over the placebo-controlled 24-week period. This low rate of serious infection continued throughout the full 48-week period, with no obvious difference between the rituximab doses.</p><p>Although reductions in Ig levels (predominantly IgM) were observed, mean Ig levels stayed within normal limits, and there did not appear to be any association between reduced Ig concentrations and infection.</p><p>The incidence of other events of interest, including malignancies and cardiac, vascular or lower gastrointestinal events did not indicate higher rates of such events with rituximab + MTX compared with MTX alone.</p><p>Both doses of rituximab were associated with rapid and complete depletion of peripheral CD19+ B cells, with depletion and repletion patterns as previously observed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref> The incidence of immunogenicity (HACAs) was also comparable with previous results with no evidence that HACA formation altered the therapeutic or safety profile of rituximab.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref></p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study confirm that rituximab is an effective and well tolerated preferred biological treatment for patients with active RA and an inadequate response to MTX.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the principal investigators of the SERENE Trial Group Ingemar Petersson, Oskarstr&#x000f6;m, Sweden; Karl Grindulis, West Bromwich, UK; Tom Sheeran, Cannock, UK; Rhian Goodfellow, Cardiff, UK; Horatiu Bolosiu, Cluj-Napoca, Romania; Catalin Codreanu, Bucharest, Romania; Matija Tomsic, Ljubljana, Slovenia; Ulrich Von Hinueber, Hildesheim, Germany; Jorg Wendler, Erlangen, Germany; Andre Kahan, Paris, France; Andreas Krause, Berlin, Germany; Jorge Morales, Leon, Spain; Ruxandra Lonescu, Bucuresti, Romania; Mihai Bojinca, Bucharest, Romania; Guillermo Huerta, Aguascalientes, Mexico; Eduardo Samayoa, Guatemala City, Guatemala; Alfred Cividino, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada; WP Olszynski, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada; Rafat Faraawi, Kitchener, Ontario, Canada; Per Eriksson, Linkoeping, Sweden; Eva Baecklund, Uppsala, Sweden; Jacob Aelion, Jackson, Tennessee, USA; Adam S Barron, West Palm Beach, Florida, USA; Marcy Bolster, Charleston, South Carolina, USA; David A Bong, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; Richard Brasington, St Louis, Missouri, USA; Michael S Brooks, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, USA; Jeffrey Butler, Spokane, Washington, USA; Andrew Chubick, Dallas, Texas, USA; John Condemi, Rochester, New York, USA; Ellen Zanetakis, Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA; James Dreyfus, Munster, Indiana, USA; Larry Willis, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA; Robert Ettlinger, Tacoma, Washington, USA; Jeffrey Kaine, Sarasota, Florida, USA; Michael Fairfax, Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Guy Fiocco, Lacrosse, Wisconsin, USA; Daniel Fohman, Bend, Oregon, USA; Reynold Karr, Everett, Washington, USA; Joseph Z Forstot, Boca Raton, Florida, USA; Norman Gaylis, Aventura, Florida, USA; Robert Griffin, West Reading, Pennsylvania, USA; Jeffrey Lawson, Simpsonville, South Carolina, USA; George Liang, Chicago, Illinois, USA; John Looney, Rochester, New York, USA; Cummins Lue, Little Rock, Arkansas, USA; William Palmer, Omaha, Nebraska, USA; Charles Pritchard, Willow Grove, Pennsylvania, USA; Luggen, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA; David Mandel, Mayfield, Ohio, USA; Benard Rubin, Fort Worth, Texas, USA; Constantine K Saadeh, Amarillo, Texas, USA; Michael Sayers, Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA; Joy Schechtman, Peoria, Arizona, USA; Evan Siegal, Wheaton, Maryland, USA; Michael Snack, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA; Jeffrey Neal, Lexington, Kentucky, USA; Ewa Olech, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA; Nadera Sweiss, Chicago, Illinois, USA; Saima Chohan, Chicago, Illinois, USA; Christopher G Jackson, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA; Richard Jimenez, Seattle, Washington, USA; Lawrence Brent, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Steven Ecklund, Meridian, Idaho, USA; Pamela Freeman, Orlando, Florida, USA; David Sises, Zephyrhills, Florida, USA; Christopher Striebich, Aurora, Colorado, USA; David Holt, Spartanburg, South Carolina, USA; Steven J Klein, Cumberland, Maryland, USA; Jefrey Lieberman, Decatur, Georgia, USA; Geoffrey Gladstein, Bridgeport, Connecticut, USA; Daksha P Mehta, Elizabethtown, Kentucky, USA; Mario Humberto Cardiel Rios, Morelia, Mexico; Steven Stern, Louisville, Kentucky, USA; A Gough, Harrogate, UK; Robert Trapo, Springfield, Illinois, USA; Morges Sisay, Evansville, Indiana, USA; Asad Fraser, Bowling Green, Kentucky, USA; Anthony Saway, Birmingham, Alabama, USA; Cesar Pacheco, Chihuahua, Mexico; Mike Green, Cork, Ireland; Deborah Desir, Hamden, Connecticut, USA; Marcin Gornisiewicz, Knoxville, Tennessee, USA; Edmund Edelmann, Bad Aibling, Germany; R Franklin, Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Charles Birbara, Worcester, Massachusetts, USA; Philip Taylor, Cape Girardeau, Missouri, USA; Alastair Kennedy, Vero Beach, Florida, USA; Michael Miniter, Moline, Illinois, USA; Allen Samuels, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, USA.
