lower limb joint angles during walking in female university students. [Subjects] Thirty
healthy female university students were randomly assigned to an experimental group (pelvic
adjustment group, n = 15) and a control group (stretching group, n = 15). [Methods] Pelvic
adjustment was performed three times on the experimental group. The control group
performed three sets of pelvic muscle stretching for 15 minutes. A back mapper and motion
analysis equipment were used to measure pelvic posture and angles of lower limb joints for
the experimental and control group. [Results] The values obtained before and after the
intervention were compared. For the experimental group, the results were significantly
different in terms of reduced differences in hip flexion between the left and right hips
and in knee abduction between the left and right knees. Differences in pelvic position and
pelvic torsion were also found in the experimental group. No significant differences in
the control group were identified. [Conclusion] Pelvic adjustment affects pelvic position
and torsion and this enhancement to pelvic stability decreases hip flexion and knee
abduction during walking.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pelvic adjustment</kwd><kwd>Lower extremity joint angle</kwd><kwd>Pelvic posture</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Gait, which comprises movements that cannot be learned in a short time, refer to continuous
and repeated movements of the body while maintaining stability. Gait also produces
biomechanical changes and motor functional changes in the nervous system and the
musculature<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each gait cycle is divided
into a stance phase and a swing phase. Each stance phase consists of heel strike, foot flat,
mid stance, and toe off movements. Each swing phase includes acceleration, mid swing, and
deceleration<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gait comprises
complicated movements in which human nerves and skeletal muscles are used in unison.
Substantial effort and practice are required for a person to perform their gait
correctly<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Normal gait is important to
maintain harmonious trunk and pelvic turns. The dynamic balance of trunk muscle activities
reduces unnecessary energy consumption and effectively eliminates false steps that may occur
during gait<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>During gait, the lower limbs (which act as weight-bearing structures) work in conjunction
with the head, the trunk, and the arms. In addition, the lower limbs provide basic movements
that are necessary to move, push the body forward, and maintain stability and balance<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. These movements in the lower limbs are
complex and efficient because they are completed by the combined functions of many human
parts. Therefore, if one portion of the body involved in these movements is impaired, gait
patterns become disorganized. The pelvis operates as a stable base for the trunk by
supporting the abdomen and connecting the spine and the lower limbs<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Previous studies have explored the necessity of stability
and posture of the pelvis during gait<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Some of these studies explored lumbopelvic stabilization and posture through bridge
exercises<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Others evaluated posture
following pelvic adjustment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> or discussed
gait variables<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. One study in particular
focused on the correlation between pelvic position and differences in lower extremity joint
angles during walking among female university students<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Few papers discuss whether the quality of gait improves following adjustments to the
pelvis. In addition, few studies explored the effects of pelvic adjustment on differences in
joint angles between the left and right lower limbs during gait. Therefore, this study used
a back mapper and motion analysis equipment to examine the effects of pelvic adjustment on
pelvic posture and differences in joint angles between the lower left and right limbs of
female university students during gait. In this study, the Gonstead technique was used to
adjust the pelvis. It is fundamentally a full-spine, osseous technique, emphasizing a
specific high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust that corrects subluxation<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted on 30 women studying at K University in South Korea. These
students were randomly divided into a pelvic adjustment group of 15 subjects and a
stretching group of 15 subjects. The mean age, height, and weight of the pelvic adjustment
group were 21.7 &#x000b1; 0.4&#x02005;years, 162.4 &#x000b1; 4.3&#x02005;cm, and 53.5 &#x000b1; 5.7&#x02005;kg, respectively. The mean age,
height, and weight of the stretching group were 20.2 &#x000b1; 0.5&#x02005;years, 161.7 &#x000b1; 3.5&#x02005;cm, and 52.4 &#x000b1;
5.6&#x02005;kg, respectively. Independent t-tests were conducted to check for differences between
the groups in terms of age, height, and weight. No statistically significant differences (p
&#x0003e; 0.05) were detected, indicating that no issues related to homogeneity were present
between the two groups. Those who had issues in the muscular, skeletal, or nervous system
were excluded as subjects. Others who were excluded from the study included those who
experienced daily pain in the lumbar region or the pelvis, those whose postures were not
proper owing to burns or postoperative scars, and those who could not walk normally. The
Institutional Review Board of K University approved this study. In accordance with the
ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki, every subject understood the purpose of
the study and provided written consent prior to their participation.</p><p>This study used a high-velocity, low-amplitude technique for prone positions derived from
Gonstead&#x02019;s theory of pelvic adjustment. After having each subject assume a prone position,
the posterior-inferior (PI) innominate bone was adjusted by moving it to the
anterior-superior (AS) position. The AS innominate bone was moved to the PI position. The
therapist&#x02019;s hands, which were overlapping, were placed on the posterior-superior iliac spine
or the ischial tuberosity. Then, pressure was applied three times using gravity,
acceleration, and the therapist&#x02019;s body weight<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pelvic postures and differences in joint angles between the left and right lower limbs were
evaluated during gait. Pelvic positions were measured using a three-dimensional spinal
diagnostic imaging system (Back Mapper, ABW, Germany). This system provides relatively
accurate analysis of shapes, positions, and distortions of the human spine when viewed from
the front, rear, bottom, or top of the body. In addition to evaluating the distribution of
fat and muscle, this system shows the position of the skeleton in the body to analyze pelvic
position (PPO), which provides the lateral slope of the pelvis. The system also shows pelvic
torsion (PTO, the degree of torsion of the hipbone), and pelvic rotation (PRO, the degree of
torsion of the pelvis on the horizontal plane).</p><p>The Qualisys Track Manager (Qualisys AB, Sweden) is a three-dimensional wireless motion
analysis system equipped with 6 cameras operating at 100&#x02005;Hz/second. This system was used for
kinematic analysis of motion in the lower limbs during gait. An L-frame was fixed at the
point at which the gait began in the body to set the spatial coordinates. The upward
vertical axis, moving direction axis, and horizontal axis were set as +Z, +Y, and +X axes,
respectively. To ensure that the marker was recognized, the space in which movements were
performed was defined using a T-wand based on the L-frame. Reflective markers were attached
to the sacrum, both thighs, both anterior superior iliac spines, and the sides of the shanks
to form a basic frame. The four markers on the thighs and the sides of the shanks were
attached in a square to form a three-dimensional space. Markers were also placed on the
medial side of the femurs, lateral epicondyles, lateral malleolus, and on both sides of the
medial malleolus. In terms of the segments of the subjects&#x02019; feet, markers were attached to
the calcaneal tuberosity and the first and fifth metatarsal heads on the surface of the
feet. In addition, markers were placed on the medial side of the femurs, the lateral
epicondyles, the lateral malleolus, and on both sides of the medial malleolus to track the
three-dimensional movements of the three lower limb joints. These markers were removed
before images were taken. A single trained individual attached the markers to reduce the
potential for error. Using motion analysis, differences were measured between the left and
right range of motion for hip joint flexion, abduction, and external rotation. Differences
were also measured for knee joint flexion, abduction, and external rotation, as well as
ankle joint dorsiflexion, inversion, and abduction along the X, Y, and Z axes<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The measured data were analyzed using the SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) statistical
program. The collected data were presented as means and standard deviations. Paired t-tests
were used to measure the significance of differences before and after the experiment in each
group, and independent t-tests determined the significance of differences between the two
groups. The level of significance was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The data were compared before and after the experiment in the pelvic adjustment and

The dynamic
balance of trunk muscle activities limits unnecessary energy consumption and effectively
reduces false steps that may occur during gait<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Incorrect gait patterns cause body instability and affect
breathing, the heart, and balance of various regions of the body. Incorrect gait patterns
also lead to excessive energy consumption. This may induce severe fatigue, long-term
increases of which can cause malformation of the foot structure due to improper weight
distribution<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pelvis is a structure
between the hip joint and the lumbosacral region. Many muscles are attached to the pelvis to
control the movements of the hip joint and the lumbosacral region. Therefore, the position
of the pelvis is the most important element that determines the sagittal alignment and
posture in the body<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the
position of the pelvis may cause mechanical problems to the musculoskeletal system of the
lumbar vertebrae, and anterior-posterior sloped movements of the pelvis may affect spinal
stability and body alignment. Therefore, proper alignment of the pelvis is an important
component of gait. Improper positioning of the pelvis can lead to poor posture<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Normal positions and stability of the pelvis are important for balanced gait. Although many
previous studies have used three-dimensional gait analysis to implement diverse
interventions in hemiplegia<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup> or cerebral
palsy patients<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, few studies have
analyzed the gait of normal adults after pelvic adjustment. Therefore, this study was
designed to examine the effects of pelvic adjustment in normal adults on the position of the
pelvis and lower limb joint angles during gait.</p><p>After pelvic adjustment was applied using the Gonstead technique, lower limb joint angles
during gait were measured using the Qualisys Track Manager. According to the results,
differences between left and right hip flexion angles and between left and right knee valgus
angles significantly decreased in the experimental group. Pelvic postures were analyzed
using a back mapper. The results showed that the lateral slope of the pelvis and hipbone
torsion decreased after pelvic adjustment.</p><p>In terms of previous studies related to pelvic adjustment, Park et al. reported an
improvement in the balance of 20 elderly men through pelvic adjustment using the Gonstead
technique<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Gong et al. reported that
unequal functional leg length decreased following pelvic adjustment using the Gonstead
technique. This change in leg length inequality also reduced foot pressure differences<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study related to the pelvis,
Cho and Jun selected 30 female university students and randomly assigned them to a pelvic
adjustment and a stretching group, each of which contained 15 subjects. Cho and Jun&#x02019;s study,
the purpose of which was to analyze gait and differences in step length, stance phase, swing
phase, single support, and step time between the groups, found marked decreases in these
elements following pelvic adjustment<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Cho reported that pelvic adjustment led to statistically significant improvements in trunk
imbalance, pelvic position, pelvic torsion, and the position of the scapulae<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Previous studies suggesting that pelvic adjustment using the Gonstead technique reduced
differences in leg lengths, improved balance, reduced foot pressure differences, reduced
differences in gait variables (e.g., step length), and improved pelvic postures (e.g.,
pelvic positions) are consistent with the results found in the present study. The findings
of this study indicate improved gait quality using pelvic adjustment to correct pelvic
postures, reduced differences between left and right hip flexion angles, and minimized
differences between left and right knee valgus angles. These results were achieved because
pelvic adjustment affected balance and gait variables. The use of pelvic adjustment in
clinics to improve pelvic postures and gait quality is therefore recommended.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by the Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2016.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Perry</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: Gait analysis: Normal and pathological function.
