Population screening using fecal occult blood tests (FOBTs) facilitates early detection and greater chance of survival, but participation rates are low. We developed a Web-based decision tool to provide information tailored to an individual&#x02019;s decision stage for CRC screening and attitude toward screening utilizing the Preventive Health Model (PHM) and Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) as theoretical frameworks for screening behavior. We describe the practical steps employed in the tool&#x02019;s design and the subsequent conduct of an exploratory study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="objective"><title>Objective</title><p>To design a decision tool for CRC screening and conduct an exploratory study among average-risk men and women to (1) test the impact of message type (tailored vs non-tailored) and message delivery modality (Web-based vs paper-based) on attitudes toward screening and screening uptake, and (2) investigate the acceptability of the decision tool and relevance of materials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Participants (n = 100), recruited from a population sample of men and women aged 50-76 residing in urban Adelaide, Australia, were randomly assigned to a control group or one of 4 interventions: (1) Web-based and tailored information, (2) paper-based and tailored information, (3) Web-based and non-tailored (generic) information, or (4) paper-based and non-tailored information. Participation was augmented by snowball recruitment (n = 19). Questionnaires based on PHM variables were administered pre- and post-intervention. Participants were given the opportunity to request an FOBT. Following the intervention, participants discussed the acceptability of the tool.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Full data were available for 87.4% (104/119) of participants. Post-intervention, perceived susceptibility scores for individuals receiving tailored information increased from mean 10.6 (SD 2.1) to mean 11.8 (SD 2.2). Scores on self-efficacy increased in the tailored group from mean 11.7 (SD 2.0) to mean 12.6 (SD 1.8). There were significant time x modality x message effects for social influence and salience and coherence, reflecting an increase in these scores for tailored Web-based participants only; social influence scores increased from mean 11.7 (SD 2.6) to mean 14.9 (SD 2.3), and salience and coherence scores increased from mean 16.0 (SD 2.2) to mean 17.7 (SD 2.1). There was no greater influence of modality or message type on movement toward a decision to screen or screening uptake, indicating that neither tailored messages nor a Web modality had superior effect. Overall, participants regarded tailored messages positively, but thought that the Web tool lacked &#x0201c;media richness.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This exploratory study confirms that tailoring on PHM predictors of CRC screening has the potential to positively address attitudes toward screening. However, tailoring on these variables did not result in significantly increased screening uptake. Future research should consider other possible psychosocial influences.

Population screening using a fecal occult blood test (FOBT), or the second-generation fecal immunochemical test (FIT), facilitates the detection of CRC at its early stages by detecting invisible (occult) traces of blood in the feces. A recent systematic review concluded that appropriate population utilization of FOBT screening is likely to reduce death from CRC by about 1 in 6 deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]. This possibility has resulted in the implementation of national pilot or population screening programs in a number of countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]. Effectiveness of these programs depends upon yield and participation rates&#x02014;in Australia, estimates of participation in screening for colorectal cancer have been low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]. The National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP), which provides people turning 50, 55, and 60 years with a free FOBT, had a total participation rate over three years (June 2008 to June 2011) of 38.4% of the eligible population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>].</p><p>This paper describes the theoretical framework and practical steps we employed to design a Web-based, tailored decision tool for CRC screening, and to conduct an exploratory study to test its impact on screening attitudes and uptake prior to the design and conduct of a larger randomized trial. We examined uptake of FOBT only (versus colonoscopy or in addition to colonoscopy) because unlike other countries, such as the United States, usual CRC screening practice in Australia is by FOBT followed by colonoscopy for those with a positive result&#x02014;colonoscopy is regarded as a diagnostic test rather than a screening test. We also sought to place the study in the context of the NBCSP approach, which is to encourage population-based screening using FOBT for those who do not have any obvious symptoms of bowel cancer.</p><sec><title>Theoretical Framework</title><p>Two classes of behavioral theory are relevant to understanding uptake of new health behavior. &#x0201c;Stage of change&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;readiness to act&#x0201d; models, such as the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>], focus on an individual&#x02019;s commitment to act. The PAPM characterizes movement toward commitment as (1) unaware of the issue, (2) heard of the issue but unconcerned, (3) considering action, (4) deciding against action, or (5) deciding to act. By contrast, &#x0201c;continuum&#x0201d; theories, such as the Preventive Health Model (PHM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>], focus on psychosocial predictors of intention to act and on predictors of behavior. The PHM approach identifies 5 variables that affect the likelihood to act. In the context of cancer screening, these are (1) salience and coherence of the screening behavior (the perception that performing cancer screening is consistent with beliefs about how to protect and maintain health); (2) perceived susceptibility (perceptions of personal risk for developing colorectal cancer or polyps); (3) response efficacy (the belief that utilizing an FOBT will be effective in reducing disease threat); (4) cancer worries (concerns about negative consequences of undertaking cancer screening); and (5) social influence (extent to which an individual believes that those who they interact with, and whose opinions they value, support FOBT use). Research indicates that these factors are associated with the decision to screen in the United States [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>], Canada [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>], and Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]. Two other constructs&#x02014;self-efficacy and fecal aversion&#x02014;are important in the context of this study. Self-efficacy, in this case the confidence to utilize the FOBT, is a significant predictor of health-related intentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] and behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>], and fecal aversion has been demonstrated to be a predictor of FOBT uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>].</p><p>Research has shown that programs designed to improve screening uptake are enhanced considerably when stage theories and continuum theories are utilized together. Groups of people at a specific stage of thinking about CRC screening (PAPM) can be distinguished from people at a different stage in terms of their responses to the variables included in the PHM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>]. Thus, utilization of both the PAPM and PHM can enable the provision of messages that are &#x0201c;tailored&#x0201d; to individual responses with the aim of moving people to a &#x0201c;better&#x0201d; screening decision stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Tailored Communication</title><p>Tailored health promotion materials are &#x0201c;...any combination of information and behavior change strategies intended to reach one specific person, based on characteristics that are unique to that person, related to the outcome of interest, and derived from an individual assessment&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]. Tailored print communication is better remembered, read, and perceived as more relevant than non-tailored materials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]. However, a recent systematic review based on two trials, found no evidence of tailored interventions on CRC screening uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>], although the researchers found evidence for a beneficial effect of tailored information on perception of cancer risk and knowledge of cancer. Thus, further research is required to better understand the &#x0201c;ingredients&#x0201d; of tailoring approaches on CRC screening rates.</p></sec><sec><title>Web Delivery of Information</title><p>Paper-based delivery of non-tailored screening messages has improved FOBT uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] and tailoring may have the capacity to achieve further incremental improvements in uptake rates. A meta-analysis showed that computerized tailoring (feedback composed by means of computer algorithms) demonstrated improved outcomes in terms of health behaviors compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>]. Using computers to construct tailored messages can facilitate the creation of finer-grained tailored materials; without them, tailoring has been limited to few variables because of constraints on the logistical practicality of creating a comprehensive library of messages and manipulating them to simultaneously address multiple variables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]. Additionally, delivery via online communication channels may increase the feasibility of this individualized approach to communication through channels such as interactive feedback and simplicity of navigation to personally relevant materials. For example, a meta-analysis comparing Web-based and non-Web-based information interventions has shown enhanced outcomes among individuals using Web-based interventions, particularly in the areas of knowledge and targeted behavior change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>].</p><p>In light of the above considerations, we conducted an exploratory study to investigate whether information tailored to an individual&#x02019;s current decision stage for screening based on PHM variables would have a greater influence on the readiness of invitees to be screened compared with non-tailored generic information. We also sought to disentangle outcomes and investigate whether it was perceived personal relevance (through tailoring) of information, simplicity of navigation (through Web-based delivery) to access personally relevant material, or both factors that had the greater effect. The primary outcomes were (1) change in PHM scores, (2) change in PAPM decision stage, (3) intention to screen as measured by a request for an FOBT, and (4) actual uptake of screening. We were also interested in participants&#x02019; opinions of the acceptability and relevance of the materials. We aimed to use results from this exploratory study to inform the design and conduct of a larger, nationwide randomized controlled trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Design</title><p>A 2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 2 mixed model factorial design examined the influence of message type (tailored vs non-tailored) and message modality (paper vs Web) on predictors of screening (PHM variables) and stage of readiness to screen (PAPM stage) measured before and after receipt of screening messages.

Prior to extracting this subsample, telephone contact numbers were obtained by comparing names and addresses against information contained in the electronic White Pages telephone directory. Those persons for whom telephone contact details were not indicated were excluded, as were those whose postal code indicated they lived more than one hours&#x02019; travel time from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation <bold>(</bold>CSIRO) laboratories. The remaining names were randomized into 4 intervention groups and 1 control group by a researcher not directly connected with the study using a computer-generated random number sequence (Microsoft Office Excel 2003).</p></sec><sec><title>Study Conduct</title><p>The trial commenced in August 2007 and proceeded through a number of phases.</p><sec><title>Phase 1</title><p>A notification letter describing the study was mailed to potential participants. They were advised that they were eligible to participate if they were aged 50-76 and ineligible if they were having regular CRC screening or had ever been diagnosed with colorectal cancer or bowel polyps. Those allocated to the intervention groups were also required to have experience using a computer to search the Web and to be willing to attend the CSIRO laboratory.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 2</title><p>Two weeks (+/- 48 hours) following the notification letter, attempts were made (maximum 3) to telephone individuals and recruit them to the study. A computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) format was used to collect interview responses (Microsoft Office Access 2003). Informed consent was formally requested and recorded before commencement of the CATI. Participants answered baseline survey questions to collect background demographics and responses to other variables as described previously. Appointments were made with all but the control group participants to visit the CSIRO laboratory and review materials concerned with CRC screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 3</title><p>Two weeks (+/- 48 hours) later, participants attended CSIRO. They were presented with Web-based or paper-based CRC educational content, as allocated by random sampling, to work through as they wished. Additionally, one Web group and one paper group received messages tailored according to their responses to the baseline survey. The non-tailored Web and paper groups received generic information. Participants in each group were aware that the intervention might be Web- or paper-based, but those who received tailored messages were blinded to the fact that others received only generic messages. The process of developing the tailored messages and educational content is described in the Materials section. Participants were also given the opportunity to request an FOBT through either a Web link or a paper form according to intervention group.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 4</title><p>Immediately following the intervention, participants were asked to complete an endpoint survey that remeasured the same variables as in the baseline survey. Control group participants were telephoned at this point (ie, approximately 2 weeks following the baseline survey) and they completed the endpoint survey through a CATI. Control group respondents whose PAPM stage was &#x0201c;ready to act&#x0201d; were regarded as having requested an FOBT kit. Those who were not ready to act were sent a letter inviting them to contact the researchers should they subsequently wish to receive an FOBT.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 5</title><p>All intervention group participants completed an additional questionnaire and participated in a discussion group immediately following completion of the endpoint survey. Both the questionnaire and the discussion explored perceptions of the relevance of the information presented, ease of navigation through the materials, and satisfaction with the information they had gained. The interviews were conducted individually or as a group, depending on the number of people attending the session. The questionnaire analyses are not included here because they have been reported in a separate paper with respect to an enhanced version of the decision aid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 6</title><p>One day after the intervention, an FOBT was mailed to those who requested one. The remaining participants were sent a letter inviting them to contact the researchers should they subsequently wish to receive an FOBT. Receipt of completed tests was recorded by a processing center and de-identified with aggregate participation data relayed to the researchers. People who did not return their test after 6 weeks were sent a reminder letter. Those who did not return their test after 12 weeks were regarded as having not screened.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Materials</title><p>An overview of the materials developed for the study and their presentation is described subsequently, followed by specific details of the various components.</p><sec><title>Tailored Intervention</title><p>Materials for the tailored group were a message library consisting of messages tailored to an individual user&#x02019;s decision stage for screening and responses to PHM, self-efficacy, and fecal aversion variables, and generic educational content based on the NBCSP consumer information booklet.

From the baseline survey data, an access query obtained the participant&#x02019;s name, age, scores on each tailoring variable, and screening decision stage. This information was manually entered into a logic program, a &#x0201c;message concatenator&#x0201d; that accessed the message library and produced a set of personalized reinforcing or motivating messages according to scores. The messages were divided into &#x0201c;chunk 1&#x0201d; (messages addressing the factors most salient to the participant&#x02019;s decision stage as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>) and &#x0201c;chunk 2&#x0201d; (messages addressing the remaining factors as seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The text of both sets of messages varied by individual&#x02014;those at the same decision stage (having the same salient and less salient factors relating to that decision stage) may have scored those factors differently, so messages would reflect the divergence in scores. An example of a completed concatenator form and the resultant set of messages is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> indicates, the underlying message&#x02013;merge syntax resulted in duplication of words and phrases, concepts running together, and seemingly random placement of the personalized name and age details. These messages were subsequently edited by the first author in order to omit duplicated phrases and enhance flow between PHM factor concepts.

Participants had the option of completing the form immediately after viewing the material and leaving the completed form with the researchers (paper group) or using a hyperlink to email their details (Web group). The screening kit included (1) a bowel cancer screening information pamphlet; (2) an immunochemical FOBT (InSure, Enterix Australia) that does not require dietary or drug restrictions; (3) a combined participant details and consent form confirming personal details, nominating a preferred doctor for follow-up, and consent to obtain clinical follow-up reports if required; and (4) a reply-paid return envelope addressed to the processing laboratory. The processing laboratory provided the researchers with de-identified FOBT receipt information.</p></sec><sec><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Chi-square analyses (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) and one-way analyses of variances (ANOVAs) were initially undertaken to confirm group comparability at baseline. A mixed-group design ANOVA with two between-group factors&#x02014;message delivery modality (Web or paper) and message type (tailored or non-tailored)&#x02014;and one within-subject factor, time of measurement (baseline&#x02013;time 1 and endpoint&#x02013;time 2), was undertaken to examine for main effects from message, modality, and time of measurement, and their interaction on the main outcome variables. These main effects and interaction terms were examined in order to test whether attitudes and beliefs, as reflected in scores on the PHM variables and self-efficacy and fecal aversion, improved over time, and were influenced by the message delivery modality and the nature of the message. It was hypothesized that tailored messages delivered via Web modality would be associated with greatest improvement. The effect of modality and message type on categorical outcome variables (ie, decision stage movement, FOBT request, and uptake) was examined using Chi-square analyses. Participation rates were defined as &#x0201c;early&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; at a cut-off point of 6 weeks following dispatch of FOBT, and &#x0201c;non-return&#x0201d; at a cut-off point of 12 weeks. All analyses were conducted using a two-sided alpha level of .05.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>From a sampling frame of 756 people, 532 people were contacted at baseline. Of these, 298/532 (56.0%) declined to participate and 134/532 (25.2%) were ineligible. In total, 100/756 (13.2%) agreed to participate in the study. There was no significant difference in gender distribution (the only demographic variable obtained from non-participants) between those who declined to participate and participants (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>
<sub>1 </sub>= 0.2, <italic>P </italic>= .68). Because the numbers in the intervention groups were lower than anticipated, we resorted to &#x0201c;snowball&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] recruitment (n = 19) to increase the number of participants to within approximately equal numbers in each group. &#x0201c;Snowballing&#x0201d; is a chain-referral method whereby a study participant who fits the eligibility criteria uses their social networks to recruit participants with similar characteristics. Those participants then recruit others, resulting in a process analogous to a snowball rolling down a hill. Subsequently, 15 participants (2 in the paper/non-tailored, 5 in the paper/tailored, 6 in the Web/non-tailored, and 2 in the Web/tailored groups) did not attend the laboratory for the intervention. Therefore, full data were available for 95.7% (104/119) of participants. Although &#x0201c;snowball&#x0201d; recruits comprised 17.3% (18/104) of the final sample and varied between groups, there were no significant differences between groups for gender, mean age, education, Australian birth, marital status, and awareness of FOBT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table5" position="float"><label>Table 5</label><caption><p>Comparison of groups across conditions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8" border="1" width="1000"><col width="10" span="1"/><col width="154" span="1"/><col width="154" span="1"/><col width="131" span="1"/><col width="154" span="1"/><col width="131" span="1"/><col width="80" span="1"/><col width="63" span="1"/><col width="75" span="1"/><col width="75" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="bottom"><td colspan="2" rowspan="1"> Demographic </td><td colspan="5" rowspan="1"> Condition </td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"> &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> (df) </td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

In addition to changes in PHM variable scores, outcomes included changes in decision stage for screening, FOBT requests, and participation.</p><p>After the interventions, there was an improvement in PHM variable scores for all groups except the control group, who received no information. For the intervention groups, all mean scores significantly moved in the desired direction (eg, decreased cancer worries or increased support for cancer screening identified in all other psychological variables). Although not influencing every factor, receipt of tailored messages increased perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy and increased both salience and coherence and social influence when combined with Web delivery. Perceived susceptibility has been shown to be a predictor of intention to screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>]. Similarly, a person&#x02019;s confidence in their capacity to act (self-efficacy) is widely reported as a predictor of actual health behavior participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] and has been shown to moderate the relationship between intention, planning, and action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>]. Thus, it appears that messages tailored to individual levels of these important factors have a greater likelihood of beneficially influencing screening behavior than more generic messages. Salience and coherence and social influence are also important behavioral determinants of screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]; it is unclear how Web delivery interacted with tailoring to improve these scores.</p><p>Overall, there was no indication of a modality effect for PHM factors; the delivery channel alone (paper or Web) had no direct influence on score changes. Web delivery enables a shift from the use of static material to a dynamic interactive resource [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>] that could be expected to provide more sophisticated and effective decision support. Qualitative data suggests that the site may not have fulfilled expectations with regard to &#x0201c;media richness.&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Rich&#x0201d; media are generally characterized by the capacity for immediate feedback, the capacity to transmit multiple cues, the use of language variety, and capacity of the medium to have a personal focus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>]. The Web-based educational content of the decision support tool was designed to be comparable with the paper version, with only the presence of hyperlinks differentiating the modes of transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure2">Figure 2</xref>). Interview feedback suggested participants found the information &#x0201c;boring&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dry&#x0201d; in comparison to other websites and this may have affected their level of engagement. This result highlights the need to ensure that Web-based information is presented in media-rich format that users have come to expect, albeit with due consideration of the needs of the target age group (eg, issues of cognition, readability, vision, and disability) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>].</p><p>Regarding movement in decision stage, more people in the control group moved from &#x0201c;never heard of FOBT&#x0201d; to no further than &#x0201c;not considering&#x0201d; FOBT. This result corresponds with the control group&#x02019;s lack of movement in PHM scores and clarifies that the act of being asked to just think about the factors associated with screening without accompanying more specific information is unlikely to encourage screening uptake. Although there was greater movement toward a decision to screen in the intervention groups, no one modality or message type was more effective than the other. The lack of effect of Web versus paper delivery could be ascribed to the previously mentioned lack of expected Web-based richness of information. However, receipt of tailored messages, compared to non-tailored material, had a beneficial effect on several PHM factors and could be expected to increase intention to screen.</p><p>Despite a growing evidence base showing that tailored messages are superior to generic messages in their ability to influence health behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>], the mechanisms by which tailoring works is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>]. Tailored feedback can take different forms&#x02014;descriptive, comparative, evaluative, or a combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>]&#x02014;and their relative effectiveness may differ between individuals. For example, some study participants found our descriptive approach (providing feedback on what is known about the recipient based upon their PHM responses) confronting (eg, it was a &#x0201c;...bit strange seeing things that I&#x02019;d said&#x0201d;) and the language may have lacked empathy. Message framing may also have an influence. For example, Akl and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>] in their systematic review noted that loss messages (vs gain messages) led to more positive perception of effectiveness for screening messages. Others have found that differing presentation of risk factors (absolute vs comparative) had an impact on intention to screen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>], and message order was found to influence responses to breast cancer information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>]. Further research to test the effects of different types of message feedback, framing, and presentation order using both behavioral and communication theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>] in the CRC screening context would help &#x0201c;unpack&#x0201d; the mechanisms through which tailoring has an influence.</p><p>The FOBT request and uptake rates, although greater than the control, were no different for modality or message type. Only slightly more than half of the FOBTs requested were returned. Although it is generally accepted that intention to screen is a necessary precursor of action, other variables amenable to tailoring may exert a greater influence on screening uptake. For example, in a group of people committed to screening we found that, in conjunction with self-efficacy, commitment explained only 8.0% of variance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>], and others have found that life difficulty variables were better predictors of action than intention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref>]. Other researchers have approached the choice of tailoring variables in other ways (eg, by targeting the most important barriers identified by participants themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref>]).</p><p>We did not test whether knowledge of bowel cancer and screening was enhanced through provision of the educational material, or whether such knowledge helped participants decide whether or not to screen. Knowledge is a critical component of informed decision making; however, as Jepson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>] point out, a tension exists between the need of a screening program to attain high rates of uptake and the promotion of informed choice&#x02014;an individual with whom information about the explicit risks and benefits has been shared may choose not to undertake screening (as in the case of prostate cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>]). Although acknowledging the ethical imperative of being able to make an informed choice, it is unclear whether increased knowledge alone actually influences uptake. Increased knowledge does not necessarily translate into action. This fact has been demonstrated with respect to bowel cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref>], other screening behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>], and organ donation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of the relative lack of effect of Web-based delivery, from a practical perspective, using the Web as a delivery medium for tailored information has significant advantages over tailoring via paper. Material and decision rules can be created and updated more easily and economically, thus maintaining currency for a longer period, and the interaction required for obtaining relevant information and providing tailored feedback can occur in the one session. This creates a &#x0201c;real time&#x0201d; interaction that can be linked to immediate behavior activation (eg, ordering an FOBT online). Older people are increasingly using the Internet. An earlier study we conducted found that more than half the population over 50 years in South Australia had access to the Internet at some location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref>]. Others have found that in South Australia the proportion of people aged 45 to over 65 years seeking Internet health information significantly increased between 2001 and 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref>]. These data are likely to be representative of greater Australia and other developed countries.</p><sec><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>There are some limitations with this study. First, our sample was small, but it was consistent with that typically used in exploratory studies. Second, those who did participate were likely to have had greater focus on their health status and, therefore, not necessarily representative of the external population. Participants and non-participants did not differ in gender, although we acknowledge that they may have differed on other variables. It was not possible to measure the extent of any potential bias without detailed information on those who did not participate, which was inherently unavailable. We also had a lower than expected initial uptake rate, necessitating snowball recruitment and the associated loss of randomization.</p><p>Nevertheless, by means of this exploratory study we gained sufficient indication of the beneficial effect of tailored material on FOBT screening attitudes and participation to justify the formulation of feasible hypotheses upon which to expand our research. We also gained a participant perspective of the usability and the content of the website. These results will be incorporated into the design of a larger, truly randomized trial using an improved Web interface. The process of producing and presenting tailored messages from survey responses was labor-intensive and not readily transferable to population settings. Going through the process, however, highlighted the potential for the development of more sophisticated, fully automated message libraries and the use of natural language generation systems, for example [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>].</p><p>Despite that randomization was broken, strengths of the study included the majority of participants (although self-selected) were randomly sampled from a population frame, thereby providing a stronger indication of generalizability of results. We used behavioral constructs that had been validated as predictors of CRC screening, and FOBT participation was not measured by self-report alone.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This exploratory study has confirmed that the provision of tailored messages that address attitudes and perceptions of screening that are amenable to change are more likely to result in increased readiness to screen for CRC compared to provision of generic information alone. However, despite increased PHM scores and generally positive qualitative feedback, tailored messages did not result in significantly increased requests for an FOBT or its actual use. Future research should address optimal message framing and construction, and consideration of other possible psychosocial influences on screening uptake. Mode of delivery did not affect outcomes, but this may have been due to Web design deficiencies. From a public health promotion perspective, the Web has economic and logistical advantages over paper as a delivery medium.</p><p>We are currently undertaking a large-scale, randomized population trial using a redesigned Internet decision aid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>] to construct and deliver tailored messages in real time. Based on the results of this exploratory study, we have been able to improve the quality and precision of our intervention. We ensured that the initial sample approached would be large enough, after allowing for attrition through non-eligibility and non-participation, to retain sufficient power to detect statistically significant group differences for the primary outcomes. This study also highlighted that the steps involved in gaining responses to PHM variables upon which to base tailored messages, and the process of preparing the messages for presentation in a coherent manner, was labor-intensive and not compatible with a population-based screening program. Therefore, in the larger trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref>], baseline survey responses will be collected in real time and participants in the tailored information group will receive immediate tailored feedback. Additionally, an automated tailored message library using sophisticated algorithms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref>] will be used to ensure that messages are united with natural language so that they can be read in a coherent, logical manner without the need for further &#x0201c;editing.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Stephen Cole and Alicia Keys,
