Unfortunately, many trials either fail to recruit sufficient numbers of participants, or recruitment takes longer than anticipated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Such difficulties not only have an impact on the power and external validity of the study&#x02019;s findings but may also increase the overall financial cost. Many trials implement methods to improve recruitment and/or retention such as the use of monetary incentives. There is, however, limited evidence as to the effectiveness of recruitment strategies in healthcare settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and as a result, the UK Medical Research Council funded the Systematic Techniques for Assisting Recruitment to Trials (MRC START) research programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The aim of this programme was to &#x0201c;improve the evidence-base of recruitment to trials, enhance recruitment rates and make research more accessible to the public.&#x0201d; One key objective of the project was to develop interventions to improve recruitment to trials and test them in embedded trials within ongoing &#x02018;host&#x02019; trials. The initial focus was on testing optimised patient information sheets and multimedia resources.</p><p>Patient information sheets (PISs) are always given to potential trial participants along with verbal information as part of the informed consent process. A trial PIS has to be reviewed and approved by an ethics committee or an internal review body; nonetheless, there remain longstanding concerns regarding their length, complexity and the level of literacy skills required to understand the information, all of which may have a negative impact on recruitment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Indeed, a recent sample of 20 PISs from recently completed or ongoing RCTs were found to be lengthy (mean word count 1853, standard deviation&#x02009;=&#x02009;960) and lacking information important to making an informed decision about trial participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. However, Brierley et al. found that reducing the length of the PIS did not influence recruitment and actually yielded more ineligible patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, simply producing a shorter PIS is ineffective, and the content and interpretability of the information presented must be retained. One possible approach to improve the quality and appearance of PISs is to develop their content through a process of re-writing (for a lay audience), re-organisation, enhancing their appearance through input from a graphic designer and involving user testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The use of a professionally designed information pack was seen to have a small positive effect on initial response rates relative to a &#x02018;standard&#x02019; pack (2.7% difference in response rates, 95% confidence interval (CI) &#x02212;0.06 to 5.5%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.06) in an RCT embedded in an Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, undertaking commercial user testing and incorporating graphic design input into PISs is costly, especially if the process needs to be completed for each trial; therefore, it has been suggested that a &#x02018;bank&#x02019; of template PISs could be developed (which have been re-written and have undergone bespoke user testing and graphic design) in different populations. Researchers could select the most appropriate template on which to base their trial PIS according to their particular study population.</p><p>Embedding recruitment trials into ongoing trials is an efficient method to test recruitment strategies, and to help fill the knowledge gap with minimal resource use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> presents a Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) checklist for reporting embedded recruitment trials. The REFORM study team were invited by the MRC START programme to embed a recruitment methodology trial within the REducing Falls with ORthoses and a Multifaceted podiatry intervention (REFORM) study. The REFORM study was selected, as the aims of the MRC START programme were compatible with both the need to maximise recruitment to the REFORM trial and the ethos of the York Trials Unit (YTU) to develop an understanding of effective recruitment interventions. The aim of the designed three-arm embedded trial was to determine if the number of participants recruited, randomised and retained to the REFORM trial could be improved by the use of both a bespoke user-tested and a template-developed optimised PIS.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Checklist of items for reporting embedded recruitment trials</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Section/topic and item no.</th><th>CONSORT 2010 (standard) checklist item</th><th>Extension for embedded recruitment trials</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">Title and abstract</td></tr><tr><td>1a</td><td>Identification as a randomised trial in the title</td><td>Identification as an <italic>embedded randomised recruitment trial</italic> in the title</td></tr><tr><td>1b</td><td>Structured summary of trial design, methods, results and conclusions (for specific guidance see CONSORT for abstracts)</td><td>Structured summary of <italic>embedded recruitment trial</italic> design, methods, results and conclusions (for specific guidance see CONSORT for abstracts)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Introduction</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3">Background and objectives</td></tr><tr><td>2a</td><td>Scientific background and explanation of rationale</td><td>Scientific background and explanation of rationale <italic>for embedded recruitment trial including a brief description of the host trial(s) as appropriate</italic>

Ethical approval for the REFORM study was given by NRES East of England &#x02013; Cambridge East Research Ethics Committee and the University of York, Department of Health Sciences Research Governance Committee. Ethical approval for the PIS embedded methodology trial was given via a substantial amendment to the same committees. The embedded methodology trial is registered as a substudy to REFORM (ISRCTN68240461).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>REFORM is a cohort RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] in which patients were initially recruited to an observational cohort before potentially being randomised into an RCT. Electronic medical notes at participating National Health Service (NHS) podiatry clinics were searched to identify community-dwelling patients eligible for the REFORM observational cohort (i.e. those who were over the age of 65 and had attended a routine podiatry appointment within the past 6&#x000a0;months). Potentially eligible participants were mailed an invitation pack (letter of invitation, one of the three PISs being evaluated in this embedded trial, consent form, screening questionnaire and prepaid envelope) asking whether they would like to participate in the REFORM study. The information and consent process covered all aspects of the cohort and trial, and so only one PIS was seen by participants whether they went on to be randomised into the REFORM trial or not. Participants who returned their completed consent and screening form to the YTU by post were assessed by researchers at the YTU for eligibility. Participants were ineligible if they reported neuropathy, dementia or another neurological condition such as Parkinson&#x02019;s or Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease; were unable to walk household distances without the help of a walking aid; or had a lower limb amputation or were unwilling to attend their local podiatry clinic. Eligible participants were sent a baseline questionnaire and monthly falls calendars. Participants who returned a baseline questionnaire and at least one monthly falls calendar (recording falls in the previous month) were included in the observational cohort. Those cohort participants who had either had one fall in the past 12&#x000a0;months or one fall in the past 24&#x000a0;months requiring hospital attention, or who reported a fear of falling on the baseline questionnaire (worried about falling at least some of the time in the past 4&#x000a0;weeks) were then eligible for randomisation to the REFORM trial. During the course of the trial, cohort participants who went on to have a fall could then become eligible for the REFORM trial. In order to minimise the delay between randomisation and the podiatrist seeing the participants in clinic for their REFORM appointment, participants were randomised when clinics had capacity and not at the point of becoming eligible for the trial.</p><p>At the point at which this embedded trial was nested within the host trial, the next podiatry clinics due to begin recruitment were Harrogate, Leeds, Scarborough, Selby and Sheffield. All patients due to be sent a REFORM invitation pack from these clinics were randomised to one of the three arms in the embedded methodology trial which determined which format of PIS they were sent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p>This was an embedded, individually randomised, recruitment trial. A list of patients was generated and ordered by NHS number. Each patient was assigned a unique identification number. An independent data manager at the YTU, who was not involved in the recruitment of participants, generated the allocation sequence for the embedded methodology trial electronically. Randomisation was stratified by centre, using a single large block per site, which corresponded to its total sample size. Participants were allocated 1:1:1 to receive, in their invitation pack, either (1) the control PIS and control invitation letter; or (2) an optimised version of the PIS and invitation letter developed through bespoke user testing; or (3) an optimised template-developed PIS and the original invitation letter. Patients were then sent the allocated invitation pack by members of the research team based at the University of York. The researchers, patients and podiatrists were blind to the allocation. Patients who received the information sheet were unaware that they had been randomised to receive different information leaflets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Control group</title><p>The &#x02018;control&#x02019; PIS was the original PIS developed for the REFORM trial. It was written in accordance with the standard National Research Ethics Service template available at the time at which the study was set up. It underwent several revisions by the research team and was five pages of A4 paper in length. The invitation letter was one A4 page on NHS trust headed paper. The control PIS is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Intervention group: &#x02018;bespoke user-tested&#x02019; PIS</title><p>The &#x02018;bespoke user-tested&#x02019; PIS was developed in the following way: it was re-written for a lay audience (led by author PK), re-organised into eight subsections, had graphic design input and underwent user testing. The graphic design and user testing were both undertaken by commercial companies. Staff members who had considerable experience in writing patient material and a graphic designer revised the content and layout of the control PIS. A contents list was placed on the front page along with a list of key points about the study, with the main text divided into eight sections. Sentences and paragraphs were shortened and bullet points used for lists. The PIS then underwent three rounds of user testing, each involving 10 members of the public with limited podiatry- or trial-specific knowledge. During the user-testing process, the users (a group demographically similar to the REFORM trial target population but with no history of falls) were asked to find key pieces of information in the PIS relating to: the nature and purpose of the trial; the process and meaning of consent; and trial procedures and safety issues. Questions were arranged in such a way to ensure they did not match the order within the PIS. The final version of the PIS was printed on one sheet of double-sided A3 paper and folded to form a booklet. The control one-page invitation letter was revised and underwent user testing alongside the PIS, resulting in shortened text and the addition of bullet points to clarify what to do if the participant wished to take part. The user-tested PIS is shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention group: &#x02018;template-developed&#x02019; PIS</title><p>The &#x02018;template-developed&#x02019; PIS was written by three research fellows with more than 12&#x000a0;years&#x02019; experience of recruiting patients to a range of randomised trials and who were currently working on the REFORM study. The content, layout and style were revised using a previously bespoke user-tested PIS designed for an earlier trial conducted in a similar aged population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this process, the control PIS text was shortened and divided into seven sections, a contents list included and bullet points added to clarify what the participant should do if he/she wished to take part. A green colour scheme was used to match the trial logo. The PIS was reviewed and revised further by two other experienced researchers. The Public and Patient Involvement (PPI) group reviewed this PIS and gave feedback about its readability, layout, font size and content; however, no graphic design input or formal user testing was undertaken. The revised version was printed on one sheet of double-sided A3 paper and folded to form a booklet.

Previous studies investigating the method of delivering paper-based information to patients have found that reducing the length of the PIS or supplementing the PIS with a booklet on clinical trials has little or no impact on trial recruitment, but that the use of a professionally designed information pack may be effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Alternative strategies could be evaluated in future embedded trials. Bower et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] have identified three areas which merit further investigation. These include training site staff, communication with patients and incentives. The key finding of this study is that the use of enhanced PISs did not significantly increase recruitment or retention. The overall recruitment rate to the REFORM trial (2.8%) and the REFORM cohort (6.3%) was low, so it may be that there was insufficient power to detect a difference. The MRC START group will undertake a meta-analysis of six embedded trials evaluating enhanced information sheets which will have more power to provide evidence of effectiveness. Small differences in recruitment rates could make a large difference to trials similar to REFORM, which required a sample size of nearly 900 participants. For example, a 3% uptake would require 30,000 invitations, but if uptake to the study increased to 4%, then 7500 fewer recruitment packs would be required, saving up to &#x000a3;35,000 in packing and postage costs alone. This would be a significant saving, even after incorporating the cost of professional graphic design and bespoke user testing. In this study, there were no statistically significant differences between the bespoke user-tested and template-developed information sheets, so it may be beneficial to develop a bank of template information sheets rather than each trial having to take account of the additional time and expense of professional user testing. Alternatively, since many trials include PPI, a more structured approach to reviewing and developing the information sheet could be evaluated and then, if effective, adopted within PPI groups.</p><p>One reason why there may have been little evidence of a difference is that the &#x02018;standard&#x02019; PIS has been developed by experienced researchers, and consequently it may be difficult to achieve a significantly improved information sheet. It could also be that the optimised PISs increased the interpretably and clarity of the provided information, which deterred some patients from responding. Unlike the other host trials in the START programme, REFORM used a cohort randomised controlled trial design. Participants were recruited first to the observational cohort, and then eligible participants were randomised to the REFORM trial. Therefore, optimised PISs were more likely to have an effect on recruitment to the observational cohort than randomisation into the REFORM trial. As there was a lack of effect on recruitment to the observational cohort, it was unlikely that there would be an impact on recruitment or retention in the trial.</p><p>There are some potential limitations to this study. First, the results of this study are applicable only to those participants over the age of 65&#x000a0;years attending routine podiatry clinics. Further studies should substantiate the study results in other populations. Second, due to the nature of the intervention, it was not possible to blind administrative staff who mailed out the recruitment packs, but it is unlikely that allocation subversion could have taken place. Whilst participants were aware of which PIS they received, they were unaware that an embedded trial was being conducted and that recruitment to the REFORM study was being monitored. Finally, it was not possible to evaluate whether the enhanced information sheets affected the speed of recruitment, as podiatry clinics were limited to the number of participants they could see at any one time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Optimised participant information sheets are one of a number of recruitment interventions amenable to testing through embedded trial methodology. Whilst the results of this study suggest limited benefits to enhancing patient information sheets, the findings add to the body of evidence around the effectiveness of recruitment strategies and may potentially help save time and money in future trials. The results of this study and the other embedded studies for the MRC START programme are to be incorporated into a meta-analysis which will provide more robust evidence as to the effectiveness of these types of recruitment strategies.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Guidelines for reporting embedded recruitment trials</title><p>The guidelines are obtained from the following source: Vichithranie W.
