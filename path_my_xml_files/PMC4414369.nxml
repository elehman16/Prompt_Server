Although over 70% of smokers want to quit, fewer than 5% achieve this annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Behavioral treatments teach individuals strategies to avoid smoking triggers, or to foster positive affective states, reduce negative mood, reduce stress by exercise or relaxation, divert attention from cravings, substitute other activities for smoking, or to develop social support mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These approaches have only modest success, with 6&#x02013;12 month abstinence rates of 20-30% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Their limited success may be due to the fact that smoking triggers are always present, making avoidance difficult; diversion of attention requires cognitive resources which are often depleted after strong affective states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]; and effective substitutions are not always readily available.</p><p>Recent work suggests that mindfulness training may be an effective behavioral treatment for smoking by targeting stress, craving and learned responses. Mindfulness training has been adapted as a central component of some contemporary psychotherapy and has shown some efficacy in the treatment of psychiatric disorders relating to or involving pain, anxiety, and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Mindfulness has been operationalized into two components: (i) maintaining attention on immediate experience and (ii) maintaining an attitude of acceptance toward that experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Mindfulness training typically involves the training of attention regulation, body awareness, and emotion regulation, among other components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In this way, mindfulness training may aid in smoking cessation by teaching individuals to pay attention to and work mindfully with affective states and craving as they arise, rather than to react by smoking.</p><p>Preliminary evidence supports testing mindfulness training in the treatment of substance-use disorders and other addictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A recent review found that mindfulness-based interventions were associated with reduced consumption of substances of misuse including alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes, and opiates, as compared to several active and inactive control groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, several studies included in the review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] report that mindfulness training was associated with reduced craving and increased mindfulness, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to outcomes. Although several limitations of prior studies were identified such as small sample sizes and lack of methodological details, findings overall suggest that mindfulness training may be an effective treatment for addictions. A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) reported preliminary evidence that mindfulness training was associated with increased smoking cessation rates as compared to another leading, widely disseminated and validated smoking cessation treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In that trial, home mindfulness practice was also found to reduce the association between craving and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Despite these promising findings, in-person mindfulness training is challenged by the need for experienced therapists, significant demands on time, limited access to and high costs of in-person treatment delivery, and other limitations. One way to overcome these challenges is to offer mobile mindfulness training delivered by smartphone. The global use of smartphones is growing, for example nearly half of U.S. adults (age 18+, 45%) and two-thirds of young adults (age 18&#x02013;29, 66%) now use smartphones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] (young adults also have the highest smoking rates in the U.S. (32-35%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]). Smartphone app-based treatments for addictions are also gaining popularity due to relative low cost, ease of use, and availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This suggests the demand for and utility of a mindfulness training smartphone app for smoking cessation. In addition to improving treatment dissemination, this approach can be standardized compared to in-person training; may reduce stigma associated with seeking treatment for substance use; improves tracking of adherence such as to home meditation practice, as compared to self-report; offers direct access to tools for self-management and social support; and gets treatment into the hand of the individual in context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Beginning work has evaluated the efficacy of smartphone-based treatments for smoking. A recent pilot trial compared SmartQuit, an app teaching acceptance and commitment therapy, which uses mindfulness strategies, to the National Cancer Institute's QuitGuide app for smoking cessation, and found higher engagement and promising quit rates for SmartQuit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore in this study we translate a mindfulness training program that has shown preliminary efficacy for smoking cessation into a smartphone app.</p><p>The smartphone app is also embedded with experience sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] to query individuals about their behavior and experience in real time to measure psychological mechanisms of change <italic>in vivo</italic>. By sampling behavior and experience in real time, it is possible to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and document change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Tracking cigarette use in real time also avoids known biases in retrospective reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Experience sampling has been used successfully across disciplines including mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and will be utilized here to evaluate smoking, craving, mood, and mindfulness.</p><p>This trial is innovative by: (i) mobile mindfulness training merges a new treatment for smoking &#x02013;mindfulness training &#x02013;with a novel delivery method &#x02013;smartphone app; (ii) mobile mindfulness training can potentially improve efficacy by bringing mindfulness into real-world contexts; (iii) experience sampling will capture real time, real-world smoking, craving, mood, and mindfulness, by smartphone app, whereas prior studies were limited to text messaging or web-based tools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]; and (iv) a novel comparison group, experience sampling-only, will be used to disentangle the efficacy of mindfulness training from that of effective self-monitoring.</p><p>The primary aim is to evaluate the efficacy of mobile mindfulness training plus experience sampling to improve smoking cessation rates at 6-months follow-up as compared to experience sampling-only. It is hypothesized that mobile mindfulness training will contribute to a significantly higher smoking cessation rate at 6-months follow-up as compared to control. The secondary aim is to test the hypothesis that mobile mindfulness training moderates the decoupling of craving and smoking. It is hypothesized that mobile mindfulness training will moderate the change in the prediction of smoking by craving across study time points. It is also hypothesized that meditation practice during treatment will moderate this change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A pragmatic RCT funded by the American Heart Association will be conducted. Participants will be allocated to either the control (experience sampling-only) or intervention (mobile mindfulness training plus experience sampling) group by basic randomization, using Yale Qualtrics Survey Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.qualtrics.com/">http://www.qualtrics.com/</ext-link>).

The study website links to a short screening survey. The survey notifies an individual if they are eligible or not eligible. If eligible, they are asked for their contact information and directed to an online consent form, which includes study contact information to ask questions. Those who provide consent are sent an email with a link to the baseline survey and a copy of the consent form. This email also includes a recommendation for nicotine replacement therapy or other pharmacotherapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. At the end of the baseline survey, participants are randomized to treatment group and emailed a link to download their app and begin the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Retention strategies</title><p>Treatment retention will be defined as completing 75% of mobile mindfulness training modules. Retention rates will be ensured by: (i) emphasizing the importance of follow-up at study initiation and through follow-up; (ii) requesting three referrals at study initiation who can update a participants&#x02019; contact information; (iii) paying $10 for the end of treatment survey, $20 each for surveys at 3- and 6-months follow-up, and $0.50 per experience sampling "check-in" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; and (iv) paying for participation (up to $116 total) at 6-months follow-up. All randomized participants will be followed up and their true smoking status used in the analysis, and follow-up will be collected blind to group allocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p>The sample size was determined based on the prior study of in-person mindfulness training for smoking cessation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Cell size was determined by a <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> power analysis using one-week point prevalence abstinence at end of treatment and at 4-months follow-up from that study. Point prevalence abstinence differed between groups by 20% or more at each time point. Thus it is estimated that group sizes of 59 per group will achieve 80% power to detect a 20% group difference at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;.05 using a two-sided <italic>Z</italic>-test with pooled variance. 140 subjects will be recruited to allow for 12-15% attrition. Further, a sample size of 33 was sufficient to detect a significant prediction of smoking by craving at baseline and significant effects of meditation on smoking at end of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], therefore these group sizes will be sufficient to detect similar changes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Intervention and comparator</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Intervention group</title><p>The intervention group will receive a smartphone app, Craving to Quit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cravingtoquit.com/">www.cravingtoquit.com</ext-link>) which delivers mindfulness training and experience sampling daily for 22 days. An introductory email will explain that the app will help participants self-monitor their smoking habits, recognize when and how often they smoke, identify triggers for smoking, and learn methods to become more mindful of cravings and &#x02018;ride them out&#x02019;. Upon downloading the app, participants will input the number of cigarettes smoked per day and set a quit date of 3 weeks from today. They will view a tutorial explaining the app features and begin the first day.</p><p>Mobile mindfulness training is comprised of 22 modules, 5&#x02013;15 minutes each, designed to teach mindfulness for smoking cessation using audio, video, animations, and <italic>in vivo</italic> exercises (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Participants have access to only one new module per day; subsequent days are locked to prevent skipping ahead. Four bonus modules become available across the study to bolster training. Overall the concept of mindfulness &#x02013;paying attention to and accepting momentary experience &#x02013;will be taught. Participants will learn three standard meditation practices: body scan, loving kindness, and breath awareness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Body scan is practiced by bringing awareness to different parts of the body, and is considered to foster awareness of body sensations that constitute cravings and affective states. Loving kindness is practiced by directed well-wishing by repeating phrases such as "may X be happy,&#x0201d; and is considered to foster acceptance of oneself and others. Breath awareness is practiced by paying attention to the breath wherever one feels it most strongly in the body, and is considered to help retrain the mind away from habitually engaging in self-related thinking toward a more present-centered awareness.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

VAS from not at all to extremely, for each: relaxed, anxious, joyful, tired, content, sad, excited, irritable. (8) The tracker says you have smoked (#) cigarettes today. Adjust your tracker below if needed. Today I have smoked: (#). Participants will be sent a reminder text message if their response rate drops below 3 check-ins in 24 hours. Any day with less than 3 completed check-ins will be excluded from the analysis. Based on prior studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] a response rate of 80% is expected.</p><p>Upon completion of the 22-day program, participants will receive an email of congratulations, reminding them that they will be paid for the check-ins they completed across the program 6-months from when they started the study, and that they will receive the next survey 1-month from when they started the study (the dates will be provided as a reminder). Links to the online follow-up surveys will be emailed to participants at 1-, 3-, and 6-months. At 6-months follow-up, participants who report one-week abstinence from smoking will take part in carbon monoxide (CO) monitoring. CO levels will be measured using piCO+ Smokerlyzer breath CO-monitors (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bedfont.com/">www.bedfont.com</ext-link>). CO-monitors will be shipped to participants with usage instructions, and they will set up a recorded, smartphone-based video call with a researcher, during which they will use the CO-monitor and show the output to the researcher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. They will be provided a paid shipping return label and will be asked to return the CO-monitor in its original packaging. Once a participant has completed the 6-months follow-up survey and returned the CO-monitor (if applicable), they will be emailed an Amazon (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.amazon.com">www.amazon.com</ext-link>) gift card with their study payment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Control group</title><p>The control group will receive experience sampling-only, to control for: (i) expectancy effects of treatment for smoking; (ii) non-specific effects of using a smartphone for smoking cessation; and (iii) potential effects of experience sampling for smoking cessation. Experience sampling may bring awareness to craving and smoking, and is similar to other interventions that teach individuals to identify triggers and track the number of cigarettes they smoke. Experience sampling-only will be delivered by smartphone app for 22 days. An introductory email will explain that the app will help individuals self-monitor their smoking habits, recognize when and how often the smoke, and identify triggers for smoking. Upon downloading the app, participants will input the number of cigarettes smoked per day and set a quit date of 3 weeks from today. They will view a tutorial explaining the app features and begin the first day. Across treatment, experience sampling procedures will be matched to the intervention group. From day 22, all study procedures will be matched to the intervention group. In addition, along with study payment at 6-months, this group will receive a free download code for the treatment app.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Measurements</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>The primary outcome is one-week point-prevalence abstinence from tobacco smoking at 6-months, verified by carbon monoxide monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] with the interviewers blinded to treatment allocation.

Although many meditation-related smartphone apps are available, very few have been tested for use in clinical groups such as smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, there are currently few smoking cessation interventions that target the association between craving and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In-person mindfulness training has been found to improve smoking cessation rates and decrease the association between craving and smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, this trial will test whether mobile mindfulness training is associated with similar outcomes.</p><p>The choice of a control group for this trial was critical for isolating and testing variables of interest, by comparing mobile mindfulness training to experience sampling-only. Alternative comparators could be in-person mindfulness training, an online smoking cessation program, waitlist control, or another smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention. However, there is limited evidence for the efficacy of existing smartphone apps for smoking cessation, and other apps offer additional features not available in the tested intervention that introduce confounds, or vice versa. Experience sampling may bring awareness to smoking, craving, and mood, similar to mindfulness training, therefore experience sampling-only was chosen as the control, to disentangle the effects of mindfulness training from those of effective self-monitoring. Exploratory analyses will test whether experience sampling-only also leads to mindfulness, and whether increases in mindfulness are associated with smoking cessation.</p><p>If the intervention is found to be effective, this RCT will provide a platform for large-scale clinical trials to compare mobile mindfulness training to active behavioral treatments for smoking cessation, and to disseminate this treatment to the wider community.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>Judson A.
