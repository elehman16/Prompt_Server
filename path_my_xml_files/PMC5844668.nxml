however, a majority of patients lack psychological support during this critical period. Internet interventions help patients overcome many barriers to seeking face-to-face support and may thus close this gap. We assessed feasibility and efficacy of Web-based stress management (STREAM [Stress-Aktiv-Mindern]) for newly diagnosed patients with cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and Methods</title><p>In a randomized controlled trial, patients with cancer who had started first-line treatment within the previous 12 weeks were randomly assigned to a therapist-guided Web-based intervention or a wait-list (control), stratified according to distress level (&#x02265; 5 <italic>v</italic> &#x0003c; 5 on scale of 0 to 10). Primary efficacy end point was quality of life after the intervention (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy&#x02013;Fatigue). Secondary end points included distress (Distress Thermometer) and anxiety or depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Treatment effect was assessed with analyses of covariance, adjusted for baseline distress.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 222 of 229 screened patients applied online for participation. Between September 2014 and November 2016, 129 newly diagnosed patients with cancer, including 92 women treated for breast cancer, were randomly assigned to the intervention (n = 65) or control (n = 64) group. Adherence was good, with 80.0% of patients using &#x02265; six of eight modules. Psychologists spent 13.3 minutes per week (interquartile range, 9.5-17.9 minutes per week) per patient for online guidance. After the intervention, quality of life was significantly higher (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy&#x02013;Fatigue: mean, 8.59 points; 95% CI, 2.45 to 14.73 points; <italic>P</italic> = .007) and distress significantly lower (Distress Thermometer: mean, &#x02212;0.85; 95% CI, &#x02212;1.60 to &#x02212;0.10; <italic>P</italic> = .03) in the intervention group as compared with the control.

At least 70% of patients with cancer use the Internet as a source of information shortly after diagnosis,<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> making it a powerful platform for reaching these patients. Recent approaches to integrating the Internet into patient care range from patient forums to information sites and even therapeutic games.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Internet programs based on cognitive behavioral techniques with patient guidance via regular online contact with a health care professional (ie, therapist-guided programs or guided self-help) have emerged as particularly effective options. For a range of psychological disorders, including anxiety disorders and depression in those without cancer,<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> therapist-guided online interventions seem similarly effective as face-to-face interventions.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The success of Web-based guided self-help in psychological disorders<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> coupled with the need to further improve access to psychosocial support for patients with cancer, especially outside of inner cities with large cancer centers,<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> has boosted interest in online interventions in oncology. Numerous piloted and ongoing trials in patients with cancer seek to define suitable indications, formats, and settings.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The few larger published randomized controlled trials<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> show encouraging results, with improvement in a number of relevant psychosocial domains, including coping with cancer,<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> sexual functioning,<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and distress<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> in breast cancer survivors.</p><p>We designed the STREAM (Stress-Aktiv-Mindern) intervention specifically for the particularly vulnerable period immediately after first diagnosis of cancer.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> The rationale behind this early intervention was three-fold. First, distress in patients with cancer peaks shortly after diagnosis,<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> irrespective of cancer type. Second, the time after diagnosis is busy with appointments for diagnostics and treatment. Therefore, the self-management of time and location allowed by Web-based interventions<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> might be of particular value. Third, successful early psychosocial interventions have shown potential to affect disease course beyond psychosocial outcomes.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> We assessed feasibility and efficacy of our therapist-guided Web-based stress management program STREAM for newly diagnosed patients with cancer receiving first-line treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>Details are provided in the Appendix (online only) and the published protocol.<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> We included adult patients (age &#x02265; 18 years) with newly diagnosed cancer who started first-line treatment (either systemic treatment, including chemotherapy, hormonal treatment, or targeted therapy, or radiotherapy) no longer than 12 weeks before study registration. Patients were required to provide written informed consent, read and write in German, and have Internet access as well as basic computer skills. The ethics committee approved the study (EKNZ339/13).

In an ITT analysis (n = 64), quality of life increased significantly (FACIT-F T2 to T3: mean, 10.95; 95% CI, 6.18 to 15.71; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) and distress decreased significantly (DT T2 to T3: mean, &#x02212;1.25; 95% CI, &#x02212;1.95 to &#x02212;0.55; <italic>P</italic> = .001) between T2 and T3. Self-reported anxiety and depression were also lower (HADS T2 to T3: mean, &#x02212;2.83; 95% CI, &#x02212;4.29 to &#x02212;1.36; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Again, results were confirmed in the prespecified sensitivity analyses (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="TA.3">Table A3</xref>, online only). Data for individual patients and group means are shown in Appendix <xref ref-type="fig" rid="FA.1">Figure A1</xref> (online only).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s10"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this randomized controlled trial, newly diagnosed patients with cancer reported significantly better quality of life and lower distress on the DT after participating in the therapist-guided Web-based stress management program STREAM. Recruitment to the STREAM study via online channels was successful, and patients in three countries, corresponding to a geographic area twice as large as the United Kingdom, were reached. Thus, dissemination of psychosocial interventions beyond urban centers, where face-to-face psychosocial interventions are available,<sup><xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> can be facilitated by a Web-based approach. The STREAM intervention was feasible in our population of patients during a period of active treatment of different types of cancer with good adherence; 80% of patients worked with at least six of the eight modules.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Although it is indisputable that quality of life matters, it is also inherently difficult to measure.<sup><xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> To ensure robust and clinically relevant data, we rely on well-validated and standardized questionnaires.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> There is no clear cutoff for clinically meaningful increases in overall quality of life in the FACIT-F score. However, on the basis of previous studies, changes reported in the postintervention scores of this trial were in a range that is considered highly noticeable to patients.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Quality-of-life analyses are often complicated by a large number of missing data. In our study, the low number of missing data (90.7% of all randomly assigned patients completed the primary assessment at T2) and robustness of the sensitivity analyses (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="TA.2">Tables A2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="TA.3">A3</xref>), increase reliability of patient-reported outcomes.</p><p>Although the primary efficacy end point of better quality of life after the STREAM intervention was clearly met, the effect of the intervention on distress is less clear cut. The DT is an assessment tool that allows patients to summarize all subjective aspects of distress in a single number (VAS, 0 to 10). In its simplicity, the DT therefore has the advantage of covering various dimensions of distress, including physical, functional, social, socioeconomic, spiritual, and emotional distress.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> However, the weight that patients assign, whether consciously or not, to each dimension is not discernible from the DT score. In contrast, the HADS questionnaire covers exclusively the emotional dimension of distress, but it does so in greater depth.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Whereas self-reported distress on the DT was lower after STREAM, with a small to medium effect size<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> (&#x003b7;<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.043 and 0.069 in the ITT and PP populations, respectively), emotional distress as assessed by HADS did not change. This leads to the hypothesis that STREAM primarily affects dimensions of distress other than anxiety or depression. Of note, in our population, HADS scores at baseline were rather low (mean, 12; IQR, 7-17), whereas baseline DT scores were high (mean, 6; IQR, 5-8). It is therefore conceivable that a potential impact of STREAM on the emotional dimension of distress (anxiety and depression) cannot be assessed conclusively in our population. A study tailored specifically toward patients with high baseline levels of anxiety or depression would be more appropriate to answer this specific question.</p><p>Although STREAM was designed for and open to all newly diagnosed patients with cancer, women with breast cancer undergoing curative treatment represented the vast majority of the study population. This leaves uncertainty regarding generalizability of the results, particularly toward men and toward the palliative setting. Women with breast cancer are known to have the largest social media network in the cancer community, which likely allowed for effective online recruitment. The presence of other cancer groups in the Internet community is only emerging, with platforms such as that created by the Movember Foundation for men with cancer.<sup><xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Such platforms may allow for integrating more men into future studies. If targeted specifically, men with prostate cancer also seem to be reachable via the Internet, as shown by an Australian self-help online program, which integrated a patient forum called My Road Ahead.<sup><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>At baseline, before random assignment, more patients in the control group reported face-to-face psychological support and use of psychotropic drugs than in the intervention group, although the number was not statistically significant. Data on the amount of time spent face to face with local psychologists during the course of the trial were not collected; hence, potential bias cannot be quantified. In contrast, attention bias toward the intervention group, possibly introduced by the time our STREAM psychologists spent online with the patients, may have affected outcome inversely. Because we opted for a care-as-usual (ie, wait-list) rather than active control, this will need to be differentiated in future studies.</p><p>A wait-list controlled design is generally accepted to control for the effect of time on the outcome of interest. However, the duration of the wait and consequently the timing of assessments (T2) for the control group are prospectively defined and rigid, whereas the timing of assessments (T2) in the interventions group is dependent on the duration of the intervention and therefore more variable. Hence, time sensitivity is only partially accounted for. This is also true for our study, where median time between T1 and T2 was 9.4 weeks (IQR, 8.6-12.1 weeks) for the intervention group but was shorter in the control group (median, 8.7 weeks; IQR, 8.3-9.3 weeks). Dynamic wait-list controlled designs have been proposed to minimize this potential bias.<sup><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup></p><p>Another shortcoming of our trial is that we only show a benefit in distress and quality of life for patients early after diagnosis, with a limited follow-up. It is conceivable, however, that such an early intervention<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> may be of particular importance to prevent chronification of distress.<sup><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> Whether lower distress and increased quality of life after STREAM translate into better treatment tolerance and favorable disease course warrants additional studies.</p><p>The unique and common feature of study participants in this trial was a recent diagnosis of cancer. In contrast, the few reported randomized controlled trials on online support for patients with cancer have mainly focused on cancer survivors (ie, interventions later in the disease trajectory). In a randomized, wait-list controlled trial, breast cancer survivors (on average, 3 years after initial diagnosis) who participated in an online program in a similar therapist-guided format as presented here reported significantly improved sexual functioning (the primary end point of the trial) as compared with the wait-list control group.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Breast cancer survivors were also the target population in the randomized trial for the Coping With Cancer Workbook.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Women who participated in this Web-based self-help program reported better self-efficacy in coping with cancer. Overall quality of life was not reported. The BREATH (Breast Cancer eHealth) intervention,<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> a Web-based intervention based on cognitive behavioral techniques but without therapist guidance, led to reduced distress in breast cancer survivors; however, it was not sustained during the 10-month follow-up.</p><p>In conclusion, with digital natives approaching an age that places them at risk for developing age-associated diseases, including cancer, use of the Internet in the health care setting will likely further increase. In this randomized trial, we found that a Web-based, guided self-help intervention resulted in a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life. Our results indicate that Web-based, guided self-help has potential to efficiently support newly diagnosed patients with cancer.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1" fn-type="supported-by"><p>Supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (Grant No. SNSF PP00P3_139155/1) and Cancer Research Switzerland (Grant No. KFS-3260-08-2013).</p></fn><fn id="fn2" fn-type="presented-at"><p>Presented in part as a late-breaking abstract at the 53rd Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, Chicago, IL, June 2-6, 2017.</p></fn><fn id="fn3" fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial information: NCT02289014.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>We thank the software company YooApplication AG, Basel, Switzerland, for its collaboration in development and maintenance of the STREAM application.

Patients were required to provide written informed consent, read and write in German, have Internet access, and have basic computer skills. To obtain informed consent, a therapist provided detailed information about the study via telephone and went point by point through the informed consent form. The informed consent form was then sent to the patient, who, if in agreement, sent the signed paper form back via post mail. The Ethics Committee of Northwestern and Central Switzerland approved the study (EKNZ 339/13).

To foster recruitment, we linked and distributed information about the trial via the following channels: links from health-related Web sites, such as cancer leagues, cancer hospitals, and patient advocate Web sites to the public Web site of STREAM; distribution of flyers in hospitals and during cancer conferences; communication to medical lay press; and paid advertisement via Google and Facebook.</p></sec><sec id="s34"><title>Study Design</title><p>We randomly assigned eligible patients at a ratio of one to one using blocked randomization with randomly selected block sizes to an intervention group or a wait-list control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig 1</xref>). Patients were stratified according to baseline distress, using an internationally accepted cutoff of &#x02265; 5 points on the 10-point visual analog scale of the Distress Thermometer.<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s35"><title>Intervention</title><p>We developed the Web-based intervention STREAM<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> based on established stress management intervention manuals<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> that incorporate cognitive behavioral&#x02013; and mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques, which we adapted to the Web context. STREAM aims at improving intra- and interpersonal coping strategies, thereby reducing perceived stress, anxiety, and fatigue as well as enhancing quality of life. STREAM consists of eight modules (Appendix <xref ref-type="table" rid="TA.1">Table A1</xref>), which can be completed in 60 to 90 minutes each. Each module starts with a short mindfulness breathing exercise followed by text-based psychoeducation, reflection on current individual emotional status, and acquisition of coping strategies including several exercises and worksheets. Daily use of downloadable audio files with relaxation and guided-imagery exercises was encouraged. Participants were asked to complete one module per week. Access to the next module was provided after the weekly online feedback of a therapist. Patients who had to interrupt the program for medical or personal reasons were regularly contacted and offered continuation. The total duration of the program was not limited. Therapists monitored participants&#x02019; progress in the program and contacted the participants via an integrated and secured e-mail system to provide feedback and structure. Patients could use the integrated e-mail system to contact their therapist whenever they felt the need to and were informed that the therapist would answer within 3 working days. Whenever patients did not log in to the program for 7 days, therapists sent an e-mail reminder.</p><p>Therapists were four female psychologists with Master&#x02019;s degrees in clinical psychology and clinical experience in psycho-oncology. Three of them were in postgraduate psychotherapy training programs, and one was a licensed psychotherapist (C.U.). This core team was supported by seven psychologists with Bachelor&#x02019;s degrees in psychology, who worked under supervision of the licensed psychotherapist. All therapists were trained by the psychological study team leaders (A.G., C.U.) in applying the STREAM program and met for weekly discussions, with input by a medical oncologist (V.H.), to align procedures and strategies.

For patients in both groups, cancer treatment was determined locally, and supportive care, according to local standards, may also have included face-to-face psychosocial support and psychotropic drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s37"><title>Assessments</title><p>Assessments were conducted electronically directly within the Web-based program via the open source application LimeSurvey at baseline (T1) and after the intervention or waiting period (control group), respectively (T2). In addition, 2-month follow-up (T3) was performed in both groups. Feasibility was assessed at two different levels: feasibility of online recruitment and feasibility for patients to participate in the STREAM program while undergoing first-line treatment. According to the study protocol, feasibility of online recruitment was confirmed when 120 patients (ie, the number needed to assess the primary efficacy outcome) were recruited within a 2-year period; feasibility of participation during treatment was prespecified as a descriptive end point&#x02014;more specifically, the percentage of completers&#x02019; in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, where completers&#x02019; were defined as patients who worked with at least six of eight modules.</p></sec><sec id="s38"><title>Efficacy End Points</title><p>Primary end point was quality of life at T2, assessed in the validated German version of the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy&#x02013;Fatigue (FACIT-F) questionnaire.<sup><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> The first 27 items are common to all Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires and cover different domains of quality of life, specifically physical well-being (seven items), social well-being (seven items), emotional well-being (six items), and functional well-being (seven items).
