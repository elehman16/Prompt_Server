One reason for this may be suboptimal program implementation. This study aimed to identify perceived barriers and enablers of the implementation of the 6-PACK falls prevention program to inform the implementation in a randomised controlled trial. Strategies to optimise successful implementation of 6-PACK were also sought. A mixed-methods approach was applied in 24 acute wards from 6 Australian hospitals. Participants were nurses working on participating wards and senior hospital staff including Nurse Unit Managers; senior physicians; Directors of Nursing; and senior personnel involved in quality and safety or falls prevention. Information on barriers and enablers of 6-PACK implementation was obtained through surveys, focus groups and interviews. Questions reflected the COM-B framework that includes three behaviour change constructs of: <italic>capability</italic>, <italic>opportunity</italic> and <italic>motivation</italic>. Focus group and interview data were analysed thematically, and survey data descriptively. The survey response rate was 60% (420/702), and 12 focus groups (n = 96 nurses) and 24 interviews with senior staff were conducted. Capability barriers included beliefs that falls could not be prevented; and limited knowledge on falls prevention in patients with complex care needs (e.g. cognitive impairment). Capability enablers included education and training, particularly face to face case study based approaches. Lack of resources was identified as an opportunity barrier. Leadership, champions and using data to drive practice change were recognised as opportunity enablers. Motivation barriers included complacency and lack of ownership in falls prevention efforts. Motivation enablers included senior staff articulating clear goals and a commitment to falls prevention; and use of reminders, audits and feedback. The information gained from this study suggests that regular practical face-to-face education and training for nurses; provision of equipment; audit, reminders and feedback; leadership and champions; and the provision of falls data is key to successful falls prevention program implementation in acute hospitals.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1007627</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barker</surname><given-names>Anna L.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC), Australia (APP1007627).

More than 240,000 in-hospital falls occur each year in England and Wales with falls being the most commonly reported safety incident in National Health Service hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0171932.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Falls prevention programs for hospitalised older people are multifaceted, reflective of the complex causal pathway for falls. With increased complexity comes increased risk of implementation failure. Implementation of falls prevention programs can be influenced by several factors including environmental and contextual issues; staff knowledge, beliefs and attitudes; organisational culture and climate; staff workloads; and access to appropriate equipment and resources [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. An understanding of these factors can inform the development of an implementation plan that addresses the barriers and enablers to the implementation of the intervention.</p><p>There is limited information about the barriers and enablers to the implementation of falls prevention in acute hospitals. Two survey based studies implemented across five acute care hospitals in Singapore showed that nurses perceived the greatest barriers to implementation of fall prevention practices to be: staff and patient education; lack of motivation in staff; availability of support staff; and access to facilities and equipment [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These barriers were also reported in a recent Cochrane review of 11 RCTs [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other barriers reported in the review included: leadership support at the organisational and unit level; engagement of front-line staff in program design; pilot-testing to identify potential barriers to implementation; provision of data about falls; and changes in nihilistic staff attitudes about falls prevention were associated with successful implementation of inpatient falls prevention programs in hospitals [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Tailoring the implementation of falls prevention programs to the local context optimises implementation. The 6-PACK falls prevention program is nurse-led (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pone.0171932.box001">Box 1</xref>) and was developed as part of continuous quality improvement activities at an Australian acute hospital. An evaluation reported that fall-related injuries appeared to reduce following the implementation of the program [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This led to a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) to further establish the efficacy of the 6-PACK program [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0171932.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Whilst 6-PACK intervention components are required to remain fixed in an RCT, the implementation of the program was tailored to the local context of the intervention wards to ensure implementation was optimised.</p><boxed-text id="pone.0171932.box001" position="float" orientation="portrait"><sec id="sec002"><title>Box 1.

Specifically we sought to identify physical and psychological factors (capability); environmental and social contexts (opportunity); and reflective and autonomic processes (motivation) that are perceived to be barriers or enablers of the successful implementation of the 6-PACK program. In addition, we sought to gain insights into what strategies could be applied to optimise successful implementation of the 6-PACK program in the RCT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec003"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec004"><title>Design</title><p>A multi-centre mixed methods study.

This was further complicated by a lack of tracking systems of where the beds are within a hospital.</p><disp-quote><p>We have about 12 low-low beds, which is not sufficient.

Leaders were identified by staff as playing a critical role in providing guidance and support to those less experienced, and to develop and promote standardised practices in terms of implementing falls prevention interventions. Nurses were either neutral (35%) or agreed (42%) that there was strong leadership support for falls on their ward and that their supervisors have assisted them when issues of falls have been raised (64%).

These included education and training to address skills, knowledge and beliefs of nurses and developing systems to encourage falls prevention practice such as audits, reminders and feedback, provision of equipment and facilitating a culture of falls prevention through leadership and champions. Previous studies have also reported the above enablers [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Unlike prior research, this study details differences between nurses and senior staff beliefs regarding falls prevention. Learnings from this study were used to develop an implementation plan for the RCT [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>The belief in the inevitability of falls is consistent with findings from other studies [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0171932.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Although survey results suggest nurses thought falls could be prevented, nurses in focus groups identified patient groups where they believed falls could not be prevented. There was disagreement between nurse and senior staff perspectives as to whether in-hospital falls could be prevented. Incongruity between nurses&#x02019; and senior staff perceptions of the inevitability of falls has implications for the success of a falls prevention program. If nurses do not believe falls can be prevented, it may be difficult to implement interventions that aim to prevent falls. Senior staff recommended that education and training was required to increase nurse confidence and knowledge in how to prevent falls and to utilise the resources provided effectively.</p><p>Education was identified as a strategy to improve capabilities. However, implementation did raise some practical challenges. While both senior staff and nurses valued face to face case studies, senior staff favoured e-learning due to convenience and efficiency. Carefully designed e-learning packages can be effective in disseminating best practice education and have the potential to reach less accessible night and casual staff [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, if a model of e-learning was adopted it would be important to ensure nurses have adequate access to computers and that these packages address aspects of falls prevention that are of greatest concern to nurses.</p><p>A motivator identified by senior staff was to harness the emotional impact of falls, for example through &#x02018;story telling&#x02019; of falls incidents at handover. Case studies with patient stories and experiences of falls may also prove powerful in highlighting the need to address in-hospital falls in education sessions. Communicating clearly the patient benefits of the 6-PACK program was also seen to be a strategy to enhance engagement by staff.</p><p>A challenge to motivation is complacency in falls prevention practice. The acute setting is a crowded landscape of patient safety initiatives that can compete for the attention and time of nurses. Previous research has described the phenomenon of &#x02018;missed care&#x02019; or &#x02018;unfinished care&#x02019; where nurses can find it difficult to achieve all their tasks in caring for a patient. This can lead to adverse patient events such as falls [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. To promote continuing engagement in strategies and to assist in care prioritisation, senior staff and nurses highlighted the importance of regular audits, reminders and feedback. Audits, reminders and feedback are generally an effective approach in guiding the implementation of an intervention [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Providing data to demonstrate the extent of the problem of falls on wards and to benchmark progress was another strategy identified by participants. Incident reporting has also been identified as a useful approach to change the attitudes, perceptions and practice of staff and promote engagement in patient safety initiatives [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>The majority of falls prevention programs are focused on nurses and nursing interventions with falls often considered a nursing sensitive patient outcome [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, a barrier to motivation identified is the lack of ownership for falls prevention. Senior staff stated that falls prevention should involve a multidisciplinary team approach and is everyone&#x02019;s responsibility. Conversely, a recent study in Australian hospitals reported that doctors perceived time limitations as a major barrier to their involvement in falls prevention and acknowledged that medical priorities were more important for them [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. While 6-PACK is a nurse led program, it does not discourage involvement of other clinicians. Indeed, nurses are a critical link between the patient and other care team members and often are responsible for communicating on progress and changes in patient status. This importance of the nurse role in multi-disciplinary management of falls should be communicated to staff in training.</p><p>The opportunity domain examined factors outside of the individual which enable or prompt falls prevention action. The key themes related to opportunity included lack of availability of resources, provision of falls data and leadership for falls prevention. The lack of availability of falls prevention equipment, such as low-low beds, has previously been described [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0171932.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Leadership is both an opportunity and motivation strategy and was recognised as important by both nurses and senior staff. NUMs and champions were identified as key individuals in the implementation and sustainability of falls prevention interventions. The need for leadership and champions has been reported as an important implementation strategy in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0171932.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0171932.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0171932.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations and future research</title><p>The 6-PACK program is a nurse delivered intervention and therefore the focus of this research was to seek the perspective of nursing staff. The perspectives of other health professionals (doctors, allied health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists) involved in direct patient care were not captured in this study. Further research to explore whether the barriers and enablers identified by nurses and senior staff are also identified by other hospital staff is required. The wards that participated in this study volunteered to take part in the 6-PACK RCT which may have introduced selection bias. This may have impacted on the results with participants being more likely to recognise the importance of falls prevention practice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study identified barriers and enablers to the implementation of the 6-PACK program corresponding to the constructs of capability, opportunity and motivation. Barriers identified included beliefs that falls could not be prevented; limited knowledge on falls prevention in patients with complex care needs (e.g. cognitive impairment); lack of resources; and lack of ownership in falls prevention efforts. Enablers included education and training, particularly face to face case study based approaches; improved leadership; using data to drive practice change; and use of reminders, audits and feedback. Successful falls prevention program implementation in acute hospital wards are likely to require a multifaceted, planned approach that includes: regular practical face-to-face education and training for nurses to modify skills and established beliefs; provision of equipment; audit, reminders and feedback; leadership and champions; and the provision of falls data.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171932.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>6-PACK programme to decrease fall injuries in acute hospitals: cluster randomised controlled trial (published article).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171932.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0171932.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Development of an implementation plan for the 6-PACK falls prevention programme as part of a randomised controlled trial: protocol for a series of preimplementation studies (published article).</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0171932.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge Jeannette Kamar and the Injury Prevention Unit, The Northern Hospital, Northern Health, Melbourne, Australia who developed the 6-PACK Program.
