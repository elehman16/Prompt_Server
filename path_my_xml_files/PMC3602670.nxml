Reducing house entry rates in endophagic vectors by obstructing openings is one simple way of achieving this. Mosquito netting has previously been shown to have this effect. More recently different materials that could also be used have come onto the market. Therefore, a pilot study was conducted to investigate the protective effect of three types of material against <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae s.l</italic> entry into village houses in Mozambique when applied over the large opening at the gables and both gables and eaves.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A two-step intervention was implemented in which the gable ends of houses (the largest opening) were covered with one of three materials (four year old mosquito bed nets; locally purchased untreated shade cloth or deltamethrin-impregnated shade cloth) followed by covering both gable ends and eaves with material. Four experimental rounds (each of three weeks duration), from four houses randomly assigned to be a control or to receive one of the three intervention materials, were undertaken from March to August 2010 in the village of Furvela in southern Mozambique. Mosquito entry rates were assessed by light-trap collection and the efficacy of the different materials was determined in terms of incidence rate ratio (IRR), obtained through a Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE), of mosquito entry in a treated house compared to the untreated (control) house.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Altogether 9,692 <italic>An. funestus</italic> and 1,670 <italic>An. gambiae s.l.</italic> were collected.

Improvements to houses were important in reducing malaria transmission in the early part of the last century [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Reducing mosquito entry rates into houses is a simple way of reducing transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and several methods to do this have been proposed, including building houses on stilts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], using screens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] or blocking the gap between the roof and walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>In many rural areas of Africa, houses are simple structures without windows. Hence, mosquitoes, attracted to odour and carbon dioxide, tend to enter such houses via the gap between the roof and the walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This gap, in addition to allowing access to mosquitoes, provides illumination and ventilation and closing the opening with a solid barrier, as recommended by Kirby <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], may not be acceptable in many cases. Airflow may also be increased through other openings if the larger openings are closed enabling mosquitoes to more easily find these secondary entry points.</p><p>An alternative system is to use semi-permeable barriers, such as mosquito netting, that allow air and light to enter the house but which prevent the mosquito from entering. Barriers have been shown to be effective in reducing malaria transmission in Burkina Faso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] but, with the exception of work in The Gambia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], despite the apparent advantages of such a technique, they have not been tested with much rigour elsewhere. Recently developed materials, such as UV-resistant polyethylene shade cloths for the protection of vegetables or vector control may be even more effective or better suited to cover house openings than mosquito netting. A pilot study was, therefore, conducted to determine if, when placed over the openings of houses in a village in southern Mozambique, different types of material of different permeability to airflow, affected mosquito entry rates as measured by light-trap collection. Since houses in this part of Mozambique have a large opening at the gable ends but smaller openings at their sides, the intervention was tested initially by closing only the large openings and subsequently closing all wall to roof openings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Description of study site</title><p>The study was conducted between 24 March 2010 to 30 August 2010 in the village of Furvela (24&#x000b0;43&#x02019;S, 35&#x000b0;18&#x02019;E) in Morrumbene District, Inhambane Province, Mozambique. The village has been described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It lies circa 2&#x02009;km from a mangrove-bordered coast to the west and is delineated by the Furvela river valley to the north. Both areas provide ample breeding sites for anopheline mosquitoes. A single rainy season occurs from October to March, when approximately 1,200&#x02009;mm of rain falls, mostly in February and March. Daily mean temperatures vary between 18&#x000b0;C in July and 30&#x000b0;C in December. The majority of inhabitants live in rectangular houses built of reed with palm leaf roofs. Most houses do not have windows and have just a single door. There is usually an opening of 15&#x02009;cm or more between the end gables and the roof. This provides ventilation, illumination and access for endophilic mosquitoes. The gap between the sides and the roof (the eaves) is smaller or non-existent. Malaria is endemic in the village. <italic>Anopheles funestus</italic> is the principal vector although <italic>Anopheles gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis</italic> and <italic>Anopheles merus</italic> also occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>The shade cloths</title><p>Three types of material that differed in their permeability to air were used in the experiment: 1) a deltamethrin-impregnated durable lining (henceforth Zero Vector cloth) manufactured by Vestergaard-Frandsen; 2) a locally purchased untreated-shade cloth used to protect growing vegetables (henceforth Maxixe cloth); and, 3) previously used Interceptor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> mosquito bed net (henceforth bed net). The Zero Vector cloth was made of fibres of polyethylene, weighing approximately 55&#x02009;g/sq m. The cloth provides 50% shading and was impregnated with deltamethrin at 4.4&#x02009;g/kg, incorporated into the yarn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The gap size between fibres was circa 1.5&#x02009;mm &#x000d7; 20&#x02009;mm (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). The weave of the Maxixe cloth, which was also made of polyethylene, was thicker than Zero Vector cloth and in addition to reducing airflow it reduced the amount of light coming into the house (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). The Interceptor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> bed net was 75 denier, white polyester treated with the insecticide FENDOZIN<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, a mixture of the insecticide alpha-cypermethrin with a binding polymer at a target dose of 6.7/kg or 200&#x02009;mg/m<sup>2</sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] (Figure&#x02009;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C).

The different fabrics were placed over the end of the opening of the cardboard tube and airflow reduction compared to the flow when no material was in place. For each fabric, airflow was recorded every five seconds over a five-minute period immediately in front and behind the cloth and mean velocities determined. Velocities were also measured between each replicate when no material was obstructing the opening of the funnel. The effect of the different materials on airflow was assessed as percentage reduction in flow. Air flow measurements were normally distributed (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05) therefore, two sample <italic>t</italic> tests were used to determine the significance of the difference between the mean air flow velocity before and after one the application of the material.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Experimental design</title><sec><title>House selection criteria</title><p>In each of the four experimental rounds four rectangular houses with walls built of reed and roofs of palm leaves, which are the most common form of house in Furvela, were chosen for the experiment.

Houses used in the experiments were a minimum of 200&#x02009;m from each other and at least two people slept in each house.</p></sec><sec><title>Application of shade cloth inside houses</title><p>Three of the four houses in each experimental round were randomly assigned to receive one of the interventions: A- Zero Vector; B- Maxixe cloth, or, C- Bed net whilst the fourth served as the control.

Houses do, however, have to be relatively well built in the first place and the door must fit securely since gaps around badly fitting doors can easily become entry points for hungry female mosquitoes even when the gables and eaves are covered. In the present experiment the effect of covering only the gable ends or the complete house differed between vectors. Covering the whole house improved the effect against <italic>An. gambiae</italic> but made no difference to the effect against <italic>An. funestus</italic>. There are two possible explanations for the enhanced effect against <italic>An. gambiae</italic>: either the two mosquitoes differ in the way that they enter houses, more <italic>An. gambiae</italic> going through openings in addition to the gables, or the effect had something to do with the insecticide on two of the three materials (Zero Vector and Bed net). The bed nets had been in use for four years and had been washed a number of times so it is not known how much insecticide remained on the material. Since the <italic>An. funestus</italic> in Furvela are resistant to the pyrethroids used on these materials and resist knockdown for more than 30&#x02009;minutes when exposed to fresh active ingredient (Charlwood and Kampango, unpublished data) the difference is likely to be due to differing house entry strategies between the two vectors. Unfortunately, the resistance status of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> is not known. The efficacy of the one material not impregnated with insecticide also implies that observed reductions were due to physical rather than chemical effects.</p><p>Notwithstanding the fact that this was only a pilot study, and for scientific exactitude a much larger randomized control trial would be useful, the results are sufficiently encouraging to suggest to villagers that covering the openings to their houses with netting or shade cloth is a good thing to do. As with bed nets the real problem (whether the material has insecticide or not) is how to get the intervention in widespread use. Although the intervention by itself may not significantly reduce transmission in a village such as Furvela, where inoculation rates are among the highest recorded (Charlwood<italic>,</italic> unpublished), it is an intervention well worth advocating. It is available, cheap and low-tech and, once in place, does not require further input from the householder. The use of old mosquito nets for this purpose would seem apposite since they are the most readily available material throughout much of the tropics and can be installed with a few nails or wire on a &#x02018;do it yourself&#x02019; basis. Their use would also solve the problem of what to do with old, no longer used, nets.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>AK did the fieldwork, analysed the data and helped write the paper.
