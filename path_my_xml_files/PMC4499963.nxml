complications. This study was designed to determine changes in cardiopulmonary functions
after aerobic and anaerobic exercise training in obese subjects. [Subjects and Methods]
Forty obese subjects, whose ages ranged between 18 and 25&#x02005;years, were divided into 2 equal
groups: group A received aerobic exercise training in addition to dietary measures, and
group B received anaerobic exercise training for 3 months in addition to dietary measures.
Measurements of systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, maximum
voluntary ventilation, maximal oxygen consumption, and body mass index were obtained for
both groups before and after the exercise program. [Results] The mean body mass index,
systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and maximal oxygen
consumption decreased significantly, whereas the mean maximum voluntary ventilation
increased significantly after treatment in group A. The mean maximum voluntary ventilation
also increased significantly after treatment in group B. There were significant
differences between the mean levels of the investigated parameters in groups A and B after
treatment. [Conclusion] Aerobic exercise reduces weight and improves cardiopulmonary
fitness in obese subjects better than anaerobic exercise.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Aerobic</kwd><kwd>Anaerobic</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Obesity is a leading threat to the health of children and adolescents. Genetic factors,
medical conditions, medications, and environmental factors are the most common causes of
childhood obesity, which is usually managed through a diet regimen, exercise, and surgical
treatment<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The prevalence of overweight and obese individuals is increasing at an alarming rate, and
obesity has become one of the most important avoidable and independent risk factors for
morbidity and mortality<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A successful weight management program must include dietary adjustments, increased physical
activity, and behavior modifications. Nutrition modification should take into account the
diet&#x02019;s energy content, composition, and suitability for individual patients<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The European standards for energy-restricted diets have been established, but leave little
flexibility for change. Three categories prevail: very low-calorie diets [450&#x02013;800&#x02005;kcal],
low-calorie diets [800&#x02013;1200&#x02005;kcal], and meal replacements [200&#x02013;400&#x02005;kcal]<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Obesity in children has been associated with lower levels of physical activity and fitness.
Research examining maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub> max) in obese and non-obese
children indicates a significant difference in exercise tolerance<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Physical activity and exercise are essential elements in
obesity treatment, and regular physical activity has also been shown to lessen the burden of
obesity-related comorbidities<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Physical activity, without a reduction in calorie intake, usually has no relevant effect on
weight. Although it is possible to lose weight through physical activity alone, the amount
of physical activity required for substantial weight loss is well beyond what is feasible
for most people in today&#x02019;s world. For instance, it would take more than 1&#x02013;2 hours of very
vigorous activity per day for children to achieve the desired weight loss<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine changes in cardiopulmonary functions after
aerobic and anaerobic exercise training in obese participants, with the aim to identify the
most appropriate types of exercise training programs for these individuals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty obese subjects, whose ages ranged from 18 to 25&#x02005;years, participated in this study.
Subjects suffering from any cardiovascular, pulmonary, orthopedic, or neurological disorders
were excluded from the study. Patients were divided into 2 equal groups: group A received
aerobic treadmill walking exercise training for 3 months, at a frequency of 3 sessions per
week, in addition to dietary measures. The second group, group B, received anaerobic
exercise training for 3 months, at a frequency of 3 sessions per week, in addition to
dietary measures. All participants were free to withdraw from the study at any time. In the
event of occurrence of any adverse effects, the experiment would have been discontinued, and
the Human Subjects Review Board was informed regarding this. However, no adverse effects
occurred, and data of all participants were available for analysis. This study was approved
by the ethics committee, and all participants gave their informed consent. This study was
conducted at the King Abdulaziz University Hospital in Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Cardiopulmonary exercise test unit (CPET): (Zan 800, Germany). The CPET consisted of a
breath gas (O<sub>2</sub> and CO<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) analyzer, an
electronic treadmill, a 12-channel electrocardiogram, (ECG) monitor, a gas bottle, and a
mask with a diaphragm to analyze gas, which was used to measure VO<sub>2</sub> max and
in-exercise training. The speed and inclination of the treadmill were controlled by
pre-selected software (standard Bruce protocol). The final test results were printed. This
unit was calibrated daily, as its speed, inclination, and timer are adjustable. It also
featured a control panel to display the exercise parameters.</p><p>Pulsometer (Tunturt TPM-400, Japan): This was used to detect pulse rate before, during, and
after exercise. A spirometer (Schiller-Spirovit Sp-10, Switzerland) was used to measure
maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV). A mercury sphygmomanometer (Diplomat, Presameter) and
stethoscope (Riester, duplex, Germany) were used to measure blood pressure before and after
exercise training sessions.</p><p>Before starting the study, each participant completed a consent form as an agreement to be
included in the present study. Additionally, before initiation of the exercise training
program, each subject was examined medically by a physician in order to exclude subjects
with any of the medical problems listed above in the exclusion criteria. A brief description
of the tasks expected during the test was provided to the subjects.</p><p>Before conducting the exercise tolerance test, all subjects were asked to visit the
laboratory to get familiar with the equipment for ensuring cooperation during the test. The
treadmill had front and side rails to aid subject stability. Each subject underwent a
continuous progressive exercise tolerance test to measure VO<sub>2</sub> max., in accordance
with the standard Bruce protocol, which consisted of a warm-up phase, 5 active phases, and a
recovery phase.</p><p>Measurements of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate
(HR), MVV, VO<sub>2</sub> max, and body mass index (BMI) were obtained for both groups
before and after the exercise program.</p><p>The aerobic treadmill-based training program (Zan 800, made in Germany) was started with a
5-minute warm-up phase performed on the treadmill at a low load. The active phase of the
training session was gradually increased from 20 to 30 minutes in the form of
walking/running on the electronic treadmill with zero inclination 3 times per week for 12
weeks, its intensity being increased gradually from 60% to 70% of the maximum HR (HRmax)
achieved in a reference, which was performed in accordance with a modified Bruce protocol.
This rate was defined as the training HR (THR). The session ended with a 5-minute recovery
and relaxation phase<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. The anaerobic
treadmill-based training program (Zan 800, made in Germany) was started with a 5-minute
warm-up phase performed on the treadmill at a low load. Initially, the active phase of the
training session was 2 minutes long, and this was gradually increased by 5 seconds in each
session until 3 minutes, followed by rest for 2 minutes; this was repeated 5 times during
each session in the form of running on the electronic treadmill, with a gradual increase
from 70% to 80% of the HRmax, according to a modified Bruce protocol. This rate was defined
as the THR. The session ended with a 5-minute recovery and relaxation phase. All patients
performed 3 weekly sessions. HRmax = 220&#x02212;age<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The interview-based food survey was administered to all patients by dieticians to identify
previous food habits and possible anomalies in dietary behavior. The prescribed low-calorie
diet was balanced, with 15% as protein, 30&#x02013;35% as fat, and 50&#x02013;55% as carbohydrates on
average, in order to provide all study participants with approximately 1,000 calories daily
for 2 months.</p><p>The prescribed diet included breakfast consisting of 2 boiled eggs (80 calories), 50&#x02005;g
cheese (100 calories), and 1 slice of bread (105 calories); and lunch consisting of 2 pieces
(100&#x02005;g) of boiled meat (240 calories) or chicken (300 calories), 500&#x02005;g salad (105 calorie),
300&#x02005;g boiled vegetables (110 calories), and 100&#x02005;g banana (100 calories). However, the dinner
consisted of only 200&#x02005;g skimmed milk (120 calories). We checked that the food was eaten as 3
daily meals, and we emphasized the need to have a substantial breakfast. The two groups
underwent an identical dietary monitoring program with an initial consultation, and with one
check-up in the middle of the program and another during the final sessions by a dietician
who was blinded to the type of program the subject had followed. The mean values of SBP,
DBP, HR, MVV, myocardial oxygen consumption, and BMI were obtained for both groups before
and after the exercise program.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Forty obese subjects, whose ages ranged from 18 to 25&#x02005;years, were divided into 2 equal

This result is supported by previous studies that have reported a significant reduction in
BMI with aerobic exercise, which is associated with subsequent cardiovascular risk factors;
this reduction therefore decreases the risk of cardiovascular disease in these subjects<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results also indicated that there was a significant increase in MVV in both the aerobic
exercise group and the anaerobic exercise group, where the aerobic exercise group obtained a
greater increase in MVV than the anaerobic exercise group. This result is supported by a
previous study that reported that aerobic training induces significant physiological
adaptations in the cardio-respiratory system of middle-aged men. The best markers of these
adaptations were the smaller sympathetic tachycardia at comparable workloads and the
improvement of oxygen transport, as documented by the increase in the anaerobic threshold
and VO<sub>2</sub> peak during dynamic exercise<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. This result was also supported by a study comparing
cardiopulmonary function between a moderate exercise program and a severe exercise program;
a significant improvement in VO<sub>2</sub> max and MVV was reported after both types of
exercise<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The results also indicated
that there was a significant reduction in HR, SBP, and DBP at the end of the program in the
aerobic exercise group.</p><p>Regular aerobic training induces significant adaptations both at rest and during maximum
exercise in a variety of dimensional and functional capacities related to the cardiovascular
and respiratory regulation system, thus enhancing the delivery of oxygen to the active
muscles. These changes include decreases in resting and maximal exercise HR and enhanced
stroke volume as well as cardiac output<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. The reduction of HR, SBP, and DBP in the
aerobic exercise group after aerobic training might be due to nitric oxide, an important and
potent endothelium-derived relaxing factor that facilitates blood vessel dilatation and
decreases vascular resistance<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of our study also indicated that there were no significant changes in HR or in
SBP and DBP in the anaerobic exercise group after completion of anaerobic exercise program,
but there was a significant reduction after the aerobic exercise program. This reflects an
increased cardiorespiratory load related to the increased duration of the training session
from 20 to 30 minutes. However, the greater blood flow under the influence of the rise in HR
and SBP does not satisfy the increased oxygen requirements during anaerobic exercise. This
explains the significant augmentation of pulmonary ventilation and ventilation capacity in
the attempt to satisfy the expanding oxygen transport requirements during maximal exercise.
Participation in heavy resistance anaerobic training over an extended period of time
increases cardiac workload, and thus it could not be sustained over an extended period of
time<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results concerning myocardial oxygen consumption in our study indicated that there were
no significant changes in myocardial oxygen consumption after completion of the anaerobic
exercise program. However, there was a significant reduction after the aerobic exercise
program. The improvements in the resting HR and SBP are reflected in the myocardial oxygen
consumption in this study. This improvement in myocardial oxygen consumption might be due to
an improvement in endothelium&#x02013;dependent vasodilatation in both epicardial coronary vessels.
Additionally, it might be due to the recruitment of coronary collateral vessels and enhanced
blood flow with regulation of the vasomotor tone toward vagal modulation. The myocardial
oxygen consumption was lowered after 8 weeks of the training program from 60% to 80% of
HRmax. This improvement might be due to increased peripheral vasodilatation and
consequently, a decreased afterload following exercise and a reduction in the adrenergic
efferent stimuli<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Aerobic exercise improves cardiorespiratory fitness in obese
subjects with less cardiac workload as evidenced by the low myocardial oxygen consumption,
while anaerobic exercise increases cardiac work and is difficult to maintain for extended
periods of time<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, Moreover, low-intensity aerobic exercise is less difficult, more
easily tolerated, and can be practiced daily over an extended period of time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), King Abdulaziz
