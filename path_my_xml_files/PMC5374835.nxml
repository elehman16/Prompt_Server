Regional anesthesia techniques provide important advantages including excellent pain control, reduced side-effects, and shortened stay in the post anesthesia care unit. However, these early advantages can be short-lived and limited by the relatively brief duration of action of currently available local anesthetics (LAs), potentially resulting in block resolution before the period of worst postoperative pain. Increasing the volume of LA may prolong the duration of analgesia, but may also increase the risk of LA systemic toxicity. Although continuous catheter-based nerve blocks can extend postoperative analgesia, their placement requires additional time, cost, and skill.</p><p>Ropivacaine has a long duration of action, with similar pharmacology to bupivacaine but a wider safety margin.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Adjuvants with LAs in brachial plexus block are used to achieve a quick, dense, and prolonged block.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The concurrent injection of &#x003b1;2 adrenergic agonist drugs has been suggested to improve the nerve block characteristic of LA solutions.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is a selective &#x003b1;2 adrenoceptor agonist, which has higher affinity to &#x003b1;2 receptors compared to clonidine. With ropivacaine, it results in a dose-dependent increase in the duration of sensory and motor block.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>However, their combination in supraclavicular brachial plexus block has not been studied till now; hence, the need for the study.</p><p>The primary outcome was the duration of analgesia. Secondary outcomes include the time to onset of sensory and motor blockade, duration of sensory and motor blockade and complications/side effects if any.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material And Methods</title><p>This placebo-controlled randomized trial was conducted at a tertiary referral hospital from October 2012 to April 2014. Sample size calculation was done based on a pilot study in which it was estimated that a minimum of ten patients in each group would be required to detect a difference in the average duration of analgesia as small as 2 times with 95% confidence level. The standard deviation (SD) of the two groups was 80 and 137 min of A and B Groups, respectively. The level of significance and the power of the study were fixed as 0.05 (&#x003b1;) and 0.9 (1-&#x003b2;). A larger sample size of 30 in each group was selected to avoid the skewness of the primary outcome variable (time to first analgesic), to obtain significant difference in the secondary outcomes among the two groups and to eliminate any other confounding biases.</p><p>Eligible participants were patients aged between 18 and 70 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA) I/II/III, and those undergoing elective upper limb surgeries. Exclusion criteria were patient refusal for the block, patients on anticoagulants or with bleeding disorders, those with severe respiratory disease, neurological deficits involving the brachial plexus, allergy to study drugs, local infection at the injection site, those on sedatives or antipsychotics, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35, cardiac arrhythmias, advanced heart block and/or severe ventricular dysfunction, those on other vasodilators or negative chronotropic agents, altered sensorium, and pregnant and nursing women.</p><p>Sixty patients satisfying the inclusion criteria undergoing elective upper limb surgery were included in the study, after obtaining an informed consent and ethical committee approval. They were randomized and divided into two groups in a double-blind fashion using computer generated random number table with assignments provided in sealed opaque envelopes. Group A patients (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 30 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine + 1 mL saline, and Group B patients (<italic>n</italic> = 30) received 30 mL of 0.5% ropivacaine + 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine.</p><p>All the patients were premedicated with 150 mg ranitidine and 8 mg ondansetron orally on the morning of surgery. Intravenous access was obtained on the opposite limb. After documenting the baseline vital parameters, the patients received intravascular midazolam 1 mg and fentanyl 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg prior to the block. The supraclavicular brachial plexus block was performed by the classical approach using a single-injection and nerve stimulator technique. Once the desired response was obtained, that is a muscle twitch of the fingers that is clearly visible; the current strength was reduced to 0.6 mA. If the desired response persisted at 0.6 mA, the drug solution was injected. If there was no adequate response, the needle was moved anteriorly or posteriorly along the first rib to elicit a response. Following the injection, the area was massaged to help the solution to dissipate along the plexus.</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by pinprick test at each minute after completion of drug injection in the dermatomal areas corresponding to the median nerve, ulnar nerve, radial nerve, and musculocutaneous nerve till complete blockade. Sensory block was assessed by a 3 &#x02013; point scale: 0 &#x02013; normal sensation, 1 &#x02013; loss of sensation of pinprick (analgesia), 2 &#x02013; loss of sensation of touch (anesthesia). Onset time was defined as the time interval between the end of LA administration and complete sensory block (score 2). Duration of sensory block was defined as the time interval between the end of LA administration and the complete resolution of anesthesia (score 0).</p><p>Motor blockade was assessed by modified Bromage scale (MBS) for the upper limb.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Motor block onset time was defined as the time interval between the end of total LA administration and complete motor block (MBS score 2). Duration of motor block was defined as the time interval from the onset to the recovery of complete motor function (MBS score 0).</p><p>Inadequate sensory and motor blockade beyond 30 min following the infiltration was considered as an unsuccessful block and was supplemented with general anesthesia.</p><p>Pain was assessed using a standard 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) by an independent anesthesiologist. Intraoperative heart rate, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures, sensory and motor block scores, and the VAS scores were noted every 5 min during the first 15 min, then every 15 min throughout the surgery and hourly thereafter till complete recovery of the block. Intravenous paracetamol 1 g was administered 6<sup>th</sup> hourly for the first 24 h. Time for the first request of postoperative analgesic when VAS &#x0003e;3 (duration of analgesia) was noted and rescue analgesic intramuscular tramadol, 50 mg was given.</p><p>Hypotension (systolic blood pressure more than 20% fall from baseline value), bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;50/min), and postoperative complications such as nausea and vomiting, Horner's syndrome, phrenic nerve palsy, pneumothorax, respiratory depression, and signs and symptoms of LA systemic toxicity were looked for and managed, if any. The above assessments were made by an investigator who was blinded to the drugs used in the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results of continuous measurements were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD and analyzed using Student's unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test.

This indicates that the analgesic effect of peripheral perineural dexmedetomidine was caused by the enhancement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation current, which maintains the nerve in a hyperpolarized state and prevents it from subsequent firing.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</p><p>The efficacy of peripheral action of perineural dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine and ropivacaine for sciatic nerve block in rats has been established. The increase in duration of analgesia is dose dependent, and the effect is peripheral (not caused by centrally mediated or systemic analgesia).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>In our study, the higher incidence of bradycardia and hypotension in dexmedetomidine group is a problem and cannot be ignored. There was no significant clinical impact, and they could be easily managed. Bradycardia and hypotension are potentially life-threatening, and if not detected in time, there can be dangerous consequences. Thus, when dexmedetomidine is being used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine, monitoring of the patient in a high dependency area is required at least for 24 h.</p><p>The lack of other side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression make dexmedetomidine an attractive choice as an adjuvant for the block.</p><p>Use of ultrasound guidance for the peripheral nerve block is one of the latest, precise, and safe methods these days. This could have helped us to reduce the dosages and volumes of LAs. Long-term follow-up of our patients was not done. This could have helped us to understand any long-term neural side effects of the study drugs used. Nonavailability of ultrasound equipment during the course of our study and no long-term follow-up are our limitations. Further studies using ultrasound guidance and with long-term follow-up may be needed.</p><p>The findings of this study indicate that dexmedetomidine can be safely used with LA in peripheral nerve blocks; however, study to determine any toxic effects on neural structures in humans is needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that dexmedetomidine added to perineural ropivacaine in supraclavicular brachial plexus block is effective in providing prolonged duration of analgesia.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Klein</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Greengrass</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Steele</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>D'Ercole</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Speer</surname><given-names>KP</given-names></name><name><surname>Gleason</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A comparison of 0.5% bupivacaine, 0.5% ropivacaine, and 0.75% ropivacaine for interscalene brachial plexus block</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1998</year><volume>87</volume><fpage>1316</fpage><lpage>9</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">9842819</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mondal</surname><given-names>SK</given-names></name><name><surname>Biswas</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Caudal analgesia in paediatric patients: Comparison between bupivacaine and ropivacaine</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2003</year><volume>47</volume><fpage>275</fpage><lpage>8</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kuthiala</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Chaudhary</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Ropivacaine: A review of its pharmacology and clinical use</article-title><source>Indian J Anaesth</source><year>2011</year><volume>55</volume><fpage>104</fpage><lpage>10</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21712863</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Concepcion</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Arthur</surname><given-names>GR</given-names></name><name><surname>Steele</surname><given-names>SM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bader</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Covino</surname><given-names>BG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A new local anesthetic, ropivacaine.
