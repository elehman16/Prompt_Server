Two randomized placebo-controlled studies were conducted to assess the safety profile and potential efficacy of multiple subcutaneous doses of MEDI-528, a humanized anti-IL-9 monoclonal antibody, in asthmatics.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Study 1: adults (18-65 years) with mild asthma received MEDI-528 (0.3, 1, 3 mg/kg) or placebo subcutaneously twice weekly for 4 weeks. Study 2: adults (18-50 years) with stable, mild to moderate asthma and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction received 50 mg MEDI-528 or placebo subcutaneously twice weekly for 4 weeks. Adverse events (AEs), pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity, asthma control (including asthma exacerbations), and exercise challenge test were evaluated in study 1, study 2, or both.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In study 1 (N = 36), MEDI-528 showed linear serum PK; no anti-MEDI-528 antibodies were detected. Asthma control: 1/27 MEDI-528-treated subjects had 1 asthma exacerbation, and 2/9 placebo-treated subjects had a total of 4 asthma exacerbations (one considered a serious AE). In study 2, MEDI-528 (n = 7) elicited a trend in the reduction in mean maximum decrease in FEV<sub>1 </sub>post-exercise compared to placebo (n = 2) (-6.49% MEDI-528 vs -12.60% placebo; -1.40% vs -20.10%; -5.04% vs -15.20% at study days 28, 56, and 150, respectively). Study 2 was halted prematurely due to a serious AE in an asymptomatic MEDI-528-treated subject who had an abnormal brain magnetic resonance imaging that was found to be an artifact on further evaluation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In these studies, MEDI-528 showed an acceptable safety profile and findings suggestive of clinical activity that support continued study in subjects with mild to moderate asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials (NCT): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00507130">NCT00507130</ext-link> and ClinicalTrials (NCT): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00590720">NCT00590720</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Asthma continues to be a significant health problem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], with nearly 8% of the US population reported to have asthma in 2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In one study, approximately 30% of &#x0003e;3,400 asthmatics failed to achieve control despite regular use of combination therapy with high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Interleukin (IL)-9, a 144 amino acid-long protein secreted by CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-helper 2 (Th2) cells, mast cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], may be associated with airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Evidence supporting IL-9 as a potential target treatment for asthma emerged from a series of genetic experiments linking AHR to a region on chromosome 13 in mice, which contains the IL-9 gene and is syntenic with the 5q31-q33 chromosome in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Overexpression of IL-9 in murine models of asthma has been shown to cause airway inflammation with pulmonary infiltration of eosinophils and lymphocytes, airway obstruction, and mast cell hyperplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, anti&#x02212;IL-9 antibody therapy has led to reduced levels of AHR in murine models of allergen-induced asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Blocking IL-9 expression inhibits airway inflammation in a mast cell-dependent murine model of asthma. Mast cell-deficient animals demonstrated reduced lung inflammation and AHR compared with wild-type control mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. An IL-9-neutralizing monoclonal antibody effectively reduced lung recovery of mast cell precursors and inflammatory cells after allergen challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. These findings suggest that IL-9 promotes asthma pathology in a mast cell-dependent manner through the proliferation of mast cell precursors or the recruitment of immature mast cells to lung tissue, or both.</p><p>Mast cell degranulation and release of spasmogenic mediators have been reported to cause bronchoconstriction in subjects with exercise-induced asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Exercise challenge is an indirect airway challenge that results in airway narrowing due to the release of mediators from mast cell degranulation, as opposed to direct airway challenges such as methacholine that act directly on the airway smooth muscle to produce bronchoconstriction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Additionally, in asthmatics, bronchial biopsy specimens revealed increased IL-9 immunoreactive cells and IL-9 mRNA, protein, and receptor levels compared with those of healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These data suggest that IL-9-targeted therapies may offer a novel approach for treating patients with asthma and may reduce exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB).</p><p>MEDI-528 is a humanized anti-IL-9 monoclonal antibody. Results from 2 open-label, phase 1 studies demonstrated that MEDI-528, administered as a single intravenous or subcutaneous (SC) dose, had an acceptable safety profile in healthy volunteers, with no serious adverse events (AEs) and a linear pharmacokinetic (PK) profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We report the results of 2 studies evaluating the safety, tolerability, PK, and immunogenicity profiles of multiple SC doses of MEDI-528, and the potential reduction of EIB in subjects with mild to moderate asthma.

For each cohort (0.3 mg/kg, 1 mg/kg, or 3 mg/kg), subjects were randomized 3:1 via an interactive voice response system (IVRS) to receive MEDI-528 or placebo as SC injections twice weekly for 4 weeks through study day 24; thereafter, subjects were monitored for 126 days. Dosing at each next higher dose group commenced after all evaluable subjects from the previous lower dose group completed evaluations on study day 56 with acceptable safety profiles. Subjects who received &#x02265;7 doses of the study drug were considered evaluable. Those not evaluable were replaced, unless they withdrew from the study due to safety reasons. The primary outcome for this study was the safety and tolerability of multiple SC doses of MEDI-528. Secondary outcomes included PK and immunogenecity of MEDI-528 in this subject population. Exploratory outcomes included effects of MEDI-528 on pulmonary function, asthma exacerbations, symptoms, rescue SABA use, and quality of life.</p><p>Study 2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the safety and tolerability profiles of multiple SC doses of MEDI-528 in three cohorts of 50, 100, and 200 mg versus placebo. Subjects were randomized 2:1 via IVRS to receive MEDI-528 or placebo as an SC injection twice weekly for 4 weeks; thereafter, subjects were monitored for 126 days. Subjects who received &#x02265;4 doses of study drug (unless they discontinued for safety reasons) and had &#x02265;2 exercise challenge tests (baseline and post-therapy) were considered evaluable. The primary outcome of this study was the safety and tolerability of multiple SC doses of MEDI-528 in adult subjects with stable asthma and EIB. Secondary objectives included the effect of MEDI-528 on EIB and immunogenicity. Exploratory outcomes included the effects of MEDI-528 on spirometry, airway hyperresponsiveness as measured by methacholine challenge testing, asthma exacerbations, asthma symptoms, rescue SABA use, quality of life, and nasal allergy symptoms in this population.</p><p>In both studies, all subjects and protocol-associated personnel were blinded to the individual subject treatment assignment until the last subject in each cohort completed the study and the databases were locked.</p><p>Both studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by an institutional review board/independent ethics committee at each participating site. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject before study entry.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety profile</title><p>In both studies, AEs and SAEs were monitored after the first dose through day 150. AEs were graded by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to study drug (none, remote, possible, probable, definite) as determined by each investigator. Other safety measures included routine laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations. Physical examination included assessments for splenomegaly (palpable spleen), lymphadenopathy, and neurologic abnormalities.</p><p>In both studies, a noncontrast MRI of the brain was performed at screening and day 28. MRI was added to the current studies and other MEDI-528 studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] based on preclinical toxicology findings of lymphohistiocytic perivascular infiltrates in the brains of cynomolgus monkeys seen in both treated and control animals. The study and peer-review pathologists considered this a spontaneous background finding unrelated to treatment. Subsequent MEDI-528 toxicology studies in monkeys and of MM9C1 in mice found no evidence of macroscopic or microscopic pathologic changes in the brain; MRI is therefore not required for subsequent clinical studies of MEDI-528 (data on file, MedImmune, LLC).</p><p>Subjects in both studies who received any dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity</title><p>In study 1, blood samples for measuring serum concentrations of MEDI-528 were collected before dosing and at specified times throughout the study. As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used for these measurements. Unknown values with calculated concentrations below the assay's lower limit of quantitation (&#x0003c; 1.25 &#x003bc;g/mL) were reported as less than the limit of quantitation.</p><p>A double-antigen sandwich ELISA was performed to evaluate anti-MEDI-528 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Excercise challenge test</title><p>In study 2, exercise challenge was performed at baseline prior to dosing and on study days 28, 56, and 150 after dosing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A response to therapy was defined as a maximum decrease in post-exercise FEV<sub>1 </sub>of &#x0003c;10%, based on American Thoracic Society guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Spirometry was performed 15 minutes before initiation of the treadmill test and 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes after the treadmill test was completed. At each time point, maximum FEV<sub>1 </sub>was determined. The decrease in FEV<sub>1 </sub>at each time point after the treadmill test was calculated as a percentage of the best baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p></sec><sec><title>Asthma control and quality of life</title><p>In both studies, an asthma exacerbation was defined as a worsening of asthma requiring oral corticosteroids, a doubling of the ICS dose from baseline, hospitalization, emergency department visit, or an unscheduled asthma-related visit to a health care provider. Asthma symptom scores were recorded twice daily for the duration of the study. Symptoms were assessed on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 4 (marked discomfort). Rescue SABA use (puffs/day) was recorded daily by subjects for the duration of the study. Subjects completed the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] at baseline and after dosing.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional evaluations</title><p>Skin prick testing of common food and aeroallergens was performed during screening for both studies and on study day 28 for study 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

No statistical hypothesis testing was performed for this end point. Data analyses were conducted using the SAS System (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).</p><p>AEs and SAEs were described using the MedDRA Adverse Event Thesaurus by system organ class, severity, and relationship to study drug through 18 weeks after the last dose (day 150). Laboratory values with a higher toxicity grade than that observed at baseline were recorded as AEs. The day 0 value before study drug administration was used as a baseline for laboratory parameters. Study discontinuation blood samples were summarized at the closest nominal time point that did not already have a value.</p><p>The original design for study 2 included 3 cohorts (50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg MEDI-528), each with 18 subjects randomized 2:1 to receive MEDI-528 or placebo. Sample size calculations were based on two-sample <italic>t </italic>test of the reduction in the maximum decline of FEV<sub>1 </sub>after exercise challenge testing. The power to detect a statistically significant difference in the maximum decline in FEV<sub>1 </sub>was greater than 80% based on an assumption of a 20% fall in the placebo group and 65% reduction in the maximum decline of FEV<sub>1 </sub>in the combined group (36 subjects) on active treatment versus placebo (18 subjects).</p><p>Serum concentrations and PK parameters were analyzed using WinNonlin (Pharsight, St. Louis, MO) and descriptive statistics summarized for each MEDI-528 treatment group. The number of subjects exhibiting anti-MEDI-528 antibodies was summarized, and all valid assay results from subjects who received any study drug were included in immunogenicity summaries.</p><p>No formal statistical hypothesis tests were conducted for exploratory variables (pulmonary function, asthma exacerbations, symptom scores, rescue SABA use, quality of life). These variables were examined for their medical/clinical implications.</p><p>Two-sample <italic>t </italic>tests were used to explore the change from baseline in FEV<sub>1 </sub>and asthma symptom score between MEDI-528 and placebo groups. The Fisher exact test was used to explore the difference in asthma exacerbation proportions between the placebo and MEDI-528 groups. The total number of exacerbations per subject during the study was noted.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Demographics and baseline characteristics</title><p>In study 1, 36 subjects were randomized between June 2007 and February 2008 at 8 sites, and 33 completed the study through day 150.

No subjects developed anti-MEDI-528 antibodies. MEDI-528 exhibited linear PK, with peak and trough concentrations increasing in an approximately dose-proportional manner over the dose range studied. The half-life values (35-38 days) were consistent with those observed in the high-dose groups of the single-dose SC study of healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], namely, the 3-mg/kg (half-life, 44 days) and 9-mg/kg (half-life, 33 days) doses. In addition, these results are in accord with findings from the 2 studies conducted in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In those studies, MEDI-528 had an acceptable safety profile, with no SAEs or deaths reported.</p><p>Throughout study 1, pulmonary function was essentially unchanged and SABA use was comparable among groups. Overall, asthma symptom scores showed a trend toward improvement in all subjects. A trend toward fewer subjects having &#x02265;1 asthma exacerbation was observed in MEDI-528-treated subjects in study 1 compared with placebo-treated subjects. This finding is of unclear significance as blocking IL-9 may result in a reduction in AHR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and AHR has not been clearly related to asthma exacerbations.</p><p>Although the actions of IL-9 are not fully understood, IL-9 is believed to play an important role in the trafficking and function of mast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Local IL-9 production from inflammatory cells would theoretically result in the recruitment and differentiation of mast cell progenitors from the bone marrow to the lung. Blocking IL-9 would therefore not be expected to have an immediate clinical effect, but this would rather be dependent on the loss of resident mast cells in the tissue.</p><p>The results of study 2 are intriguing in that they suggest that blocking IL-9 with MEDI-528 may have an effect on EIB, which is dependent on mast cell degranulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The maximum effect of MEDI-528 was seen at study day 56, which would be consistent with a later onset of action. Future studies should consider that a period of chronic dosing may be required before seeing maximum clinical effect. Conclusions from study 2 are unfortunately limited in that it was prematurely halted.</p><p>Because of the small sample size in both studies, firm conclusions regarding the clinical activity of MEDI-528 cannot be drawn from these results. The potential benefits of MEDI-528 observed in both studies should be interpreted with caution as these studies were also limited by the mild disease severity of the study population.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, prior and current results suggest that MEDI-528 has acceptable safety and tolerability profiles and provide evidence of clinical activity in mild to moderate asthmatics. Further studies are warranted to assess the clinical efficacy of MEDI-528 for treating patients with inadequately controlled asthma.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>CLF, SDM, and DP received research funding from MedImmune, LLC, for the conduct of these studies.
