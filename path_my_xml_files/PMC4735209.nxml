The prompt identification of this disorder, and the provision of treatment, may help to reduce the likelihood of post-partum depression, prevent severe forms of the disease, and reduce its intergenerational impact. Despite women's repeated encounters with health services throughout their antenatal care, depression often goes undiagnosed. This is one area where mobile health could prove useful. We will assess the feasibility of using tablets to incorporate depression screening into antenatal pathways. We will also assess if survey layout could affect the quality of the data collected through these devices.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>We will test the feasibility of using iPad Airs for the administration of the Whooley questions and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) to pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in England. We will assess the impact of survey layout on the quality of the responses given to these screening scales using a parallel, randomised controlled study design. We will calculate the positive predictive value, the negative predictive value and the false omission rate of the Whooley questions in comparison with the EPDS. We will calculate differences in data equivalence, time needed to complete the surveys, break-off rates, data completeness and requests for help between the 2 experimental groups: using all questions in one screen and navigation by vertical scrolling, or a single question per screen and navigation by multiple pages.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been approved by the National Research Ethics Service Committee South East Coast&#x02014;Surrey.

The direct and indirect financial costs of perinatal depression to the health system, together with its direct impact on the mother and her child, account for the majority of the overall costs to society of perinatal mental disorders.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In the UK, these costs have been estimated at &#x000a3;8.1 billion for each 1-year cohort of birth (with the average costs of one case of perinatal depression estimated at &#x000a3;74&#x02005;k), 72% of which could be attributed to the adverse effects experienced by the child.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> For this reason, the early identification of women who might be at risk of developing or have perinatal depression should be considered a priority.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Women appear to be at an increased risk of depression 3&#x02013;6&#x02005;months after childbirth,<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> although a recent longitudinal study found that symptoms of depression may be more prevalent at 4&#x02005;years post-partum.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Several factors are known to increase the likelihood of developing post-partum depression.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Depression during pregnancy, however, has been recognised as one of the most important risk factors and one that is susceptible to early intervention. The point prevalence of depression during the first, second and third trimesters of pregnancy has been estimated at 7.4%, 12.8% and 12%, respectively.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The timely identification of depression during these stages, and the provision of appropriate treatment, can reduce the likelihood of developing post-partum depression, prevent more severe forms of this disorder, and improve a woman's general health status.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Treating depression during pregnancy may also help reduce the intergenerational impact of this condition.</p><p>Nonetheless, depression during pregnancy often goes undiagnosed and its routine screening is still debated.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Validated screening tools, such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), can facilitate the early identification of depressive symptoms in pregnant women.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, cost-effectiveness is often cited as one of the key reasons against the routine screening for this condition.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> This is an area where smartphones and tablet computers could demonstrate their value in a field of study that is known as mobile health (mHealth). Thanks to their advanced computational and networking capabilities, and overall popularity (in the first quarter of 2015, it was reported that approximately 66% of adults in the UK owned a smartphone),<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> these devices could facilitate depression screening and monitoring of symptoms<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> while reducing costs and administrative burden.</p><p>Researchers from the School of Social Work at the University of Illinois and staff members at Champaign-Urbanara Public Health District will be testing the use of tablet computers to implement depression screening in maternal clinics.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> They will be doing so during antenatal consultations. Mobile devices could be used to screen for depression before a consultation, thus releasing some of the consultation time. For this reason, we need to establish the feasibility of using these devices to do so.</p><p>One aspect of delivering depression screening through mobile devices is the impact that this technology may have on data quality. This is to ensure that the data accurately reflect underlying clinical changes. Our recent Cochrane review<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> suggests that collecting patient self-reported data through apps is equivalent to collecting data through alternative delivery modes (ie, paper, short messaging service, laptops, plastic rulers and personal digital assistants). This review also highlighted that equivalence, and other data quality dimensions, could be affected by factors other than the delivery mode.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> One such factor is survey presentation. Unlike the survey methodology literature, however,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> the effect of this factor on validated clinical tools has not been systematically explored in the medical literature.</p><p>In this study, we will assess the feasibility of implementing the recommendations from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> for recognising depression during pregnancy. We will conduct our study in the waiting area of general practices, community midwiferies and hospitals using iPad Air tablets. We will evaluate the statistical properties of one of the validated instruments recommended by this guideline. We will also assess if survey layout (as a component of survey presentation) affects the quality of the responses collected through the screening instruments under evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>We will assess the feasibility of using iPad Air tablets to administer a brief survey asking for personal information, the Whooley questions and the EPDS (see online supplementary appendix 1) to pregnant women attending antenatal clinics across a number of primary and secondary care National Health Service (NHS) centres in England. iPad Air tablets have a 9.7-inch (diagonal) retina display, with a 2048-by-1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch.

It will also contribute to building the evidence base for mHealth, particularly when applied to mental health. Unlike other studies in the medical literature, this study will evaluate how survey layout could affect the quality of the responses collected using a validated scale. Evaluating how different factors could affect data quality becomes important when data are used to inform clinical and therapeutic decisions. In addition, this study will also evaluate some of the implementation issues that might arise when deploying an mHealth intervention, and that could affect its successful adoption.</p><p>The technical specifications of a device, such as screen size, could influence user interaction and thus the quality of responses. In addition, usage patterns (in terms of the type of interactions, duration and frequency of an interaction, and the type of activities that occur during an interaction) vary depending on the type of device and the setting in which it is being used. For these reasons, our findings might only be generalisable to iPad Air tablets (or devices with similar technical specifications) that are being used in clinical settings. Therefore, in a future study, we will explore issues associated with the at-home collection of mood data during pregnancy, using participants&#x02019; own devices.</p><p>The findings from this feasibility study will inform a larger trial evaluating the integration of this intervention into routine antenatal pathways, and the potential impact on clinical outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study has been reviewed and approved by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee South East Coast&#x02014;Surrey on 9 July 2015 under the Research Ethics Committee (REC) reference 15/LO/0977.</p><p>This study is being sponsored by Imperial College London under the reference number 15IC2687 and has been included in the UK Clinical Research Network (CRN) Study Portfolio under the UKCRNID number 19280.</p><p>Lastly, this study protocol has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under the identifier NCT02516982 (as required by the REC).</p><p>The findings of this study will be disseminated through academic peer-reviewed publications, poster presentations and abstracts at academic and professional conferences, discussion with peers, social media and the Global eHealth Unit website.
