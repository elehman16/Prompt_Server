Especially at intermediate vocational education schools, high rates of medical absenteeism are found. In 2012 the Dutch intervention &#x02018;Medical Advice for Sick-reported Students&#x02019; (MASS), previously developed for pre-vocational secondary education, was adjusted for intermediate vocational education schools. The aim of the study outlined in this paper is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MASS intervention at intermediate vocational education schools in terms of reducing students&#x02019; medical absenteeism and early dropping out of school. Additionally, the extent to which biopsychosocial and other factors moderate the effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A controlled before-and-after study will be conducted within Intermediate Vocational Education schools. Schools are allocated to be an intervention or control school based on whether the schools have implemented the MASS intervention (intervention schools) or not (control schools). Intervention schools apply the MASS intervention consisting of active support for students with medical absenteeism provided by the school including a consultation with the Youth Health Care (YHC) professional if needed. Control schools provide care as usual. Data will be collected by questionnaires among students in both groups meeting the criteria for extensive medical absenteeism (i.e. &#x02018;reported sick four times in 12 school weeks or for more than six consecutive school days&#x02019; at baseline and at 6&#x000a0;months follow-up). Additionally, in the intervention group a questionnaire is completed after each consultation with a YHC professional, by both the student and the YHC professional. Primary outcome measures are duration and cumulative incidence of absenteeism and academic performances. Secondary outcome measures are biopsychosocial outcomes of the students.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">It is hypothesized that implementing the MASS intervention including a referral to a YHC professional on indication, will result in a lower level of medical absenteeism and a lower level of school drop outs among intermediate vocational education students compared to students receiving usual care. The study will provide insight in the effectiveness of the intervention as well as in factors moderating the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">Nederlands Trial Register NTR5556.

Students who break off their education prematurely often find themselves in a more vulnerable situation with regard to developing illnesses, being unemployed and being involved in criminal activities, as compared to students who hold a basic educational degree. Reasons to drop out of school prematurely, as reported by students, vary from learning and motivation difficulties, behavioural, (mental) health problems to problems at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">School absenteeism is often a precursor of school dropout and absenteeism in future careers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It can be divided into unexcused (truancy) and excused absenteeism. The most common form of excused absenteeism is absence due to sickness reporting or sick leave, so called medical absenteeism. Medical absenteeism is perceived twice as often as truancy among adolescent students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Particularly at intermediate vocational educational schools, high rates of medical absenteeism and school dropout can be found. Of all students entering intermediate vocational education, only 50% passes on to the second year and after five years approximately 25% leaves school without a degree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Investing in effective methods regarding the prevention of extensive medical absenteeism at intermediate vocational education schools is therefore relevant.</p><p id="Par16">The Dutch Youth Health Care (YHC) system offers preventive health care for children and adolescents between 0 and 18&#x000a0;years old. It aims to foster the optimal trajectory for growth and development in children and to provide anticipatory guidance to prevent negative outcomes later in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In general, the YHC system does not focus actively on students with extensive medical absenteeism. The current policy of most intermediate vocational education schools does not include an active identification of students with extensive absenteeism and referrals to YHC professionals are limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Because of the high rate of medical absenteeism at intermediate vocational education schools and the complex underlying problems, however, the YHC system could play an important role in addressing medical absenteeism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">In 2012, the Medical Advice for Sick-reported Students (MASS) intervention was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] to address medical absenteeism more actively within students attending pre-vocational secondary education, the school level preceding intermediate vocational education. The aim of the MASS intervention is to limit medical absenteeism by arranging appropriate care, educational adjustments and adequate support for students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The intervention focuses on the factors associated with extensive medical absenteeism: somatic, mental and physical complains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], poor lifestyle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and psychological, family and social problems of sick-reported students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The schools and the YHC professionals collaborate directly within the MASS intervention to design and monitor a management plan that aims to optimize students&#x02019; health and maximize students&#x02019; participation in school activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] In an effect study Vanneste et al. found a reduction of 15.1% in medical absenteeism among pre-vocational secondary education school students after implementing the MASS intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">As students in pre-vocational secondary education schools often continue their education at intermediate vocational education schools, medical absenteeism might be associated with the same determinants in both groups of students. Despite potential similarities between intermediate vocational education and pre-vocational secondary education students, there are also clear differences that need to be taken into account in designing interventions. Students in intermediate vocational education schools, for instance, are generally aged between 15 and 25&#x000a0;years old. Furthermore, the level of medical absence is often larger at intermediate vocational education schools and its nature is often more complex due to underlying biopsychosocial factors and financial problems. As a result, the MASS intervention has been adapted for intermediate vocational education schools and is currently being applied at several schools in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, evidence for its effectiveness is thus far lacking.</p><p id="Par19">The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the MASS intervention at intermediate vocational education schools, with a focus on the efforts of the YHC professional, in terms of reducing students&#x02019; medical absenteeism and early dropping out of school. In addition, we will assess to what extent biopsychosocial and other factors may influence the effect of the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par20">A controlled before-and-after study with a follow-up period of 6&#x000a0;months will be conducted.

In the Netherlands, students under the age of 18 leaving lower secondary school have to continue a higher general secondary education or enter one of the five intermediate vocational education programs: technology, economics, agricultural, personal/social services or health care. The intermediate vocational education schools prepare students for a specialized trade by developing a particular expertise.

The YHC organization in Rotterdam will not be involved in the study as schools in this area have not yet implemented the MASS intervention and will therefore be allocated to the control group.</p><p id="Par24">YHC organizations invite the intermediate vocational education schools to participate in the study. Schools that agree to participate will subsequently be visited by the researchers. It is expected that a total of 12 schools will participate.

The schools (usually an appointed coordinator) select students meeting the inclusion criteria (i.e. reported sick for at least four times in 12&#x000a0;weeks or reported sick for more than six consecutive school days) and invite them to participate in the study. All students receive an information letter and leaflet with information about the study. They are asked to provide informed consent. Participants in the study are invited to complete the baseline questionnaire. The coordinator will send the filled-out questionnaires back to the researchers on a regular basis. For students aged younger than 18&#x000a0;years of age qualifying for participation, parents also receive an information letter and brochure about the study at home provided by school; these parents can object to participation in the study by their child. After 6&#x000a0;months, a follow-up questionnaire will be sent to the students. Students will receive either a hard-copy version, a digital version or both versions, depending on their preference.</p><p id="Par28">Students in intervention schools who have a consultation with the YHC professional will be asked by the YHC professional to complete an additional short questionnaire after consultation. The YHC professionals themselves are also asked to fill out a short questionnaire after each consultation.

In addition, the Dutch version of the self-sufficiency matrix (SSM-D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] is completed by the YHC professionals. The SSM-D addresses the ability of students to provide for themselves regarding 11 specific life-domains (e.g. income, daytime activities, housing, mental health) as assessed by the YHC professional. Each life domain of the SSM is measured by a single item. On each item, students are evaluated on 5-point Likert-type scales, from &#x02018;in crisis&#x02019; (1) to &#x02018;thriving&#x02019; (5). Finally, the perceived value of the MASS intervention according to the YHC professional including the biological model and the SSM-D, is assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Power considerations</title><p id="Par53">Participating schools invite students who meet the inclusion criteria (i.e. reported sick four times in 12&#x000a0;weeks or more than six consecutive school days) to participate in the study. We will include 480 students, 240 in the control group and 240 in the intervention group. Allowing a loss-to-follow-up of 50% we assume to have complete data on 240 students (120 in the intervention and 120 in the control group). Taking into account cluster randomization with Intra Class Correlation of 0.10, assuming 15 participants per school class and an equal standard deviation (SD) of medical absenteeism in hours during a period of 12&#x000a0;weeks before T1 of 30&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], alpha 0.05 and a power of 0.80, in the case of one-sided testing, a difference in medical absenteeism of 15&#x000a0;h between Intervention and Control group at T1 can be established.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par54">In order to evaluate effect of the effect of the intervention the scores on outcomes of both groups measured during follow will be compared, adjusted for baseline findings. For continuous outcome measures such as duration of the medical absenteeism and psychometric test results (multiple) linear regression analyses will be applied. Dichotomous outcomes, such as progressing into the next year or obtaining a basic educational qualification degree, will be evaluated by using a multiple logistic regression analysis.</p><p id="Par55">The research condition will be included as an independent variable.

The aim of the MASS intervention is to limit the medical absenteeism of students by arranging appropriate care, educational adjustments and adequate support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This paper describes the design of a controlled before-and-after study, which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the MASS intervention as well as its contributing factors and interfering factors among intermediate vocational education school students.</p><p id="Par59">It is hypothesized that implementation of the MASS intervention and incorporating a referral to a YHC professional is effective in terms of reducing medical absenteeism. Results of this study will show whether the YHC professional added value in the MASS intervention. Moreover, the study will provide insight in which factors contribute and/or moderate to the intervention&#x02019;s effectiveness and may provide useful suggestions for improvement.</p><p id="Par60">A strength of this study is that it will be conducted in the daily setting schools and YHC practice, which will facilitate future implementation. The participating schools and YHC professionals cover the urban and rural areas of the Netherlands, which will support the generalizability of our findings. Nevertheless, the schools and students are not randomized which can result in differences between the groups. We have tried to minimize this potential effect by correcting for potential confounders. Another strength is that we look at the extent to which the MASS intervention is applied by de YHC professional and gain insight into the care provided by the school to the individual students.</p><p id="Par61">As the MASS intervention had already been implemented at the intervention schools, we could not capture strict criteria for referral to the YHC professional. The criteria for referral to a YHC professional were determined by each individual school which is in line with the MASS protocol, which may result in a variety of used criteria. On the other hand, this will give a realistic approach of the effects of the implementation of the MASS intervention. Also, the MASS-protocol requires great commitment of the schools to identify and refer students to YHC professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It is therefore questionable how many students eventually will be identified and/or referred to the YHC professional.</p><p id="Par62">In conclusion, the premise is that students with high rates of medical absenteeism receiving a customized reintegration plan and supervision from school and the YHC professional show a reduction in medical absence and easier return back to school compared to students receiving usual care. When MASS including the use of a YHC professional is effective, a comprehensive evaluation of full implementation of the MASS intervention at schools may follow.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CAT</term><def><p id="Par5">Care Advisory Team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CES-D</term><def><p id="Par6">Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CS</term><def><p id="Par7">Control school</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IS</term><def><p id="Par8">Intervention school</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MASS</term><def><p id="Par9">Medical Advice for Sick-reported Students</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SF-12</term><def><p id="Par10">12-item Short Form Health Survey</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T0</term><def><p id="Par11">Baseline questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T1</term><def><p id="Par12">Follow &#x02013; up questionnaire</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>YHC</term><def><p id="Par13">Youth Health Care</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank the participating Youth Health Care organizations and schools for their input and discussing the design and protocol used in the study.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p id="Par63">This study was funded by ZonMw, the Dutch Organization for Health Research and Development.
