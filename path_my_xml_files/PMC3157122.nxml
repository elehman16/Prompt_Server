GERD is a highly prevalent (10&#x02013;20% of the population) condition having a significant impact on the quality of life leading to high healthcare expenditures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] GERD patients may be categorized according to their symptoms and endoscopic findings. From an endoscopic point of view, GERD patients are classified as those with no recognizable esophageal erosion (nonerosive reflux disease, NERD), those with visible distal esophageal erosions (erosive reflux disease, ERD), and those with columnar metaplasia in the distal esophagus (Barrett's esophagus, BE).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Though the etiopathogenesis of the disease is multifactorial, the main attributing factor is the dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>Ensuring relief of symptoms in patients with GERD is an important treatment goal. The ideal treatment should improve patients&#x02019; quality of life by providing rapid relief of symptoms and reducing the severity and number of recurrent episodes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are the most effective drugs to control GERD symptoms, and to cure esophagitis endoscopically.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] PPIs such as omeprazole, esomeprazole, lansoprazole, and rabeprazole effectively inhibit the duration and extent of gastric acid secretion and provide more complete remission of the symptoms of heartburn than other antisecretory drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] However, the response to PPIs in patients with nonerosive reflux disorder is less efficacious when compared to patients with erosive GERD.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Two new PPIs, rabeprazole and esomeprazole, have been already proved to be effective and safe in GERD. Rabeprazole is a PPI that effectively provides symptom relief and healing, and prevents relapse, in patients with erosive GERD. Esomeprazole, the s-enantiomer of omeprazole, has demonstrated superior efficacy over omeprazole in healing and symptom resolution in patients with erosive and nonerosive reflux disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Currently, the market is flooded with &#x0201c;me-too&#x0201d; drugs and physicians are inundated with the promotional literature from pharmaceutical companies. So our present study is an effort to determine the better agent between rabeprazole and esomeprazole in mild-to-moderate erosive GERD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients</title><p>The study was conducted on 60 patients of mild-to-moderate erosive gastroesophageal disease attending the outdoor department of General Medicine, Prathima Institute of Medical Sciences, Karimnagar, Andhra Pradesh, India. The study population included patients, irrespective of sex, aged 18&#x02013;65 years suffering from GERD symptoms for at least 3 months in the previous year. Subjects experienced at least one period of moderate-to-severe heartburn or regurgitation in the past 7 days prior to treatment and at endoscopy; they had grade A or grade B esophagitis according to the Los Angeles (LA) classification. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: known history of gastroduodenal ulcer; infectious or inflammatory conditions of the intestine (including inflammatory bowel disease); malabsorption syndromes; obstruction; gastrointestinal malignancy; gastric or intestinal surgery including vagotomy; Barrett's esophagus; esophageal stricture or pyloric stenosis; scleroderma; pregnancy; abnormal laboratory tests at the initial visit (including liver enzymes greater than twice the upper limit of normal); GERD treatment refractory to a 2-month course of H<sub>2</sub>-blocker or PPI therapy; PPIs taken within 14 days of screening or H<sub>2</sub>-blocker or prokinetic agent taken within 7 days of screening; daily use of NSAIDs, oral steroids, aspirin (&#x0003e;325 mg/day); being unable to discontinue the use of anticholinergics, cholinergics, spasmolytics, opiates, or sucralfate.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>The present study is a 4-week, randomized, single-blinded, parallel group comparative clinical study between rabeprazole and esomeprazole in patients with mild-to-moderate erosive GERD conducted in a single center. The study was approved by the institute ethics committee. A written informed consent was taken from all the patients participating in the study after explaining the patient's diagnosis, the nature and purpose of a proposed treatment, the risks and benefits of a proposed treatment (rabeprazole/esomeprazole), alternative treatment, and the risks and benefits of the alternative treatment. Randomization was done by using a computer-generated random list. After randomization, the patients were divided into two treatment groups. A total of 30 patients were allocated in the rabeprazole group who received rabeprazole 40 mg daily and another 30 patients in the esomeprazole group who received esomeprazole 40 mg daily for 4 weeks. [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>] The patients received the drugs free of cost from our institute pharmacy. At the first visit, after a detailed history was taken on baseline symptomatology, clinical evaluation [including GERD symptom score and quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia (QOLRAD) scoring] and laboratory investigations (upper GI endoscopy, liver function test) were done. After 4 weeks, upper GI endoscopy was repeated and the clinical improvement was assessed in terms of the change in endoscopic findings, GERD symptom score, and QOLRAD scoring. The liver function test was done for all follow-up patients at the second visit to detect any hepatic dysfunction.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Recruitment, allocation and follow-up of participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JPP-2-150-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Efficacy and safety variables</title><p>The efficacy variables were changes from baseline to day 28 in the severity of GERD symptoms based on GERD symptom scoring, endoscopic findings, and QOLRAD scoring.</p><p>The improvement in the four most important GERD symptoms (heartburn, acid regurgitation, epigastric distress, and dysphagia) have been scored on a scale of 0&#x02013;4 depending on severity to assess the efficacy of the candidate drugs.

The dimensions include the following items by domain &#x02013; emotional distress: discouraged or distressed, frustrated or impatient, anxious or upset, worries or fears, irritable, and the exact cause is not known; sleep disturbance: tired due to the lack of sleep, waking at night, fresh and rested, and trouble getting to sleep; vitality: feeling tired or worn out, generally unwell, and lack of energy; food/drink problems: eat less than usual, unable to eat foods or snacks, food unappealing, not tolerating food or snacks, and avoiding certain food/drink; physical/social functioning: avoid bending over, doing things with family, difficulty in socializing, unable to carry out daily activities, and unable to carry out physical activities. All questions are rated on a seven-point Likert scale according to the following response options: all of the time, most of the time, quite a lot of the time, some of the time, a little of the time, hardly any of the time, none of the time; for questions 3, 16, and 19, the responses were a great deal, a lot, a moderate amount, some, a little, hardly any, none at all. The lower was the value, the more severe the impact on daily function was.

Developers of the LA classification tried to avoid subjective interpretations and relied on objective criteria to make the diagnosis of endoscopic GERD. Finding a definite break in the mucosa called &#x0201c;erosion&#x0201d; is essential to diagnose endoscopic GERD in the LA classification.

In this study, rabeprazole and esomeprazole have been found to decrease heartburn and acid regurgitation significantly in their respective groups and when the percentage changes were compared, rabeprazole has been found to be superior to esomeprazole in controlling those symptoms. The improvement in the overall symptom score was significantly lowered in both groups and rabeprazole was found to be superior over esomeprazole when compared by the <italic>t</italic>-test. The present study supports the findings of a previous study by Warrington <italic>et al</italic>. where rabeprazole was found to be a better antisecretory agent than esomeprazole.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] In this study, improvement was seen in all five domains of QOLRAD scoring with both the drugs. But the improvement with rabeprazole was found to be more than esomeprazole over 1 month. So in all five domains, rabeprazole was found to be superior to esomeprazole in reducing the impact on daily functioning and improving quality of life. An increase in the overall score of QOLRAD was also found to be statistically significant in the rabeprazole group. The changes in the esomeprazole group of our study are close to those of the previous studies done by Gunasekaran <italic>et al</italic>. and th Attwood <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Endoscopic findings showed that the incidence of residual esophagitis after 4 weeks was higher in the esomeprazole group compared to the rabeprazole group. Similarly, the incidence of healing and percentage risk reduction was significantly higher in the rabeprazole group compared to the esomeprazole group. Like other PPIs, both rabeprazole and esomeprazole were well tolerated without any severe side effects. The previous studies by Fock <italic>et al</italic>. and Pai <italic>et al</italic>. also reported the safety of these drugs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>]</p><p>The superiority of rabeprazole over esomeprazole found in our study has been supported by a comparative study where rabeprazole 20 mg daily was found to be more effective than esomeprazole 20 mg daily in increasing intragastric pH and maintaining pH &#x0003e; 3 and &#x0003e;4. On day 5, mean pH AUC was higher after esomeprazole than rabeprazole.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] A previous study by Caos <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated the safety and efficacy of 20 and 10 mg rabeprazole in maintaining GERD healing for up to 5 years compared to placebo. Both doses were effective in preventing the relapse of GERD, heartburn frequency, and daytime heartburn severity, with the 20-mg dose also effective in preventing night time heartburn severity. Rabeprazole treatment improved patients&#x02019; quality of life when compared to placebo. Both rabeprazole doses were well tolerated and equally safe.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] In providing rapid, sustained acid control, rabeprazole effectively relieves the symptoms of GERD and has been shown to be effective for acute healing of erosive esophagitis and 1-year maintenance of healing. In another study, rabeprazole increased intragastric pH with a rapid onset of action (within hours) and maintained an elevated pH through and between meals. This effect was seen on the first day and maintained throughout 8 days of rabeprazole treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Rabeprazole was demonstrated to be superior to omeprazole on the first treatment day, by maintaining a higher diurnal and nocturnal gastric pH at half dosage and decreasing more deeply the gastric acidity at full dosage (rabeprazole: 66%, omeprazole: 35%).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>Several mechanisms may explain the superior efficacy of rabeprazole in increasing the intragastric pH and decreasing the acid output. Rates of acid inhibition are known to correlate with the acid stability of PPIs. Rabeprazole, which has the highest pKa of all PPIs and is therefore least stable at neutral pH, is more rapidly converted to inhibit the proton pump as compared to omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] This may be critical given the known short half-lives of PPIs that limit time available to accumulate in the parietal canaliculus, to form the activated sulphenamide form, and to bind to inactivate proton pumps.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] In addition, rabeprazole may have more prolonged and potent acid inhibitory effects due to continued binding to proton pump transmembrane domains even after achieving 100% inhibition of the ATPase activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] While the majority of available parietal cells typically maintain an intracellular pH near 1, a proportion of these target cells may have a pH as high as 3 depending largely on the age of that cell. In extremely acidic environments, PPIs may have similar equipotency.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] However, in less acidic environments, rabeprazole, given its rapid activation over a wide pH range, actually targets a greater population of parietal cells to give a more rapid and pronounced degree of acid inhibition.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] In older parietal cells, rabeprazole can be as much as 10 times more potent than other PPIs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] In addition, rabeprazole has an advantage not shared by other PPIs. Its metabolism is largely nonenzymatic and therefore less dependent on CYP2C19, giving a greater consistency of pharmacokinetics across all patients, regardless of the CYP2C19 genotype.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>From the results of the present comparative clinical analysis of rabeprazole and esomeprazole, we conclude that rabeprazole (40 mg) is a better choice in mild-to-moderate erosive GERD compared with esomeprazole (40 mg) owing to its better efficacy and safety profile. This study has limitations because of being a single-blinded and single-center study, and hence the findings of this exploratory study should be confirmed by multicentric, randomized, double-blind, large population studies.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Partha Chakraborti, MD; Raghavendra M, MD; and Zubair Ahmed Karim, PhD, for their valuable suggestions, active help, and encouragement.
