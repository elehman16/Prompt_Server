of this study was to analyze exercise beliefs and psychosocial factors in sedentary and
active healthy women and observe the changes in these parameters resulting from clinical
Pilates exercises and verbal education in healthy women. [Subjects and Methods] Sixty-six
healthy women were included in the study. Participants were divided into clinical Pilates
(n=21), verbal education (n=25), and control groups (n=20). Prior to and at the end of the
study, demographic information, body mass index, waist-hip circumference, exercise
beliefs, physical activity index, and psychosocial factors (Rosenberg self-esteem scale,
Body Cathexis Index, SF-36 quality of life, Beck Depression Scale, visual analog scale for
tiredness) of the subjects were recorded. [Results] Meaningful changes for all the
parameters took place in the clinical Pilates and verbal education groups. Our analyses
indicated that the changes in the clinical Pilates group were more meaningful than those
in the verbal education group. When the data of the study groups were compared with those
of the control group, the clinical Pilates group showed meaningful differences.
[Conclusion] The result of this study indicate that both clinical Pilates and verbal
education are effective in changing exercise beliefs and physical and psychosocial
parameters.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Theory of planned behavior</kwd><kwd>Exercise beliefs</kwd><kwd>Pilates</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Technological developments have simplified some tasks for human beings, but these
developments have also decreased the physical activity level of the average person. Exercise
is a planned activity, and recurrent physical activity helps to protect or improve one or
more components of physical suitability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
When modern city life began at the start of the 20th century, the importance of exercise was
better understood. In the past, the terms exercise were used interchangeably, but now
exercise is defined as a low category of physical activity. The effects of exercise on human
health can be divided into two main groups, namely physical and psychological effects.</p><p>Clinical Pilates exercises were chosen in this study because of the holistic character of
Pilates, which has both physical and psychological effects on human health. The positive
effects of the clinical Pilates exercises can be seen in a short time, and the individual&#x02019;s
feelings about this improves the sustainability of the exercise behaviour. Different
exercise forms and concepts are defined in the literature<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In recent years, clinical
Pilates has been gaining popularity, and physical therapists are using this exercise form
more frequently<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pilates, which was introduced by Joseph Hubertus Pilates, is a
physical fitness program that uses mat exercise equipment to reshape body, and increase
flexibility, strength, balance, and coordination<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Clinical Pilates exercises have a low intensity compared with other
aerobic exercise forms; however, it provides many benefits to human health. It reduces
cardiac disease risks, osteoporosis, reshapes the body, and develops balance and
flexibility. Clinical Pilates exercises have different levels for different conditions<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Also, the Pilates method is a functional form of exercise, because it utilizes a combination
of movements in different coordinates, planes, and positions<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Pilates exercises include a breathing component, which has many
positive effects on aerobic capacity and is also beneficial for psychological health. This
exercise form emphasizes the effect of mental concentration on the physical body by
incorporating a focus on breathing<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>On the other hand, we think that knowledge about exercise is important. People are told
about the benefits of exercise by physical therapists. The cause and effect relationship of
this practice may benefit from further study. Thus, we performed a study with a group of
people who received verbal education about exercise.</p><p>We hypothesized that if we could understand exercise beliefs, we could find a way to
increase the exercise level of the community, so we sought to analyze the determinants of
exercise level. The theory of planned behavior (TPB), which introduces a model about human
behavior, was first defined by Icek Ajzen<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many people have positive intentions to
participate in an exercise program, but they do not follow through. The theory gives a road
map to work on the problems and present appropriate attempts to resolve them<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. According to the theory, human behavior
is guided by three kinds of considerations: beliefs about the likely outcomes of the
behavior and the evaluations of these outcomes (behavioral beliefs), beliefs about the
normative expectations of others and motivation to comply with these expectations (normative
beliefs), and beliefs about the presence of factors that may facilitate or impede
performance of the behavior and the perceived power of these factors (control beliefs). In
combination, attitude toward the behavior, subjective norm, and perception of behavioral
control lead to the formation of a behavioral intention. As a general rule, the more
favorable the attitude and subjective norm, and the greater the perceived control, the
stronger should be a person&#x02019;s intention to perform the behavior in question. Finally, given
a sufficient degree of actual control over the behavior, people are expected to carry out
their intentions when the opportunity arises. Intention is thus assumed to be the immediate
antecedent of behavior<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. The validity and reliability of the theory of planned
behavior were shown in previous exercise investigations<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. When considered objectively, it is clear that the TPB has been one
of the most cited and impressive models since it was first published by Ajzen in 1985.</p><p>From this standpoint, we first designed an exercise beliefs questionnaire with guidance
from the TPB. Then, the validity and reliability of this form was established.</p><p>This study was performed to analyze the exercise beliefs of both sedentary and active
healthy women, in addition to psychosocial factors, and to observe the changes in these
parameters resulting from clinical Pilates exercises and verbal education.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects included in this study were women between 20&#x02013;45 years old. Subjects who had a
systemic, neurological or metabolic disease, had undergone any spinal surgical procedure, or
had a BMI over 29.9&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were excluded from the study.</p><p>Seventhy healthy women between the ages of 20&#x02013;45 years participated in this study. However,
four subjects declined to participate in the study because of health problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1. </label><caption><p>Flowchart of the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-27-3437-g001"/></fig>).</p><p>The clinical Pilates (n=21) and verbal education (n=25) groups consisted of sedentary
subjects divided according to their intentions. All analyses were done in these groups
before the study and after eight weeks. The clinical Pilates group performed clinical
Pilates exercises with a trained physical therapist, three times a week for eight weeks at
the Pamukkale University Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation High School Exercise Saloon.
The verbal education group was told about exercise principles and benefits by the researcher
at the beginning of the study and also had individual exercise programs and guidelines for
homework. The exercise programs consisted of postural, stretching, and strengthening
exercises, in addition to aerobic exercises like walking and cycling. The verbal education
group was not called or supervised by the researcher with regard to exercises during the
eight-week period.</p><p>The control group was composed of healthy subjects who were already walking regularly for
one hour three or four times a week for at least one year without supervision (n=20) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>). The control group was chosen from active
subjects to compare the physical and psychosocial effects of regular and long-term exercise
with the effects in the study groups.</p><p>All the subjects understood the purpose of this study, agreed to participate in this
research, and signed an informed consent form. The study was approved by the Hacettepe
University Non-invasive Clinical Research Ethics Committee (LUT 12/58-04).</p><p>Demographic information and physical characteristics like age, body mass index (BMI), and
waist and hip circumference measurements were collected from all the subjects at the
beginning of the study. Moreover, all the subjects answered the exercise beliefs
questionnaire, physical activity index, and psychosocial factors (SF-36, Rosenberg
self-esteem scale, Body Cathexis Index, Beck Depression Scale, and visual analog scale for

our study was permanent changes in exercise and lifestyle. Changes in physical activity and
exercise level also lead to changes in beliefs, and this paves the path for permanent
changes. By replacing intentions or behavior, the TPB leads to lasting changes in behavior.
In the present study, we made changes in the level of exercise to understand the changes in
beliefs. We believe that changes in beliefs can prepare the foundation for lasting changes.
Our study demonstrates that exercise beliefs can be changed and that behavioral aspects are
gained from this change. Since our goal was to change behavior of the CPG and VEG, which
were composed of sedentary individuals, we selected individuals who already had a regular
exercise habit for the CG. The purpose of the CG, which was composed of active individuals,
was to enable comparison of sedentary and active individuals during the same periods.</p><p>To predict exercise behavior in Korean Americans, the TPB was used in an identifier norm
frame. Intention and perceived behavioral control statistically determined leisure
activities<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. From other aspects, TPB
has been applied to explain physical activity in Canadian adults in a population consisting
of 4,073 people, and it was descriptive<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. Positive changes in attitudes and intentions regarding exercise as
exercise time increased was shown in a study by Chan et al. In our study, the changes in the
CPG before and after the study were similar to those in the CG. With an increase in the
duration of physical exercise, permanent lifestyle changes may be expected<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Exercise habits may lead to a permanent change in behavior, and this is possible with a
systematic training program. This is possible with verbal information or practical
applications. To this end, physiotherapists use these approaches when designing and
recommending exercise programs for patients as well as healthy individuals<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, the VEG was
informed about benefits of exercise through a program, and moreover an exercise program was
designed to meet each participant&#x02019;s individual needs. The other study group, the CPG,
participated in therapist-led clinical Pilates exercises. Similarly, in another study, the
effects of behavior changes on exercise beliefs were examined with the TPB. The study was
designed with sedentary individuals to investigate if an increase in physical activity led
to an increase in positive beliefs about exercise. At baseline, after the sixth and twelfth
months, 365 adults were asked to complete forms regarding their physical activity and
expectations for a more active life in the next year. Objectively, these adults reached the
activity levels that the targeted at the beginning by the twelfth month<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, an individual&#x02019;s intention to exercise were
not questioned before training; but they were allowed to pick their own training group. This
established their intention to exercise. Therefore, the significant increase in level of
physical activity in the CPG may be associated with the form of instruction the group
received as well as the initial intentions of the subjects. When we compared the groups in
terms of impact after training, significant differences were observed in the CPG compared
with the VEG, but both groups of individuals, which were initially sedentary, later
developed exercise habits and approached the CG in terms of many parameters. In previous
study by Sirur et al. conducted a home exercise program and physical activity program and
demonstrated that treatment was ineffective. Their study revealed the need to increase the
commitment to exercise for an effective program of physiotherapy, and there are five
theories that suggest a physiotherapistis necessary for this purpose. The five theories
consist of a health belief model, protection motivation theory, self-efficacy theory, the
TPB and the social cognitive theory<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
connection with this search, it is also thought to be possible to ensure the functioning of
the protection motivation and social cognitive theories in CPG, while individuals in VEG may
only be able to perform the health belief model and induced impact theory. Most of the
changes in the CPG brought their data closer to those of the CG. It is thought that this was
the result of the 8-week clinical Pilates program, which has often been reported in the
literat&#x000fc;re<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, significant differences in the CG, like those in body
image scale, SF-36 role limitations, emotions, BMI, and waist circumference, which are
parameters of a physically active lifestyle could be the result of the long-term and lasting
effects of physical activity.</p><p>In our study, significant positive changes were observed in quality of life in the CPG
before and after measurements were made. In a study similar to ours, by Leopoldino and
colleagues on sedentary individuals, the the effects of the Pilates Matwork method on sleep
quality and quality of life were examined. When sleep quality and quality of life levels
were compared before and after the study, significant improvements were found<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this sense, the results of our study
seem to be consistent with the literature.</p><p>This study was planned and implemented with women to exclude differences in gender-specific
muscle mass, hormonal changes, etc. The importance of exercise in women for prevention of
cancer, diabetes, and hypertension, in addition to the benefits for overall health, has been
revealed in several studies<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our study found that an increase in the level of exercise
has a positive effect on BMI, waist hip circumference, self-esteem, body image, and quality
of life. One of the most important results of our study is the indispensability of Pilates
exercises for the female population, which also supports findings in the literature.</p><p>Oliveira and colleagues investigated the effects of Pilates on muscle strength, postural
balance, and quality of life in older adults with a randomized, controlled, clinical trial.
The 16 participants were assigned to a working group and control group randomly in their
study. They concluded that Pilates exercises led to significant improvement in isokinetic
torque of the knee extensors and flexors, postural balance, and aspects of the
health-related quality of life of older adults<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup><sub>.</sub> In the CPG in our study, reductions in parameters such
as the BMI and waist circumference revealed the positive effects of Clinical Pilates on the
physical properties of individuals. The positive effects of the Pilates method are supported
by our study in terms of improving quality of life.</p><p>In a study conducted by McGrath et al., the relationship between health-related quality of
life and group exercises was investigated in healthy individuals. There were 143 adult
participants in their study. The participants were divided into two groups, namely those who
participated in Pilates exercise and those who participated in strengthening exercise. At
the end of the study, the Pilates group was found to have significant differences in favor
of energy and fatigue components of the SF-36. It was also revealed that the type of group
exercises affect health-related quality of life<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. As shown in our study and others, clinical Pilates is a form of
group exercise. The analyses showed that clinical Pilates causes an increase in all
parameters of the SF-36. Clinical Pilates seems to be an effective physical fitness program
to improve the quality of life. In a study conducted in Portugal that was similar to ours,
the, life satisfaction, the impact on physical health and self-confidence levels of Pilates
mat exercise were studied in adult women. In that study, positive significant changes were
found in parameters such as life satisfaction, the perception of acceptance by other people,
physical appearance perception, and functionality perception in the working group at the
beginning and after 6 months<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the
present study, in the CPG, the positive changes obtained in the CPG in parameters such as
self-esteem, body image, and quality of life seem to be consistent with the results of the
Portuguese study.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Lip</surname><given-names>RW</given-names></name><name><surname>Fong</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Ng</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of Ving Tsun Chinese martial art training on
