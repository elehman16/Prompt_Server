activities of the lumbar erector spinae caused by inversion traction in order to verify
the relaxation effect. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects included 60 healthy male adults
who were equally and randomly assigned to a 30&#x02013;30&#x000b0; group, a 30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group, and a 60&#x02013;60&#x000b0;
group. Inversion traction was performed for six minutes, and the electromyographic
activities of the lumbar erector spinae (L2, L4) were measured before and after inversion
traction. [Results] The root mean square values at the L2 and L4 levels on both sides were
statistically significantly higher after inversion traction compared with before inversion
traction. Before inversion traction, the root mean square values at the L2 and L4 levels
on both sides in the 30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group and 60&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group were significantly higher than those in
the 30&#x02013;30&#x000b0; group, while the root mean square values at the L2 and L4 levels on both sides
showed no significant differences between the groups before inversion traction.
[Conclusion] The findings of this study indicated that IT is more likely to elicits an
increase in muscle tension and prevent relaxation of the lumbar erector spinae.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Inversion traction (IT)</kwd><kwd>Muscle tension</kwd><kwd>Traction angle</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Inversion traction (IT) is a form of spinal traction in which the body is maintained in an
inverted position so that back problems can be prevented and cured<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Specifically, IT provides the spinal column with traction
force using the body&#x02019;s weight. The force of the body&#x02019;s weight in the IT position is usually
calculated as approximately 40% of the body&#x02019;s overall weight<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>; this depends on the user&#x02019;s body weight and the traction angle.
Unlike automated mechanical traction, it is difficult in the case of IT to adjust the
traction force because the traction angle is set by the users themselves. Thus, IT places
excessive traction force on the spinal column.</p><p>In the IT process, the paraspinal muscles are generally stretched as the spinal column is
lengthened. The muscle spindles arranged parallel to the muscle fibers are then stretched,
and &#x003b1;-motor neurons are stimulated by the stretch stimulus signal from the muscle spindles
through the Ia and II sensory nerves. Consequently, muscle contraction or tension is
elicited. Although muscle tension works as a muscle guard to protect the muscles, persistent
muscle guarding restricts blood flow and causes muscle fatigue<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The accumulation of metabolic waste also leads to muscle pain<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, it is expected that IT will trigger
back pain.</p><p>Recently, Wang et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that IT
causes muscle fatigue in the lumbar erector spinae. It can be deduced from this finding that
IT prevents the lumbar erector spinae from relaxing. However, the study of Wang et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> did not provide any information on IT in the
case of inversion above 30&#x000b0;, mainly because IT was performed at an inverted angle below 30&#x000b0;
in the study. Moreover, previous studies insisting that IT helps to relax the lumbar erector
spinae are controversial<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there is no doubt that IT can prevent relaxation
of the lumbar erector spinae. In a study by Vernon et al.<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> on IT, 19 subjects showed increased paraspinal electromyographic
activity.</p><p>Accordingly, the current study analyzed the electromyographic activities of the lumbar
erector spinae resulting from the application of an IT traction angle of over 30&#x000b0;. Based on
the results, we investigated whether IT can help in the relaxation of the lumbar erector
spinae.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, the subjects comprised 60 healthy male adults with no history of
musculoskeletal or neurological system disorders. The mean age, weight, and height of the
subjects were 23.02&#x000b1;2.10&#x02005;years old, 70.77&#x000b1;10.14&#x02005;kg, and 174.28&#x000b1;5.95&#x02005;cm, respectively. All
subjects were equally and randomly assigned to a 30&#x02013;30&#x000b0; group, a 30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group, and a 60&#x02013;60&#x000b0;
group depending on the angle of IT applied. All the subjects listened to a detailed
explanation about the study&#x02019;s methodology, safety matters concerning the progression of the
study, and bio-information protection before voluntarily consenting to participate in the
study. This study was approved by the bioethics committee of the Catholic University of
Pusan (CUPIRB-2015-027).</p><p>IT was performed as follows. The subjects were positioned horizontally on a table-form IT
device (TB2015-H1, THE BAN, Namyangju, Republic of Korea) and remained resting in a supine
position for 10 minutes. After resting, the subjects&#x02019; muscle activity was measured for three
minutes. IT was then performed using various methods depending on the group. For example, in
the case of the 30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group, IT was first performed at 30&#x000b0; of inversion for three minutes,
followed by a further three minutes at 60&#x000b0;of inversion. Inversion was performed on the
30&#x02013;30&#x000b0; group and the 60&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group in the same way. To evaluate the muscle activities of the
lumbar erector spinae, electromyographic signals were collected at a sampling rate of
1,000&#x02005;Hz using an electromyography system (LXM3204, LAXTHA Inc., Daejeon, Republic of
Korea). The root mean square (RMS) values were calculated using the TeleScan software
(LAXTHA Inc., Daejeon, Republic of Korea) after being processed with a 60&#x02005;Hz notch filter
and a 50&#x02013;500&#x02005;Hz band-pass filter. The muscles were the lumbar erector spinae on both sides
of the lumbar spine (L2, L4)<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Statistical analyses were then conducted using the SPSS version 12.0 software. The paired
t-test was used to compare the significance of the differences in RMS values between the
pre-IT and post-IT values. One-way ANOVA and Scheff&#x000e9;&#x02019;s post hoc test were used to compare
the significance of the differences in RMS values between the groups. The significance level
was 0.01.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The RMS at the L2 and L4 levels on both sides were statistically significantly higher after

30&#x02013;30&#x000b0; group (p&#x0003c;0.01). Before IT, there were no significant differences between the
groups in terms of RMS values at the L2 and L4 levels on both sides (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in RMS values after IT</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Before IT</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">After IT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" colspan="1">L2 Left (&#x000b5;V)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;30&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.31&#x000b1;2.08</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.85&#x000b1;3.50<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.65&#x000b1;1.84</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.70&#x000b1;4.15<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.50&#x000b1;2.02</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.17&#x000b1;5.79<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" colspan="1">L2 Right (&#x000b5;V)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;30&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.87&#x000b1;3.05</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.99&#x000b1;3.66<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.44&#x000b1;1.21</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.05&#x000b1;3.63<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.61&#x000b1;1.71</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.46&#x000b1;4.73<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" colspan="1">L4 Left (&#x000b5;V)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;30&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.18&#x000b1;1.66</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.04&#x000b1;3.59<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.38&#x000b1;0.78</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.78&#x000b1;3.85<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.06&#x000b1;2.42</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.49&#x000b1;5.44<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="3" colspan="1">L4 Right (&#x000b5;V)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;30&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.13&#x000b1;2.15</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.36&#x000b1;3.53<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.95&#x000b1;1.10</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.14&#x000b1;3.53<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60&#x02013;60&#x000b0;<sup>*</sup></td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.20&#x000b1;1.70</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.24&#x000b1;3.80<sup>b</sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>*p&#x0003c;0.01, Values with different letters in a column are significantly different by

(e.g., degenerative or herniated discs, spinal stenosis, or other spinal conditions). IT
provides pain relief, muscle relaxation, and distraction of vertebral column<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, the paraspinal muscles generally provided resistance against spinal traction. A
traction force of at least 25% of the body&#x02019;s weight is necessary to achieve distraction of
the lumbar vertebrae against muscular resistance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The force of IT applied is usually approximately 40% of the overall
body weight<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The applied traction force
places a direct stretching load on the paraspinal muscles, and this load elicits increasing
muscle tension. Our study also produced a similar result, and we verified increased muscle
activities of the lumbar erector spinae after IT. This signified that muscle tension
persisted even after IT<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. These results
concur with those of a study by Wang et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> showing that IT causes muscle fatigue. Although the study by Wang et
al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> only examined an IT angle of less
than 30&#x000b0;, it was clear from our study that IT cannot help to achieve relaxation of the
lumbar erector spinae in our study. However, previous studies have clearly stated that IT
can help with relaxation of the lumbar erector spinae<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, these studies
noted that IT decreases electromyographic activities of the lumbar erector spinae, but this
was not found in our study. Moreover, the previous studies measured electromyographic
activities during IT, and this was the reason why the electromyographic activities were
considered to have decreased. During the process of IT, the sustained stimulus induces
accommodation. The induced accommodation, in turn, affects the response of the stretching
load, and electromyographic activities decrease as time passes. For these reasons, it may
appear as though muscle tension has decreased.</p><p>In this study, we compared the RMS values after IT with the RMS values before IT in order
to examine changes in muscle tension. This method was used in a study by Acedo et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, and like that study, we were able to
obtain results showing changes in muscle tension. Moreover, we obtained another interesting
result. After IT, the RMS values of the lumbar erector spinae in the 30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group and 60&#x02013;60&#x000b0;
group were higher than those in the 30&#x02013;30&#x000b0; group, and there was no difference between the
30&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group and the 60&#x02013;60&#x000b0; group. In other words, muscle tension increased by IT was
affected by the size of the traction angle rather than the process of traction angle
application. In a study by Cholewicki et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, there was no difference between the electromyographic activities
of the lumbar erector spinae during several types of traction, when the same peak torque was
applied by spinal traction. The results of their study were similar to those of our study.
In the case of IT, the traction force depended on the user&#x02019;s body weight and on the traction
angle. Accordingly, IT was affected by the size of the traction angle rather than the
process of traction angle application. Therefore, the size of the traction angle should be
fully taken into account and applied very carefully in prescribing IT.</p><p>In this study, the subject was comprised of healthy male adults, so the results of this
study were limited to a healthy population. However, muscle tension will be increased by IT
in any other population, as IT also lengthens paraspinal muscles in any other population.
The aspects of the change in muscle tension will be different depending on the pathological
symptoms or conditions of the subject. Therefore, we suggest that IT need not be applied if
it does not aid in the relaxation of the lumbar elector spinae.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Prentice</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name></person-group>: Therapeutic modalities in rehabilitation.
