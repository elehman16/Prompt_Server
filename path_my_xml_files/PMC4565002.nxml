The objective of this study was to examine the safety and benefits of certolizumab pegol (CZP)+methotrexate (MTX) treatment for almost 5 years in patients with RA.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients who completed the 24-week Rheumatoid Arthritis Prevention of Structural Damage (RAPID) 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT; NCT00160602), or who were American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20 non-responders at Week 16, entered the open-label extension (OLE; NCT00160641). After &#x02265;6 months treatment with CZP 400 mg every two weeks (Q2W), dose was reduced to 200 mg Q2W, the approved maintenance dose. Safety data are presented from all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose CZP (Safety population, n=612). Efficacy data are presented to Week 232 for the intent-to-treat (ITT, n=492) and Week 24 CZP RCT Completer (n=342) populations, and through 192 weeks of dose-reduction for the Dose-reduction population (patients whose CZP dose was reduced to 200 mg, n=369). Radiographic progression (modified total Sharp score change from RCT baseline &#x0003e;0.5) to Week 128 is reported for the Week 24 CZP Completers.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the RCT, 619 patients were randomized to CZP+MTX (n=492) or placebo+MTX (n=127). Overall, 567 patients (91.6%) entered the OLE: 447 CZP and 120 placebo patients. Of all randomized patients, 358 (57.8%) were ongoing at Week 232. Annual drop-out rates during the first four years ranged from 8.4&#x02013;15.0%. Event rates per 100 patient-years were 163.0 for adverse events (AEs) and 15.7 for serious AEs. Nineteen patients (3.1%) had fatal AEs (incidence rate=0.8). Clinical improvements in the RCT were maintained to Week 232 in the CZP Completers: mean Disease Activity Score 28 (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) change from baseline was &#x02212;3.4 and ACR20/50/70 responses 68.4%/47.1%/25.1% (non-responder imputation). Similar improvements observed in the ITT were maintained following dose-reduction. 73.2% of CZP Completers had no radiographic progression at Week 128.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with active RA despite MTX therapy, CZP was well tolerated, with no new safety signals identified.

Nonetheless, continued research is needed to evaluate their long-term efficacy and safety in RA patients. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a PEGylated anti-TNF Fab employed for treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe RA. Results from the Rheumatoid arthritis prevention of structural damage (RAPID) 2 randomized controlled trial (RCT) demonstrated rapid and significant improvements in signs and symptoms of RA after 24 weeks of treatment, using a loading dose of 400 mg at weeks 0, 2, and 4 followed by CZP 200 mg or 400 mg every other week (Q2W) + methotrexate (MTX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Patients who completed the 24-week RCT or who withdrew at week 16 due to lack of response were eligible to enter the open-label extension (OLE). In the OLE, all patients initially received CZP 400 mg Q2W + MTX for &#x02265;6 months, followed by a dose reduction to 200 mg Q2W, the approved maintenance dose of CZP. The primary objective of this paper is to assess the long-term safety and efficacy of CZP + MTX treatment up to 232 weeks (approximately 4.5 years) in patients with active RA. Additionally, we report efficacy analyses for patients who experienced dose reduction during the OLE and explore whether the timing of the initial response to CZP or lack of response upon OLE entry had an impact on long-term outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>The RAPID 2 OLE (NCT00160641) was conducted at 68 centers across 13 countries; the design of the phase 3 RAPID 2 RCT study has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the RCT, patients were randomized 2:2:1 to receive one of two regimens of subcutaneous (sc) CZP (200 mg or 400 mg Q2W) + MTX following administration of the loading dose (400 mg at weeks 0, 2 and 4), or placebo Q2W + MTX for 24 weeks. In the OLE, all patients initially received CZP 400 mg Q2W + MTX for at least 6 months, including patients originally randomized to 200 mg Q2W in the RCT. Following a protocol amendment, CZP dose was then reduced to 200 mg sc Q2W, the approved maintenance dose of CZP. This amendment was driven by data from RAPID 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and RAPID 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which demonstrated that 400 mg Q2W provided no additional benefit compared with 200 mg Q2W.</p><p>Both studies were conducted in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed patient consent and all appropriate ethical committee approvals were obtained for both studies. Full details of the ethical bodies and committees that approved the study for each center are provided in &#x0201c;Acknowledgements&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the RCT are reported in the primary publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In brief, eligible patients had active RA of &#x02265;6 months&#x02019; duration prior to screening and had received MTX therapy for &#x02265;6 months (stable dosage of &#x02265;10 mg/week for &#x02265;2 months prior to baseline). Changes in MTX dose were permitted during the OLE if clinically indicated, but MTX discontinuation was not. Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) other than MTX were not permitted during the RCT, but were allowed during the OLE; other biological therapies were prohibited throughout.</p><p>Two groups of patients were eligible to enter the OLE: (1) CZP or placebo patients who completed the 24-week RCT and (2) CZP or placebo patients who were American College of Rheumatologists (ACR)20 non-responders at both weeks 12 and 14 in the RCT, and were required to withdraw from the RCT at week 16.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Patient retention</title><p>Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate patient retention in the CZP intention-to-treat (ITT) population. This included patients who withdrew for any reason compared with those who withdrew due to an adverse event (AE) or lack of efficacy only. The annual dropout rate in the CZP ITT population for each year of the study is presented as a percentage and was calculated as follows: (number of patients on treatment at the beginning of the year who were no longer on treatment at the end of the year)/(total number of patients on treatment at the beginning of the year) &#x000d7; 100.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Safety assessment and analysis</title><p>The primary objective of the OLE was to assess the long-term safety of CZP + MTX treatment in patients with active RA. Combined safety data from the RCT and OLE are presented. The safety population included all patients who received &#x02265;1 dose of CZP in either the RCT or OLE. Data are reported from the time of first CZP exposure until last visit or patient withdrawal, plus 12-weeks follow up (i.e., five times CZP half-life + 14 days injection, or six times CZP half-life). AEs and serious AEs (SAEs) were assessed at every visit and classified by system organ class and preferred term according to the MedDRA dictionary v9.0. AEs are reported as exposure-adjusted event rates (ER) and incidence rates (IR) per 100 patient-years (PYs). The most frequent AEs by preferred term (ER &#x0003e;4.0 per 100 PYs) are also reported.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Concomitant medication use</title><p>Concomitant medication use was measured at each visit throughout the OLE and coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO-DD) 2004/Q4. Concomitant medications were those starting on or after the date of first study drug administration in the RAPID 2 RCT and on or before the last on-study visit in the RAPID 2 OLE. Use of concomitant medications is presented for all patients who entered the OLE and summarized by patients taking any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), any corticosteroid, any selective immunosuppressant, any anti-malarial drug, or any DMARD other than MTX.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Efficacy evaluations</title><p>Secondary objectives of the RAPID 2 OLE were assessment of the continued effectiveness of CZP + MTX treatment in patients with active RA, including analysis of the impact of treatment on physical wellbeing and quality of life. Efficacy data and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are presented from RAPID 2 RCT baseline to approximately 4.5 years of CZP treatment (220&#x02013;232 weeks) for the following populations: (1) all patients randomized to CZP (400 mg or 200 mg) in the RCT (CZP ITT population), (2) patients randomized to CZP (400 mg or 200 mg) who completed the 24-week RCT and enrolled in the OLE (week 24 CZP completers) and (3) patients randomized to placebo who completed the 24-week RCT and enrolled in the OLE (week 24 placebo completers).</p><p>Disease activity score in 28 joints (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) (DAS28(ESR)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], ACR20/ACR50/ACR70 response rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], health assessment questionnaire-disability index (HAQ-DI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], patient&#x02019;s global assessment of disease activity (PtGA) (using 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS)), and patient&#x02019;s assessment of arthritis pain (VAS) were measured at entry to OLE, at weeks 36, 48, 64, and 76, and then every 12 weeks throughout the OLE. Fatigue (VAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and short-form-36 (SF-36) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] were assessed at baseline, weeks 36, 48, and 76, and then every 24 weeks throughout the OLE. Continuous measures are reported as absolute values or mean changes from RCT baseline. DAS28(ESR) &#x0003c;2.6 remission is also reported. For PROs, minimally clinically important differences (MCID) were defined as decrease of &#x02265;0.22 points from baseline in HAQ-DI scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], improvements &#x02265;2.5 from baseline in SF-36 physical component summary (PCS) scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and improvements of &#x02265;10 mm in VAS scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Clinical disease activity index (CDAI) remission (CDAI &#x02264;2.8), simplified disease activity index (SDAI) remission (SDAI &#x02264;3.3) and ACR-European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2011 Boolean-based remission criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] using four variables (Boolean 4: swollen joint count (SJC) and tender joint count (TJC) &#x02264;1, C-reactive protein (CRP) &#x02264;1 mg/dL and PtGA &#x02264;1) and three variables (Boolean 3: SJC and TJC &#x02264;1 and PtGA &#x02264;1) were analyzed post hoc in the CZP ITT and week 24 CZP completer populations. The effects of CZP dose reduction in patients from the RAPID 2 CZP ITT population who initially received CZP 400 mg Q2W + MTX were analyzed post hoc by efficacy analyses (ACR20/50/70 and DAS28[ESR]) over 192 weeks exposure following dose-reduction.</p><p>Patients treated with CZP who completed the RCT were further stratified into early and late responders. Early responders were defined as clinical responses at week 12; later responders as responses at week 24, but not week 12. Responses were defined in two ways: ACR20 response (as defined in the protocol) or decrease from baseline in DAS28(ESR) &#x02265;1.2. Efficacy measures (ACR50, HAQ-DI, DAS28(ESR)) were compared post hoc in early vs late responders. Similar analyses also compared early and late responders with the ACR20 non-responder population, which included patients treated with CZP who withdrew at week 16 due to failure to achieve an ACR20 response, and week 24 CZP completers who were recorded as not achieving an ACR20 response at OLE entry.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Assessment of radiographic progression</title><p>Radiographs of hands and feet were performed at RCT baseline and endpoint and/or entry to OLE and weeks 48, 100 and 128.

Additional post hoc radiographic analyses (mTSS) were compared in early vs late responders (response defined by decrease from baseline in DAS28(ESR) &#x02265;1.2).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Efficacy results were analyzed descriptively with mean and standard deviations for continuous variables and with counts and percentages for binary variables. Observed data are presented alongside imputed data for all efficacy variables in the CZP completer, CZP ITT and dose-reduction populations. Non-responder imputation (NRI) was used to assess ACR responses. Additional analyses assessed ACR response using mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) imputation; the individual components were imputed using MMRM prior to calculation of response. Modified NRI was used to assess DAS28(ESR) low disease activity (LDA) and DAS28(ESR) remission for timing of response analyses. Missing mTSS data were imputed by linear extrapolation if at least baseline and one follow-up radiograph were available.</p><p>LOCF/NRI was used to assess DAS28(ESR), CDAI, SDAI and ACR-EULAR Boolean-based remission in the CZP completer and ITT populations. For LOCF/NRI analyses, missing values during the RCT and missing values for patients not entering the OLE were imputed by carrying forward the last available post-baseline composite score. For patients entering the OLE, missing values during the OLE due to patient withdrawal (AE or lack of efficacy) or data exclusion after rescue medication use were imputed as non-remitters, whereas missing values due to other withdrawal reasons, study completion, or a missing assessment were imputed by carrying forward the last available post-RCT entry score. If still missing, then the value was imputed as non-remitter.</p><p>MMRM imputation was used for all other efficacy variables; the MMRM model specifications had visit, gender, region, rheumatoid factor, and treatment in the original RCT as fixed effects. If the variable was changed from baseline, the baseline values were added as covariates. The visits of each patient were the repeated measure in the model. Additional analyses for all continuous efficacy variables were assessed using LOCF imputation. For PRO MCIDs, LOCF/NRI analysis was used.</p><p>Binary and continuous variables are presented using NRI and MMRM imputed values, respectively, because NRI is a more conservative imputation method than MMRM for imputing the components of responder variables.

Patient retention was high in the RAPID 2 OLE, which indicates an acceptable tolerability profile and sustained efficacy of CZP. However, it should be noted that patient retention in clinical trials is often better than in real-world clinical practice. Clinical (ACR20/50/70, DAS28(ESR)) and patient-reported (HAQ-DI, PtGA, pain, fatigue, SF-36 PCS) improvements in RA signs, symptoms, and physical function observed over the 24-week RAPID 2 RCT were maintained for up to approximately 4.5 years in both the CZP ITT and week-24 CZP completer populations, consistent with sustained improvements observed in the RAPID 1 study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Efficacy was also maintained in the dose-reduction population, demonstrating that CZP 200 mg Q2W + MTX was just as efficacious as CZP 400 mg Q2W + MTX during the maintenance phase.</p><p>Assessment of structural joint damage was documented for patients over 2 years of CZP treatment following the RAPID 2 RCT, and confirmed that TNF inhibition, here with CZP, can almost arrest long-term progression of joint damage in a majority of patients who completed the initial RCT. Radiographic progression in the week-24 CZP completers amounted to &#x0003c;1.0 point on the mTSS scale, which corresponds to an estimated irreversible disability increase of &#x0003c;0.01 in the HAQ-DI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] over more than 2 years.</p><p>Although direct comparisons with other anti-TNFs are limited by differences in study design and lack of head-to-head studies, the observed incidences of SAEs and fatalities in the RAPID 2 OLE were comparable to long-term studies of other anti-TNFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Similarly, the IR of serious infections reported in this study (4.1/100 PYs) is consistent with IRs reported from OLE studies of other anti-TNFs (ranging from 2.8/100 PYs to 6.4/100 PYs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and also with a recent pooled safety analysis of clinical CZP trials in RA (3.65/100 PYs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In terms of efficacy, ACR response rates reported for the CZP completers at week 232 also appeared similar to long-term data reported for other anti-TNFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Numerically higher ACR50 response rates and lower DAS28(ESR) scores were observed in early responders compared to later responders, confirming the importance of an early response to CZP for some long-term clinical outcomes. These results are consistent with a previous post-hoc analysis of the RAPID 1 study, which demonstrated that faster attainment of clinical response to CZP was associated with improved long-term outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This is also in line with recent EULAR recommendations, which state that if no improvement is observed after 12 weeks of treatment, physicians should consider adjusting therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, in patients receiving CZP in the RCT, timing of response made little difference to the proportions of patients reporting improvements in HAQ-DI &#x02265;MCID or experiencing radiographic progression. It should be noted that early response is likely important for long-term outcomes with other anti-TNFs and DMARDs, but this may not have been analyzed in as much detail as the RAPID 1 and 2 studies.</p><p>Lack of ACR20 response upon OLE entry appeared to be important for long-term ACR50 and HAQ-DI outcomes, but not for DAS28(ESR). A greater percentage of the later ACR20 responders achieved ACR50 responses and improvements in HAQ-DI &#x02265;MCID compared with ACR20 non-responders, whereas the percentages of later ACR20 responders and ACR20 non-responders achieving DAS28(ESR) LDA and remission were similar. This is in line with previous notions on the limitations of the DAS28 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. When compared to the CZP ITT population, ACR20 non-responders had similar long-term improvements in DAS28(ESR) scores, whereas lesser improvements were observed in HAQ-DI scores.</p><p>Limitations to this study included the relatively small number of patients who were evaluated. The drop-off in patient number towards the end of the study due to site closures in countries where CZP became commercially available made it impossible to report efficacy outcomes in patients with treatment duration &#x02265;4.5 years. Additionally, exposure-adjusted IR was a pre-specified safety outcome in this study; however, the incidence of AEs was not constant over the treatment period, which is the main assumption for the use of exposure-adjusted IR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>A major strength of this report relates to the method of assessment. Not only were data evaluated in patients who completed the RCT and consented to enter the OLE, but an ITT analysis was performed from the start of the trial, as requested by recent recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. While, expectedly, the response rates were lower in the ITT than completer analyses, long-term maintenance of response to CZP was fully confirmed as an overall result.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the phase 3 multicenter RAPID 2 RCT and OLE, assessment of CZP as an additional medication to MTX in patients with active RA confirmed that long-term efficacy of CZP was sustained for almost 5 years, with no new safety signals observed compared to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Efficacy was maintained following dose reduction from 400 mg to 200 mg Q2W, the approved dose of CZP, and early response to CZP at week 12 was again associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes. The long-term safety and efficacy of CZP reported here appears comparable to studies with other anti-TNFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], however, comparisons are limited due to differences in study design. These results not only confirm previously reported short-term data from the RAPID 2 RCT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], they additionally support and expand the results from the RAPID 1 clinical trial and OLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec23"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13075_2015_767_MOESM1_ESM.pdf"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
