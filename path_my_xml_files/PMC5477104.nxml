Our DC-based immunotherapy concept is guided by such bystander view and accordingly, we have developed a cellular adjuvant consisting of pre-activated allogeneic DCs producing high levels of DC-recruiting and DC-activating factors. This concept doesn&#x02019;t require MHC-compatibility between injected cells and the patient and therefore introduces the possibility of using pre-produced and freeze-stored DCs from healthy blood donors as an off- the-shelf immune enhancer. The use of MHC-incompatible allogeneic DCs will further induce a local rejection process at the injection site that is expected to further enhance recruitment and maturation of endogenous bystander DCs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twelve intermediate and poor risk patients with newly diagnosed metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) where included in a phase I/II study. Pro-inflammatory allogeneic DCs were produced from a leukapheresis product collected from one healthy blood donor and subsequently deep-frozen. A dose of 5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> DCs (INTUVAX) was injected into the renal tumor twice with 2&#x000a0;weeks interval before planned nephrectomy and subsequent standard of care.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No INTUVAX-related severe adverse events were observed. A massive infiltration of CD8+ T cells was found in 5 out of 12 removed kidney tumors. No objective tumor response was observed and 6 out of 11 evaluable patients have subsequently received additional treatment with standard tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Three of these 6 patients experienced an objective tumor response including one sunitinib-treated patient who responded with a complete and durable regression of 4 brain metastases. Median overall survival (mOS) is still not reached (currently 42.5&#x000a0;months) but has already passed historical mOS in patients with unfavourable risk mRCC on standard TKI therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings indicate that intratumoral administration of proinflammatory allogeneic DCs induces an anti-tumor immune response that may prolong survival in unfavourable risk mRCC-patients given subsequent standard of care. A randomized, multi-center, phase II mRCC trial (MERECA) with INTUVAX in conjuction with sunitinib has been initiated.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01525017">NCT01525017</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Metastatic renal cell carcinoma</kwd><kwd>Phase I/II study</kwd><kwd>Intratumoral administration</kwd><kwd>Vaccine</kwd><kwd>Allogeneic dendritic cells</kwd><kwd>Anti-tumor response</kwd><kwd>INTUVAX</kwd><kwd>Sunitinib</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Immunicum AB</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Despite the clinical improvement with VEGF and mTOR-targeted therapies in improving clinical outcomes in mRCC, resistance to these therapies develops in the vast majority of cases and despite of considerable efforts in sequential or combined modalities, durable remissions are rare. These facts have resulted in continued interest in novel immunomodulating agents for the treatment of mRCC. Notably, in a recent phase III trial with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab (a human monoclonal antibody targeting programmed cell death protein (PD-1)) given to patients with previously treated advanced RCC, overall survival was significantly increased when compared to standard second-line treatment with everolimus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Based on these results, nivolumab received approval from the FDA in November 2015 for the treatment of advanced RCC in patients who have received prior antiangiogenic therapy.</p><p>Mutation-derived and tumor-specific neoantigens are now increasingly recognized as immunodeterminants, as there is strong evidence that neoantigen-specific T cells are reactivated, following treatment with checkpoint blockade rendering them capable of mediating tumor rejection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. These results reveal that tumor-specific neoantigens are not only important targets of checkpoint blockade therapy, but can also be used to develop personalized cancer-specific vaccines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. To exemplify, this strategy was used successfully by Carreno et al. in stage 3 melanoma patients by promoting a diverse neoantigen-specific T cell response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Vaccination using autologous dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with patient-specific neoantigens was found to be safe, and none of the patients had evidence of autoimmunity. However, with this type of personalized DC-based vaccines, tumor tissue from each patient is required to identify and prioritize candidate neoantigens, which implicate coordination of tissue acquisition, collection of an autologous leukapheresis product, construction of a vaccine, and administration of the produced vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>One obvious way to circumvent practical problems associated with ex vivo production of a complete neoantigen-based vaccine would be to use the patient&#x02019;s own tumor in situ, as a direct antigen source by intratumoral administration of a potent immune enhancer. The immune-enhancing role would be to recruit and activate the patient&#x02019;s endogenous DCs and DC precursors to the tumor site, where they will encounter and engulf dying tumor cell and/or tumor cell debris, including the full array of &#x0201c;personal&#x0201d; mutation-derived neoantigens.</p><p>As to potential potent immune enhancers, recent studies have shown that injected autologous DCs, which have been pre-activated during a limited time period ex vivo, have the potential to indirectly prime na&#x000ef;ve CD8+ T cells in vivo, by acting as a pure immunogenic adjuvant and not as antigen presenters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This indirect immune enhancing function of DCs is strictly dependent on their active secretion of certain DC-and-NK-cell-recruiting chemokines at the time of administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In line with these data, pre-clinical findings indicate that the efficient induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CTLs), characterizing viral infections, is caused by cross-priming, where initially infected DCs produce a unique set of inflammatory factors that recruit and activate non-infected &#x0201c;bystander&#x0201d; DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In vitro studies, using human monocyte-derived DCs, have further shown than these cells can be programmed to produce vigorous amounts of T helper 1-associated chemokines and cytokines in a sustained fashion when stimulated with a combination of stimulatory factors, including Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands and IFN-gamma, thus mimicking virally infected DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, in the study by Pang et al., using transgenic mice, it was shown that no MHC compatibility was needed between infected DCs and &#x0201c;bystander&#x0201d; DCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. By using allogeneic DCs as immune enhancers in the vaccine setting, such cells will further be regarded as foreign allogeneic invaders that most likely will potentiate a T helper 1-deviated inflammatory reaction, further promoting recruitment and activation of endogenous &#x0201c;bystander&#x0201d; DCs at the vaccination site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>If the pro-inflammatory DCs are injected intratumorally, tumor-derived proteins (including tumor-specific neoantigens) will act as an antigen source for recruited endogenous &#x0201c;bystander&#x0201d; DCs. The final outcome of the proposed scenario is that recruited endogenous DCs will capture dying tumor cells and subsequently become activated into T helper 1 deviating DCs. These DCs will finally migrate to the tumor-draining lymph node, where they will prime tumor-specific T cells, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In line with this proposed scenario, supernatants from activated human monocyte-derived DCs (activated with a cocktail consisting of R848, poly I:C and IFN-gamma) have been shown to induce a phenotypic maturation of &#x0201c;bystander&#x0201d; immature DCs in vitro (15). Also, intratumorally or subcutaneously injected allogeneic bone-marrow derived mouse DCs, activated with an identical cocktail (except that human IFN-gamma has been replaced by mouse IFN-gamma), have been shown to both induce recruitment of immune cells into the vaccination site and migration of mature endogenous DC to the draining lymph node. Moreover, by loading subcutaneously injected allogeneic mouse DCs with a tumor antigen, a systemic activation of tumor-specific T cells was further demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Here, we present safety as well as immunological and efficacy outcomes from the first-in-human study in poor and intermediate risk patient with newly diagnosed mRCC, receiving 5&#x02013;20&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> DCs (INTUVAX) by a CT-guided injection into the renal tumor twice with 2&#x000a0;weeks interval before planned nephrectomy and subsequent standard of care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>INTUVAX production</title><p>INTUVAX was manufactured at the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliant facility of the Cancer Centre Karolinska (CCK), Stockholm, Sweden. Monocytes were isolated from a leukocyte concentrate from a healthy blood donor at the Blood Centre, Karolinska University Hospital. The monocytes were cultivated in CellGro&#x000ae; DC Medium (CellGenix&#x02122;), a serum free cell culture medium, supplemented with 100&#x000a0;ng/mL granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 20&#x000a0;ng/mL interleukin 4 (IL-4) (both cytokines from CellGenix&#x02122;). Thereafter, the cells were cultured in a closed system and incubated at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere. After differentiation, the CellGro&#x000ae; DC Medium was supplemented with 100&#x000a0;ng/mL GM-CSF and 20&#x000a0;ng/mL IL-4 and added to the cell suspension. To induce DC activation/maturation, toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/8 agonist R848 (2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL; InvivoGen), TLR3 agonist Poly I:C (20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL; Sigma-Aldrich), and human recombinant interferon gamma (IFN-&#x003b3;; Imukin) (1000&#x000a0;U/mL; Boeringer-Ingelheim) were added to the culture medium. After maturation of DCs, mature pro-inflammatory DCs were harvested and resuspended in heat-inactivated AB plasma obtained from the Blood Centre, Karolinska University Hospital, and supplemented with 10% DMSO. One mL of the cell suspension was filled in each cryovials (CryoTubes&#x02122;, NUNC) and subsequently deep-frozen to &#x02212;150&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, using a computerized gradient freezer (Planer) and thereafter transferred to a&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;150&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C freezer. The final product, INTUVAX, was thawed and assessed for release tests (including testing for sterility, mycoplasma and endotoxin) for clinical use. All doses of INTUVAX that were used in this study originate from the same batch.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>Men and women at least 18&#x000a0;years of age with newly diagnosed synchronous mRCC were enrolled. Inclusion required a size of the primary kidney tumor of at least 4&#x000a0;cm in longest diameter, as determined by CT, and at least one measurable distant metastatic lesion. Patients should have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &#x0003c;3 and were required to be candidates for nephrectomy and to have adequate hematological parameters. Therefore, patients with a life expectancy of less than 3&#x000a0;months, brain metastases, active or latent virus disease (HIV, HBV and HCV), other malignancy or ongoing active autoimmune disease, which required treatment with systemic immunosuppressive agents were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design and treatment</title><p>The study was a prospective single armed, open label phase I/II study. Patients on the waiting list for nephrectomy were enrolled in 3 cohorts of 3&#x02013;5 patients per cohort. All patients in the same cohort were treated at the same dose level, i.e. 5&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup>, 10&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> or 20&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> viable and MHC class II expressing DCs. Two CT-guided injections with 14&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3&#x000a0;days of interval were administered into the viable part of the primary renal tumor identified with contrast enhanced CT scan. All INTUVAX doses used in the study were from the same batch.</p><p>The planned nephrectomy was performed within 28&#x02013;42&#x000a0;days after the first vaccination. The patients were hospitalized for 24&#x000a0;h after each vaccination. The patients then returned to the clinic for safety visits one week after each vaccination, in connection with nephrectomy and 3&#x000a0;months after nephrectomy. Monitoring of vital signs, physical examination, safety lab and collection of adverse events (graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 4.0), were made at visits during the treatment period and at the follow-up visit, 3&#x000a0;months after nephrectomy.</p><p>Immunologic parameters including inflammatory immune serology, immune cell parameters, INTUVAX cell tracking and analyses using enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) were monitored in connection with the vaccinations (samples taken at the day for vaccination and the day after). To evaluate potential auto- and allo-immune events, auto- and allo-immunization parameters were evaluated at screening and at follow-up visit 3&#x000a0;months after nephrectomy. Information on disease progression and survival data were obtained for all patients. Tumor follow-up, according to Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria, was conducted at baseline and at follow-up visit 3&#x000a0;months after nephrectomy. An extended follow-up to evaluate clinical outcome was further performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Study oversight</title><p>This study was approved by the local ethics committee in Uppsala, Sweden, and was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines, as defined by the International Conference on Harmonisation. All patients provided written informed consent that was based on the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. A safety monitoring committee reviewed safety during this study. The study was designed by the authors in collaboration with the sponsor (Immunicum AB, Gothenburg, Sweden).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>End points</title><p>The primary endpoints were registration of adverse events and changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters from baseline. Secondary end points included evaluation of tumor-specific immune response using immunohistology parameters of the renal tumor post nephrectomy, tumor-specific ELISpot assay, inflammatory immune parameters, systemic cytokine and chemokine production, immune cell distribution and activation, vaccine cell tracking and evaluation of potential auto- and allo-immunization. Finally, tumor response by CT scan was evaluated, according to RECIST 1.1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Blood sample collection and storage</title><p>Heparinized blood was drawn before treatment, during the vaccinations, and at the end of the study. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by centrifugation on Metrizoate-ficoll (Lymphoprep, Nycomed/Axis-Shield PoC/Alere Technologies AS, Oslo, Norway) using a standard method, and thereafter aliquoted and cryopreserved for later use. Serum samples were also collected before treatment and at the end of the study and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>HLA-typing</title><p>At screening, evaluation of the patient&#x02019;s HLA-type (HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DR) was made. The samples were analyzed at the local clinical immunology laboratory at site (Dept of Clinical Immunology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden). HLA-typing of vaccine cell donor was also performed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Tracking of injected INTUVAX cells</title><p>Flow cytometry analysis for donor cell tracking was performed on peripheral blood samples (taken just before vaccination and 1&#x000a0;h and 20&#x02013;24&#x000a0;h after each vaccination) after lyzing of the erythrocytes with ammonium chloride and washing using a standard procedure. The samples were stained with combinations of murine monoclonal antibodies directly conjugated with fluorochromes (fluorescein isothiocyanate; FITC, phycoerythrin; PE, peridinin-chlorophyll protein; Per-CP or allophococyanin; APC). Staining was performed with antibodies specific for HLA class I antigens (HLA-A2 or HLA-A24) selectively expressed on INTUVAX cells, HLA-DR and CD86. The cells were incubated at 4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 15&#x000a0;min with antibodies in the concentrations recommended by the manufacturer. The cells were analyzed in a FACSCanto&#x02122; II flow cytometer using the FACSDiva software and dot plots and quadrant statistics from a four-colour analysis were generated. All antibodies, the flow cytometer and the software were from BD Biosciences (Mountain View, CA, USA). Results for each subpopulation were expressed as the percentage of leucocytes. The samples were analyzed at the Dept of Clinical Immunology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Serologic inflammatory parameters</title><p>Cytokines and chemokines were quantified from serum samples taken just before and 1&#x000a0;day after each administration of INTUVAX cells and 14&#x000a0;days after the second administration using a Bio-Plex human cytokine assay, a Bio-Plex 100 assay reader and the Bio-Plex Manager&#x02122; software (Bio-Rad Laboratories AB, Sundbyberg, Sweden). The analysis was performed according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The following inflammatory parameters were analyzed: IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, IL-17A, G-CSF. GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, MCP-1, MIP-1 beta and TNF-alpha. The chemokine RANTES was quantified by a commercially available ELISA (R&#x00026;D Systems, Abingdon, UK), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. The production of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-12p70, RANTES and MIP-1 beta was also analysed in supernatants from thawed and washed Intuvax cells cultured for 24&#x000a0;h in AIM-V culture medium at a concentration of 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL.

The samples were subsequently incubated for 5&#x000a0;min in peroxidase blocking solution (DAKO) to inhibit endogenous peroxidase. Consecutive sections from each tumor specimen were then incubated with antibodies against CD3 (polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD3; DAKO), CD4 (monolonal mouse anti-human CD4, clone 4B12; DAKO), CD8 (polyclonal rabbit anti-human CD8; DAKO), CD56 (monoclonal mouse anti-human CD56, clone 123C3; DAKO), CD68 (monoclonal mouse anti-human CD68, clone KP1; DAKO), HLA-DR (monoclonal mouse anti-human HLA-DR, alpha chain, Clone TAL.1B5; DAKO) and PD-L1 (monoclonal mouse anti-human PD-L1, Clone 22C3, DAKO-kit SK006, DAKO) for 30&#x000a0;min. A subsequent reaction was carried out using secondary antibodies (DAKO) at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 30&#x000a0;min. Then, the sections were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently the color was displayed with DAB (DAKO) for about 5&#x000a0;min. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin, dehydrated in ethanol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped.</p><p>For enumeration of CD8-infiltrating T cells, five different areas with most abundant positively stained cells in each section were selected and number of positve cells were counted under 400 magnification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

The product is composed of pro-inflammatory DCs that have been stimulated with a combination of potent activating factors, resulting in a residual strong production of desirable DC-recruiting and DC-activating factors at the time of injection. The local release of these factors within the tumor is expected to induce a local recruitment and activation of endogenous immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells, immature DCs and T cells. By using allogeneic DCs as vaccine cells, such cells will further be regarded as MHC-incompatible foreign invaders, most likely potentiating an inflammatory reaction that corresponds to an allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction (MLR), further promoting recruitment and activation of endogenous DCs at the vaccination site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Finally, engulfed tumor-derived proteins, including tumor-specific neoantigens within the injected target tumor tissue, are expected to act as antigen source for recruited endogenous DCs. The &#x0201c;final&#x0201d; outcome is that recruited endogenous DCs will capture dying tumor cells (killed by recruited and locally activated NK cells), and subsequently differentiate into T helper 1 deviating DCs. These DCs will finally migrate to the tumor-draining lymph node, where they will prime tumor-specific T cells, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells.</p><p>The safety profile in this first-in human clinical trial on newly diagnosed mRCC patients showed that INTUVAX was well tolerated. In terms of AEs, the related events reported were few, and mild to moderate in terms of severity.</p><p>In terms of immunologic safety parameters, there were no signs of any induced autoimmune reactions, as measured by standard serological tests, while a humoral donor-specific alloimmunization was seen in 3 patients. In terms of immunologic efficacy parameters, 5 out of 12 resected tumors exhibited a massive infiltration (&#x0003e; 200 cells/high power field) of CD8+ T cells, which compares favourably with historical data where a median of approximately 20 CD8+ T cells/high power field was reported among 105 examined RCC samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>No clear-cut correlation between number of infiltrating CD8+ T and the DC dose (5&#x02013;20 million cells/dose), degree of MHC-incompatibility between vaccine cells and recipients or fever reactions was however found.</p><p>Therapies targeting the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor have shown unprecedented rates of durable clinical responses in patients with various cancer types, including mRCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. One mechanism by which cancer tissues limit the host immune response is via upregulation of PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and its ligation to PD-1 on antigen-specific CD8 T cells. PD-L1 can be constitutively expressed on the surface of cancer cells through poorly characterized oncogenic signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] or alternatively, expressed in response to the presence of CD8+ T cells, producing immune-stimulating cytokines, including IFN-&#x003b3; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The latter process has been termed adaptive immune resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and represent a mechanism by which cancer cells attempt to protect themselves from immune cell-mediated killing. In line with this adaptive immune resistance process, findings by Tumeh and collegues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] indicate that melanoma tumor regression, following therapeutic PD-1 blockade requires pre-existing CD8+ T cells. Our present data, as to PD-L1 expression, are however highly surprising because strong CD8+ T cell infiltration, which was generally associated with strong HLA-DR expression on adjacent tumor cells (potentially indicating the presence of CD8-derived IFN-&#x003b3;) was associated with the abscence of, or low, PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. In contrast, the tumor with substantial expression of PD-L1 was one with poor CD8+ T cell infiltraton and concomitant low or absent expression of HLA-DR expression. These finding are, however, at least partially in line with a recent publication where no correlation was found between PD-L1 tumor expression and IFN-&#x003b3; or cytotoxic T cell gene signatures in RCC, while melanoma tumors exhibited the expected correlation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Taken together, these data may indicate that RCC expression of PD-L1 is mainly regulated by oncogenic signalling pathways.</p><p>In terms of clinical efficacy, none of the patients in our mRCC cohort exhibited any objective tumor response at 3&#x000a0;months, while the majority (five out of 8) of evaluable patients actually exhibited a tumor progression, according to RECIST 1.1. criteria.</p><p>The study was formally completed in March 2014, but the patients have thereafter been followed as to tumor progression, subsequent systemic treatment, tumor response to these treatment regimens and survival time. Three patients, all with sarcomatoid tumor features and with a rapidly progressing mRCC, only received palliative care after nephrectomy. Two of 3 patients, who so far have received subsequent therapy with sunitinib, have shown an objective tumor response and both responding patients exhibited a strong/massive infiltration of CD8+ T cells in their removed kidney tumor. One of these 2 patients exhibited sarcomatoid tumor features and the other patient had developed 4 brain metastases at the follow up visit 3&#x000a0;months after nephrectomy. Notably, the patient with brain metastases responded with a complete disappearance of all brain lesions and this response was still ongoing 38&#x000a0;months after initiation of sunitinib treatment. These two cases of objective tumor response upon subsequent sunitinib treatment are highly unexpected, since recent publications indicate that brain metastases as well as mRCC with sarcomatoid features are highly resistant to sunitinib treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These findings therefore indicate that INTUVAX given in conjunction with sunitinib may have a synergistic antitumor effect. Our hypothesis is that INTUVAX elicit a tumor-specific T cell response and that addition of sunitinib, which has been shown to affect and reduce the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], will unleash the tumor killing potential of INTUVAX-induced tumor-specific T cells. A synergistic vaccine/sunitinib combination effect has been observed in a mouse model and supports this hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Among 3 patients, receiving additional treatment with pazopanib, one has experienced an objective tumor response and another patient experienced a long-lasting (19&#x000a0;months) progression-free survival, after initiation of pazopanib treatment. In two patients, nephrectomy was followed by metastasectomy, one complete and one incomplete. A subsequent complete tumor regression, without addition of any systemic treatment, was observed in the patient with incomplete metastasectomy, but a local recurrence was noted 18 months later. Patient 5 is still tumor free, 46 months after radical metastasectomy. These data compares favourable with historical data from a group of 22 patients with mRCC, receiving targeted therapy followed by complete surgical resection of metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. These patients developed tumor recurrence at a median time of 10.5&#x000a0;months from metastasectomy.</p><p>Updated survival data (06 December 2016) for the whole patient group is, moreover, highly encouraging, showing that 5 of the 11 patients evaluable for efficacy were still alive. Median OS (from start of INTUVAX treatment) for the entire patient group was 42.5&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(yet not reached) months as compared to expected 14.7&#x02013;15.8&#x000a0;months mOS for poor and intermediate risk patients with newly diagnosed (treatment initiation within one year from diagnosis) mRCC receiving standard targeted therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In a recent publication on newly diagnosed mRCC patients with poor and intermediate prognosis (48% with poor prognosis according to IMDC criteria) treated with autologous DCs transduced with autologous tumor mRNA in combination with sunitinib, a mOS of 30.2&#x000a0;months was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Moreover, in a recent publication by Choueiri and collegues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] on patients with poor and intermediate mRCC prognosis a mOS of 30.3&#x000a0;months was reported for cabozantinib, as compared to 21&#x000a0;months for sunitinib. However, only 19% of the patients in the cabozantinib and sunitinib groups belonged to the high risk/poor prognosis subgroup (according to IMDC criteria) while 45% of our patients belonged to this IMDC subgroup.</p><p>There is only few historical data available as to mOS in the separate subgroup of newly diagnosed mRCC patients with high risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In the study by Powles and collegues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] the mOS for high risk patients, according to MSKCC criteria, was 9.0&#x000a0;months as compared to 32.8+ months in our MSKCC high risk subgroup. In the study by Amin and collegues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], the mOS for the high risk subgroup, according to IMDC criteria, was 9.1&#x000a0;months, as compared to 24.5&#x000a0;months in our IMCD high risk subgroup.</p><p>High base-line density of CD8+ T cells has been shown to be a good prognostic feature in a wide variety of solid tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In RCC, however, patients with highest intratumoral CD8+ T cell density have repeatedly been shown to have shorter survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In contrast to these historical RCC data, mOS for those 5 patients in our mRCC cohort with massive infiltration (&#x0003e; 200 cells/high power field) is currently superior compared to mOS for the other 6 patients with low or moderate CD8+ T cell density (44.1+ months vs. 33.5+ months). However, mOS in our subgroup of patients with low or moderate CD8+ T cell density also compares favourable with historical mOS data and 2 out of 3 patients with the currently longest survival time belongs to the subgroup with weak or moderate intratumoral CD8+ T cell infiltration.</p></sec><sec id="Sec36"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, these data indicate that intratumoral injection of INTUVAX is safe and induce a systemic antitumor immune response that may prolong survival in mRCC patients subsequently receiving standard of care.
