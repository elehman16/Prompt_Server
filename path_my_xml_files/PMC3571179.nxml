However, the adoption of this intervention at local level will entail significant changes in practice of care, in the division of health care work and in traditional professional-patient relationships and so will be contingent on the support of frontline health professionals directly responsible for its delivery. This was the rationale behind this theme 4 sub study within the Whole System Demonstrator evaluation study.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>To examine health professionals&#x02019; views and experiences of implementing telehealth and their retrospective judgements of barriers and facilitators to its success.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Methods</title><p>We undertook a 2-year qualitative longitudinal study. The method of data collection was semi-structured in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of frontline health professionals. The first year comprised baseline qualitative interviews with key health professionals directly involved in the delivery of telehealth in three Whole System Demonstrator sites: the London Borough of Newham, Cornwall and Kent. Interview participants included community matrons, teleheath monitoring nurses and general practitioners who deliver care to patients with long-term conditions. Follow-up interviews were conducted around one year later, prior to the end of the study and all interview data were thematically analysed and managed by NVivo.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results</title><p>Currently under embargo by DH.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Currently under embargo by DH.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Whole System Demonstrator</kwd><kwd>telehealth</kwd><kwd>health professionals</kwd><kwd>qualitative</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front></article>
