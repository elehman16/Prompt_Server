Ethical approval for this study was provided by the Institutional Ethics Committee. Written informed consent was obtained from the patients. The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02866409. This manuscript adheres to the applicable EQUATOR guidelines.</p><p>Eligible candidates were patients aged 18&#x02013;70 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I and II, undergoing elective craniotomy. During preanesthesia visit, patients were made familiar with the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) (0&#x02013;10, with 0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain ever).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Patients with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) &#x0003c;15, not able to comprehend NRS, incision extending beyond the field of the block, chronically on analgesics or narcotic medications, or patients planned for postoperative mechanical ventilation were not included in the study. Patients with postoperative GCS &#x0003c; 15, poor cognitive function, having fever (&#x02265;39&#x000b0;C), or require mechanical ventilation in the postoperative period were excluded from the study.</p><p>We conducted a pilot study in 10 patients undergoing craniotomy to observe severity of pain in the postoperative period who received bupivacaine infiltration at site of skin incision at the end of surgery. Assuming mean difference of 2 points in NRS with standard deviation (SD) of 2.5 (from pilot study), sample size in our study came out to be 47 subjects per group at a power of 90% and confidence interval of 95%. Expecting attrition, it was decided to include 50 patients in each group with a total of 150 patients in the study.</p><p>The 150 patients included in the study were randomly allocated into three equal groups (50 each) by computer-generated random numbers. If any patient was excluded in the postoperative period, the same random number code was allocated to the next patient to ensure an equal sample size without any modification in the original random number table. The random numbers were then kept in opaque-sealed envelopes, numbered sequentially. The envelopes were opened just before shifting the patient inside the operation theater and the study drug was prepared in 20 ml syringes by a person not involved in the study. The drug was administered as scalp block or infiltration after completion of surgery, and the postoperative data were collected by an investigator who was blinded to the group assigned to the patient.</p><p>A standard anesthesia technique was followed in all the patients. Injection morphine 0.1 mg/kg body weight was given as premedication. The patients were induced with propofol or thiopentone, and trachea were intubated following administration of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg. Anesthesia was maintained with intravenous or inhalational anesthetic agent along with nitrous oxide-oxygen mixture (60:40) and intermittent doses of intravenous vecuronium. Intravenous morphine was repeated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg if duration of surgery was &#x0003e;3 h. Total amount of intraoperative morphine in mg/kg was noted. Patients were reversed and trachea was extubated according to standard anesthesia protocol.</p><p>After the closure of scalp incision, patients in Group BI received incision-site infiltration with bupivacaine (0.25%), Group BDI received incision-site infiltration with combination of bupivacaine (0.25%) and dexmedetomedine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg), and Group BDNB received scalp nerve block with bupivacaine (0.25%) and dexmedetomedine (1 &#x003bc;g/kg). Supraorbital, supratrochlear, zygomaticotemporal, auriculotemporal, greater auricular, and greater and lesser occipital nerves were blocked. In all three groups, 20 ml of study drug was used. In infiltration group, 1/3<sup>rd</sup> of the total volume of the drug was infiltrated in the muscle while 2/3<sup>rd</sup> of the drug was injected into the subcutaneous tissue. To prevent local anesthetic toxicity, the dose of bupivacaine was kept &#x0003c; 2 mg/kg in all the three groups.</p><p>Patients were shifted to the Postanesthesia Care Unit (PACU) and were assessed for hemodynamic parameters, i.e., heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), respiration rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) on arrival and then at 15 min interval for 2 h. Patients were followed up for 48 h and these parameters were recorded at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 36, and 48 h after surgery. To check fitness for proper evaluation of NRS, patients were evaluated for cognitive function 30 min after shifting to PACU using a modified questionnaire of Short Orientation Memory Concentration (SOMC) test.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Subjects who were able to recall and count with minimal mistakes (1&#x02013;3) were regarded as good, &#x02265;3 mistakes were regarded as fair, and those not able to recall at all were regarded as poor cognitive function. In patients with poor cognitive function at 30 min, the same test was repeated at 1 h. If the grading was again poor, then that patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>Postoperative pain was assessed by NRS, wherein 0 meant no pain and 10 meant the worst imaginable excruciating pain.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It was assessed on arrival to PACU and at regular interval till 48 h after surgery. When NRS score was &#x0003e;4, rescue analgesic paracetamol 1 g was administered intravenously. Time of first rescue analgesic administration from the time of test drug administration was recorded as the pain-free interval. The total rescue analgesic requirement in 24 and 48 h was noted. Prolonged postcraniotomy pain was assessed using NRS by telephonic communication at 1- and 3-month interval, postoperatively.</p><p>Any adverse events such as bradycardia (HR &#x02264;40), hypotension (SBP &#x0003c; 90 mm of Hg) were recorded and treated by rescue drugs: atropine 15 &#x003bc;g/kg and mephentermine 3 mg/dose, respectively. Total amount of rescue drug requirement in 24 and 48 h was noted. Level of sedation in the postoperative period was assessed using Modified Ramsay Sedation Scale (MRSS).[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Respiratory depression (RR &#x0003c; 8 breaths/min) was recorded and managed accordingly. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was assessed on a 4-point PONV Scale with 1 as no PONV, 2 as mild PONV (only mild nausea/one emetic episode/nausea lasting &#x0003c; 10 min, 3 as moderate PONV (patient has 1&#x02013;2 emetic episodes/moderate to severe nausea and antiemetic therapy is required, and 4 as severe PONV wherein the patient has &#x0003e;2 emetic episodes/is nauseated more than twice/more than one antiemetic required to treat PONV. Rescue antiemetic ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg was given intravenously if PONV score was &#x0003e;2.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Any other complications were noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences, Chicago, IL, USA) version 22. The continuous data were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or median and interquartile range, as appropriate.

Hemodynamic variables HR, SBP, DBP, RR, and SpO<sub>2</sub> were compared by ANOVA. Pain scores, modified SOMC score, and PONV score were compared by Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test followed by Mann&#x02013;Whitney test for two groups. For time-related scores, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was applied. Pain-free period was skewed, so Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was applied and Kaplan&#x02013;Meier analysis was done. Rescue drugs, site of craniotomy were described as frequencies and percentages and were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test whichever was applicable. All tests were two-sided.

As the interventions were implemented in adults of both sexes, and in craniotomies involving all types of incisions, this could benefit all the patients undergoing craniotomies.</p><p>Regional anesthesia techniques in the form of scalp block and scalp infiltration block the nerves that supply sensation to the scalp and provide good pain control with lesser systemic adverse effects. The addition of dexmedetomidine to a local anesthetic agent for surgical-site infiltration or peripheral nerve block has been found to prolong the duration of analgesia in various studies.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Dexmedetomidine has been found to block the hyperpolarization-activated cation current (I<sub>h</sub> current) which is activated by the initial hyperpolarization of the nerve. The I<sub>h</sub> current is known to bring the nerve back to the normal resting potential state, and hence, its blocking by dexmedetomidine results in prolonged hyperpolarization of the nerve. The cited effect of dexmedetomidine upon the I<sub>h</sub> current appears to be more prominent in C fibers (pain) than in A alpha fibers (motor), and therefore, the predominant sensory block can be observed.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The scalp is richly innervated by C fibers and this may explain the prolongation of duration of analgesia in the BDNB and BDI groups where dexmedetomidine was added to local anesthetic agent bupivacaine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>In a study conducted by Bala <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] patients who received scalp block with 0.5% bupivacaine and epinephrine were found to be pain-free up to 4 h in the postoperative period.

Dexmedetomidine has been known to produce arousable sedation, i.e., the patient is sedated but responds to verbal instructions.[<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Incidence of PONV was lower in our study as compared to previous studies.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] It may be due to better pain control in the patients. None of our patients developed complications such as respiratory depression, hypoxemia, vascular puncture, scalp infection, or hematoma during the follow-up period.</p><p>Other strategies of analgesia including opioid derivatives such as tramadol, codeine, and morphine have been used in neurosurgical patients. However, these agents are being avoided for a long time owing to their potential side effects such as sedation, respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, and miosis which may mask the signs of an adverse intracranial event.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Respiratory depression resulting from opioids can lead to hypercarbia resulting in raised ICP.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Other options comprise of nonopioid analgesics such as NSAIDs and paracetamol. NSAIDs can increase the risk of bleeding as well as postoperative hematoma formation due to their antiplatelet function which could be fatal in neurosurgical patients.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] However, diclofenac if given preoperatively as a preemptive analgesic has been found to decrease the incidence as well as the severity of postcraniotomy headache in one of the studies.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] Paracetamol alone provides inadequate analgesia so must be used as a part of multimodal analgesic therapy.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>We did not have the record of preoperative headache in our patient population. Patients with headache in the preoperative period may have more analgesic requirement due to preoperative sensitization. This may be a limitation of our study. Second, we have not divided cases on the basis of supra- or infra-tentorial craniotomies. However, most of the cases included in this study were supratentorial in origin (86%). This may be another limitation of this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>We conclude that scalp nerve block using dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine may be considered as one of the method of choice for managing postcraniotomy pain. It is safe, efficacious, easy to administer, less time-consuming with very few side effects. Dexmedetomidine when added to bupivacaine as an adjuvant prolongs the duration of pain relief after craniotomy.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and
