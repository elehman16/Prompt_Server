We aimed to follow-up the Preschool Autism Communication Trial (PACT), to investigate whether the PACT intervention had a long-term effect on autism symptoms and continued effects on parent and child social interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>PACT was a randomised controlled trial of a parent-mediated social communication intervention for children aged 2&#x02013;4 years with core autism. Follow-up ascertainment was done at three specialised clinical services centres in the UK (London, Manchester, and Newcastle) at a median of 5&#x000b7;75 years (IQR 5&#x000b7;42&#x02013;5&#x000b7;92) from the original trial endpoint. The main blinded outcomes were the comparative severity score (CSS) from the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), the Dyadic Communication Assessment Measure (DCMA) of the proportion of child initiatiations when interacting with the parent, and an expressive-receptive language composite. All analyses followed the intention-to-treat principle. PACT is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN58133827.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>121 (80%) of the 152 trial participants (59 [77%] of 77 assigned to PACT intervention <italic>vs</italic> 62 [83%] of 75 assigned to treatment as usual) were traced and consented to be assessed between July, 2013, and September, 2014. Mean age at follow-up was 10&#x000b7;5 years (SD 0&#x000b7;8). Group difference in favour of the PACT intervention based on ADOS CSS of log-odds effect size (ES) was 0&#x000b7;64 (95% CI 0&#x000b7;07 to 1&#x000b7;20) at treatment endpoint and ES 0&#x000b7;70 (95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;05 to 1&#x000b7;47) at follow-up, giving an overall reduction in symptom severity over the course of the whole trial and follow-up period (ES 0&#x000b7;55, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;14 to 0&#x000b7;91, p=0&#x000b7;004). Group difference in DCMA child initiations at follow-up showed a Cohen's <italic>d</italic> ES of 0&#x000b7;29 (95% CI &#x02212;0.02 to 0.57) and was significant over the course of the study (ES 0&#x000b7;33, 95% CI 0&#x000b7;11 to 0&#x000b7;57, p=0&#x000b7;004).

Evidence shows that a range of psychosocial intervention approaches can have short-term effects on various developmental indicators that are thought to be important for later autism outcomes, such as parent-child joint engagement, social communication, child symbolic play, and social imitation. Follow-up data from one study showed improved language outcomes 5 years after the initial treatment endpoint.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, evidence is scarce as to whether such intermediate effects are associated with reduced autism symptom severity or improved longer-term post-treatment symptom outcomes.</p><p>In a Cochrane review,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref> Oono and colleagues identified six, mainly small, studies of parent-mediated interventions that addressed autism severity as a treatment outcome according to various blinded child assessment measures and non-blinded parent-reported measures. A random-effects meta-analysis of the reported mean symptom scores suggested an overall effect of intervention compared with control in terms of reducing symptom severity (standard mean difference &#x02212;0&#x000b7;30, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;52 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;08, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05; combined n=316). Three of these studies used blinded symptom outcome measures; these were the pilot study<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and subsequent larger trial<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref> of a 12 month pre-school autism communication intervention (Preschool Autism Communication Trial; PACT). In a separate meta-analysis by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE),<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref> the weighted combined effect size of the treatment used in these PACT studies was &#x02212;0&#x000b7;29 (95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;59 to 0&#x000b7;00, p=0&#x000b7;05; n=180) in favour of the intervention, as assessed with a standard blinded measure of the social communication-specific symptoms of autism (Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule [ADOS]-Generic [ADOS-G]).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> A third study also used the ADOS measure, and the results showed no effect on the symptom endpoint after 2 years of intensive treatment with the Early Start Denver Model (ESDM) intervention (n=48).<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> This trial of ESDM was the basis for one of two longer-term follow-up studies of autism symptoms to have been attempted so far. ADOS assessment was done at a mean age of 6 years, 2 years after the end of the intervention.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> In individuals who were followed up, the investigators reported significantly greater symptom reduction in intervention participants (n=21) than in regular care participants (n=18), although inferences from these findings were limited by the small sample size and lack of intention-to-treat analysis. In the other follow-up study of autism symptoms,<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref> no group differences were found 12 months after a 12 week teacher-mediated intervention (n=33) compared with controls (n=27) in terms of non-blinded parent-rated or teacher-rated autism symptoms assessed with the Social Communication Questionnaire at age 5 years. Other reports of long-term follow-up after intensive behavioural programmes have not addressed symptoms, but have suggested ongoing effects on IQ and adaptive behaviour,<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> albeit on the basis of non-experimental studies<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> or very small samples.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref></p><p><boxed-text id="cetextbox10"><caption><title>Research in context</title></caption><p><bold>Evidence before this study</bold></p><p>There has been relatively little study of long-term symptom outcomes after autism treatment. A Cochrane review from 2013 investigated parent-mediated intervention for young children with autism spectrum disorder and included six randomised controlled trials that reported autism symptom outcomes. Overall, the review showed reduced symptom severity with intervention compared with control conditions (standard mean difference &#x02212;0&#x000b7;30, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;52 to &#x02212;0&#x000b7;08, p&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05; combined n=316) on random-effects meta-analysis. Additionally we searched for intervention trials reporting on longer-term symptom follow-up after parent-mediated, teacher-mediated, or therapist-mediated early interventions for young children with autism spectrum disorder. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE for articles published between Jan 1, 2000, and May 6, 2016, using the search terms &#x0201c;autism&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;early&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;intervention&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;long-term&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;outcomes&#x0201d; and selecting studies that reported autism severity. We found two studies, one of which reported greater symptom reduction (assessed in a blinded manner) in participants followed up from the original intervention (n=21) compared with regular care (n=18) groups at a mean age of 6 years, two years after a 2 year intensive pre-school intervention. The other study found no effect on parent-reported or teacher-reported symptom questionnaires at 12 months after a 12 week preschool intervention (n=33) versus control (n=27).</p><p><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p>The two previous follow-up studies to test the longer-term effects on symptoms after interventions for autism spectrum disorder in young children were marked by small sample size and relatively short follow-up periods. Our study contributes now to the scientific literature in terms of its sample size (n=152) and the longer-term nature of the follow-up (nearly 6 years from treatment endpoint, with mean age of 10 years at follow-up) with blinded symptom ascertainment.</p><p><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p>Previous evidence from trials has suggested that early intervention can result in short-term symptom reduction in young children with autism spectrum disorder. We now show that a 12 month parent-mediated preschool intervention can produce sustained improvement in child autism symptoms and social communication with parents, which remained at nearly 6 years after the end of treatment. These findings support the potential long-term effects and value of early parent-mediated interventions for autism.</p></boxed-text></p><p>In this context, the aim of our present study was to investigate the long-term outcomes of the largest of the trials done so far, PACT, which assessed the effects of a developmentally targeted social communication intervention on autism symptoms and other outcomes in children aged 2&#x02013;4 years. The video-aided intervention in PACT works with the parent rather than directly with the child, aiming to optimise developmentally relevant parent interactive behaviours, which will in theory enhance parent&#x02013;child dyadic interaction, consequently improving child communication and more general autism symptoms. The logic of this treatment procedure is that the dyadic interaction is the proximal target of the intervention and the delivery mechanism by which the child gains benefit. The initial PACT trial tested this intervention against treatment as usual at three sites in a randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms (n=152).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> Trial data and associated mediation analysis<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> supported this model of the hypothesised treatment mechanism. A strong effect on the targeted parental behaviour (parental synchronous response to child communication during interaction) mediated 71% of improvement in child communication with the parent during interaction. In turn, this improvement in child dyadic communication mediated 73% of the independently assessed symptom change in the child in a different context.</p><p>Our predefined hypotheses were that, at follow-up, we would find enhanced effects of the intervention on the autism symptom outcome; continuation of the initial intervention effects on dyadic communication (parent synchrony, child communication initiations) and enhanced effects on reported adaptive functioning; and sustained reduction in restricted and repetitive behaviours of the child, accompanied by reduced anxiety, which has been associated with restricted and repetitive behaviours in some studies.<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> The design of the present long-term follow-up of the PACT trial therefore combined analysis based on the initial randomised intervention allocation with prospective repeated measure follow-up to test for downstream developmental effects of the intervention on later autism symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="cesec20"><title>Method</title><sec id="cesec30"><title>Study design and participants</title><p>PACT was a randomised controlled trial done at three specialist centres in the UK (London, Manchester, and Newcastle).<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> The PACT trial and follow-up study were approved by the Central Manchester Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (Manchester, UK).

The updated ADOS CSS coding, which has been published since our original report, reflects current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5)-defined autism spectrum disorder criteria by combining social communication and restricted and repetitive behaviours (which were reported separately in the original PACT endpoint report)<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> into an overall symptom severity score. This system allows for comparison across different developmentally staged ADOS modules. Scores range from 1 to 10, where scores of 1 and 2 represent minimal-to-no evidence of autism; 3 and 4 represent low severity; 5&#x02013;7 represent moderate severity; and 8&#x02013;10 represent high severity. Assessor training achieved the required reliability as shown by intraclass correlations from 52 double-ratings of 12 children assessed during the main trial and 50 ratings of 25 children assessed at follow-up of 0&#x000b7;73 (95% CI 0&#x000b7;58 to 0&#x000b7;84). The severity scales can also be calculated for the two component symptom domains; social-affect (SA) and restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRB).<xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref></p><p>Parent&#x02013;child dyadic communication was assessed via measurement of an 8-min video sample of carer&#x02013;child naturalistic play, using the DCMA.<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This measurement was obtained in a context independent of the context of therapy, with separate protocol and play materials to avoid circularity with the therapy process itself.

We present descriptive statistics for participants with data at follow-up. We used logistic regression to identify baseline characteristics associated with dropout and measures for which treatment groups were not balanced at follow-up. Analysis of all outcomes followed intention-to-treat principles. We estimated differences between the intervention groups at the mean follow-up age for the whole sample, under the assumption of attrition being at random, by the use of the maximum-likelihood method, adjusting for centre and variables for which groups were not balanced at endpoint or follow-up. We checked these estimates against whole-sample analyses in which missing observations were completed by multiple imputation using chained equations (<italic>mi</italic> command in Stata). Where available, we included repeated measures in mixed-effects models to improve the efficiency of estimation of group differences at follow-up, to provide additional effect estimates at earlier time points, to increase the likely validity of the missing-at-random assumption, and to allow calculation of the area-under-the-curve (AUC) treatment effect estimates. We modelled the effects of time by piecewise slopes between each assessment for each treatment group, with the AUC calculated as the sum of the triangular or trapezoidal areas between the groups. These AUC effect estimates provide a principled basis for an overall mean effect for unequally spaced measures that summarise treatment effect over the whole trial from baseline to follow-up. AUC effect estimates were obtained by use of the <italic>lincom</italic> post-estimation command.</p><p>Of the blinded outcomes, we analysed the ADOS CSS with mixed-effect ordinal logistic regression (<italic>xtologit</italic>) with random intercept and robust standard errors.

We used a structural equation model (described in the <xref rid="sec1" ref-type="sec">appendix</xref>) to estimate the group difference in the mean of a factor defined by each of the six language scores (<italic>sem</italic>). Of the non-blinded outcomes, the parent Vineland ABC scores were also analysed with a mixed-effects model.

We were able to trace 144 (95%) of 152 participants, 126 (88%) of whom consented to participate in the current study.

At follow-up, 43 participants were assessed with module 1 of ADOS, 22 were assessed with module 2, and 56 were assessed with module 3. The median length of follow-up (baseline to follow-up) was 82 months (IQR 78&#x02013;85), with median time from treatment endpoint to follow-up of 69 months (65&#x02013;71).

At follow-up, the point estimate of ADOS CSS showed a continuing group difference in symptoms, but with a CI that included the null (marginal log-odds ES 0&#x000b7;70, 95% CI &#x02212;0&#x000b7;05 to 1&#x000b7;47). Again, there was no evidence of effects varying with severity (proportional-odds test p=0&#x000b7;154). The proportion of high severity symptom scores in each group had increased (63% in the treatment as usual group and 46% in the PACT intervention group); a group difference of 17&#x000b7;2% (95% CI &#x02212;2&#x000b7;9 to 37&#x000b7;3) in favour of intervention versus treatment as usual. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> shows the course of autism symptoms by group from baseline to trial endpoint, and then to follow-up.

Parent report of adaptive behaviour, peer problems and prosocial behaviour showed moderate to substantial point estimate trends in favour of treatment, but CI's on all of these results included null or small negative effects. There was no evidence of treatment effect on co-occurring mental health problems on DAWBA.</p></sec><sec id="cesec90"><title>Discussion</title><p>We sought to assess the long-term outcomes of the preschool PACT intervention on autism symptoms and other outcomes. The results of our investigation show a treatment effect to reduce autism symptom severity at treatment endpoint, which remained almost 6 years later, giving a clear averaged treatment effect over the total period. The effect was apparent across both autism social-communication and repetitive symptom domains. A similar treatment effect is also seen in parent-reported symptom measures at follow-up which, although unblinded, have the potential complementary strengths of being service-user outcome measures and being based on knowledge of the child in naturalistic settings.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first study to report long-term symptom outcomes to middle childhood (7&#x02013;11 years) following a randomised controlled trial of early intervention in young children. As such, our results extend the findings from the smaller study of Estes and colleagues, with a shorter follow-up period of 2 years<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> that suggested follow-up effects on autism symptoms. Notably, the PACT intervention is substantially less time intensive than is Estes and colleagues intervention (ESDM) in terms of therapist treatment hours. Taken together, these results are encouraging and provide evidence that sustained changes in autism symptoms can be possible after early intervention, something that has previously been regarded as difficult to achieve.</p><p>Our findings also have substantial implications for developmental science, given that a sustained effect of this type on targeted outcomes for a prolonged period after the end of treatment is very uncommon in developmental interventions. PACT is designed to work with parents to reduce autism symptoms through optimising naturalistic parent&#x02013;child social communication in the home setting. The theoretical advantage of this approach over direct therapist&#x02013;child therapy is that it has potential for change in the everyday life of the child, in which much social learning takes place, and might continue to have sustained effects after the end of the therapist-delivered intervention to the parent. Evidence from the initial trial mediation analysis<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> supported this theoretical model of action by showing that it was the treatment effects on parent interaction style that were responsible for the positive child change during the treatment period. The current follow-up analysis shows a loss of this original treatment effect on parental synchrony over time, but maintenance of the effects on child communication and symptom-change. This finding suggests that the improvement in child communication and autism symptoms during treatment could have become self-sustaining during the years following the end of treatment, independent of the initial parental behavioural change that mediated them. This finding lends support to the theoretical rationale behind a developmental approach in which targeting of pivotal precursor social communication skills can lead to improvements in developmental trajectories, further supporting the notion that a parent-mediated approach can lead to sustained effects beyond the end of treatment. Further empirical study of the mechanism behind such maintained change is now needed.</p><p>Before the follow-up study, we hypothesised that the PACT intervention would lead to sustained reduction in restricted and repetitive behaviours of the child. Testing of this hypothesis in a prespecified analysis produced another important finding: the intervention, which was targeted at improving child social communication, also had marked cross-domain effects on the restricted and repetitive behaviours aspect of autism, seen both at endpoint<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and at follow-up, with the follow-up result reflected in ADOS CSS and parent-reported RBQ scores. We argue that this finding supports a developmental account of the emergence of restricted and repetitive behaviours as at least partly dependent on a lack of effective social communication during the development of individuals with autism. However, our related hypothesis that levels of child anxiety, which are often linked to levels of restricted and repetitive behaviours in autism,<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr"><sup>17</sup></xref> would also show a treatment effect at follow-up was refuted (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Amelioration of the defining symptoms of autism is positive in its own right; but, in longitudinal autism cohort studies, ADOS symptom trajectories also predict concurrent adaptive functioning and later long-range adjustment through to young adulthood.<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Estes and colleagues reported an effect on parent-rated adaptive function during their 2 year follow-up.<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> Our measures designed to address this aspect of autism were blinded teacher-rating of adaptive function in school, and non-blinded reports by parents of child adaptive function, peer relationships, and prosocial behavior. Point estimates of treatment effect on these measures range from modest to substantial size in favour of treatment, but CIs for the effect sizes were wide and included null or negative effects in each case (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">figure 2</xref>). Consequently we cannot be sure at this time of the existence or extent of the effect of symptom changes on general adaptation. We found no evidence of an overall effect on comorbid mental health problems; the only apparent effect, a small point estimate of effect on anxiety or OCD symptoms, had a wide CI that included both some negative and positive effect. These findings suggest that, at the least, additional strategies will be needed if broader adaptive function and mental health in autism at later ages is to be further improved.</p><p>The high rate of follow-up of what was already the largest randomised intervention cohort of its kind to address core autism features represents a key strength of this study; follow-up ascertainment was achieved for almost 80% of the recruited sample at 82 months after initial randomisation. Key measures were assessed in a blinded manner and consistently across time-points, although parent reports of repetitive behaviours and peer functioning were at follow-up only. Between-group demographic imbalances in the follow-up sample were adjusted for in the analysis. We note that our inclusion criteria were for core-defined autism rather than broader autism spectrum disorder; we cannot be sure how our results would generalise to young children with less severe symptoms.</p><p>This study advances previous work by showing that a theoretically derived, developmentally targeted early intervention can have a sustained effect on autism symptom outcomes nearly 6 years after the end of treatment. In addition to replication, further research is needed to elucidate the developmental mechanisms behind such sustained change, as well as the extent of and barriers to wider developmental benefits, and the cost-effectiveness of such interventions over longer-term development.</p><p>On the basis of these results, we are now able to support the use of the PACT intervention for reducing symptoms of autism in young children, a revision of our initial view<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> and consistent with the results of a subsequent UK NICE meta-analysis.<xref rid="bib8"
