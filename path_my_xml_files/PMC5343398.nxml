Most often, patients who suffered from polio start to experience gradual new weakening in muscles, a gradual decrease in the size of muscles (muscle atrophy) and fatigue years after the acute illness. L-citrulline is known to change muscular metabolism synthesis by raising nitric oxide (NO) levels and increasing protein synthesis. This investigator-initiated, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, trial aims to demonstrate that L-citrulline positively influences muscle function and increases muscular energy production in patients with PPS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Thirty ambulant PPS patients will be recruited in Switzerland. Patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two arms of the study (placebo:verum 1:1). After a 24-week run-in phase to observe natural disease history and progression, participants will be treated either with L-citrulline or placebo for 24&#x000a0;weeks. The primary endpoint is change in the 6-min Walking Distance Test. Secondary endpoints will include motor function measure, quantitative muscle force, quantitative muscle magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy and serum biomarker laboratory analysis</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this phase IIa trial is to determine if treatment with L-citrulline shows a positive effect on clinical function and paraclinical biomarkers in PPS.

To date, most regions in the world are certified polio free. However, poliomyelitis is still endemic in two countries worldwide (Afghanistan and Pakistan) with 74 reported cases in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>PPS is a condition that affects polio survivors years after recovery from an initial acute infection by the Poliomyelitis virus. Most often, patients affected by polio start to experience gradual new weakening in muscles which were previously infected by the original polio infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The most common symptoms include slowly progressive muscle weakness, fatigue (both generalised and muscular) and a gradual decrease in muscle size (muscle atrophy). The diagnosis of PPS relies nearly entirely on clinical information. Physicians diagnose PPS after completing a comprehensive medical history and physical examination, and by excluding other disorders that could explain the symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The exact incidence and prevalence of PPS is unknown. Due to the large number of polio survivors, in 2004 250,000 patients with PPS were estimated in Europe, 20 million worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Ragonese et al. showed in 2005 a prevalence rate for PPS of 31% (women more than men) in patients affected by poliomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The aetiology and pathogenesis of PPS are unclear. It has been hypothesised that the new weakness of PPS appears to be related to the degeneration of individual nerve terminals in the motor units. The usage of these recovered but overly extended motor units for years overstresses the neurons which, over time, lose their ability to maintain the increased work demands. This results in slow deterioration of the neurons, leading to reduced muscle strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>This hypothesis explains why PPS occurs after a delay and has a slow and progressive course. There are currently no effective pharmaceutical or rehabilitative treatments that can stop the deterioration or reverse the deficits caused by the syndrome itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>L-citrulline</title><p>L-citrulline (CIT) is a nonessential amino acid, not involved in protein synthesis. However, CIT plays a central part in cellular metabolism. CIT is produced but not metabolised in the gastrointestinal tract. More than 80% of the citrulline produced by the gastrointestinal tract appears to be taken up by the kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. CIT is then converted to L-arginine in the renal proximal tubules (via the enzymes arginosuccinate synthase and arginosuccinate lyase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. As a precursor of L-arginine, CIT is transformed into nitric oxide (NO) by nitric oxide synthase (NOS). El-Hattab et al. demonstrated that the intake of CIT in MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) patients showed a substantially higher increase of L-arginine and NO plasma concentrations than did the same dose of L-arginine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Both CIT and L-arginine support NO synthesis in a variety of tissues, including muscle tissue. Osowska et al. reported that with a CIT-enriched diet, protein synthesis improved and, therefore, the protein mass in the muscle could be increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. NO triggers mitochondrial biogenesis and enhances coupled respiration and adenosintriphosphate (ATP) production. This process is mediated via a cGMP (guanosine 3&#x02019;,5&#x02019;-monophosphate)-dependent signalling pathway that activates the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b3; coactivator 1&#x003b1; (PGC-1&#x003b1;), which is a master regulator of mitochondrial biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, CIT supplementation results in reduced fatigue and improved endurance for both aerobic and anaerobic prolonged exercise. It seems to interact with ATP production (in a beneficial manner) by increasing the efficiency of energy production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Single oral doses of CIT of up to 15&#x000a0;g are tolerated without any side effects in contrast to equivalent oral doses of L-arginine, where osmotic diarrhoea has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The same observations may be reported in our own studies (data not yet published) in which CIT (doses of up to 15&#x000a0;g/d) was administered to patients with Becker muscular dystrophy and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p><p>Unpublished results showed beneficial effects of CIT on muscle function and fatigue in muscular dystrophies. In both pathways, the stimulation of skeletal muscle protein syntheses via ATP production and mitochondrial biosynthesis stimulation could be potentially useful in other chronic neuromuscular disorders of neurogenic origin such as PPS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The study is an investigator-initiated, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, efficacy phase IIa trial and is conducted over a time period of 48&#x000a0;weeks.

If the patient still qualifies for the study, they will be definitively enrolled in the study. Two weeks after screening, self-report questionnaires are filled in a second time by patients to evaluate the questionnaires for test-retest reliability. During visit 3 (week 24), the following procedures will be performed: 6MWD; vital signs; physical examination; self-report questionnaires; MFM scale; QMT; muscle MRI; adverse events; blood draw (laboratory analysis) and urine pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential.

The 6MWD is a validated tool to measure the distance that an individual is able to walk over a total of 6&#x000a0;min on a hard, flat surface. The goal for the individual is to walk as far as possible in 6&#x000a0;min.

It includes 32 items that evaluate three dimensions of motor performance, including specific motor functions, such as transfers and standing posture (D1), proximal and axial (D2) and distal (D3) and a total MFM score involving all of the motor dimensions. The items are scored and summed to comprise a total score where the maximum represents normal motor function.

Visual and semiquantitative muscle MRI studies have been applied in inherited neuromuscular disorders, including SMA, and have identified anatomical abnormality, such as absent, aberrant, or accessory muscles, changes in tissue composition, such as fatty infiltration or increased water content, and masses or mass-like lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We use the IDEAL-CPMG sequence allowing simultaneous T<sub>2</sub> and lipid quantitation and dynamic Phospho-magnet resonance (<sup>31</sup>P-MR) spectroscopy that quantifies the kinetics of phosphocreatine (PCr), ATP and intracellular pH in lower leg muscles during rest, exercise and recovery. As this sequence is not tested previously in an age-correlated group of people without neuromuscular disorders, up to 20 age- and gender-correlated subjects will be examined additionally at one time point.</p><p>In neuromuscular disorders, quantitative muscle MRI (qMRI) detects disease progression more sensitively compared to other clinical scores.

The IBM-FRS (Inclusion Body Myositis Functional Rating Scale) and the WHOQOL (World Health Organisation &#x02013; Quality of Life) &#x02013; BREF questionnaire are widely used and validated scales to assess motor function especially in patients with asymmetric neuromuscular conditions, such as inclusion body myositis, and/or quality of life regardless of any underlying condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].

A randomisation scheme called Big Stick Design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] with a maximum tolerated imbalance (MTI) between groups of two patients will be applied. The randomisation corresponds to tossing a fair coin as long as the difference in group sizes does not exceed the MTI. If the MTI is reached, a deterministic allocation is performed so that the difference in group sizes is reduced. For emergency breaking of the group assignment, unblinding envelopes are provided. These envelopes have a window in which only the running patient&#x02019;s ID is visible and contain an unblinding form that states the patient&#x02019;s group assignment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Sample size estimation</title><p>It is assumed that patients in the verum group will on average have a 25% longer 6MWD after 24&#x000a0;weeks of treatment with CIT compared to baseline. It is further assumed that patients in the placebo group will on average have no improvement, but also no deterioration with regard to the 6MWD over the 24&#x000a0;weeks of placebo treatment. For sample size estimation, a data set from a study of patients with Becker&#x02019;s muscular dystrophy (BMD) treated with the same CIT dose for 6&#x000a0;weeks was used (performed at the University of Basel Children&#x02019;s hospital, publication in preparation). Patients (mean age 31&#x000a0;years) were assigned to CIT treatment for the duration of 6&#x000a0;weeks and their 6 MWD was measured at baseline and follow-up.

The multivariate normal distribution was parameterised by the mean 6MWD at baseline from the BMD data set, the mean 6MWD at follow-up (mean baseline value augmented by the expected relative increase <italic>&#x003b8;</italic>
<sub>i=1,&#x02026;41</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1, &#x02026;, 0.5), and the variance-covariance matrix as estimated from the BMD data set. The patients were randomised in a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio to the placebo and the verum group, respectively, in order to examine the effect of the randomisation ratio on sample size. The resulting data set was analysed with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with 6MWD follow-up measurement as response, 6MWD baseline measurement as adjusting covariate and treatment group (placebo versus verum) as explanatory variable of interest. Finally, it was tested whether there was a difference between the placebo and verum groups.</p><p>For an expected mean increase in 6MWD of 25% in the verum group, 28 subjects need to be recruited to obtain 25 evaluable patients, assuming a dropout rate of 10% and when randomising patients 1:1 to placebo and verum, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). To further increase the sensitivity, a similar 24-week run in observational period will be performed in all patients before active or placebo treatment. The latter should help within the placebo group to separate natural history changes from placebo effects during the treatment period.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Randomisation placebo:verum 1:1.

Affected patients suffer from severe impairment that justifies an attempt to improve this condition using an almost side-effect-free treatment.</p><p>The participation in this study is voluntary. If the patients do not want to participate, they will not experience any disadvantages concerning any further medical treatment. The same applies if the patients withdraw the consent at a later time point. They have this possibility at any time. Possible withdrawal of consent from the study can occur without giving any reason. In case of withdrawal the data collected until this time point will be used and the samples (blood) collected in the context of the study will be destroyed. In case of withdrawal the patient will undergo a final visit for a medical examination for his own safety.</p><p>A placebo group is necessary to demonstrate the efficacy of the used medication (CIT) and to exclude a possible placebo effect.</p><p>There is a great potential that positive results of this study could lead to other large multicenter trials. Furthermore, if we can show an effect of CIT on muscle function, this will be a major breakthrough and mean a better symptomatic treatment of the muscle degeneration that occurs in PPS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The aim of this investigator-initiated, randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, phase IIa trial is to examine whether treatment with CIT has a beneficial effect on clinical muscle function and fatigue and on the surrogate biomarkers that assess muscle ATP production and mitochondrial function in PPS. If this turns out to be the case, a cost-effective, symptomatic therapy with CIT could be available for these patients.</p><p>As PPS is a very heterogeneous disease, all patients will undergo a 24-week observational (untreated) period to observe the natural history of the disease. For the primary endpoint the 6MWD was chosen, which implies that all included patients are still ambulatory. As physical fatigue is one of the major and most limiting symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the 6MWD seems to be the ideal endpoint to observe positive effects on muscle function, and to assess fatigue and endurance due to CIT intake. Furthermore, due to the asymmetric nature of the disorder the 6MWD seems to be optimal regardless of whether walking impairment is caused by the right or left proximal or distal leg being affected.</p><p>The MFM is a scale used in neuromuscular diseases to assess their severity and progression. It is used by physiotherapists or rehabilitation physicians and is useful to observe motor function changes in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The test includes 32 items including specific motor functions such as transfers and standing (D1), proximal and axial (D2) and distal (D3). The total MFM score involves all the motor dimensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and can, therefore, also detect motor function changes in body parts which are not involved in walking and are not evaluated in the 6MWD.</p><p>In order to increase sensitivity and to detect subclinical positive effects on muscle mass and muscle metabolism, quantitative muscle MRI (qMRI) is performed. We and others have demonstrated that qMRI is more sensitive than clinical evaluation and visual analysis of MRI scans and it also shows an excellent reproducibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. qMRI is a powerful technique to evaluate neuromuscular and muscular disorders in a noninvasive way for evaluation of disease progression and, furthermore, it is a good biomarker in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Kinali et al. showed a good correlation between muscle histology and MRI changes in patients with DMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Furthermore, to investigate ATP in human muscle in vivo, <sup>31</sup>P-MR spectroscopy is used (during rest, exercise and recovery). With this method, the mitochondrial function and the regeneration of ATP after muscle exercise could be investigated.</p><sec id="Sec26"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial started enrolment in June 2016 and is expected to be completed by the end of August 2017.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec27"><title>Additional file</title><p>
