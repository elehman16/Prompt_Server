The aim of the present study was to gain a community wide perspective of the effects of RS types 2 (RS2) and 4 (RS4) on the fecal microbiota in human individuals.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Ten human subjects consumed crackers for three weeks each containing either RS2, RS4, or native starch in a double-blind, crossover design. Multiplex sequencing of 16S rRNA tags revealed that both types of RS induced several significant compositional alterations in the fecal microbial populations, with differential effects on community structure. RS4 but not RS2 induced phylum-level changes, significantly increasing Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes while decreasing Firmicutes. At the species level, the changes evoked by RS4 were increases in <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic> and <italic>Parabacteroides distasonis</italic>, while RS2 significantly raised the proportions of <italic>Ruminococcus bromii</italic> and <italic>Eubacterium rectale</italic> when compared to RS4. The population shifts caused by RS4 were numerically substantial for several taxa, leading for example, to a ten-fold increase in bifidobacteria in three of the subjects, enriching them to 18&#x02013;30% of the fecal microbial community. The responses to RS and their magnitudes varied between individuals, and they were reversible and tightly associated with the consumption of RS.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that RS2 and RS4 show functional differences in their effect on human fecal microbiota composition, indicating that the chemical structure of RS determines its accessibility by groups of colonic bacteria. The findings imply that specific bacterial populations could be selectively targeted by well designed functional carbohydrates, but the inter-subject variations in the response to RS indicates that such strategies might benefit from more personalized approaches.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The gastrointestinal microbiota is of profound importance for the human host, affecting its metabolism, immune functions, and physiology with implications to health <xref rid="pone.0015046-Gordon1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Nicholson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Not only are these microbial populations involved in the prevention of gastrointestinal infections and stimulation of the immune system, but recent research has indicated a role of the gut microbiome in complex diseases such as colon cancer, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory bowel disease <xref rid="pone.0015046-Cani1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Flint1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Tannock1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The implications of these cohesions cannot be overstated; if the gut microbiota influences health, it stands to reason that dietary factors which influence species composition and metabolic characteristics of the gut microbiota are strong candidates for disease prevention and intervention. Dietary components that are resistant to human digestion are considered the most significant source of nutrients for colonic bacteria, and they thus offer a promising tool for the modulation of the gut microbiota <xref rid="pone.0015046-Louis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>Resistant starches (RS) are starches or products of starch degradation that escape digestion and are not absorbed in the small intestine of healthy individuals <xref rid="pone.0015046-Asp1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. RS are classified into four categories according to the features that render it undigestible. RS type 1 is physically inaccessible starch whereas RS type 2 (RS2) is native granular starch consisting of ungelatinized granules. RS type 3 is retrograded amylose, and finally, RS type 4 (RS4) is chemically modified to achieve undigestibility. Several studies have shown RS have the potential to improve health, with one of the primary benefits being maintenance of healthy blood sugar levels <xref rid="pone.0015046-Behall1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Nilsson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Though resistant to digestion in the small intestine, bacterial species that reside in the colon are capable of utilizing RS as a substrate. These fermentations lead to an increase of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), especially butyrate, and a reduction of secondary bile acids, phenol, and ammonia <xref rid="pone.0015046-Louis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Nugent1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These metabolic effects are likely to underlie some of the documented health benefits of RS, which include the prevention of colon cancer development and colitis in animal models <xref rid="pone.0015046-BauerMarinovic1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-LeLeu1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Moreau1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Toden1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Several studies have been performed to characterize the potential of RS to induce alterations in the composition of the gut microbiota.

Unfortunately, most studies have been performed in either <italic>in vitro</italic> systems or animal models <xref rid="pone.0015046-Crittenden1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. To our knowledge, there were two previous studies that have used culture independent methods to characterize the effect of RS in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. Abell and coworkers, who used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) to study the impact of RS2 on the human gut microbiota and revealed an enrichment of phylotypes related to <italic>Ruminococcus bromii</italic>
<xref rid="pone.0015046-Abell1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.

This technique has been extremely valuable, for example, in the characterization of the human microbiota in terms of lean and obese physiological states, impact of antibiotics, and the importance of delivery mode at birth <xref rid="pone.0015046-Dethlefsen1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-DominguezBello1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Turnbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Pyrosequencing has significant advantages over other molecular techniques currently used to study microbial communities. First, unlike probe based techniques such as fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), pyrosequencing allows the determination of the entire phylogenetic spectrum of the bacterial populations in one single analysis. Second, it further allows an immediate taxonomic characterization and the flexibility to analyze the communities at different taxonomic levels. Third, pyrosequencing has a markedly increased dynamic range when compared to more traditional fingerprinting techniques such as DGGE <xref rid="pone.0015046-Hamady1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>The goal of the present study was to obtain a community wide perspective of the impact of RS on the composition of the human gut microbiota. We were further interested to compare RS4 and RS2 in this respect because most emphasis in the literature has been placed on the latter substrate. To achieve our goal, we conducted a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover trial with 10 human subjects and performed a comprehensive characterization of their fecal microbiota by using a combination of approaches, including pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015046-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0015046-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0015046.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design used in this study.</title><p>Subjects (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) participated in a 17-week double-blind crossover design, in which 3 dietary treatments were assessed: 100 g of crackers containing either native starch or 33 g of RS2 or RS4.

The control crackers included in the study (providing a daily dose of more than 55 gram of native starch) did not have a significant impact on the fecal microbiota, as the microbial populations during administration of these crackers showed little difference to those during baseline and washout periods. In contrast, RS significantly affected several groups of colonic bacteria, with the two types of RS exerting functional differences in terms of their ability to modulate the gut microbiota.

First we identified OTUs that were affected through the dietary treatments in individual subjects. We then constructed phylogenetic trees with representative sequences of these OTUs according to phylum, which are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0015046-g002">Figures 2A</xref> (for Firmicutes), 2B (for Actionobacteria), and 2C (Bacteroidetes). The abundance of the OTUs in all ten subjects was then quantified by local BLASTn.

<xref rid="pone.0015046-KovatchevaDatchary1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Leitch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. The same bacterial groups, with the exception of bifidobacteria, were also enriched in fecal samples of obese human subjects during consumption of RS3 <xref rid="pone.0015046-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In contrast, our findings clearly showed that the response of the fecal microbiota to RS4 differed to that of RS2 and RS3. For example, <italic>Parabacteroides distasonis</italic> was enriched through RS4, while <italic>Eubacterium rectale</italic> and <italic>Ruminococcus bromii</italic> showed a significant decrease. Strikingly, RS4 also led to phylum level alterations, decreasing the proportion of Firmicutes while increasing Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. Such phylum level changes have not been observed in fecal samples of human subjects consuming RS2 in our study and RS3 as shown by Walker and coworkers <xref rid="pone.0015046-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>.</p><p>There was very little overlap in the bacterial groups that responded to both RS2 and RS4. This was surprising as the RS types used in this study were both starch polysaccharides that consist of glucose monomers with the same covalent bonds, although the RS4 was cross-linked by phosphorylation. One of the bacterial groups that responded to both RS types was the genus <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic>, which increased in six subjects with RS4 and in five of the same subjects with RS2. However, the temporal dynamics of these modulations differed. RS2 led to a much slower raise in bifidobacteria, reaching comparable numbers to RS4 only in week three. This clearly showed that time is an important variable when studying dietary modulations of the human gut microbiota. It appears that the ability to increase levels of bifidobacteria is comparable between RS2 and RS4 in the long run, but extended feeding studies will be necessary to determine the exact taxon-time patterns of responses to different forms of RS.</p><p>Questions remain about the mechanisms by which different RS types selectively promote groups of colonic bacteria in humans <italic>in vivo</italic>. Starch fermentation per se should not be selective as many bacterial genera (<italic>Clostridium</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium, Butyrivibrio</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic>, <italic>Roseburia</italic>, <italic>Eubacterium</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus</italic>, etc.) present in the human GIT can utilize this substrate <italic>in vitro</italic>, and various bacterial systems involved in the degradation of starch have been identified by genomic approaches <xref rid="pone.0015046-Louis1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-KovatchevaDatchary1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Bird1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Cho1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-DElia1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Duncan1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Flint2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Ryan1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Schell1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, our <italic>in vivo</italic> findings showed that substrate preferences and competitive abilities exist in the gut environment. In this respect, it is important to point out that the RS types used in this study varied markedly in terms of their chemical structure. RS2 is a granular form of high amylose corn starch, while RS4 is a chemically modified starch that is cross-linked through phosphate moieties. Therefore, it is possible that different groups of colonic bacteria produce enzymes with distinct activities towards the two RS types, promoting different dynamics in the gut ecosystem. However, it is also of note that the ability of bacterial groups to make use of RS <italic>in vivo</italic> might relate not only to the utilization but also to the binding of the substrate. It is striking that <italic>Ruminococcus bromii</italic>, <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic>, and <italic>Eubacterium rectale</italic>, which showed the most substantial increases in the human gut in response to RS2, have also been shown to form highly selective associations with this substrate <xref rid="pone.0015046-Leitch1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Therefore, the adherence of bacteria to starch granules might constitute an important first step in the utilization of this substrate, and groups of colonic bacteria might differ in their ability to adhere to granules of RS2 and RS4. The mechanisms by which different types of RS become fermented in the human colon remain an important area of future research.</p><p>A significant finding of this study was the individualized responses of the gut microbiota to RS2 and RS4, which has also been shown previously for RS3 <xref rid="pone.0015046-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Out of the nineteen OTUs that were detected to respond during this study in individual subjects, eleven did not reach significance when all subjects were included in the analysis (e.g. <italic>Bifidobacterium longum</italic>, <italic>Ruminococcus obeum</italic>, <italic>Roseburia intestinalis</italic>, <italic>Roseburia inulinivorans</italic>, and several <italic>Bacteroides spp.</italic>). In addition, none of the taxa that were significantly affected by RS showed a response in all ten subjects. There are three possible explanations for the individuality of the responses. First, few OTU are completely conserved among humans <xref rid="pone.0015046-Turnbaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Tap1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, thus species that were affected in some subjects might simply not be present in other individuals. Second, strain-level differences in the ability to utilize substrates could contribute to the inter-individual variations. For example, it has been shown for <italic>Bifidobacterium adolescentis</italic> that individual strains can have major differences in their amylolytic activity <xref rid="pone.0015046-Crittenden2" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Ramsay1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Lastly, host factors might play an important role. For example, subject specific environmental constrains (e.g. through limitations in growth factors other than carbohydrates) might restrict the ability of a bacterial group to increase in numbers even if a suitable growth substrate is provided. In addition, differences in host genotype might influence transit times or the amount of digestive enzymes secreted, thus affecting the fraction of RS that survives digestion.</p><p>There is currently no scientific consensus of what defines a healthy human microbiota in terms of its composition. Therefore, predictions on the consequences of the compositional alterations induced through RS2 and RS4 in terms of health remain speculative. Nevertheless, the distinct effects of RS2 and RS4 on the microbial community in the gut suggest that these substrates could have a different impact on the host. RS2 promoted <italic>Eubacterium rectale</italic>, a species associated with high butyrate production <xref rid="pone.0015046-Flint1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, a trait that could be especially beneficial in the prevention of inflammation and colon cancer <xref rid="pone.0015046-McIntyre1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Scheppach1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. In contrast, RS4 reduced the amount of Firmicutes in favor of Bacteroidetes and bifidobacteria. Such a shift in the gut microbiota could be especially beneficial in the prevention or treatment of obesity and related metabolic disorders. A microbiome enriched in Firmicutes has been associated with an increased capacity for energy harvest and obesity <xref rid="pone.0015046-Ley2" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0015046-Turnbaugh2" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, and a reduction of this phylum could therefore reduce the amount of calories extracted from the diet. Furthermore, bifidobacteria have been linked to metabolic and immunological improvements related to type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0015046-Cani2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. As we gain a better understanding about the contributions of members of the gut microbiota to disease, knowledge as obtained during this study can aid in a more systematic selection of carbohydrates for intervention studies.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrated that RS2 and RS4 promote distinct compositional alterations within the human gut microbiota. These functional differences imply that specific bacterial populations can be selectively targeted by starches with different chemical structures. If future research will reveal causative associations between dysbiosis and disease, then selective dietary strategies that redress these imbalances have potential to improve health. However, the individualized responses observed during this study certainly pose a hurdle to developing universal dietary recommendations, and they imply that more personalized strategies that target the gut microbiome might enhance the success rate of such applications.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The human trial of this study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Nebraska (IRB Approval Number: 2008038840EP), and written informed consent has been obtained from all subjects.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Preparation of RS crackers</title><p>Three types of crackers, containing either RS2 (Hi-Maize 260, National Starch and Chemical Corp., Bridgewater, N.J., USA), RS4 (Fibersym&#x000ae; RW, MGP Ingredients, Atchison, Kansas, USA), or native wheat starch (Midsol 50, MGP Ingredients, Atchison, Kansas, USA), were prepared at the American Institute of Baking International (Manhattan, Kansas).

None of the subjects had been on antibiotics or on a vegetarian diet within three months prior to the start of the study or throughout its duration. Three subjects stopped their participation for reasons unrelated to the study. Thus, the study was completed by ten subjects (five males and five females) between 23 and 38 years of age. The study was conducted over a 17-week period, beginning with a two-week baseline period (no crackers administered). The subjects then consumed 100 gram per day of the different crackers in sequence, each for three weeks, interspersed by 2-week washout periods. The study finished with a 2-week washout. Fecal samples were collected weekly, resulting in a total of 161 fecal samples for the entire study. For reasons unrelated to the study, we were unable to collect a total of 9 fecal samples distributed among five subjects. All missing samples corresponded to washout periods, and their omission did therefore not affect the statistical analysis.</p><p>Subjects completed a symptoms diary to assess the potential side effects of RS administration. The symptoms included were bowel movement, stool consistency, discomfort, flatulence, abdominal pain, and bloating, and subjects were asked to score them on a scale from 1 (none, normal, good well-being) to 5 (severe symptoms and discomfort).</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Collection of fecal samples and analysis by selective culture</title><p>Fresh fecal samples were processed within an hour of defecation.

First, the Classifier tool (with a minimum bootstrap value of 80%) of the RDP was applied to obtain a taxonomic assignment of all sequences. This approach allowed a fast determination of the proportions of bacterial groups at different taxonomic levels (phylum, family, genus). Second, sequences were assigned to Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) that were quantified in individual subjects. As the entire data from the ten subjects contained too many sequences for a quality alignment, sequences were aligned by subject using the Aligner web tool of the RDP, and then clustered using the Complete Linkage Clustering tool (with a maximum distance cutoff of 97%). OTUs that contained less than three sequences were excluded from the analyses. ANOVA was used to identify OTUs that were significantly affected by the dietary treatments in each of the ten subjects. These OTUs were subjected to a taxonomic classification and grouped according to phylum (Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria). Within these phyla, five random sequences of each OTU identified above were aligned with the most closely related type strains and entry in the NCBI database using Muscle 3.6 <xref rid="pone.0015046-Edgar1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. Phylogenetic trees were built with MEGA 4.0 Software <xref rid="pone.0015046-Tamura1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref> by neighbor-joining with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. These trees allowed us to visually assign OTUs as sequence clusters which, in most cases, encompassed sequences from several subjects, and consensus sequences were generated for each OTU. A local nucleotide database was established for each subject in BioEdit <xref rid="pone.0015046-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref> containing all sequences detected by pyrosequencing, and the BLASTn algorithm was used with a 97% cutoff (min. length 300 bp) to quantify each OTU in the fecal bacterial populations in each sample. We verified that this approach did not result individual sequences being assigned to different OTUs. In two occasions, two OTUs that were initially identified as distinct had very high sequence similarities, and were thus combined.</p><p>Diversity of the fecal microbiota was determined using 16S rRNA sequence data with two different methods, Shannon's index and the generation of rarefraction curves.
