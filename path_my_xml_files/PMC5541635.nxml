Evidence for nHF use is predominantly from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). There are no randomised trials of nHF use in non-tertiary special care nurseries (SCNs). We hypothesise that nHF is non-inferior to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) as primary support for newborn infants with respiratory distress, in the population cared for in non-tertiary SCNs.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The HUNTER trial is an unblinded Australian multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial. Infants are eligible if born at a gestational age &#x02265;31 weeks with birth weight &#x02265;1200 g and admitted to a participating non-tertiary SCN, are &#x0003c;24&#x02009;hours old at randomisation and require non-invasive respiratory support or supplemental oxygen for &#x0003e;1&#x02009;hour. Infants are randomised to treatment with either nHF or CPAP. The primary outcome is treatment failure within 72&#x02009;hours of randomisation, as determined by objective oxygenation, apnoea or blood gas criteria or by a clinical decision that urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation, or transfer to a tertiary NICU, is required. Secondary outcomes include incidence of pneumothorax requiring drainage, duration of respiratory support, supplemental oxygen and hospitalisation, costs associated with hospital care, cost-effectiveness, parental stress and satisfaction and nursing workload.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Multisite ethical approval for the study has been granted by The Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Melbourne, Australia (Trial Reference No. 34222), and by each participating site. The trial is currently recruiting in eight centres in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia, with one previous site no longer recruiting. The trial results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be presented at national and international conferences.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR): ACTRN12614001203640; pre-results.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>neonatology</kwd><kwd>paediatrics</kwd><kwd>perinatology</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="funding-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text id="BX1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first study to compare nasal high-flow with nasal continuous positive airway pressure as respiratory support for newborn infants in non-tertiary settings.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study is well-powered to detect non-inferiority of nasal high-flow with a non-inferiority margin of 10%; the use of a non-inferiority study design is appropriate given the advantages of nasal high-flow over nasal continuous positive airway pressure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The study includes assessment of parental stress, nursing workload and financial costs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Blinding of the allocated respiratory support modes is not possible, so objective criteria were specified for the primary outcome of treatment failure.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Some infants in the nasal high-flow group will have received a brief period of nasal continuous positive airway pressure prior to randomisation.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="s1a"><title>Background</title><p>Preterm birth, at&#x000a0;&#x0003c;37 weeks&#x02019; gestational age (GA), affecting about 15&#x02009;million infants annually, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. About one million infants die from complications of prematurity every year.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Australia, about 9% of all births are preterm.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> A major contributor to mortality and morbidity in preterm infants is respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) due to surfactant deficiency in the lungs, which leads to many preterm infants requiring respiratory support soon after birth; the proportion of infants who develop RDS increases with lower GA. However, about 80% of preterm infants are born moderate to late&#x000a0;preterm (32&#x02013;36 weeks&#x02019; GA),<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> where RDS is less common. Respiratory symptoms in this more mature preterm population, and in term infants, may be due to conditions such as transient tachypnoea of the newborn or infection.</p><p>It is estimated that 2.5%&#x02013;5% of all newborn infants have respiratory distress.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In Australia, most of these infants are born in a non-tertiary hospital and cared for in a special care nursery&#x000a0;(SCN), where (depending on the level of neonatal care available) they may be treated with supplemental oxygen and/or &#x02018;non-invasive&#x02019; respiratory support from nasal continuous positive airway pressure&#x000a0;(CPAP). However, if these treatments are not available such as in some smaller SCNs, or not successful, or if an infant is born very preterm (&#x0003c;32 weeks&#x02019; gestation) or very small (&#x0003c;1250 g), then the infant usually needs to be transferred to a tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit&#x000a0;(NICU). In Australia, neonatal intensive care is centralised in large metropolitan centres, and maternal and infant transfers from regional or rural centres involve large distances and significant costs.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>The standard non-invasive respiratory support: CPAP</title><p>CPAP uses large prongs in the nose, or a mask over the nose, fitted firmly to the infant&#x02019;s face. The prongs or mask deliver heated and humidified air and oxygen under pressure. CPAP can be used effectively as the primary mode of respiratory support (the first mode of respiratory support applied after admission to the neonatal unit soon after birth) in infants with respiratory distress, even those born at 25&#x02013;30 weeks&#x02019; gestation.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> When used in Australian non-tertiary SCNs to treat late preterm and term infants with respiratory distress, CPAP reduces the need for transfer to a tertiary NICU, and&#x000a0;it reduces costs in comparison to the use of supplemental oxygen alone.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> However, CPAP has been associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax compared with supplemental oxygen alone.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6 7</xref>
</p><p>CPAP is a widely&#x000a0;used method of respiratory support in larger Australian SCNs,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8 9</xref> but&#x000a0;it has some disadvantages. CPAP fixation devices are bulky and cover much of the infant&#x02019;s face, interfering with parental interaction and feeding; trauma to the nasal skin or septum is a commonly reported complication.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Nursing vigilance is required to ensure that an adequate seal (and hence pressure) is maintained without causing nasal injury. For these reasons, and others including limits on staff and equipment, CPAP is not currently a feasible therapy in smaller Australian SCNs (with birth rates mostly&#x000a0;&#x0003c;1500/year) that infrequently care for infants who require respiratory support.</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>The new therapy: nasal high-flow</title><p>In recent years, nasal high-flow&#x000a0;(nHF) therapy, a newer form of non-invasive respiratory support, has become popular as an alternative to CPAP around the world, including in Australasian SCNs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 11&#x02013;15</xref> nHF therapy delivers heated, humidified, blended oxygen and air via small binasal prongs, using gas flows of at least 1 L/min.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x000a0;While nHF therapy has been adopted by many NICUs around the world, there has until recently been relatively little evidence to support this practice. The increasing popularity of nHF seems to be due to its reported advantages over CPAP: it is easier to apply and maintain, more comfortable for infants, associated with less nasal trauma and preferred by parents and nursing staff.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;20</xref> If nHF was demonstrated to be an effective mode of respiratory support in non-tertiary SCNs, these factors would make it the preferred interface in this setting.</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Clinical trials of nHF in newborn infants</title><sec id="s1d1"><title>Preventing extubation failure in NICUs</title><p>The majority of published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of nHF have evaluated its use as an alternative to CPAP, as postextubation respiratory support. An updated Cochrane Review<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> of these trials, published in 2016, found no difference in rates of treatment failure or reintubation in infants treated with postextubation nHF, compared with those treated with CPAP. The nHF infants were noted to have lower rates of nasal trauma and a small reduction in the risk of pneumothorax.</p></sec><sec id="s1d2"><title>Primary respiratory support for newborn infants</title><p>Prior to the HUNTER trial commencing, there was little evidence from RCTs to support the use of nHF as primary support for newborn infants. Yoder <italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>
<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> conducted an RCT in 432 infants, of whom about one-third were included in an &#x02018;early support&#x02019; arm. There was no difference between the nHF and CPAP groups in need for intubation or in other neonatal morbidities. Studies by Iranpour&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>
<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and Kugelman&#x000a0;<italic>et&#x000a0;al</italic>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> each including approximately 70 infants, compared nHF with CPAP and nasal intermittent positive airway pressure, respectively, as early respiratory support for preterm infants; they found no difference between groups in rates of treatment failure or other important outcomes.</p><p>Within the past year, two larger RCTs evaluating nHF as primary respiratory support in NICUs have been published. The HIPSTER trial<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> included 564 preterm infants of mean 32 weeks&#x02019; GA and 1.7&#x02009;kg in birth weight, not previously treated with surfactant, in nine NICUs in Australia and Norway; nHF use resulted in a higher rate of treatment failure (based on objective clinical criteria) than CPAP (25.5% vs 13.3%, p&#x0003c;0.01), but no greater risk of intubation, likely due to the use of &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; CPAP in infants with nHF failure. Lavizzari <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> studied 316 infants of mean 33 weeks&#x02019; GA and 1.9&#x02009;kg in birth weight in an Italian NICU. They found no difference in rates of treatment failure (mechanical ventilation within 72&#x02009;hours) between infants treated with nHF and those treated with CPAP and/or biphasic positive airway pressure (10.8% vs 9.5%, p=0.71). However, it is notable that infants in this study could be intubated, treated with surfactant and extubated (&#x02018;INSURE&#x02019; treatment), without being classed as having treatment failure. Surfactant use was common, occurring in&#x000a0;&#x0003e;40% of infants in both treatment groups.</p><p>While providing important guidance on the use of primary nHF in NICUs, it is important to recognise that the results of these studies cannot be directly applied to use in non-tertiary SCNs, where there is currently no high-quality evidence to guide practice. Staffing in SCNs is different to that in tertiary NICUs, and infants in SCNs have different antenatal exposures, GAs and pathologies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s1e"><title>Summary and rationale</title><p>The reported advantages of nHF&#x02014;easier nursing care, improved feeding and parental interaction, reduced nasal trauma and greater infant comfort&#x02014;have led to widespread adoption of this new therapy. While there are now a number of studies assessing nHF use in the NICU, there are no published trials that study the efficacy and safety of nHF compared with CPAP as early respiratory support for newborn infants in SCNs. The reference treatment against which non-inferiority is being assessed, CPAP, has been shown to be effective in SCNs in a study with similar inclusion criteria and CPAP treatment protocols.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> If proven to be effective and safe, the ease of use of nHF would mean that it could be widely applied to infants with respiratory distress in non-tertiary SCNs, both in Australia and around the world, potentially reducing the need for transfer to a tertiary NICU&#x02014;reducing costs and keeping mothers and their babies together. Conversely, if nHF is shown to be unsafe or significantly less effective than CPAP, this will guide clinicians to avoid nHF treatment of newborn infants outside NICUs. The above considerations led to the adoption of a non-inferiority trial design.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>HUNTER is a multicentre, randomised, non-inferiority trial, including newborn infants cared for in Australian non-tertiary SCNs, who require early non-invasive respiratory support in the first 24&#x02009;hours of life.

No Australian SCNs provide ongoing mechanical ventilation; this is only provided while awaiting transfer of the infant to a tertiary NICU. All participating centres administer exogenous surfactant if the infant requires intubation for RDS prior to retrieval by the neonatal transport team; the standard of care is that all these infants are transferred to a tertiary NICU. Two participating centres have some experience using the &#x02018;INSURE&#x02019; (Intubate, Surfactant, Extubate) procedure<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> in select infants with the support of the neonatal transport service (after which NICU transfer could potentially be avoided), but this is an infrequent practice that is staff&#x000a0;dependent. The participating SCNs have 24&#x02009;hour on-site junior paediatric staff and a designated on-call consultant paediatrician available to advise management and/or attend as required. Some participating centres have one or two consultant staff with specialist neonatal training, but most Australian SCNs do not.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>Infants are eligible for inclusion in the trial if:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>They are born at&#x000a0;&#x02265;31 weeks&#x02019; GA by best obstetric estimate and have birth weight&#x000a0;&#x02265;1200 g; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>They are admitted to the SCN of a participating centre and are&#x000a0;&#x0003c;24&#x02009;hours old at the time of randomisation; and</p></list-item><list-item><p>They require non-invasive respiratory support after admission to the SCN (at clinician discretion) or require any supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x000a0;91%&#x02013;95% for more than 1&#x02009;hour.</p></list-item></list>

The other recently published trial of primary nHF was also performed in a NICU and&#x000a0;it included a high rate of surfactant administration by the INSURE technique, an intervention which is not currently practised routinely in Australian SCNs, and that has not been well-studied in the SCN setting or in the infant population relevant to SCNs (infants&#x000a0;&#x02265;31 weeks&#x02019; GA).<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
</p><p>There has traditionally been a lack of clinical research in newborn infants cared for in non-tertiary SCNs and only one previous RCT of respiratory support in this setting.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Research in SCNs is important because care of infants in these units incorporates a number of factors distinct from tertiary NICUs. Non-tertiary SCNs do not care for large numbers of very preterm or very low birth weight infants and often need to treat term infants with respiratory distress. The resources and staffing available in non-tertiary SCNs are different from those in NICUs, and while capable of intubation and mechanical ventilation as a stabilisation measure, SCNs are not equipped to provide this level of treatment for longer periods. The implications for failure of non-invasive support are therefore greater in SCNs: transfer of the infant to a NICU and separation from his or her parents. Furthermore, there are potentially important financial implications of treatment failure: retrieval by specialist neonatal transport services, particularly when over long distances, as would apply in many areas of Australia, bears a significant cost. Transfers from SCNs also have an impact on staffing and resource allocation in receiving tertiary NICUs.</p><p>There has never been a randomised trial of nHF in non-tertiary SCNs; nHF may be an effective mode of support in this setting and, due to its ease of use, would be preferable to CPAP if shown to be non-inferior. However, it is equally important to determine if nHF is unsafe or significantly inferior to CPAP, so that clinicians may be guided to avoid nHF use in non-tertiary SCNs. If nHF use was associated with a reduction in nursing workload, it may prove to be more cost-effective than CPAP or may result in a greater capacity to manage infants requiring non-invasive support in SCNs. CPAP is associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax in comparison with oxygen treatment.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> A Cochrane Review noted nHF treatment to be associated with a small reduction in pneumothorax rate compared with CPAP.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> If a lower rate of this complication was seen in our trial with nHF, in conjunction with non-inferiority in treatment efficacy, nHF could be the preferred mode of treatment.</p><p>The HUNTER trial is a well-powered, carefully designed randomised clinical trial, which will determine whether nHF is an appropriate mode of early respiratory support for newborn infants in the non-tertiary setting. The non-inferiority design used in the HUNTER trial was until recently quite rare but has been used recently in similar trials by our group.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 31</xref> The choice of non-inferiority margin of 10% was made in view of the fact that the primary outcome was treatment failure and not a more critical outcome, such as death, and that infants who have treatment failure on nHF will be offered CPAP, which may &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; them from intubation and/or transfer to a NICU, as seen in previous NICU trials of nHF.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 31 32</xref>
</p><p>A potential limitation to this trial is that blinding of treatment allocation is not possible. We have attempted to minimise this by setting objective treatment failure criteria, which were agreed on by all participating centres. Some infants allocated to nHF will receive a brief period of CPAP before randomisation, which conceivably could affect interpretation of the results. However, we have aimed to restrict the impact of this by excluding infants who have received two or more hours of CPAP from the trial, which we felt to be the shortest window in which seeking parental consent would be feasible. The HUNTER trial is a pragmatic trial, designed to assess whether nHF is non-inferior to CPAP in <italic>real-world</italic> practice. We have not mandated the need or timing of investigations such as chest X-rays or blood gas analysis nor have we protocolised the decision to treat infants with non-invasive support, which remains at clinician discretion. We acknowledge that some randomised infants may have recovered from respiratory distress without the use of non-invasive support or may have an unrecognised pneumothorax if randomised prior to a chest X-ray being performed.</p><p>The use of nHF in NICU practice is well-established and supported by evidence from multiple RCTs. However, nHF use is also being adopted in non-tertiary SCNs,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 13&#x02013;15</xref> a setting in which there is little evidence of its efficacy and safety. If this trial demonstrates that nHF is non-inferior to CPAP as primary support for newborn infants in non-tertiary SCNs, then many units worldwide are likely to incorporate nHF into their routine practice. However, if nHF is inferior to CPAP, the results of this study will ensure that this treatment is not applied inappropriately, and infants in non-tertiary SCNs with respiratory distress will continue to receive evidence-based care.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e439" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016746.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e440" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016746.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>
