There were 58 premature infants and 33 full-term infants. All included newborns conformed to the diagnostic criteria of severe respiratory failure and did not recover after conventional respiratory supportive treatment. Parents of those newborns gave signed informed consent. Newborns with severe multiple malformation or severe congenital heart disease were excluded. The newborns were divided into research group and control group according to admission time. In the research group, there were 23 boys and 22 girls, with gestational age of 30 ~ 38 weeks (average 34.70&#x000b1;3.60 weeks), weighed 1610 ~ 3050 g (average 2334.50&#x000b1;720.90 g), and aged 1 ~ 24 h on admission; there were 25 cases of respiratory distress syndrome, 9 cases of meconium aspiration, 7 cases of pneumonia and septicemia, three cases of asphyxia, and one case of Wilson-Mikity. In the control group, there were 26 boys and 19 girls, with gestational age of 32 ~ 39 weeks (average 35.20&#x000b1;5.40 weeks), weighed 1623 ~ 2976 g (average 2411.30&#x000b1;812.60 g), and aged 1 ~ 24 h on admission; there were 23 cases of respiratory distress syndrome, 11 cases of meconium aspiration, 6 cases of pneumonia and septicemia, three cases of asphyxia, and two cases of Wilson-Mikity. Differences of general data between two groups had no statistical significance; hence, the results were comparable.

High-frequency oscillatory ventilation was performed using Stephanie pediatric ventilator (Germany) in high-frequency oscillatory mode. Mean airway pressure (MAP) was set as 1 ~14 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, vibration pressure amplitude was set as 35 ~ 45 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, vibration frequency was set as 9 ~ 10 Hz, and inspiratory time was set as 33%. Pulmonary reexpansion was achieved by improving MAP in an amplitude of 1 ~ 2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O until pulmonary reexpansion reached the 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> posterior ribs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Therapeutic method of the research group</title><p>Besides the treatment the same as the control group, patients in the research group was also treated with NO inhalation treatment.

After 30 ~ 60 min of NO inhalation, if TcSaO<sub>2</sub> increased for more than 10% and alveolar oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) increased for more than 10 mm Hg (1 mm Hg=0.133 kPa), then the treatment was determined as effective; otherwise, the treatment was determined as ineffective. For patients who obtained effective treatment result, the concentration of NO was decreased for 2 ~ 3 ppm, while for those who obtained ineffective treatment result, the concentration of NO was increased for 2 ~ 3 ppm till TcSaO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub> became stable. The concentrations of NO and FiO<sub>2</sub> were reduced every 6 to 12 hour if disease conditions of patients improved. If the concentration of NO decreased to 3 ppm and moreover FiO<sub>2</sub> stayed equal to or lower than 30% and TcSaO<sub>2</sub> stayed equal to or higher than 90% for 12 h, then NO inhalation stopped.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Evaluation standard</title><p>The outcome was evaluated referring to the standards mentioned in Pediatric Respiratory Failure Foundation and Clinic.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> If clinical symptoms and signs disappeared or basically disappeared, characteristic changes of chest X-ray film disappeared, vital signs became stable, and patients could breathe by themselves, then the disease could be determined as cured.

If characteristic changes of chest X-ray films remained unchanged, clinical symptoms and signs had no changes or continued to deteriorate, and patients still needed the support of breathing machine, then treatment was determined as ineffective.

It has been found that; respiratory distress syndrome has the highest incidence among newborns with gestational age equal to or larger than 34 weeks, followed by meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia/septicemia and wet lung disease.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Previous multi-center epidemiological investigation results in China also suggest that, respiratory system disease, especially respiratory distress syndrome, is the most commonly cause for neonatal respiratory failure, and other causes include neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, primary or secondary pulmonary hypertension and various congenital malformations.<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In the past twenty years, treating respiratory failure of critically ill newborns with conventional mechanical ventilation has gain great progress; however, some severe cases still cannot be relieved. The reason for failed treatment is that, the consumption of surface active material results in pulmonary collapse and the release of inflammatory mediators, barotrauma and shearing injury caused by mechanical ventilation aggregate lung injury, the release of endogenous NO of those patients is reduced, and moreover pulmonary arteriospasm can induce pulmonary hypertension; therefore, mechanical ventilation alone is lowly effective for some newborns with severe respiratory failure.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>NO inhalation treatment is a new kind of respiratory supportive means developed in recent years. NO, a kind of endogenous endothelium-derived relaxing factor has been found having a vital role in the pathological and physiological process of many diseases.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Many clinical researches have found that, NO can be used for relieving ischemia reperfusion injury caused by lung transplantation, selectively lowering pulmonary artery resistance of patients undergoing heart transplantation and patients with congenital heart disease and treating severe hypoxic respiratory failure, high altitude pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress syndrome.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> High frequency ventilation is based on low tidal volume and rapid frequency (10 ~15 Hz). Currently, the most effective high frequency ventilation is high-frequency oscillatory ventilation which can prevent alveolar collapse with stable MAP; to be specific, it can minimum the increase of airway pressure induced by tidal volume and the change of airway pressure is little because of the high working efficacy, which can protect the lung of newborn and avoid barotrauma.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> High frequency ventilation and NO inhalation can complement each other&#x02019;s advantages and the combination of the two therapies can effectively improve ventilation-perfusion ratio.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>This study treats severe respiratory failure of newborns with NO inhalation and high frequency ventilation. Results suggested that, the improvement of respiratory failure associated clinical symptoms, respiratory function indexes and arterial blood gas indexes of the research group was superior to that of the control group which did not apply NO inhalation. It indicated that, high frequency oscillatory ventilation in combination with NO inhalation could effectively relieve clinical symptoms such as dyspnea, cyanosis and arrhythmia and it was positive in recovering OI and improving ventilation function. Besides, it was also found that, mechanical ventilation time, duration of oxygen therapy and the length of hospital stay of newborns who were treated with NO inhalation assisted respiratory support treatment was shorter than those of newborns in the control group, the outcome of the research group was better than that of the control group, and the incidence of complications of the research group and the control group had no statistical significance. The above findings suggested that, NO inhalation in combination with high frequency oscillatory ventilation had definite effect in treating severe respiratory failure of newborns and it could significantly shorten the duration of respiratory supportive treatment, without significantly increasing adverse reactions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Treating newborns suffering from respiratory failure with NO inhalation and high frequency oscillatory ventilation is safe and effective. It can effectively improve respiratory function and stage of newborns relieving related symptoms; therefore, the combined therapy is worth clinical promotion.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
