adults standing on different types of balance pads. [Subjects and Methods] Nine healthy
adults participated in this study. Postural body sway was measured while participants were
standing on four different types of balance pads: Balance-pad Elite (BE), Aero-Step XL
(AS), Dynair Ballkissen Senso (DBS), and Dynair Ballkissen XXL Meditation and Yoga (DBMY).
A Wii Balance Board interfaced with Balancia software was used to measure postural body
sway. [Results] In the sway velocity, sway path length, and sway area, no significant
differences were found between baseline conditions (participants were standing on the
floor with no balance pad) and the use of the BE or AS. However, significant increases in
all parameters were found comparing baseline conditions to the use of either Dynair
balance pad. Furthermore, the use of either Dynair balance pad significantly increased
postural sway compared to both the BE and the AS. [Conclusion] These findings suggest that
the DBS and DBMY balance pads may serve as superior tools for providing unstable condition
for balance training than the BE and the AS balance pads.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Balance pad</kwd><kwd>Postural sway</kwd><kwd>Balance training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>A sensory system located in structures of the inner ear that registers the orientation of
the heada sensory system located in structures of the inner ear that registers the
orientation of the heada sensory system located in structures of the inner ear that
registers the orientation of the headUnlike quadrapedal mammals, humans require diverse
abilities to maintain equilibrium in a bipedal stance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Equilibrium is a sensory system that registers the orientation head
and a balance between several different influences or aspects of situation<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus the ability to maintain equilibrium is
the functional foundation for mobility and enables humans to enjoy functional independence
throughout their life span<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance is
defined as minimizing body sway induced by external stimuli and maintaining the body&#x02019;s
center of gravity within the base of support<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. So, the standing Balance is also important predictor of the safe
performance of gait and functional activities, an extensive range of programs<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance involves both static balance and
dynamic balance. Static balance refers to the ability of a body to maintain its center of
gravity within the base of support at rest, whereas dynamic balance refers to the ability of
a body to maintain its center of gravity within the base of support in motion<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. The proprioceptive, cutaneous, visual, and
vestibular systems contribute to control of posture<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> which involves proper interactions with the information received
from these systems at a high level<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Proprioception is a component of the somatosensory system and involves the ability to
perceive the movement and spatial orientation of the body by processing afferent information
from stimuli within the body itself (e.g., from proprioceptors in joints, muscles, and
tendons)<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Impaired balance has been reported to substantially limit the ability to maintain a
standing posture<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Even with a proper
posture, loss of balance control will cause unbalanced loads. Chronic exposure to unbalanced
loads may lead to structural changes in the musculoskeletal system<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, efficient therapeutic approaches based on the
appropriate assessment and training of balance are required<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, postural instability in older adults leads to
injuries through falls, limits independence, reduces the quality of life, and can even lead
to death<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, it is critical to
provide methods to maintain and improve balance and control of posture, especially in older
adults.</p><p>Balance training is an effective means to improve proxies of static/dynamic steady-state,
proactive, and reactive balance as well as performance in balance test in healthy
person<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. So many studies have reported
on various interventions to improve balance control. Hippotherapy<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>, Kung-fu swimming<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, Tai Chi Chuan<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the Wii Fit video game system<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> have all been reported to be effective at improving balance. In
addition, training programs using balance pads (e.g., wobble boards, sponge pads, ethylene
vinyl acetate pads, memory foams, and Aero-step boards, have also been reported to be
effective<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Above all, balance pads
are an easy-to-use training tool intended to improve balance performance<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. There are a wide variety of types of
balance pads, where the choice of balance pad type controls the level of difficulty one
experiences when performing a range of movements during balance exercise<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. Accordingly, it has been demonstrated
that the type of balance pad used can significantly affect postural sway<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many previous studies have used balance pads as intervention tools
to improve balance control. However, there is a paucity of data on the criteria to use in
selecting the proper type of balance pad for specific clinical applications or patient
types.</p><p>Thus, there exists a need to compare the postural sway of users on different types of
balance pads to establish criteria for the proper selection of balance pads for individuals
with problematic conditions and identify what type of pad use has a greater impact on the
patient who has impaired balance for proper balance control. To address this need, we
compared the sway path length, sway velocity, and sway area on different types of balance
pads to use as a reference for the selection of the proper type of balance pad to achieve
specific conditions in balance training.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>To recruit participants, a public notice was posted on the bulletin board at the University
stating the study objective and methods. Of the 13 volunteers, 9 were screened according to
the following selection criteria: 1) healthy women aged 20&#x02013;29 years, 2) no musculoskeletal
or nervous system disease(s), 3) no congenital abnormality or inflammatory disease(s) in the
lower extremities, 4) no open wounds, and 5) the ability to perform movements as instructed
by the researcher. The participants were 9 female, with average 22.0 (0.50) years old,
160.44 (5.57)&#x02005;cm in height, and 52.56 (5.50)&#x02005;kg in weight.</p><p>This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Kyungnam University. Written
consent was obtained from all participants prior to the commencement of this study.</p><p>This was a comparative cross-sectional study. The general information including age,
height, and weight of each participant were collected. Before measuring postural body sway
on each balance pad, baseline conditions for each participant were established by measuring
postural body sway in a static standing position without balance pad. And then, the postural
body sway was measured on each of the four types of balance pads in a random order chosen by
each participant. The following balance pads were used in this study: A) Balance-pad Elite
(Alcan airex AG, Sins, Switzerland), a rectangular blue sponge pad measuring 50&#x02005;cm (W) &#x000d7;
41&#x02005;cm (L) &#x000d7; 6&#x02005;cm (H); B) Aero-Step XL (Togu, Prien-Bachham, Germany), a blue latex pad
consisting of two conjoined air-filled hemispherical segments with bumpy surfaces measuring
51&#x02005;cm (W) &#x000d7; 37&#x02005;cm (L) &#x000d7; 8&#x02005;cm (H); C) Dynair Ballkissen Senso (Togu), an air-filled circular
pad made of soft green velvet with a bumpy surface measuring 33&#x02005;cm in diameter and 7&#x02005;cm in
height; and D) Dynair Ballkissen XXL Meditation and Yoga (Togu), an air-filled circular pad
made of soft red velvet with a bumpy surface measuring 50&#x02005;cm in diameter and 14&#x02005;cm in height

characteristics of each pad are as follows:</p><p>A) Balance-pad Elite is the most traditional type of pad and it provides a sense of
stability with the square structure. B) Aero-Step XL divided the pressure-sensitive part of
both feet to make the same environment on both feet. Because it is divided into two parts,
so it is used for walking in place balance training before increasing walking balance. The
basic type D) Dynair Ballkissen XXL Meditation and Yoga is used mainly for one-foot strength
or balance exercise. And except for the bumpy surface, C) Dynair Ballkissen Senso is similar
to D) Dynair Ballkissen XXL Meditation and Yoga. So it is used for sensor stimulation for
people who need more sensitive activation.</p><p>To establish baseline conditions, the participants were instructed to place both feet
shoulder-width apart directly on the force plate and stand with both arms lowered at their
sides<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Subsequently, each participant
was asked to repeat the same procedure while standing on each type of balance pad placed on
the surface of the force plate. To minimize postural sway due to unsteady gaze during
measurements, the participants were asked to look at a sign marked at eye level at a
distance of 2&#x02005;m. Each participant was given 10 seconds for practice and adaptation on each
balance pad prior to measurement. Postural sway was then measured twice for 30 seconds. The
velocity, path length, and area of postural sway were recorded. Mean values were calculated
for each parameter by averaging the data collected from each of the two measurements.
Participants were given a 30-second break between measurements on each type of balance pad,
and a 1-minute break before switching to a different balance pad.</p><p>The experiment was performed in a quiet and spacious room in the evening to minimize the
influence of external environment. To prevent the risk of fall on the balance pads, a
research assistant was positioned behind the participants to supervise the process. Another
well-trained research assistant performed measurements using the force plate.</p><p>To measure the postural body sway, a Nintendo Wii Balance Board (WBB) interfaced with
Balancia software version 2.0 (Mintosys, Seoul, South Korea) was used. The WBB was used as a
device comparable to force platforms commonly utilized to quantify gait, balance, and other
biomechanical parameters<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. To collect the postural body sway data, the Balancia
software was used to extract and process data from the WBB. The WBB contains four load cells
at each of its corners that are used to collect center of pressure (COP) data. The collected
data is then transmitted to a computer unit connected via Bluetooth. The data was sampled at
50&#x02005;Hz and filtered by a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of
12&#x02005;Hz. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the inter-rater reliability of this
tool was ICC=0.79&#x02013;0.89, while the intra-rater reliability was ICC=0.70&#x02013;0.92. The concurrent
validity reported was ICC=0.73&#x02013;0.87.27</p><p>SPSS 18.0 software was used for all statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics were used
to determine the general characteristics of the participants. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc
test with a statistical significance level of &#x003b1;=0.05 were used to compare the postural sway
parameters on different types of balance pads.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The analysis of postural sway velocity, sway path length, and sway area on each type of

postural sway. Balance, or postural control, refers to complex motor functions involving
sensory feedback, movement strategies, orientation in space, biomechanical constraints, and
cognition<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance control in healthy
adults involves processing afferent information from cutaneous mechanoreceptors on the soles
of the feet<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. The mechanoreceptors on
the soles of the feet provide information about surface contact pressures<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>, and balance control is mediated by
feedback and feedforward mechanisms coordinated by the sensory and motor systems<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>McIlroy et al.<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that increased
postural sway on an unstable surface resulted in a postural reflex characterized by
increased afferent input from the cutaneous receptors in the soles of the feet<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance on an unstable surface is
controlled by adjusting the contact points of the feet and shifting the body&#x02019;s center of
gravity<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since unstable surfaces
increase postural reflex activity, they are more effective for improving muscle activity
than stable surfaces<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. Behm et al. reported balance training on unstable
surfaces enhanced musculoskeletal functions in adults<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. Similarly, Shumway-Cook and Woollacott reported unstable surfaces
were effective for improving foot proprioception<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Blance training is regaining a normal functional level of neuromuscular control<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance training may influence afferent
input, result in changes in the sensory cortex, and might augment motoneuron pool
excitability<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, balance
training effectively reduces the risk of sustaining an musculoskeletal sprain<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, to make a clear statement on how
to progress during balance training, however, research is lacking on the effect of pad types
on postural sway or muscle activation. So, to evaluate the effect of balance pad type on
postural sway used several type in this study.</p><p>The Balance-pad Elite and Aero Step XL balance pads used in this study were relatively firm
and stable enough for participants to maintain balance easily while standing. By contrast,
the Dynair Ballkissen Senso and Dynair Ballkissen XXL Meditation and Yoga balance pads were
filled with air and not as firm as the Balance-pad Elite and Aero Step XL balance pads.
Consequently, the Dynair balance pads were more unstable and made it more difficult for
participants to maintain balance control. Thus, the postural body sway proved significantly
greater on the Dynair balance pads than the Balance-pad Elite and Aero Step XL balance pads.
This finding suggested that the Dynair Ballkissen Senso and Dynair Ballkissen XXL Meditation
and Yoga could be more effective for improving balance control by providing unstable
surfaces for balance training.</p><p>In agreement with this conclusion, a previous study compared postural balance in
participants standing on firm versus soft foams, and reported standing on the soft foam
increased the likelihood of contacting the hard surface beneath the balance pad. In turn,
this contact enabled participants to use the mechanoreceptors on the soles of their feet to
sense the hard surface beneath the foam to receive more sensory information. Therefore,
balance training on a soft, unstable surface is more likely to induce increased sensory
feedback for proprioceptive stimulation due to unstable movements than balance training on a
firm, stable surface. This increased sensory feedback exerts effects on sensing body
orientation and helps recover balance through corrective body movements<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to balance pad firmness, Corbin et al.
suggested the surface texture of balance pads could affect postural sway<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. Balance pads with a range of shapes and
surface textures provide participants with different sensory inputs than smooth surfaces.
The attribution of these differences in sensory feedback to the different shapes and surface
textures of balance pads are further supported by our findings. It is also important to note
that no significant differences in postural sway were found between the Dynair balance pads
in our study. These balance pads differed in size only, not in surface texture or shape.
This finding suggests that balance pad size does affect postural sway in the same manner
that balance pad firmness, shape, and surface texture do. Because, as the size of pad
increases, increased visual stability and as the margin of footprint increases,
psychological stability also increased.</p><p>A previous study comparing a foam rubber exercise group with a stable surface exercise
group and control group for 4 months in elderly people found the foam rubber exercise to
enhance improvements in balance control<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study demonstrated that the stable surface required two
additional months of balance training to achieve the same enhancement in balance performance
yielded by the foam rubber pad. In comparison to an untrained control group, both the foam
rubber pad and the stable surface showed improvements in lower extremity muscle strength.
However, there were no significant differences in muscle strength between participants using
the foam rubber pad and the stable surface<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. In another study, Lee et al. studied the effects of balance
training on an Aero-step board and reported significant improvements in both the overall and
anteroposterior stability indices after training<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. This finding was attributable to the use of Aero-step, where the
dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the ankle joint substantially stimulated the Golgi tendon
organs and muscle spindles<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref><sup>)</sup>. The two
studies mentioned above used the same balance pads as those used in the present study: the
Airex&#x02019;s Balance-pad Elite and TOGU&#x02019;s Aero-step XL. However, the present study found no
significant differences in postural sway between baseline conditions where a stable, flat
surface was provided and the use of either the Balance-pad Elite or Aero-step XL. This
finding is attributable to the fact that these stable surfaces were less deformable than
either Dynair balance pad. However, the aforementioned studies used Balance-pad Elite and
Aero-step XL as balance training tools in a longitudinal study where effects were recorded
over time, whereas the present cross-sectional study focused on comparing the extent of
postural body sway depending on the type of balance pad used at a defined point in time.
This difference in study design may account for the differences between previous and present
findings. Thus, these previous studies demonstrated that the Balance-pad Elite and Aero-step
XL may prove more effective for improving the balance control than flat, firm surfaces if
they are used as training tools for an extended period. In contrast, our findings serve as a
reference for formulating a balance exercise protocol with the proper choice of balance pad
type to offer different levels of difficulty tailored to varying levels of balance control
performance.</p><p>Balance pads are balance training tools designed to improve balance performance and, in
agreement with our findings, varying the type of balance pad used provides a convenient
method for controlling balance training difficulty<xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref><sup>)</sup>. For example, in older adults or in
individuals with neurological deficits who demonstrate poor balance performance, it may be
more appropriate to use firm, stable balance pads and then to apply increasingly difficult
tasks. Alternatively, gradual progression to more unstable balance pads could be used as a
method to increase the level of difficulty. In addition, performing increasingly difficult
tasks on unstable balance pads would be more beneficial than on stable surfaces to further
improve balance control.</p><p>It is necessary to note the limitations of this study. First, the sample size was small and
consisted of only healthy women in their 20s, which potentially limits the generalizability
of these findings. In addition, this study investigated the differences in postural body
sway on different types of balance pads and did not investigate how the type of balance pad
affected the improvement of balance control. These limitations motivate further studies
concerning the effects of different types of balance pads on the improvement of balance
control.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Cimadoro</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Paizis</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Alberti</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Effects of different unstable supports on EMG activity and
