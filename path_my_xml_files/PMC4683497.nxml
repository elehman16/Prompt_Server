The anesthestic and analgesic requirement get reduced to a huge extent by use of these adjuvants because of their analgesic properties as well as augmentation of local anesthetic mediated by hyperpolariztion of nerve tissues by altering transmembrane potential and ion conductance at the locus coerulus in the brainstem.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] In vaginal hysterectomies, after induction of neuroaxial blockade profound muscle relaxation that occurs causes inability to move legs. Also, prolonged duration of surgery, lithotomy position with trendelenberg tilt make patients uncomfortable. At this stage giving large doses of intravenous sedation defeats the very purpose of giving regional block.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Alpha-two agonists are the drugs, which have sedative and analgesic properties. The stable hemodynamic provided by these drugs makes them the desirable choice of adjuvant.</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is highly selective alpha-two adrenergic agonist with an affinity 8 times more than clonidine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It acts on both pre- and post-synaptic sympathetic nerve terminals and central nervous system thereby decreasing the sympathetic outflow and nor epinephrine release causing sedative, anti-anxiety, analgesic, sympathetic and hemodynamic effects.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Dexmedetomidine causes dose-dependent bradycardia, hypotension so in this prospective study we have used minimum doses, that is, 0.5 &#x000b5;g/kg along with the local anesthetic agent bupivacaine as it is easily available and routinely practiced since many years so that we can study the properties of the new drug like dexmedetomidine.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Objectives of the study</title><p>

</p><p>In the preoperative room, venous access was achieved with the 18 gauge vasofix. All the patients were preloaded with 500 ml of the lactated Ringer solution.</p><p>After taking the patient into the operative room, multipara monitor was attached to and baseline value of pulse rate (PR), noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP), pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), respiratory rate was noted. After taking all aseptic precautions, the lumbar epidural block was induced using 18 gauge touhy needle, in sitting position. After skin infiltration with 2% lignocaine in L2-L3 inter-space, the epidural needle was inserted, and epidural space was identified by loss of resistance to air technique. An epidural catheter was inserted and kept 4 cm in the epidural space and then fixed on the back of the patient. Test dose of 3 ml 2% lignocaine adrenaline was given through the catheter after giving supine position. After ruling out intradural and intravascular placement of the catheter, the study drug was given epidurally, which was prepared by anesthesia technician who was unaware of the study design.</p><p>The following solutions were randomly administered:</p><p>

</p><p>Bilateral pin prick method was used to evaluate and check sensory level. Motor blockade was assessed by modified Bromage scale (0 = no block, 1 = inability to raise extended leg; 2 = inability to flex knee; 3 = inability to flex ankle and foot). Sensory and motor block was assessed every 5 min after giving the study drug for 30 min. Following parameters were also observed after the epidural block: Time of onset of the analgesia to T10, maximum sensory level achieved, time for complete motor block (Bromage scale 3), time for two segmental dermatomal regression, regression to S1 dermatome, time for first rescue analgesic and total top ups required during the study. Lithotomy position was given after 25&#x02013;30 min of epidural injection. Hemodynamic parameters -NIBP, PR, SpO<sub>2</sub>, electrocardiography were measured continuously and recordings were made every 5 min till the completion of the surgery and every 15 min after the patients were shifted to the recovery unit.</p><p>Hypotension was defined as decrease in the systolic blood pressure more than 30% of the baseline value and treated with the 3&#x02013;6 mg of the mephenteramine and bradycardia was defined as PR &#x0003c; 50/min and was treated with the atropine 0.6 mg.</p><p>Grading of sedation was evaluated by the Ramsey five point scale: (1) Alert and wide awake, (2) arousable to verbal command, (3) arousable to gentle tactile stimuli (4) arousable to vigorous stimulation and (5) unarousable. Sedation scores were recorded just before the initiation of surgery and thereafter every 20 min during the surgical procedure. Any untoward incident and side effects during the study period were carefully observed and managed symptomatically. Patient satisfaction score was noted.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Mean and standard deviation was calculated, and we used two independent sample <italic>t</italic>-test to compare both the groups and to find the <italic>P</italic> value. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 considered to be significant.

Complete motor block was achieved quite early (22.98 &#x000b1; 4.78) in group II as compared to group I. In this study seven patients from group II were required to be given mephenteramine 6 mg for hypotension after 1 h of the block while in group I only two patients required to be given the vasopressor [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Sensory and motor blockade profile</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-9-310-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The findings of <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref> reveal the statistically significant values on a comparison of the post-operative block characteristics in between two groups.

As a result, the time for rescue analgesia was shorter with group I (150.24 &#x000b1; 24.42) as compared to group II (320.62 &#x000b1; 23.86). The group II experienced the prolonged pain free period as compared to group I. The superior block characteristics by addition of the dexmedetomidine were clearly evident from lesser dose of local anesthetic consumption (80.35 &#x000b1; 18.96) as compared to group I (95.30 &#x000b1; 14.28).</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Postoperative block characteristics</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AER-9-310-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Sedation score was 2 on Ramsey sedation scale in all patients in group II.

Gupta <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] found similar results with epidural dexmedetomidine when used with levobupivacaine in doses comparable to our study.</p><p>Sedation score was 2 on Ramsey sedation scale throughout the surgery and up to 2 h in post-operative room with the dexmedetomidine group, whereas in group I patients were given midazolam for the same effects. All these results show the analgesic, anesthetic and sedative properties of the dexmedetomidine.</p><p>In the present study, baseline heart rate was between 80 and 90/min. Heart rate dropped down to 56 and 70/min in six patients in epidural dexmedetomidine group. None of the patients needed atropine. Similarly, mean arterial pressure decreased from baseline in both the groups and comparable, but it never went below 70 mm of Hg. The decrease in the heart rate caused by alpha-two agonist can be explained on the basis of their central action where they decrease the sympathetic outflow and nor epinephrine release.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The stable hemodynamics can possibly be explained on the basis of lower volumes of the local anesthetic agent used, the lower doses of the adjuvant used.</p><p>Dry mouth, shivering was observed in five patients from dexmedetomidine group but was mildly discomforting to the patients and did not need any treatment. None of the patients in the present study had episodes of the respiratory depression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Faster onset of action of local anesthetic agents, rapid establishment of both sensory and motor block, prolonged duration of analgesia in postoperative period, stable hemodynamics and minimal dose requirement make dexmedetomidine very effective adjuvant in epidural anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine reduces the dose of epidural bupivacaine, potentiates its action, provides adequate surgical anesthesia and postoperative analgesia with a desirable level of sedation and minimal
