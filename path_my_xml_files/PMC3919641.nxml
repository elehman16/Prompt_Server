when it is given blind, rather than gaining weight or exhibiting dysfunctional
regulation of intake, in the present study, forty-one healthy obese (BMI
30&#x02013;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) women (age 20&#x02013;50
years), not currently dieting, were randomly assigned to consume sucrose
(<italic>n</italic> 20) or aspartame (<italic>n</italic> 21) drinks over 4
weeks in a parallel single-blind design. Over the 4&#x000a0;weeks, one group
consumed 4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;250&#x000a0;ml sucrose drinks
(total 1800&#x000a0;kJ/d) and the other group consumed
4&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;250&#x000a0;ml aspartame drinks. During
the baseline week and experimental weeks, body weight and other biometric data
were measured and steps per day, food intake using 7&#x000a0;d unweighed food
diaries, and mood using ten- or seven-point Likert scales four times a day were
recorded. At the end of the experiment, the participants weighed 1&#x000b7;72
(<sc>se</sc> 0&#x000b7;47)&#x000a0;kg less than the value predicted by
the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
model; the predicted body weight accounted for 94&#x000b7;3&#x000a0;% of
the variance in the observed body weight and experimental group accounted for a
further 1&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;% of the variance in the observed body weight,
showing that women consuming sucrose drinks gained significantly less weight
than predicted. The reported daily energy intake did not increase significantly,
and sucrose supplements significantly reduced the reported voluntary sugar,
starch and fat intake compared with aspartame. There were no effects on appetite
or mood. Over 4 weeks, as part of everyday eating, sucrose given blind in soft
drinks was partially compensated for by obese women, as in previous experiments
with healthy and overweight participants.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Sucrose</kwd><kwd>Fat intake</kwd><kwd>Energy regulation</kwd><kwd>Body weight</kwd><kwd>Soft drinks</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> CHO, carbohydrate; NIDDK, National Institute of Diabetes

living people involving <italic>ad libitum</italic> diets, intake of free sugars or
sugar sweetened beverages is a determinant of body weight&#x02019;<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It may be particularly difficult to accurately compensate for energy-dense
liquids that lack visual or orosensory cues to their energy content<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It has also been hypothesised that compensation when participants know
that they are being given sugars differs from that when they are given sugars
blind<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In the former conditions, psychological expectancy effects are more likely
to occur, such as abstinence violation effects<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>7</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, meaning that sugars can have both direct effects on energy intake and
indirect effects by being the marker and sign of a less-healthy lifestyle that may
include inactivity and surplus energy intake from all sources, notably from fat.</p><p>Studies that encourage reductions in the intake of sugars cannot be blind, and
participants deliberately choose foods, making it difficult to differentiate the direct
effects of sugar consumption from indirect effects. In studies in which isoenergetic
high-sugar or low-sugar diets are given, sometimes under blind conditions, no difference
in weight status can be found<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In short, the impact of sugars in the diet depends upon what else people
eat<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and overall energy balance<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. It is not clear whether obese people differ qualitatively, or only
quantitatively, in their regulation of eating from people who weigh less<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. There have been few randomised controlled studies carried out in obese
participants deliberately increasing sugar intake in the <italic>ad libitum</italic>
diet<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, which was the purpose of the experiment reported herein.</p><p>In this line of research, two previous studies gave supplements of 1800&#x000a0;kJ of
sucrose as liquid for normal-weight and overweight women under single-blind conditions
over 4 weeks and found that women partially compensated for the added energy by reducing
<italic>ad libitum</italic> intake elsewhere in the diet<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The participants did not gain weight over the course of the experiments.
It was concluded that when given blind to eliminate psychological expectancy effects,
women compensate for sucrose added to the diet in soft drinks. The present experiment
replicates this procedure using obese participants.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of sucrose beverages consumed
over 4 weeks when compared with a placebo containing artificial sweeteners in obese
women. Previous studies<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> found no effects of labelling, so in the present study, all the
participants were informed that they were being given sucrose-sweetened soft drinks,
meaning that half of the participants were misinformed, as they were actually being
given artificially sweetened ones.</p><p>The present experiment extends the previous experimental design to women who are obese
(BMI &#x02265;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The hypothesis was that
obese women, similar to overweight and normal-weight women in previous studies, would
partially compensate for the energy content of supplementary soft drinks: (1) not gain
weight, the primary outcome measure based on body weight; secondary outcomes being (2)
reduce energy intake elsewhere in the diet, (3) reduce the total fat content of the
diet, as in the previous experiments, and (4) reduce the <italic>ad libitum</italic>
carbohydrate (CHO) content of the diet, measured by the self-reported food intake in the
food diaries. Drinks rather than solid foods were used for convenience and because
sugary drinks are the form of simple CHO most likely to cause the effects discussed
above.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Design</title><p>The present experiment was carried out over a period of 5 weeks: baseline data
were collected for 1 week and supplementary drinks were added to the diet for 4
weeks. On the basis of previous research<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, a target cell size of twenty-two was calculated to achieve a
90&#x000a0;% chance of detecting a difference in change in the body weight of
1&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;% of baseline body weight between the groups (assuming
<sc>sd</sc>=&#x000a0;1&#x000b7;5). The subjects were given
drinks containing sucrose (achieved <italic>n</italic> 20) or drinks containing
aspartame (with minimal energy content, achieved <italic>n</italic> 21). All the
subjects were informed that they were being given sugar-sweetened drinks.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-2"><title>Ethics</title><p>The experiment was conducted according to the guidelines laid down in the
Declaration of Helsinki, and all procedures involving human subjects were
approved by the ethics committee of Queen Margaret University. Written informed
consent was obtained from all the participants. The study was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01799096). The following significant ethical issues were
recognised: first, giving obese people sucrose could possibly have adverse
effects on their weight or diet, but the null results of previous studies
minimised this risk; second, monitoring the diets of obese people introduced a
requirement of care, which was satisfied by providing detailed feedback about
dietary intake and potential ways of improving it at the end of the experiment,
and this also served as an additional incentive to participate; lastly, the
experiment involved deception, so all the participants were informed about the
reasons for this at the end of the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3" sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited by advertising around local universities and
businesses. They included university staff, mature students and members of the
general public. Volunteers were screened via telephone interviews. Inclusion
criteria included being a woman with a BMI between 30 and
35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and aged between 20 and 55 years with at
least one period of dietary restriction of 4 weeks or more in the last 24
months, but not in the last 4 weeks. Exclusion criteria included a dislike for
popular sweet carbonated drinks, dieting in the last month, history of diabetes,
having an eating disorder, being currently treated for depression or scoring
&#x0003e;10 on the Beck Depression Inventory II<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, being a smoker, pregnant or lactating, wearing a pacemaker, and
currently taking medication for mood or thyroid disorders. A pin-prick method
using the Accu-Chek GC was used to measure blood glucose levels. Fasting blood
glucose levels &#x02265;&#x000a0;11&#x000a0;mmol/l were determined as
abnormal, and individuals with these levels were not permitted to participate in
the study. A screening questionnaire was also used to detect individuals with
diabetes symptoms. In fact, nobody with diabetes symptoms was detected.</p><p>Of the eighty-five women screened, forty-one were excluded: for having a BMI
&#x0003e;35&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic> 5) or a BMI
&#x0003c;&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (<italic>n</italic>
30), currently lactating (<italic>n</italic> 1), receiving antidepressant
treatment (<italic>n</italic> 3) or having a thyroid disorder
(<italic>n</italic> 2). A further three participants withdrew during the
baseline week, giving an achieved sample size of forty-one (age 35 (<sc>sd</sc>
9&#x000b7;1) years). The participants were assigned alternately to two groups
after screening. The participants who withdrew were replaced by the next
available participant. This method of assignment was used instead of random
assignment because recruitment to previous studies was difficult, given the
exclusion criteria and duration of the experiment. It was important that early
recruiters and later recruiters (who might differ, for instance, in terms of
eagerness to volunteer) be assigned evenly to the two groups. As nobody dropped
out of the experiment during the intervention phase, an intention-to-treat
analysis was unnecessary. The participants were given a disturbance allowance of
&#x000a3;100 (&#x000a3;20 per week), to provide a limited, but not
compelling, incentive for participation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-4"><title>Experimental drinks</title><p>Each participant was given four 250&#x000a0;ml bottles per d for 4 weeks
(daily total 1800&#x000a0;kJ; 105&#x000a0;g CHO). The sucrose-sweetened
Irn Bru (per 100&#x000a0;ml) contained 180&#x000a0;kJ,
10&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;g CHO and 0&#x000b7;35&#x000a0;mg Fe with
traces of protein and fat. The diet Irn Bru contained
17&#x000a0;kJ/100&#x000a0;ml and traces of CHO, with no protein, fat or
Fe. The amount to be consumed was chosen as 1000&#x000a0;ml/d on the basis of
the ethical approval process in our earlier studies (Reid <italic>et
al.</italic>, 2007<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>), as it was found to be the minimum amount to have an effect on
dietary intake and have ecological validity without posing ethical and practical
difficulties. In 2012, the consumption of carbonated soft drinks amounted to
102&#x000b7;6 litres per head<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">

substantially more than this<sup>(</sup>

</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Experimental measures</title><sec id="sec1-5-1"><title>Physical measures</title><p>Digital scales (Soehnle) were used to measure weight to the nearest
0&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;kg, and a stadiometer (model no. 220; SECA) was
used to measure height to the nearest 0&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;cm. Using
standardised callipers, skinfold thickness was measured around the abdomen
(suprailiac) just above the iliac crest. Waist circumference was measured to
the nearest 0&#x000b7;1 inch using a standardised measuring tape.
Subsequently, the volunteers rested on a bed for 5&#x000a0;min before
body measurements were taken using the Bodystat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>1500
bioimpedance machine (Bodystat Limited). The bioimpedance machine was used
to measure body fat, water and lean mass, BMI, BMR (in kJ), estimated
average requirement and impedance. The BMR (at rest) was estimated using the
Brozek and Grande formula. This formula is based on the lean weight of a
subject and not on total body weight.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5-2"><title>Food, mood and activity diary</title><p>Each volunteer was given an electronic pedometer (Digi-Walker; Yamax) and
instructions on how to use it. Accordingly, the participants were asked to
record the number of steps that they walked each day in their diaries before
bedtime. For each week, the mean number of total daily steps was calculated.
From this number, activity levels were estimated, where
&#x0003c;&#x000a0;5000 steps indicate sedentary, 5000&#x02013;7499
steps low active, 7500&#x02013;9999 steps somewhat active, and
10&#x000a0;000+ steps active<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>12</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. For entry into the simulation model<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, these categories were coded as activity levels 1&#x000b7;4,
1&#x000b7;6, 1&#x000b7;8 and 2&#x000b7;0, respectively.</p><p>The 7&#x000a0;d unweighed prospective diary used in the present experiment
was similar to that used previously in similar experiments<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The participants were required to record all foods and drinks
consumed by them as accurately as possible in hourly time slots. To improve
accuracy, all the participants were trained in the use of the diary,
including the use of appropriate detailed descriptions of foods, using food
atlases showing portion sizes for reference<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>14</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and using labelling and packaging information for data entry.
Moreover, the experimenter (M. D.) is a trained nutritionist and each week
along with the participants, she reviewed and corrected their diaries to
maximise accuracy by checking portion sizes, eliciting further details of
the foods actually eaten, checking periods when the participants seemed to
have eaten little or nothing and checking that they had remembered to record
snacks and drinks consumed. To further enhance compliance, the participants
were given a brief individual dietary report at the end of the experiment,
based on their data. Mood and activity levels were also recorded in the
diary. Mood was measured four times a day using ten- or seven-point bipolar
Likert scales designed to comprehensively assess the main dimensions of
subjective state (happy&#x02013;sad; angry&#x02013;calm;
anxious&#x02013;composed; disgusted&#x02013;satisfied;
tired&#x02013;energetic; restless&#x02013;relaxed;
hungry&#x02013;full; thirsty&#x02013;not thirsty;
intoxicated&#x02013;sober; ill&#x02013;well).</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5-3"><title>Procedure</title><p>Further details of the questionnaire are available elsewhere<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The eligible volunteers visited the laboratory six times over
5 weeks: during the initial screening interview, at the start of each
intervention week and at the end of the last intervention week. During the
initial screening interview, height and weight were recorded, and the
subjects were screened for eating disorders and depression using standard
criteria with the Beck Depression Inventory II<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>9</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and the Eating Disorder Inventory<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>15</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As well as verbal information, the volunteers were given an information sheet
about the experiment. The subjects were told that the purpose of the
experiment was to examine the effects of certain nutrients in soft drinks on
people's psychological well-being. They were informed that the
drinks provided would be similar in taste to commercial soft drinks such as
Irn Bru and Tizer, but that the drinks had been prepared especially for the
experiment. The drinks were actually Irn Bru in plastic bottles with the
replacement labels removed and the caps painted a uniform colour. Although
artificially sweetened and sucrose soft drinks taste similar, they are
discriminable in simultaneous taste comparisons. The participants were given
only one type of drink, and they were instructed not to compare theirs with
that of other participants in order to maintain the integrity of the
experiment. Most participants were unknown to each other. Those eligible
participated after the screening session on the basis of informed consent,
which included consent to drinking beverages that may or may not contain
sucrose.</p><p>A taste test was then conducted with a rating form to exclude anyone who
disliked drinks of the type to be given. Biometric baseline measurements,
including skinfold thickness, waist circumference and bioelectrical
impedance measurements, were taken in those still eligible. They were also
given a 7&#x000a0;d food diary and a food atlas to record their dietary
intake for the baseline week before the experiment. The experimenter spent
approximately 30&#x000a0;min training each subject on the accurate
completion of the diary (see below).</p><p>After recording baseline data, the subjects returned on the following Monday
or Tuesday morning each week to keep the weekend constant within each
7&#x000a0;d test period. During these visits, the diaries of the subjects
were checked for any ambiguities or missing data, and if necessary, the
subjects were given further training on the completion of the diary.
Anthropometric measurements were again taken at each visit together with a
saliva swab. The participants were told that the experimenter could tell the
extent to which they had been consuming the test drinks from the saliva
sample, which was in fact discarded. This is an example of a
&#x02018;bogus pipeline&#x02019;, which improves compliance<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>16</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. The participants also discussed any perceived effects of
consuming the soft drinks and any difficulties that they had experienced on
drinking them on schedule. The participants were then given their supply of
drinks for the week and were informed to consume the specified amount each
day at 11.00, 14.00, 18.00 and 20.00&#x000a0;hours. The subjects rated
their mood directly after consuming the drinks in their 7&#x000a0;d food
and mood diaries every day. They were instructed to keep the unopened
bottles in a refrigerator or in a cool place.</p><p>The same procedure was repeated on the following three Monday or Tuesday
mornings. Throughout each 7&#x000a0;d period, the subjects were asked to
report to the experimenter any problems or symptoms that they felt might be
related to the consumption of the soft drinks. At the end of week 4, the
subjects returned one last time to the laboratory, when final measurements
were taken and diaries were collected.</p><p>At the end of the 5-week experiment, written and verbal dietary feedback was
provided and a disturbance allowance was given to those who completed the
experiment. The subjects were debriefed about the nature and purpose of the
study, including explanation of the deceptions involved.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data collected during baseline (week 0) and weeks 1 and 4 of the intervention
were compared; data collected during weeks 2 and 3 were not used, as they
assessed neither hypothetical early changes in dietary compensation nor final
outcome. Possible differences in baseline anthropometric, dietary and
psychological variables between the groups were assessed using independent
<italic>t</italic> tests. Using Shapiro&#x02013;Wilk tests, all the
variables entered into the main analyses were found to be normally distributed.
Body weight at the end of the intervention was analysed with linear regression
modelling to compare the observed body weight with the predicted body weight
(National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) model)
and intervention group. Differences in dietary variables were examined using
general linear modelling with the following design: two between (sucrose or
aspartame drink groups) by three repeated (baseline, week 1 and week 4) measures
with waist circumference as a covariate. In this design, an effect of sucrose
would be shown by a significant week&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;group
interaction.</p><p>The assessment of mood data was carried out using a general linear modelling
repeated-measures design using time of day and week as repeated measures, with
type of drink and expectancy as fixed variables. Where sphericity tests failed,
this was noted; otherwise, results are reported by assuming sphericity. Where
appropriate, <italic>post hoc</italic> comparisons were made using
<italic>t</italic> tests. All analyses were carried out using SPSS versions 16
and 19 for Windows (SPSS, Inc., IBM).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2"><title>Results</title><p>
<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref> summarises the selected baseline

to vary as a function of initial weight. Looking at the means for women who were
given sucrose in the three experiments, healthy-weight women compensated by
1&#x000b7;87 (<sc>sd</sc> 0&#x000b7;13)&#x000a0;kg that they did not
gain and overweight women compensated by 1&#x000b7;32 (<sc>sd</sc>

(<sc>sd</sc> 0&#x000b7;47)&#x000a0;kg. So, overweight women
compensated least well, but the standard error for obese women was approximately
twice that for the other participants, showing more variability. To address the
question of whether weight change after sucrose consumption differed between the
groups, a one-way ANOVA on weight change (observed end
weight&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;baseline weight) was conducted only
for the participants who were given sucrose, with study (healthy, overweight and

normal-weight and overweight women; however, the use of the NIDDK model<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> allowed more precise estimation of the magnitude of compensation: obese
women who were given 1800&#x000a0;kJ sucrose per d in soft drinks for 4 weeks
gained a mean of 1&#x000b7;72&#x000a0;kg less than the value predicted by the
model. Weight did not change any more than that observed in previous studies with
normal-weight and overweight participants. The reported energy intake, including the
supplement, did not change. The reported voluntary intake of CHO of the participants
was reduced to as much as 27&#x000a0;% of the energy value of the supplement by
week 4 of the intervention. The reported fat and protein intake was also reduced.
There were no effects on mood, hunger or thirst. There was no significant weight
change in the group given aspartame, suggesting that any deliberate attempts to
refrain from consuming the diet in case the drinks contained sugar were ineffective.</p><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The present study has at least four limitations. First, dietary intake recorded
in the unweighed diaries was poorly related to the energy expenditure estimated
using the NIDDK model<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, suggesting about 21&#x000a0;% under-reporting. Consequently, it
is important to avoid overinterpreting the self-reported dietary intake data.
Second, there were some differences between the results of the present
experiment and those of earlier experiments<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, with the reported compensation being smaller and individual
differences being larger. The participants may have altered their behaviour in
response to the experimental intervention. Self-monitoring is important for the
weight control of obese people<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, and taking part in a study monitoring dietary behaviour may have
had a generic influence on behaviour. Thus, the present experiment does not show
that obese people compensate identically to healthy-weight people.</p><p>Third, the participants may simply have avoided drinking some or all the
supplementary drinks, despite regular monitoring and the bogus pipeline.
However, the fact that overall CHO intake increased only in the sucrose group
suggests adequate compliance. Lastly, sweetness may have reduced energy intake
in both conditions. However, while there is some evidence that sweetness
increases short-term satiety<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, the limited evidence suggests that, if anything, in the long term
the consumption of sweet drinks leads to weight gain<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>19</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, which was not the case in the present study for either the sucrose
or the aspartame group.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Generalisability</title><p>The findings of the present study apply only to those experiments where sucrose
is added to the diet blind, with the diet being monitored. If some participants
were restraining voluntary consumption because their diets were being monitored,
then liberal use of sucrose in the unmonitored diet might not be compensated for
so well. The soft drinks used in the present experiment were sucrose sweetened
as is common in the UK, rather than being sweetened with high-fructose maize
syrup, as is common in the USA. Specific concerns about fructose and obesity
remain, although they may have been overstated<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Implications</title><p>Generally, obese women were able to compensate for the addition of sucrose to the
diet by mainly reducing CHO intake. Although these effects were relatively small
and the experiment is limited in other ways, the present study suggests that the
cognitive control of eating in obesity is important. Expectancy effects may play
a role in failures to compensate for sucrose, hence in any consequent weight
gain.</p><p>Partially controlling psychological expectancy effects, by giving sucrose blind,
reduces the chances of people being affected by cognitive factors, which may be
important for determining the effects of sugars in everyday life. The accepted
cognitive factors include the emotional valence of food<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, which may be associated with eating binges; interactions between
expectancy, orosensory experience, and satiety<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>2</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>3</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>; the abstinence violation effect<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> that having eaten a restricted food, one may as well eat more;
outcome expectancy effects<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, so that people's behaviour after eating sugars is in
accordance with the expectation that it leads to sugar craving and more
consumption; and experimental (or social) demand characteristics<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, so that participants tend to behave as the experiment (or social
setting) suggests that they should behave.</p><p>If under controlled conditions people partially compensate for sucrose added to
the diet, then there is a need for more research on what people think and what
they feel about sugars, and it is premature to consider sucrose to be
exceptionally problematic for weight management. Indeed, widely publicised
warnings about sugars<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>
<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>25</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> may make cognitive factors more likely to support dysregulation of
energy intake, perpetuating the everyday weight management problems that the
warnings are supposed to address.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-4" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrates that obese women partially compensate for sucrose
added blind to the diet over 4 weeks and do not gain weight. Their response is
not fundamentally different from the response of normal-weight and overweight
women observed in earlier studies, despite concerns that obese people regulate
diet differently, or more poorly, compared with normal-weight people. If
cognitive factors are important determinants of dietary compensation, then there
is a need for an improved understanding of how cognition interacts with
physiological mechanisms of appetite regulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank an anonymous reviewer for helpful suggestions, including directing
