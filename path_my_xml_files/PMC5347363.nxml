We sought to generate knowledge about the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial to test the effect of the Alert for AFib intervention on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about treatment-seeking for signs and symptoms of AF. Adults &#x02265;65 years old (96% White) at risk for developing AF were randomized to receive the Alert for AFib intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 40) or an attention control session (<italic>n</italic> = 40).

From baseline to study completion, knowledge (<italic>p</italic> = .005) and attitudes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .001) about treatment-seeking improved more in the intervention group compared with the control group.

The longer AF goes untreated, the more resistant the atrium is to treatments aimed at converting and maintaining sinus rhythm, leaving many patients with frequent recurrent episodes (<xref rid="bibr9-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Cosio et al., 2008</xref>). Because of these recurrent events, AF treatment is more costly (<xref rid="bibr14-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Kirchhof, 2009</xref>), and the patients&#x02019; quality of life (<xref rid="bibr26-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Thrall, Lane, Carroll, &#x00026; Lip, 2006</xref>) and productivity suffer (<xref rid="bibr23-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Rohrbacker et al., 2010</xref>). Delay in seeking treatment of AF at symptom onset results in a missed opportunity for vital early treatment. A recent study (<xref rid="bibr18-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">McCabe, Chamberlain, Rhudy, &#x00026; DeVon, 2016</xref>) revealed that 70% of patients with AF symptoms did not seek evaluation within a week of symptom onset. Treatment-seeking for AF is hindered when people do not recognize symptoms that represent AF, attribute those symptoms to alternative causes, or do not believe the symptoms are serious enough to require medical evaluation (<xref rid="bibr19-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">McCabe, Rhudy, Chamberlain, &#x00026; DeVon, 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr20-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">McCabe, Rhudy, &#x00026; DeVon, 2015</xref>). Only a few investigators have reported strategies to engage persons most at risk for AF to self-monitor for the signs and symptoms of AF and seek treatment early if signs and/or symptoms occur (<xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, such engagement has the potential to reduce treatment-seeking delay.</p><sec id="section1-0193945916656609"><title>Gaps in Science for Early Detection of AF</title><p>Emerging evidence shows that periodic screening for AF during clinical visits through pulse palpation (<xref rid="bibr7-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Camm et al., 2012</xref>), handheld electrocardiography devices, or smartphone applications (<xref rid="bibr17-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Lowres et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr25-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Svennberg, Engdahl, Al-Khakili, &#x00026; Friberg, 2015</xref>) is effective for detecting undiagnosed AF. In its early stage, AF is often episodic. In such periodic screening, detection relies on AF being present at screening. Engaging at-risk persons in regular self-monitoring that includes symptom awareness and pulse palpation can address this limitation (<xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>There is a paucity of research pertaining to evaluation of interventions that promote early treatment-seeking behavior through self-monitoring in older adults at risk for developing AF.

However, studies have not included detailed descriptions of self-monitoring interventions that are critical for replication (<xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bibr21-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Munschauer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, investigators have not reported the interventions&#x02019; influence on knowledge attitudes, and beliefs that promote self-monitoring. Information about the effects of the intervention on knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about AF that promote self-monitoring is crucial to determining the cognitive mechanisms that influence adoption of self-monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="section2-0193945916656609"><title>Purpose</title><p>The intervention called Alert for AFib was developed by the authors to address the aforementioned gaps and promote early treatment-seeking behavior for AF signs and symptoms.

Patients were excluded if they (a) had a documented history of palpitations, atrial or ventricular arrhythmias resulting in irregular pulse; (b) had a documented cognitive impairment; (c) had uncompensated hearing or visual deficits; (d) were receiving ongoing active therapy for malignancy, hospice or palliative care; (e) anticipated surgery in the 2 months following study enrollment; (f) had received general anesthesia in the 30 days before enrollment; (g) resided with a person who had diagnosed AF; or (h) had been employed or received training in a health care field where they had been exposed to information about AF.</p></sec><sec id="section5-0193945916656609"><title>Measures</title><sec id="section6-0193945916656609"><title>Demographic and clinical data form</title><p>Demographic data (i.e., age, sex, race, educational level, marital status, and living alone vs. with someone) and data pertinent to the participants&#x02019; risk factors for AF were abstracted from medical records.</p></sec><sec id="section7-0193945916656609"><title>Knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about AF</title><p>No published instruments were available to measure knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about AF among people at risk for developing AF. Therefore, we developed the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs about Atrial Fibrillation Survey (KABAFS). The KABAFS is a 33-item instrument that includes five subscales: eight-item knowledge of AF-related symptoms (response yes/no/not sure); a six-item knowledge of symptoms not related to AF (response yes/no/not sure); five-item general knowledge about AF (response true/false/not sure); five-item attitudes about recognizing AF and help-seeking behaviors for AF symptoms (response from 1 = <italic>not at all sure</italic> to 4 = <italic>very sure</italic>); and nine-item beliefs about AF and symptoms (response from 1 = <italic>strongly disagree</italic> to 4 = <italic>strongly agree</italic>). Content validity of the KABAFS was evaluated by four advanced-practice registered nurses (RNs) with expertise in AF care and five research experts in the field of treatment-seeking delay. Cognitive interviews with six mock participants were conducted to evaluate the content validity of items and assure items were interpreted as intended. Items of the KABAFS were revised according to experts&#x02019; and mock participants&#x02019; suggestions. Cronbach&#x02019;s alpha coefficients of reliabilities for the subscales of this newly developed instrument were the following: AF symptom knowledge, .78; knowledge of symptoms not related to AF, .70; general knowledge about AF, .42; attitudes .72; and beliefs, .69.</p><p>For this study, the KABAFS was administered by interview to minimize missing data that may occur with the use of mailed surveys. The subscales AF symptom knowledge and the knowledge of symptoms not related to AF were combined to produce a single symptom knowledge score. General Knowledge, Attitudes, and Beliefs subscales were scored separately. Higher scores reflected knowledge, attitudes, or beliefs more favorable to early treatment-seeking behavior.</p></sec><sec id="section8-0193945916656609"><title>Feasibility</title><p>Data were collected on the number of records screened, number of patients excluded and the reason for exclusion, number of eligible patients, number of patients who declined, number of patients unable to contact, attrition, reason for attrition, number of data collections completed, number of pulse logs returned, and percentage of total possible pulse checks completed.

To assess participant comprehension of the content for each component, the RN asked participants to tell in their own words what they thought were the important points to remember and reinforced the content as needed.</p><p>For the pulse palpation instruction, the RN described an irregular pulse, differentiated between a regular pulse and an irregular one, and instructed how an irregular pulse could signify AF and discussed the benefit of regular pulse palpation to identify an irregular pulse. The RN used illustration and demonstration to instruct participants in radial pulse palpation. Participants were then asked to perform a return demonstration to assess their technique. The goal was to identify the pulse rhythm as regular or irregular, not to count the rate. If participants were unable to palpate the pulse, they received a stethoscope for home use and the RN instructed them in use of a stethoscope to auscultate the apical pulse. The RN validated the participant&#x02019;s ability to auscultate the apical pulse accurately by placing her stethoscope in an adjacent location to auscultate simultaneously with the participant and both counted the heartbeat for 30 s. To validate ability to palpate the radial pulse, both the RN and the participant palpated the pulse simultaneously on each wrist and both counted for 30 s. Ability to palpate the pulse or auscultate the heartbeat was considered satisfactory when the participant&#x02019;s count was within five beats of the RN&#x02019;s count. To aid recognition of an irregular pulse, participants listened to an audio recording created by the institution&#x02019;s media services that produced sounds similar to an irregular and regular heartbeat. Participants were asked to identify the irregular heartbeat.</p><p>After demonstrating satisfactory pulse palpation or auscultation technique and ability to differentiate an irregular from a regular heartbeat recording, participants were instructed on how to complete the pulse-checking log and were asked to log the rhythm (regular vs. irregular) daily for 2 months. The RN asked participants to rate their self-confidence in their ability to palpate their pulse, to perform palpation or auscultation daily, and to identify barriers to performance and strategies to overcome barriers. To promote habit formation, participants were encouraged to perform the pulse palpation at the same time each day and combine it with another routine activity (<xref rid="bibr10-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Gardner, Lally, &#x00026; Wardle, 2012</xref>).</p><p>For home use and reinforcement of content covered in the face-to-face session, participants were given printed resources. These included a two-page handout on AF, published by the <xref rid="bibr1-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">American College of Cardiology (2015)</xref> that described AF, listed symptoms, discussed causes and consequences of AF, and briefly described treatment options and an institutionally produced handout describing signs and symptoms of stroke and seeking care for stroke. Participants were given a pulse-checking log that was produced by the investigators for recording the recording the daily pulse palpation (regular or irregular) over the 2-month study period. The log contained an illustration and instructions for palpating the pulse and advice to notify their health care provider when they noted an irregular pulse.</p><p>Two weeks after study enrollment, intervention participants returned to the center for an individualized, 15- to 20-min, face-to-face follow-up session to assess their comprehension of content covered in the initial session, to answer participant questions, to review the pulse log, and to address any challenges that had arisen related to pulse palpation or auscultation. Content from the initial session was reinforced as needed, and participants were commended for pulse-checking performance.</p></sec><sec id="section15-0193945916656609"><title>Intervention fidelity</title><p>To ensure intervention fidelity, the investigators created a script to guide the open-ended questions asked of participants, content presentation in each page of the flip chart, introduction to the video and risk assessment, instruction regarding pulse palpation/auscultation, and recognition of irregular pulse. The script included an approximate time frame for each component. The investigators developed a checklist that contained elements of the intervention to evaluate the RNs&#x02019; adherence to the protocol. In addition to training for content of the protocol, the RNs were trained in the Ask-Tell-Ask approach (<xref rid="bibr6-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Boxer &#x00026; Snyder, 2009</xref>). Before enrolling participants, the two RNs who delivered the interventions were observed by members of the research team to ensure consistency in their approach of content delivery and their adherence to the protocol. During the study, team members Drs.Vickers Douglas and Barton evaluated the fidelity of selected, audio recorded sessions for adherence to the script and approach to intervention delivery. Regular meetings with the RNs were held to evaluate participants&#x02019; responses to the intervention and to address any challenges of adherence to protocol.</p></sec><sec id="section16-0193945916656609"><title>Attention control session</title><p>After the baseline interview to collect KABAFS data, a study coordinator (not the RN providing the intervention) delivered an individual face-to-face, 45-min interactive session about healthy sleep to the control group to control for the influence of time and attention. This session was designed to be similar to the intervention in terms of the dialog approach and media used to present the content. The session included a video presentation on the importance of sleep, assessment of perceptions about sleep, and use of a handheld paper flip chart to present strategies to promote healthy sleep. Control participants did not receive a follow-up session. At the end of the study, they were given the option to receive the same AF education materials provided for the intervention group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section17-0193945916656609"><title>Procedures</title><p>The study was approved by the institutional review board of the study site. Medical records of patients from primary care and cardiology clinics who gave permission to review their records for research purposes were screened for eligibility. Invitation letters containing information about the study and participation requirements were sent to eligible patients. Letters contained an interest page where patients could decline to be contacted about the study or indicate an interest in hearing more about the study. Patients were instructed to return the interest page with their response in the self-addressed stamped envelope. The study coordinator called the interested patients to explain the study eligibility requirements and arrange a visit to the study site. Staff reinforced information about the study and obtained written consent at the in-person visit.</p><p>After providing written consent, participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group or the control group through the randomization function in Excel software (Microsoft). The KABAFS was administered during face-to-face interview before beginning the Alert for AFib or the healthy sleep content. At the close of the intervention session, participants were scheduled to return in 2 weeks for a face-to-face follow-up session with the RN who conducted their initial session. The study coordinators administered the KABAFS by telephone interview to both intervention and control participants at 1 and 2 months after enrollment. During the 1- and 2-month data collection interviews for intervention participants, the study coordinators also inquired about any challenges to pulse palpation and asked participants to report any missed days of pulse palpation. On completion of the study, the Study Participation Acceptance Rating Survey was mailed to all participants and returned by mail in a provided self-addressed stamped envelope. Intervention participants were asked to return their pulse log by mail. All participants received US$25 remuneration for each visit to the study site.</p></sec><sec id="section18-0193945916656609"><title>Data Analysis</title><p>Frequencies and percentages were used to describe feasibility and acceptability outcomes, as well as demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.

The majority of participants completed the study and were adherent to study protocol. Participants perceived the study burden to be low, despite the required visit to the study site and performance of daily pulse palpation and recording. The majority of intervention participants reported that the Alert for AFib intervention was very to extremely helpful. Intervention participants reported that pulse palpation was easy to do, worth the time and effort, were confident that they could do it well, and that they would be likely to very likely to continue pulse palpation after study completion.</p><p>Study findings add to the body of knowledge about older adults&#x02019; willingness to participate in studies to improve treatment-seeking behavior through self-monitoring for AF signs and symptoms and adoption of daily pulse palpation. The present study&#x02019;s recruitment rate of 15% was lower than the 23% and 33% rates reported by <xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al. (2015)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al. (2014)</xref>, respectively. The time commitment of 45 min and an additional visit to the medical center may have limited interest in participating in the study. The 93% retention rate for intervention participants reflects the effectiveness of the training and protocols and the participant interest. Participant retention during the 2-month study was consistent with the 90% and 93% retention rates of <xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al. (2015)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al. (2014)</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Results of the present investigation support prior findings about older adults&#x02019; ability to perform pulse palpation and recognize an irregular pulse. <xref rid="bibr13-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Kallmunzer et al. (2014)</xref> reported that pulse palpation to detect AF by older adults was performed with a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 96%. One month after an educational session, 81% of participants in the study by <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al. (2014)</xref> were capable of pulse palpation and recognition of irregular heartbeat. All intervention participants in the present study were able to either palpate or auscultate their pulse, to differentiate an audio recording of an irregular heartbeat from a regular heartbeat, and to describe the characteristics of an irregular pulse.</p><p>Older adults&#x02019; motivation to perform pulse palpation is further demonstrated in the finding that 87% of intervention participants returned their 2-month pulse-checking log and all but two of those 87% completed &#x0003e;88% of possible checks that could be recorded. In comparison, <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al. (2014)</xref> observed that 1 month after enrollment, 82% of participants completed 80% of their pulse diary. <xref rid="bibr21-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Munschauer et al. (2004)</xref> did not ask participants to record pulse checks, but when participants were asked whether they had checked their pulse following their education session, 70% stated they had. Participants of the Munschauer study and the study by <xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al. (2015)</xref> were instructed to palpate their pulses once a month; in comparison, participants in the <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al. (2014)</xref> study palpated their pulses twice a day and participants in the present study palpated their pulses daily.</p><p>The present study&#x02019;s intervention session was longer (45 min) than the 10 min reported by <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al. (2014)</xref> and <xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al. (2015)</xref>. It was difficult to determine what approach was used in previous studies, but the sessions focused on pulse palpation. The Ask-Tell-Ask approach (<xref rid="bibr6-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Boxer &#x00026; Snyder, 2009</xref>) used in the present study is likely to require more time because the participant is actively engaged in the dialog. In this study, instructing the participant on pulse palpation and validating performance often required &#x0003e;5 min for participants unfamiliar with pulse palpation. The content and approach of the Alert for AFib intervention may have contributed to the observed adherence rate of 87% over 2 months compared with 82% observed by <xref rid="bibr28-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Virtanen et al. (2014)</xref> over 1 month.</p><p>Few, if any, investigators have conducted randomized controlled trials to evaluate the influence of a cognitive behavioral intervention on knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors to promote early detection of AF. Although <xref rid="bibr4-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Benito et al. (2015)</xref> randomly assigned participants to receive instruction about pulse palpation and recognition of warning signs, the outcome of interest was the number of new AF diagnoses, not adherence to pulse palpation or changing knowledge of AF symptoms or attitudes, and beliefs about AF that support early treatment-seeking. We observed that scores for knowledge of symptoms, knowledge of AF, and attitudes toward seeking treatment in the intervention group improved to a greater degree than the control group in this cohort of older adults.</p><p>Sampling bias is a limitation to our study. This feasibility study was conducted at a single site in the Midwestern United States and enrolled patients who had given prior consent to be contacted for research purposes. Our study likely included participants who value research and may have been economically advantaged. Therefore, responses on the KABAFS may be biased in favor of healthy attitudes and beliefs. The fact that only 15% of eligible participants enrolled in the study introduces additional sampling bias, and we do not know whether individual characteristics varied between participants and non-participants. Our findings are only generalizable to older, White adults. Control group participants (38%) reported that they sought information about AF from Internet resources or their health care provider following enrollment in the study which may have influenced their responses on the 1- and 2-month KABAFS scores. Our findings may also be limited by using the new KABAFS that was evaluated for content validity, but not construct validity at the time it was administered to participants. The responsiveness of the KABAFS to change in knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs after the Alert for AFib intervention was demonstrated.</p><p>Additional investigations in larger and more diverse samples are needed to determine whether our findings can be replicated in populations that vary by race, ethnicity, sex, sexual identity, age, disability, socioeconomic status, and geographic location (<xref rid="bibr27-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2014</xref>). Prior research has demonstrated that social, economic, and environmental disadvantage are associated with risk for cardiovascular disease (<xref rid="bibr29-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Yancy et al., 2011</xref>).Testing of the Alert for AFib intervention in diverse populations may help to reduce patterns of known health disparities in AF (<xref rid="bibr22-0193945916656609" ref-type="bibr">Naderi, Rodrguez, Wang, &#x00026; Foody, 2014</xref>).</p><p>The Alert for AFib intervention is a theoretically and empirically based intervention that was pilot tested using a rigorously controlled protocol. The Alert for AFib intervention was feasible to deliver and was acceptable to older, well-educated White adults in an academic medical center setting. Results of this feasibility study suggest that the efficacy of this intervention can be tested in a large sample across multiple sites.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to acknowledge Wendi Lytle, M Ed for assistance with manuscript preparation</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Nursing Research of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number K23NR0114253.
