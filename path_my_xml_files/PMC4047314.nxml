During antidepressant treatment, functional improvement often lags behind symptomatic resolution, and residual impairment is associated with an increased risk for relapse. When evaluating MDD treatments, it is important to assess not only depressive symptoms but also functional outcomes. In this post-hoc analysis, data from five studies were pooled to examine the effect of levomilnacipran extended-release (ER) versus placebo on functional impairment as measured using the Sheehan Disability Scale. The mean change in the Sheehan Disability Scale total score was significantly greater for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo in the overall pooled population, for both sexes, and across all ages. Statistically significantly higher rates of functional response, functional remission, combined (functional and symptomatic) response, and combined remission were achieved with levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo in the pooled population, as well as in the male, female, younger, and middle-aged population subgroups. The levomilnacipran ER group also showed significantly improved functional outcomes versus placebo regardless of baseline depression severity. Similarly, functional impairment was significantly improved and higher functional and combined response and remission rates were achieved with levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo regardless of the baseline level of functional impairment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords:</title><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>disability</kwd><kwd>functional impairment</kwd><kwd>levomilnacipran extended-release</kwd><kwd>major depressive disorder</kwd><kwd>Montgomery&#x02013;&#x000c5;sberg depression rating scale</kwd><kwd>Sheehan Disability Scale</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>OPEN-ACCESS</meta-name><meta-value>TRUE</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and recurrent disorder that is characterized by emotional and physical symptoms, as well as increased rates of impaired occupational functioning, marital problems, and social isolation (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Murray and Lopez, 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kessler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">Wang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">Moussavi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan and Sheehan, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Guico-Pabia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).

In addition, combined (functional and symptomatic) response and remission rates were significantly higher for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo in patients with lower and higher functional impairment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this post-hoc analysis of a large pooled dataset from five phase II/III studies, the SDS total score change was significantly greater for levomilnacipran ER versus placebo, indicating that levomilnacipran ER-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement in functional impairment over the course of treatment compared with placebo-treated patients. Significantly greater improvement in SDS total scores at end of treatment with levomilnacipran ER compared with placebo was also observed when patients were categorized by sex and age, suggesting improvement in functional impairment across a wide age range and in both sexes.</p><p>Many studies have attempted to identify patient characteristics and/or baseline demographics that are predictors of symptomatic improvement during antidepressant treatment; results have been generally conflicting because of variability in patient populations, response definitions, and antidepressant treatments (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Esposito and Goodnick, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Nierenberg, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). In one large study, a greater likelihood of symptomatic remission was associated with being female, white, and having higher levels of education and income; lower likelihood of remission was associated with more concurrent psychiatric or medical disorders, lower function, and lower quality of life at baseline (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Another study examining possible predictors of time to symptomatic remission in older patients found that those with poor health, lower income, previous depressive episodes, lack of social support, or older age at depressive onset were more likely to take longer to recover; in that analysis, sex, level of education, and level of functional disability were not important factors in determining time to remission (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Bosworth <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). One characteristic that has consistently been associated with lower response rates is severity of depressive symptoms (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Kocsis, 1990</xref>; <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">Vallejo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">Keller <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Trivedi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, in a recent post-hoc analysis, desvenlafaxine was found to improve depressive symptoms significantly more than placebo in a large pool of patients, regardless of baseline depression severity (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Guico-Pabia <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Despite recent focus on assessing functional impairment as an important &#x02018;real-world&#x02019; outcome of antidepressant treatment (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan and Sheehan, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Soares <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Langlieb and Guico-Pabia, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Mancini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>), there have been relatively few studies examining whether there are baseline characteristics that predict the likelihood of improved functional impairment during treatment. One recent post-hoc analysis of a large pool of data from studies on the SNRI duloxetine versus placebo reported that female sex, a shorter time since the first depressive episode, absence of previous antidepressant use, and mild versus more severe pain were all prognostic factors for improved functioning following antidepressant treatment (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Mancini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">Guico-Pabia <italic>et al</italic>. (2011)</xref>, found that baseline depression severity was not a predictor of functional response in patients treated with desvenlafaxine, which reduced functional impairment (and improved depressive symptoms) regardless of baseline depression severity.</p><p>In the current levomilnacipran ER analyses, it is notable that improved functional impairment was observed in levomilnacipran ER-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients, regardless of sex or age. Therefore in this study neither age nor sex predicted the likelihood of improvement in functional impairment, which is in contrast to the findings of <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Mancini <italic>et al</italic>. (2012)</xref>, who reported that duloxetine-treated female patients were more likely than male patients to show functional improvement (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Mancini <italic>et al.</italic>, 2012</xref>). The different results may be due to variations in study design and/or to different drug pharmacology. For example, some researchers (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Nutt, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">Briley and Moret, 2010</xref>; <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">Moret and Briley, 2011</xref>) have posited that antidepressants with a prominent noradrenergic component may be especially effective in improving function in depressed patients. In contrast to the SNRIs duloxetine, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine, which show preference for inhibiting serotonin compared with norepinephrine reuptake, levomilnacipran ER is a more potent inhibitor of norepinephrine compared with serotonin reuptake (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Auclair <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013</xref>). Additional research may be warranted to better understand the potential association between baseline characteristics and improvement in functional impairment during antidepressant treatment.</p><p>A significantly greater proportion of patients in the overall population treated with levomilnacipran ER relative to placebo achieved functional response and remission, as well as combined (functional and symptomatic) response and remission. This was also true for all sex and age subgroups, with the exception of remission in patients who were 60 years or older. In this group, the increased proportion of remitters relative to placebo did not reach statistical significance, most likely because of the smaller sample size. The clinically meaningful improvement in functional impairment observed among levomilnacipran ER-treated patients across age and sex demographics in an acute timeframe is an important outcome, given that in previous studies with other antidepressants residual functional impairment persisted even after depressive symptoms resolved (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Sheehan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In this analysis, levomilnacipran ER-treated patients in all three baseline symptom severity subgroups (MADRS&#x0003c;30, MADRS&#x02265;30, and MADRS&#x02265;35) showed significantly more improvement in functional impairment than did placebo-treated patients, on the basis of both total score change and functional and combined response and remission rates. Similarly, when patients were categorized into two groups on the basis of baseline functional impairment (lower level of functional impairment vs. higher level of functional impairment), levomilnacipran ER treatment resulted in improved outcomes relative to placebo treatment regardless of the baseline level of functional impairment.</p><p>In light of previous studies that found that higher levels of baseline depressive severity were associated with smaller advantages in response rates for antidepressants relative to placebo, the current results are intriguing. Additional research may be warranted to better understand the relationship between symptom severity and functional outcomes, as well as the relationship between baseline level of functional impairment and treatment outcomes.</p><p>Limitations of these analyses include their post-hoc, retrospective nature and the lack of corrections for multiple comparisons. The included trials were heterogeneous with regard to design (flexible vs. fixed dosing, inclusion/exclusion criteria) and duration (8 vs. 10 weeks), and the short length of treatment may not have been adequate to fully evaluate improvement in functional impairment. The inclusion and exclusion criteria in the primary studies may limit the ability to generalize the results. Lack of an active comparator limits comparisons to currently available antidepressant treatments.</p><p>Pooling the populations from several individual studies provided increased statistical power to better assess the effects of levomilnacipran ER on function; it also provided larger sample sizes for subgroup analyses. As functional impairment is a common and debilitating sequela of depression (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Kessler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">McKnight and Kashdan, 2009</xref>), understanding patient factors that may be associated with functional improvement during treatment is an important but often overlooked component in managing depression and facilitating return to wellness. Assessing functional impairment during the treatment of patients with MDD is an essential step in the evolution of patient management, as is the understanding of how various patient populations are likely to respond to a given antidepressant treatment.</p><p>In this post-hoc analysis, meaningful improvement in functional impairment in favor of levomilnacipran ER versus placebo was observed in the overall pooled population, as well as in patients categorized by sex, age, baseline severity of depressive symptoms, and baseline level of functional impairment. These results suggest that levomilnacipran ER treatment improves functional disability in patients with MDD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to acknowledge that writing assistance and editorial support for the preparation of this manuscript was provided by Jennifer Kaiser, PhD, and Adam Ruth, PhD, of Prescott Medical Communications Group, Chicago, Illinois, and a contractor for Forest Research Institute.</p><p>This study was supported by funding from Forest Research Institute, a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories Inc.
