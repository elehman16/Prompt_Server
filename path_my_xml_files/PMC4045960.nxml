Patients with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and a score of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;20 on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index were randomly allocated to MBT-DH or treatment as usual. The MBT-DH program consists of a maximum of 18&#x000a0;months&#x02019; intensive treatment, followed by a maximum of 18&#x000a0;months of maintenance therapy. Specialist treatment as usual is provided by the City Crisis Service in Amsterdam, a service that specializes in treating patients with personality disorders, offering manualized, non-MBT interventions including family interventions, Linehan training, social skills training, and pharmacotherapy, without a maximum time limit. Patients are assessed at baseline and subsequently every 6&#x000a0;months up to 36&#x000a0;months after the start of treatment. The primary outcome measure is the frequency and severity of manifestations of borderline personality disorder as assessed by the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index. Secondary outcome measures include parasuicidal behaviour, symptomatic distress, social and interpersonal functioning, personality functioning, attachment, capacity for mentalizing and quality of life. Cost-effectiveness is assessed in terms of the cost per quality-adjusted life year.

In the general population 1 to 2% of adults are diagnosed with BPD. In psychiatric populations up to 10% of outpatients and 20% of inpatients are diagnosed with BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. BPD is also associated with high psychosocial and socio-economic costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The economic burden of disease associated with BPD is higher than that associated with depression, and comparable to that of patients with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. BPD is also associated with high psychiatric comorbidity, particularly depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, substance abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and various other personality disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], often in combination with high levels of acting-out (e.g., suicidality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and/or functional impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The lifetime risk for completed suicide associated with BPD may be as high as 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Together, these findings emphasize the need for the development of effective treatments for this severe disorder.</p><p>In recent years, a number of evidence-based specialist treatments for BPD have been developed and evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These include dialectical behaviour therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], schema therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], transference-focused psychotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and Mentalization-Based Treatment (MBT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Various reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and treatment guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] recommend these treatments for patients with BPD.</p><p>The present study focuses on MBT as developed by Bateman and Fonagy in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. MBT is a promising psychodynamic treatment that is rooted in attachment and mentalizing approaches. Briefly, mentalizing refers to the capacity to interpret the self and others in terms of internal mental states such as feelings, emotions, wishes, desires, attitudes and values. This capacity is typically acquired in attachment relationships, and is associated with feelings of self-agency, affect regulation and resilience in the face of adversity. A growing body of research suggests that impairments in mentalizing can be seen as a core feature of BPD, as patients with BPD typically fail to make sense of their own internal experiences and those of others, particularly in contexts characterized by high levels of arousal. This results in emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, and the use of self-defeating strategies in an attempt to cope with these feelings (such as self-harm, substance abuse and promiscuity).</p><p>So far, two types of MBT have been empirically investigated: intensive outpatient MBT (MBT-IOP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and day hospital MBT (MBT-DH). Both MBT-IOP and MBT-DH consist of a treatment phase and a maintenance phase, each lasting a maximum of 18&#x000a0;months. The treatment phase of MBT-DH, the focus of the current study, consists of a day hospital treatment (five days per week) that includes daily group psychotherapy, weekly individual psychotherapy, individual crisis management from a mentalizing perspective, art therapy twice a week, mentalizing cognitive therapy and writing therapy. The maintenance phase in MBT-DH consists of a one-day follow-up treatment program combined with intermittent individual follow-up appointments, with the frequency reduced over time (step down).</p><p>At the time the current study was designed (2007), there was only one randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH compared to treatment as usual (that is, standard psychiatric care) conducted by the developers of MBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. This study randomized 38 BPD patients to either MBT-DH or TAU, which consisted of standard treatment offered in the UK in general psychiatric services and comprised (a) regular psychiatric review with a senior psychiatrist when necessary (on average twice a month); (b) inpatient admission when necessary, with discharge to non-psychoanalytic psychiatric partial hospitalization focusing on problem solving; followed by (c) outpatient and community follow-up as standard aftercare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Results showed that MBT-DH was superior to TAU on all major outcome variables, that is, depressive symptoms, suicide attempts and self-harm, number of inpatient days, and social and interpersonal functioning. These results were maintained during the 18-month follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Five years after discharge from MBT, the MBT-DH group still showed superiority over TAU on suicidality, diagnostic status, service use, use of medication, global functioning scores above 60 (on the Global Assessment of Functioning [GAF] Scale), and vocational status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. For example, 74% of the patients in the TAU condition had made at least one suicide attempt, in comparison with only 23% in the MBT-DH group. And at the end of the follow-up period, 13% of the MBT-DH patients met the diagnostic criteria for BPD, compared to 87% of the TAU group. Before treatment the total health related-costs for the MBT-DH group ($44,947) and the TAU group ($52,563) were comparable; after 18&#x000a0;months of treatment the costs were reduced to $27,303 in MBT-DH and $30,976 in TAU. During the 18-month follow-up, costs further diminished sharply. After 18&#x000a0;months follow-up, the total health-related costs in the MBT-DH group were one-fifth of that for patients in the TAU condition: $3,183 for MBT-DH compared to $15,490 for TAU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Since this original trial, two other trials focusing on MBT-DH have been published. An RCT in Denmark investigated the efficacy of MBT-DH compared with a less intensive manualized supportive group therapy combined with psycho-education and medication treatment in patients diagnosed with BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In total, 58 patients were randomly allocated to MBT-DH and 27 patients to the specialist combined treatment. Results showed that both the intensive combined MBT treatment and the less-intensive supportive group therapy led to significant improvements on a variety of psychological and interpersonal measures, e.g., general functioning, depression, social functioning and number of diagnostic criteria met for BPD, with moderate to large effect sizes (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.5 to 2.1). Contrary to the expectations of the researchers, however, MBT-DH was superior only on therapist-rated GAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. No follow-up or cost-effectiveness data are yet available from this trial.</p><p>Additional evidence for the effectiveness of MBT-DH comes from a naturalistic study by Bales and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] in The Netherlands. These authors investigated the effectiveness of 18-months of manualized MBT-DH in 45 patients with severe BPD and a high prevalence of comorbid Axis-I and Axis-II disorders. Results showed significant improvements in symptomatic distress, social and interpersonal functioning, and personality pathology and functioning; with moderate to large effect sizes (<italic>d</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.7 to 1.7). These authors also showed that care consumption, defined as additional treatments and admissions during the last year before entry into and during MBT treatment, reduced significantly during and after treatment. Yet, the lack of a control group limits the possibility to draw conclusions from this study about the effectiveness of MBT-DH.</p><p>Hence, although there is some promising evidence supporting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH, given the small number of studies, more research is urgently needed, particularly in light of the limitations of existing trials. First, one of the two RCTs was conducted by the developers of MBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and thus researcher allegiance may have influenced this study. Second, it is unclear whether results from trials conducted in the UK and Denmark may generalize to The Netherlands, given the large differences in health care systems between these countries. For instance, standard psychiatric care may be more effective in The Netherlands than in the UK because of differences in the allocation of health care and the clinical training of health workers. For instance, standard care in the Netherlands includes more and thus more expensive evidence-based treatments compared to the UK, and there is more funding available per patient. This assumption leads to the expectation that differences between a specialist treatment such as MBT-DH and TAU may be smaller in The Netherlands, as they may be in Denmark, which may explain the lack of substantial differences between MBT and specialist standard care in the trial of J&#x000f8;rgensen et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This assumption is supported by recent findings that highly structured treatment programmes are associated with considerable effects in BPD patients, which are often comparable to the effects of specialist treatments such as MBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. For instance, in a randomized trial of BPD patients, Bateman and Fonagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] found that MBT-IOP outperformed a manualized structured clinical management programme only at long-term follow-up in terms of effects on suicide attempts, severe incidents of self-harm, symptom severity, depression, interpersonal functioning and social adjustment. Hence, with regard to generalizability, a concern is the need for trials comparing MBT-DH to a credible TAU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Further, the study by J&#x000f8;rgensen and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] suffered from a number of important methodological limitations, such as a skewed randomization (with the majority of patients being randomized to MBT-DH) and the fact that the same therapists conducted treatments in both conditions (i.e., MBT-DH and supportive therapy), which may have led to &#x0201c;spill-over&#x0201d; effects.</p><p>Finally, none of the existing trials focused on the purported mechanism of change in MBT, that is, changes in attachment and mentalizing. Given the growing evidence for the role of common factors in psychotherapy, there is a pressing need to provide evidence for presumed mechanisms of change in current evidence-based treatments such as MBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><sec><title>Research aims and hypotheses</title><p>The primary aim of the present study was to investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH in comparison to a specialist TAU in The Netherlands. We expect both MBT-DH and specialist TAU to be effective on both primary and secondary outcomes. Yet, we expect MBT-DH to outperform TAU, particularly at 36&#x000a0;months follow-up. After 18&#x000a0;months of treatment we expect the costs in the MBT programme to be comparable to TAU; after 36&#x000a0;months we expect MBT-DH to outperform TAU (following Bateman &#x00026; Fonagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Second, we will investigate purported mechanisms of change in MBT, focusing on changes in attachment and mentalizing. Results of this trial are expected to inform mental health professionals, patients, and policy makers.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>This study is a multi-site RCT comparing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of manualized MBT-DH and a manualized specialist TAU in the treatment of BPD. The inclusion of patients started in March 2009 and ended in July 2012. The last follow-up measurement, at 36&#x000a0;months, will be in July 2015. Two mental health care centres agreed to participate in this study: Arkin en De Viersprong, both located in Amsterdam. Arkin is a large mental health care centre that specializes in the treatment of BPD. De Viersprong is a national institute for personality problems, offering specialized outpatient, day hospital, and inpatient psychotherapy for adolescent and adult patients with severe personality problems and disorders. Arkin agreed to run four MBT-DH groups and De Viersprong agreed to run two MBT-DH groups in the context of the trial, each consisting of nine patients. The City Crisis Service, which is part of Arkin, agreed to run the specialist TAU condition. The overall aim was to randomize 54 patients to MBT-DH and 54 patients to TAU.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>A certified Medical Ethics Review Committee in The Netherlands has approved this study, registered under NL38571.078.12. This ethical approval covered all sites of data collection.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Patients were referred for treatment by general practitioners, mental health care institutions, private practices and general hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (a) a BPD diagnosis as measured by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis II Personality Disorders (SCID-II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and (b) a total score on the Borderline Personality Disorder Severity Index (BPDSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] of at least 20, reflecting severe BPD. Originally, a BPDSI score&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;25 was proposed as a cut-off point. However, it became clear quickly that this criterion was overly strict, as several patients who did not meet this criterion showed severe functional impairments. Hence, we decided to adopt a cut-off of 20. Exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum to ensure generalizability and to allow patients with severe BPD to be included. The exclusion criteria were: (a) the presence of an Axis-I disorder (as determined with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Personality Disorders (SCID-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]) that required specialist treatment, (b) organic brain disorder, (c) IQ below 80, and (d) inadequate mastery of the Dutch language.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>All patients referred to one of the mental health care institutes were invited to attend an intake appointment. Patients who were deemed eligible received more information about the study and, if they were interested, a new appointment was set during which the BPSDI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and SCID-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] interviews were administered and other eligibility criteria were assessed. If patients met inclusion criteria, they provided informed consent and were randomized to either MBT or TAU by an independent researcher using a computerized 1:1 algorithm. Patients were subsequently asked to complete the baseline measures (see Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). It was preferred that patients completed the measures in the clinic; however if patients insisted, they were allowed to complete questionnaires at home, in which case patients were asked to return the questionnaires within a week by regular mail.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expected patient enrolment in the study.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-244X-14-149-1"/></fig><p>After baseline assessments, patients are assessed at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36&#x000a0;months after the start of treatment. At these time points, patients complete a battery of questionnaires and interviews. In addition, at 36&#x000a0;months, the SCID-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], SCID-II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], BPDSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], the Substance use section of the Measurements in the Addictions for Triage and Evaluation (MATE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and the Suicide and Self-Harm Inventory (SSHI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] are readministered by research assistants (MSc-level psychologists) who are blind to treatment condition. Patients are invited by telephone to come to the clinic to complete these assessments. If they do not respond or fail to attend the first appointment, up to three attempts are made to contact them by telephone to remind them. If patients refuse to complete the questionnaires at the clinic, they are allowed to complete them at home and return them by regular post; in this case, the SCID-I, SCID-II, BPDSI, MATE and SSHI can be completed over the telephone.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><sec><title>Day hospital MBT</title><p>MBT-DH is an intensive, manualized specialist treatment for patients with BPD that has been described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Briefly, MBT-DH in this study consists of an intensive day-hospitalization programme of 18&#x000a0;months followed by a maximum of 18&#x000a0;months of maintenance mentalizing (group) therapy. The day-hospital program, covering five days per week and 4.5&#x000a0;hours per day, includes the following components: (a) implicit mentalizing groups (i.e., daily group psychotherapy and weekly individual psychotherapy, and individual crisis planning from a mentalizing perspective) and (b) explicit mentalizing groups (i.e., art therapy twice a week, mentalizing cognitive group therapy, and writing therapy). The week&#x02019;s program is ended by a social hour and a community meeting. Patients can also consult a psychiatrist once a week and medication is offered following American Psychiatric Association guidelines.</p><p>The treatment goals of MBT-DH are: (a) to engage the patient in treatment; (b) to reduce psychiatric symptoms, particularly self-harm and parasuicidal behaviour; (c) to improve social and interpersonal functioning; and (d) to foster more appropriate health care usage and prevent hospital admissions and prolonged inpatient care. To achieve these goals, components of the programme focus on enhancing the capacity for mentalizing.</p><p>As outlined above, the assumption is that by enhancing their mentalizing capacity, particularly in high arousal contexts, patients will show improvements in understanding themselves and others, leading to a decreased need to rely on maladaptive coping strategies to deal with feelings of inner emptiness and &#x0201c;badness&#x0201d;, impulsivity and relationship conflicts.</p><p>The MBT teams consist of a total of three certified and registered psychologists, two psychotherapists, one psychiatrist, four sociotherapists, and a creative therapist. All clinicians who are involved in providing MBT-DH followed an MBT training programme led by a certified MBT trainer in The Netherlands, who also acted as a consultant before and during the study and provided supervision in the initial stages of the trial.</p><p>Adherence to the MBT treatment model is monitored in the following ways. First, in daily group reflections after the group therapy, therapists are stimulated to reflect on their adherence to the treatment model. Specifically, therapists are asked to reflect on whether their interventions have enhanced mentalizing, which interventions have not, and what alternative interventions might have been more successful. Second, every 6&#x000a0;months therapists complete, with regard to their own interventions and those of their co-therapist, the MBT Adherence and Competence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] for five consecutive days within one week after a group therapy session.

When possible, patients in the TAU condition are treated by the City Crisis Service itself. When more specific treatment is needed (e.g., treatment for drug addiction or hospitalization), other treatment centres are sought as appropriate for patients&#x02019; specific needs. Additionally, if patients prefer to be treated in the area where they live, the intaker or crisis team aims to find an appropriate treatment for them in their own environment.</p><p>The City Crisis Service is specialized in providing emergency assistance and long-term aftercare treatment after crises and is composed of five psychiatrists, two psychologists, five mental health nurses and one system therapist. Treatment is mainly provided on an outpatient basis; day treatment or hospitalization is offered only when necessary. The team aims to deliver optimal care by matching the intensity of one or more interventions with the need of the patients. Interventions consist of supporting and structuring sessions, extensive diagnostic investigations, writing a crisis plan, family interventions, STEPPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or Linehan training, social skills training or learning how to deal with aggression/impulse control, cognitive schema-focused or traditional insight-oriented treatment, pharmacotherapy, and inpatient treatment when deemed necessary. The outpatient team involved in the City Crisis Centre has a capacity of 50 patients. Because of the specialist nature of this service, the fact that its treatment was manualized, and its extensive experience with treating patients with BPD, we chose it as the provider of TAU for the present study. There is no maximum time limit for treatment. No adherence measures are available for TAU.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><sec><title>Demographic variables</title><p>At baseline, participants complete questions concerning their marital status, living situation, religion, education level, diploma, current job and working situation, and questions concerning the main earner in the family (relation to the patient, annual income, occupation, and source of income).</p></sec><sec><title>Primary outcome</title><p>The total score on the BPDSI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] was chosen as the primary outcome measure.

The purpose of the instrument is not to diagnose BPD, but to yield a quantitative index of the current severity of BPD features. The BPDSI contains the following nine subscales: (a) abandonment, (b) relationships, (c) identity, (d) impulsivity, (e) parasuicidal behaviour, (f) affective instability, (g) emptiness, (h) anger-control, and (i) dissociation and paranoid ideation. The BPDSI has been shown to be sensitive to change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

This interview poses specific questions not only about the number of acts but also about the dangerousness of these acts - that is, the presence or absence of another person at the time, the likelihood of being found, preparation for the act, and lethality of the act.

Possible GSI scores range from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher level of psychological and emotional distress. Respondents have to rate each feeling item (e.g., &#x0201c;your feelings being easily hurt&#x0201d;) on a five-point scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely), representing the intensity of distress during the past 7&#x000a0;days.

Using the societal perspective, clinically relevant effects are those effects that are meaningful for society. Moreover, in order to compare effects between allocations in health care, effects should be expressed in generic terms. We will therefore use QALYs and will express the cost-effectiveness and its ratio as cost per QALY. The use of QALYs is advised in guidelines for cost-effectiveness analysis, especially when main effects are expected in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>].</p><p>Our primary cost-effectiveness ratio will be estimated using empirical data only and therefore using a 3-year time horizon, which is equal to the trial duration. Cost data are generally highly skewed, and QALY scores and ICER values are not distributed normally in most cases. Therefore, the uncertainty intervals around the mean costs, mean effects and mean ICER values will be estimated using bootstrap simulations with 1000 replications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B92">92</xref>]. These results will be graphically presented in cost-effectiveness planes. Various societal willingness-to-pay values will be used to estimate net monetary benefits. These net monetary benefits are then used to derive cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.</p><p>We will also explore the long-term costs and effects of MBT-DH and TAU from a societal perspective. One way of achieving this would be to use a Markov model to explore the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention under study. However, health stages in a Markov model are often predefined, discrete stages, where they should reflect the biological or theoretical understanding of the condition being modelled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B93">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>]. Because in this trial the BPDSI, which is a continuous measure, is the primary outcome measure, it does not allow for an unambiguous definition of health states to model disease progression. Having heterogeneous health states may be controversial, as it means that a wide range of patients may be clustered in one health state. In order to explore the cost-effectiveness using a Markov model in our study, we will therefore define health states on the basis of a cut-off score on one of the outcome measures such as the BPDSI or the OQ-45. We will extend the cost-effectiveness model results after the duration of the trial using different assumptions based on, for example, the literature. Sensitivity analysis will be performed in order to investigate the influence of those assumptions on the model results.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Although MBT-DH is a promising psychodynamic treatment for BPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], so far only two RCTs have compared MBT-DH to specialist TAU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Given the relative paucity of data supporting the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH, the possible influence of researcher allegiance in one of the trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], potential spill-over effects in another trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and problems with the generalization of findings to mental health systems in other countries, more research is urgently needed. Further, the only health economic study of MBT-DH did not use state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. To assess the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH in The Netherlands, the current study aims to compare MBT-DH with specialist TAU using state-of-the-art cost-effectiveness analyses. Further, because the current study is a multi-site trial, and treatments in both treatment arms are conducted by different therapists, the risk of spill-over effects is minimal.</p><p>We expect both MBT-DH and TAU to lead to significant reductions in primary and secondary outcome measures, including symptomatic distress and interpersonal functioning. However, we expect MBT-DH to outperform TAU, particularly at 36&#x000a0;months follow-up.</p><p>To date, no studies have examined the purported mechanism of change in MBT in the context of a randomized trial and there is a pressing need to provide evidence for presumed mechanisms of change in current evidence-based treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Aside from providing new data on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of MBT-DH, this trial also promises to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of change in MBT.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BDI: Beck depression inventory; BPD: Borderline personality disorder; BPDSI: Borderline personality disorder severity index; BSI: Brief symptom inventory; CGI: Clinical global impression scale; DAPP-SF: Dimensional assessment of personality pathology &#x02013; short form; ECR: Experiences in close relationships; GAF: Global assessment of functioning; GSI: Global severity index; HAQ: Helping alliance questionnaire; ICER: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio; IIP-64: Inventory of interpersonal problems; MATE: Measurements in the addictions for triage and evaluation; MBT-DH: Day hospital mentalization-based treatment; MBT: Mentalization-based treatment; MBT-IOP: Intensive outpatient mentalization-based treatment; OQ-45: Outcome questionnaire; PAI-BOR: Personality assessment inventory-borderline; QALY: Quality-adjusted life year; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; RFQ: Reflective functioning questionnaire; SCID-I: Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis I personality disorders; SCID-II: Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV Axis II personality disorders; SDS: Sheehan disability scale; SIPP-SF: Severity indices of personality problems &#x02013; short form; SSHI: Suicide and self-harm inventory; STEPPS: Systems training for emotional predictability and problem-solving; TAU: Treatment as usual; TiC-P: Trimbos and Institute for Medical Technology Assessment Questionnaire on Costs Associated with Psychiatric Illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>EMPL drafted the first version of the manuscript and maintained the lead in the writing process.
