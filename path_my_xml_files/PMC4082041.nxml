Group A (23 males / 17 females, aged 11.5&#x000b1;1.8 years) received fluticasone 200mg bid, and group B (21 males / 19 females, aged 11.5&#x000b1;1.8 years) clarithromycine 15 mg/kg bid, in addition to fluticasone 100 mg bid for 8 weeks. (FEV1%, C-CAT, SABA use, sputum induced % of eosinophils and neutrophils) were compared before and after treatment in each group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In group A there is significant reduction of eosinophils percentage after treatment, and non significant increase in neutrophils percentage. There was significant improvement in FEV1% predicted. While in group B there was non significant decrease in eosinophils, and significant decrease in neutrophils. In group A there was significant negative correlation between changes in FEV1% and change in eosinophils and week positive correlation between changes in FEV1% and changes in neutrophils. In group B there was significant positive correlation between basal eosinophils and change in FEV1% and significant negative correlation between basal neutrophils and change in FEV1%.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Steroids were effective in targeting eosinophilic inflammation and clarithromycine target neutrophilic inflammation. High eosinophils and neutrophils percentage in sputum are best predictors of response to steroids or clarithromycine treatment respectively.</p></sec></body></article>
