Such fear ranges from fear of needle to fear of bodily harm to a general fear of the unknown.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] To assist in the management of a child with anxiety, a wide range of pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods are available to dentists.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Recent dental studies[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have shown that distraction is a common technique used to reduce the pain reaction during short invasive procedures. Distraction techniques such as television watching, use of virtual reality, audiovisual eyeglasses, and listening to music may effectively help to distract the child's attention away from anxiety-provoking stimuli, leading to a relaxing experience for the child.</p><p>During the administration of a local anesthetic injection, an anxious patient might perceive more pain of longer duration as compared to less anxious patients.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Some studies[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] documented that computerized delivery system (CDS) for local anesthesia caused low levels of stress and pain reaction. The CDS works with a microprocessor which permits controlled low-pressure delivery of the anesthetic solution. Therefore, the pain perception during the computerized administration of a palatal injection was significantly lower, resulting in less disruptive behavior in pediatric patients.</p><p>The current study aims to compare the effectiveness of audiovisual distraction techniques (audiovisual using projector only and audiovisual with video eyewear) along with computerized delivery of anesthesia during the pulp therapy of primary molars in phobic child patients to reduce the child dental anxiety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized, crossover clinical study was conducted at University Dental Hospital Sharjah, on approval obtained from Research Ethics Committee, University of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates.</p><p>The study included 60 children aged 4&#x02013;7-year-old (31 boys and 29 girls). Scores on the faces version of the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale (MCDAS) (f)[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] were used to evaluate the level of anxiety in children before pulpectomy procedures carried out on primary molars. Treatment was planned as two appointments (or sessions). Both treatment sessions were 1-week apart. For the purpose of the current study, a score above 19 was considered as the high level of dental anxiety. As per inclusion criteria, children with previous dental experience and with MCDAS (f) score of 31 and above, with no systemic health issues that prevent them from undergoing endodontic treatment were recruited. An exclusion criterion includes patients with any visual or auditory deficits.</p><p>Children were randomly distributed equally into two groups as A and B using the stratified random selection method. Appointments were scheduled to ensure adequate time to perform all required treatment procedure and data collection. After reviewing medical history and radiographs, the patients in group A were seated and then video eyewear (Vuzix Wrap 310XL; Vuzix Corporation, Rochester, NY, USA), was placed on the patients&#x02019; eyes and attached to the iPad and their preselected 60 min movie was played. The movies were age appropriate. The children were given the option to select their choice of the movie from the collection of Shaun the Sheep, Tinker Bell, Cars, and Smurfs series. The video eyewear blocked the visual field of the child completely and had headphones to deliver the sound. Following that blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate were monitored and recorded throughout the procedure every 10 min using a pulse oximeter. All the treatment procedure was carried out by one pediatric dentist. Patients were then anesthetized by CDS using &#x0201c;single tooth anesthesia machine.&#x0201d; Root canal procedure started after rubber dam isolation. While deroofing the pulp chamber, few drops of local anesthetic using were delivered intrapulpally when needed.</p><p>After completion of questionnaire MCDAS (f), children assigned in group A, had first session of endodontic treatment (pulpectomy) using audiovisual distractor (AVD) video eyewear; whereas group B had undergone same treatment while watching movie of their choice projected through a projector on the ceiling above the dental chair without video eyewear. During session II, children in group A, had pulpectomy done on another tooth in different quadrant with AVD without eyewear, but children in group B wore video eyewear while watching cartoon movie of their preference while undergoing pulp therapy.</p><p>At the completion of the endodontic procedure, pulse oximeter and AVD glasses were removed and the patients&#x02019; were instructed to rate their pain during treatment procedure on the Wong Bakers&#x02019; faces pain scale.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>After 1-week, another dental appointment was scheduled. The children were requested to fill out the one more time MCDAS (f) questionnaire before endodontic treatment scheduled for another tooth, with provision of AVD glasses for group B. A preselected 60 min movie was displayed on the ceiling above the dental chair using projector for group A, but without video eyewear. Blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate were monitored and recorded throughout the procedure every 10 min using pulse oximeter for approximately 45 min of pulpectomy procedure.</p><p>At the completion of the procedure, pulse oximeter was removed and the patients&#x02019; were instructed to rate their anxiety during the treatment procedure on the Wong Bakers&#x02019; faces pain scale one more time.

In addition, employing CDS-intrasulcular (IS) system enables operator to control the disadvantages associated with an inferior alveolar block such as pain that affects child's behavior and avoids postoperative self-inflicted injuries (tongue or lip biting) owing to its localized effect and bilateral procedures can be done during one session.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>According to some studies,[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] CDS-IS anesthesia is less effective for pulp therapies. In addition, some other studies,[<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] also noticed that routinely used procedure for anesthetizing the maxillary second primary molars had low success. This could be due to the fact that most of these teeth were showing signs of inflammation which could lead to the possibility of reduced efficacy of the anesthetic solution. According to Ashkenazi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] dense and thick nature of zygomatic bone, as well as deep position of the apex of maxillary second primary molars, could hampers the effectiveness of anesthesia. For the very reason, in addition to intraligament anesthesia operator we also give intrapulpal anesthesia to have completely effective anesthesia during all the sessions of pulp therapy for both the groups. Furthermore, in agreement with other studies, for the operator, it is difficult to measure the precise amount of local anesthetic and the most reported oral complaints was of bitter taste of the anesthesia solution that had leaked into children's mouth.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, the mean pain scores, although not significant for group A, shows a slight increase, between first treatment session when children uses video eyewear compared to the second session when they watch the movie without using video eyewear. This slight difference could be because of the absence of video eyewear to completely block the visual field, which triggers anxiety, which children relate as pain and not because of the ineffective anesthesia.</p><p>The cooperation of the child can influence the decision to retain primary teeth by treating pulpal conditions but the use of audiovisual distraction with video eyewear and use of CDS-IS system for anesthetic delivery was demonstrated to be effective in improving children's cooperation. In addition to this, there is a reduction in self-reported pain during pulp therapy procedure.</p><p>This combination modality using audiovisual distraction with video eyewear along with CDS-IS system for anesthetic delivery during pulp therapy, to reduce the child dental anxiety, seems to be more effective than routine psychological interventions. Moreover, is, therefore, highly recommended as an effective behavior management technique for the long invasive procedures of pulp therapy in young children.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial
