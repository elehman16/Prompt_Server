W. Nitzan in 1991 as the simplest form of surgical therapy with the aim of washing out inflammatory mediators, releasing the articular disc, and disrupting adhesions between the surface of the disc and the joint fossa by hydraulic pressure of the lavage solution. There are essentially two types of therapy for temporomandibular disorders (1) conservative and (2) surgical. Conservative treatment includes bite splints, rehabilitation exercises, isometric exercises, massage of the muscles, analgesic treatment, thermotherapy, or laser therapy. Surgical treatment can be divided into invasive (open) and minimally invasive (arthrocentesis and arthroscopy).[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Ringer's lactate and physiological saline are commonly used to lavage the joint by the use of a needle introduced into the upper joint space after local anesthetic infiltration of the overlying skin. This compartment will take up to 5 mL of fluid, and by filling under pressure, any minor adhesions are broken down or lysed. A second needle was then placed into the same joint compartment to achieve continuous flow of fluid and to allow thorough washing or lavage of the joint.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>It was estimated that approximately 50&#x02013;100 mL of total arthrocentesis volume was sufficient for a therapeutic lavage of the superior joint space of TMJ.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Arthrocentesis was considered as an effective minimally invasive surgical treatment for TMJ closed lock based.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>In TMJ arthrocentesis, irrigation pump from a surgical and dental implant motor, providing the highest hydraulic pressure reported in the literature for TMJ lavage.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>In particular, the present study underlined that baseline physical findings and the type of intervention (two-needle vs. single-needle approach) were not predictors for treatment effectiveness in patients with TMJ inflammatory-degenerative disease. Furthermore, studies related to the presence of interleukin (IL), prostaglandin, and several disc-related disorders (Disc rupture) may be a variable to evaluate the outcome of procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The prospective study was carried out in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery over the period 2013&#x02013;2016.
