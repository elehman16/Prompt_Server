So using a suitable analgesic method for reducing pain is very important.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Different drugs like non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, opioids, corticosteroids along with the surgical techniques and topical anesthesia are used to reduce pain.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] It is observed that reducing post adenoidectomy pain with analgesic drugs have a notable effect on patients.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] For example, NSAIDs are caused GIB, or Opioids are caused respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In some published articles, some kind of complications of topical anesthesia, in deep and high dosage are mentioned. Like paraplegia of vocal cord, deep cervical abscess and brain-stem shock.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] So using suitable anesthetic method with the least side effects is very important.</p><p>Tramadol is a central analgesic that was effective to reduce pain. This drug is a racemic or any kind of enantiomers combination that shows different kinds of properties of opioid receptors, inhibit absorption of monoaminergics.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Tramadol have methyl group on phenyl that justifies low potency of that in the face of opioid receptors.</p><p>At first it was reported that tramadol is selective for m, d and k receptors.

In terms of construction it is very similar to lidocain except amine group of butylpyridine.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] This drug is a suitable combine for long acting anesthesia. Considering that, till now, there was no research on the preemptive effect of bupivacaine and tramadol combination in post-tonsillectomy pain.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] So we performed this study to compare the analgesic effect of peritonsillar infiltration of bupivacaine in combination with tramadol with using bupivacaine or tramadol singly in a placebo controlled study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional approval from Ethic committee of our university and taking written informed consent from the patients, this randomized, double blind placebo controlled study was performed on 120 children with ASA I and II in a age range of 5 to 15 years who were candidate for tonsillectomy with or without adenoidectomy from 21 December 2010 to 21 October 2012 in Kashani hospital.</p><p>The other inclusion criteria were patients without acute pharyngeal infection, allergy to bupivacaine or tramadol, acute and active infection of respiratory tract with fever and rhonchi, constant use of sedative or analgesic hypnotic, peritonsillar abscess, renal disease, liver disease, asthma and coagulation disorders. If the technique of anesthesia was changed or there was bleeding during operation which necessitated reoperation, the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>These patients were randomly divided into four groups.</p><p>
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Group 1 received peritonsillar injection of bupivacaine 0.5% (1 mg/kg) in adrenalin 1:200 000 in a volume of 3 cc with normal saline (N/S)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group 2 received peritonsillar infiltration of tramadol 2 mg/kg in a volume of 3 cc in N/S</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group 3 received peritonsillar infiltration of tramadol 2 mg/kg and bupivacaine 1 mg/kg in adrenalin 1:200 000 in a volume of 3 cc</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group 4 received peritonsillar infiltration of N/S in a volume of 3 cc.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>The randomization was performed with using random-allocation software.</p><p>Peritonsillar injection was performed in a fan-wise way from upper pole to lower pole before surgical incision (pre-emptive). Syringes prepared in the same form and volume by person who had no information about study group. Peritonsillar injection also performed by surgeon who was not inform from group allocation. For premedication, midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV was administered 15 minutes before induction of anesthesia. Routine monitoring were electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, pulse oxymetry and capnography. General anesthesia was induced by using 0.02 mg/kg atropine, 5 mg/kg thiopental and 2 &#x003bc;g/kg fentanyl. Intratracheal intubation was facilitated by 0.5 mg/kg atracurium. EtCO<sub>2</sub> was kept between 30 and 40 mmHg. Maintenance of anesthesia was done by isoflurane 1.25% and N<sub>2</sub>O 50% in O<sub>2</sub> 50%. At the end of the surgery all the anesthetic drugs was discontinued and the patients were extubated after resumption of consciousness and reflexes. The residual neuromuscular block was reversed by 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.02 mg/kg atropine. After 1 hour if the patient didn&#x02019;t have bleeding, he or she was discharge from the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). After arriving to the PACU, the severity of post-tonsillectomy pain was evaluated in 15, 30, and 60 minutes. Evaluation of the pain was continued in 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours by using obtaining pain scale [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. If the severity of pain was more than 3, the patient was given 15 mg/kg rectal acetaminophen. Level of consciousness was recorded by a 4-stage grading in the mentioned times:</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Objective pain scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ABR-4-132-g001"/></table-wrap><p>
