Antibiotic prescribing data were collected for all children, follow-up data for 495 (98.8%) and the National Health Service resource use data for 494 (98.6%). The overall antibiotic prescribing rates for children&#x02019;s RTIs were 25% and 15.8% (p=0.018) in intervention and control groups, respectively. We found evidence of postrandomisation differential recruitment: the number of children recruited to the intervention arm was higher (292 vs 209); over half were recruited by prescribing nurses compared with less than a third in the control arm; children in the intervention arm were younger (median age 2 vs 3 years controls, p=0.03) and appeared to be more unwell than those in the control arm with higher respiratory rates (p&#x0003c;0.0001), wheeze prevalence (p=0.007) and global illness severity scores assessed by carers (p=0.045) and clinicians (p=0.01). Interviews with clinicians confirmed preferential recruitment of less unwell children to the trial, more so in the control arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Differential recruitment may explain the paradoxical antibiotic prescribing rates.

The most effective interventions involved targeting both parents and clinicians during a consultation, using automatic computer prompts for evidence-based prescribing, involving clinicians in the design of the intervention, using printed materials with actionable information and integrating interventions into routine clinical processes. Qualitative research found that communication within consultations often failed to meet parents&#x02019; needs: information on symptom relief was lacking, safety-netting advice was too vague to be useful and parents&#x02019; concerns went unaddressed.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 12&#x02013;15</xref> Clinicians revealed that prognostic uncertainty is an important driver of antibiotic prescribing, and would like information to help them identify the children at risk of future illness deterioration.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 16 17</xref>
</p><p>Using a large multicentre, prospective cohort study (over 8300 children), we derived and internally validated a prognostic rule, using symptoms, signs and demographic characteristics to predict hospitalisation in the following 30 days among children presenting to primary care with acute cough and RTI.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18 19</xref> Findings from across the TARGET programme were synthesised to develop a complex intervention, designed to reduce antibiotic prescribing. The Children&#x02019;s Cough&#x000a0;(CHICO) feasibility trial reported here is the final element of the TARGET programme, the aim of which was to assess the recruitment and acceptability of the complex intervention and to understand whether it is feasible to conduct a larger trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Design</title><p>The CHICO feasibility trial was a primary care cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing a web-based intervention with usual care for children presenting to general practices with RTI and acute cough. The trial was approved by the North West-Haydock Research Ethics Committee, UK (reference number: 14/NW/1034, Trial registration: ISRCTN23547970, UKCRN study ID: 16891). The trial protocol<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> was devised according to the SPIRIT guidelines<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> for RCTs, reporting of the findings followed consolidated standards of reporting trials&#x000a0;(CONSORT) guidelines for clustered trials<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and below is a brief summary of the methodology.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Practise and patient recruitment</title><p>General practitioners (GPs) were invited to participate in the trial from locations in Bristol and the surrounding areas; the only exclusion criterion was for those few practicses using very outdated internet browsers. GPs and prescribing nurses (hereafter termed &#x02018;clinicians&#x02019;) were eligible to recruit children to the trial and informed consent was obtained from the parent or legal guardian (carers). Children were included if they were aged between 3 months and under 12 years and presenting with an RTI with acute cough of no more than 28 days duration prior to consultation. They were eligible if they presented with illnesses such as asthma (including those with infective exacerbations), epilepsy or diabetes. Children who required same day hospital assessment or admission were also included. Children were excluded if they were considered to have a high risk of serious infection (immune-compromised, cystic fibrosis, splenectomy).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomisation and sample size</title><p>The allocation process was a one-off randomisation stratified for both practice size and prevalence of antibiotic prescribing using a proxy measure of amoxicillin suspension prescriptions (the main antibiotic used for children with cough) within the previous 12 months. As this was a feasibility trial, a formal (effectiveness-based) sample size calculation was not required, although we were interested in the recruitment rate to inform a larger trial design. Recruitment rates varied widely between practices in our previous cohort study,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> so we monitored recruitment levels closely and capped recruitment at no more than 30 patients per practice. Estimates from the cohort study suggested 15 practices in each arm of the trial would yield a pragmatic sample between 300 and 500 patients over a 7-month period.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Intervention</title><p>Intervention development will be described in more detail elsewhere, although the paper reporting algorithm development has been published.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In brief, findings from the TARGET programme were synthesised using the&#x000a0;Precede-Proceed model of Green and Krueter<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> as a framework. The active elements of the intervention were determined to be elicitation of parents&#x02019; concerns, active no-antibiotic messages to the clinician, reduction of clinician uncertainty and support for a no-antibiotic treatment response. These elements were provided using a within-consultation interactive web-based tool, which also provided a data collection tool. This tool delivered the following intervention elements:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Recording children&#x02019;s symptoms and signs.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Elicitation and recording carers&#x02019; concerns.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For each consultation, children were identified as being at very low, normal or high risk of future hospitalisation; current National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#x000a0;guidelines on antibiotic associated with each risk strata were also provided.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A personalised printout was produced for carers of each child. Clinical observations and carers&#x02019; concerns recorded in the system were used to produce this personalised information leaflet that explained the best home-care strategies and reinforced important safety netting advice. The aim of this leaflet was to give clinicians a tangible treatment action other than (or in addition to) prescribing, to improve safety-netting information and to provide home-care support for carers.</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data collection</title><p>Both control and intervention clinicians used the same study website to record carers&#x02019; consent, enter baseline and symptom data during the consultation and record their treatment decisions. Additionally, intervention clinicians were provided with background information about how the risk algorithm was developed, recorded carers&#x02019; concerns, were given on-screen the future hospitalisation risk of the child and provided carers with a personalised printout. Use of the intervention was assessed by recording the number of times the clinicians used the web-based intervention and time spent on each page of the website. Follow-up data were collected each week from carers until the child&#x02019;s cough had resolved, or up to 8 weeks if not resolved. A medical record notes reviews were conducted at the recruiting practices to collect data relating to the 30 days following the recruitment consultation, including recruiting consultation timings, RTI-related antibiotic prescriptions, reconsultations and RTI-related hospitalisations.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Qualitative interviews</title><p>Clinicians from both arms and carers from the intervention arm only were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews to explore their views of web-based data collection and the intervention. Interviews with carers were conducted either in the week following recruitment (to facilitate recall of the consultation) or after their child had recovered, to reflect on the whole follow-up data collection process. Purposive sampling was used to maximise variation in the sample of carers, including those with a range of child ages, home neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation, illness severity scores and treatment outcomes. Clinicians were purposefully sampled to include variation in recruiting and prescribing levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Health economics</title><p>The purpose of the economic analysis was to inform the feasibility and design of a within-trial economic evaluation alongside a larger RCT, including assessing web-based data collection as a means of gathering comprehensive resource use and quality of life data from carers. We adopted a health system (ie, National Health Service&#x000a0;(NHS)) perspective for the analysis of the costs associated with resource use. We measured resources used from the time of recruitment until the earliest of either resolution or the end of the eighth week of follow-up. Health system resources used included GP consultations, use of&#x000a0;out-of-hours services, NHS 111, walk-in centres and hospital and ambulance use. We examined quality of life using the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU-9D) instrument, a generic measure of paediatric quality of life validated for children aged 5&#x02013;11 years. CHU-9D was included in the web-based tool for those children within the valid age&#x000a0;bracket.</p><p>Carers were given the option of providing data using a paper version rather than online if preferred. Participants were sent text and email reminders followed by telephone calls if the data were not returned promptly.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24 25</xref> The length of the initial consultation was recorded electronically by the web-based tool and GP practice systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to illustrate the characteristics of the carers, children and recruiting clinicians. For between-arm comparisons, categorical data were tested using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x000a0;or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test if an expected cell value was&#x000a0;&#x0003c;5, continuous data were plotted and, if not normally distributed, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test) were used. The use of baseline statistical tests to compare the arms is legitimate in the context of stratified cluster randomisation with subsequent (unconcealed) recruitment of individual participants. Such tests were used to ascertain if there was any evidence of differential recruitment of individuals across the trial arms beyond what would be expected by chance.</p><p>Qualitative interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, anonymised and imported into NVIVO 10. Analysis of qualitative data began shortly after data collection started and was ongoing and iterative. An inductive thematic analysis approach was used to identify patterns and themes.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> An initial coding frame was developed and refined as new data were produced. Two researchers (CC and JH) double coded a subset of transcripts to inform the coding framework and ensure robust analysis.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
</p><p>For both cost and quality of life data, the extent and nature of missing data was examined and compared between intervention and control practices. Descriptive statistics were used to explore resource use and cost by category and by arm to identify important cost drivers.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Ascertainment and data collection</title><p>A total of 32 practices were recruited to the trial, 16 randomised to each arm.

The target of 500 recruited children was achieved 1&#x02009;month ahead of schedule (October 2014 to March 2015 inclusive); 542 children were invited to enter the trial and 501 agreed. Of the 41 not included, 18 (3.3%) declined, 19 (3.5%) did not meet the eligibility criteria and 2 (0.4%) were subsequently withdrawn by the carers. We obtained complete carer-reported follow-up data for 495 (98.8%) from the 501 children retained in the trial. Only two practices recruited no children; the median number of children recruited at each practices was 16 (range 0&#x02013;30, IQR 4&#x02013;29). Primary care medical record data were collected for 100% of the children.

Clinicians, carers and children all liked the recruitment packs, which had been designed by a graphic designer, to be colourful and child-friendly. Clinicians in both arms reported recruiting less unwell children, for whom consultations were expected to be quicker to treat and therefore easier to combine with additional research activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">table 6</xref>: Q1). Although clinicians commented that the intervention was easy and quick to use compared with other studies, it still added time to the consultation. Practices with an appointment system that channelled eligible children towards active recruiters, who were often minor illness nurses, had high recruitment rates. In contrast, practices that normally channelled same-day appointments towards particular (non-recruiting) clinicians tended to be very low recruiters, despite attempts to get eligible patients redirected to recruiters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">table 6</xref>: Q2).</p></sec><sec id="s3e2"><title>Using the intervention</title><p>Some clinicians in both arms initiated recruitment only after they had completed their &#x02018;normal consultation&#x02019;. Most said this was because engaging with the web-based tool interfered with their &#x02018;normal consultation&#x02019;, others that they needed to assess the child for serious illness before deciding whether to include them in the trial (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">table 6</xref>: Q3). Clinicians reported a high degree of awareness of the problem of high antibiotic prescribing rates and described a range of other concurrent initiatives aimed at reducing antibiotic prescribing.</p><p>Intervention clinicians rarely reported using the CHICO algorithm results as a decision aid. Their reasons for this included: i) their &#x02018;normal consultation&#x02019; including treatment decision was undertaken before initiating the intervention; ii) they decided early in the consultation that they did&#x000a0;not need to prescribe and therefore extra information was not useful (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">table 6</xref>: Q4) (perhaps exacerbated where they chose not to recruit sicker children); iii) they lacked trust in the algorithm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">table 6</xref>: Q5). Clinicians said the questions/information included in the intervention were more detailed than they usually asked, but none felt it had influenced or changed their decision. They were reassured when the reported risk of hospitalisation agreed with their clinical judgement, and could be used as a useful backup to present to carers (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">table 6</xref>: Q7). If the hospitalisation risk or advice provided was at odds with their clinical judgement, a few clinicians said that they ignored the advice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">table 6</xref>: Q8).</p><p>Most carers said the CHICO consultation appeared as normal to them, while two said the history taking or explanations were more detailed. Few carers were aware of the reported risk of hospitalisation or subsequent advice from the CHICO intervention; one was reassured by the low-risk advice. Two had experiences of the clinician prescribing antibiotics despite CHICO advice.</p></sec><sec id="s3e3"><title>The carer leaflet</title><p>Clinicians valued having the leaflet to print out for carers highly; some said it was a useful alternative to a prescription. Some felt it backed up their recommendations and others felt it was good for carers to have printed information. Carers had mixed views about the leaflet; some felt it did&#x000a0;not tell them anything they did&#x000a0;not know already; others said it gave them some useful information; and in one case the carer reported that it prevented a reconsultation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Health economics</title><p>The review of patient practice records and the online data collection system, supported by telephone calls to carers, provided a comprehensive source of information on the&#x000a0;NHS resource use, although data missingness increased with symptom duration. Almost 99% of carers reported some NHS resource use. The initial consultation was estimated to take 15.29&#x02009;min in the intervention arm compared with 10&#x02009;min in the control arm. Health system cost data were positively skewed, reflecting limited NHS costs other than for the initial GP consultation.</p><p>Mean NHS costs per patient from available cases (n=494) were &#x000a3;54.62 in control practices, and &#x000a3;78.78 in intervention practices. The difference of &#x000a3;24.15 is associated with a bias corrected and accelerated 95% CI of &#x000a3;18.57 to &#x000a3;32.98. Mean per-patient costs were primarily determined by the costs of the initial consultation, which constitute 73% of the&#x000a0;NHS costs in the control arm and 78% in the intervention arm.</p><p>Only one in four recruited children were in the age range of 5&#x02013;11 suitable for the CHU-9D instrument; moreover, only 44 (9% of all participants) provided baseline and follow-up data from the week of resolution to facilitate the estimation of quality-adjusted life-years. The data on these children tentatively suggest that their quality of life returned to population norms after the baseline appointment, although this finding must be interpreted cautiously in light of the limited availability of these data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Summary of main results</title><p>The feasibility study showed high recruitment and retention. Quantitative and qualitative data confirm the intervention was acceptable to the clinicians and widely used, but often postconsultation and not within-consultation as intended. We found evidence of postrandomisation differential recruitment, which is likely to have biased our estimates of intervention effect and explain our paradoxical results.</p><p>Evidence for differential recruitment included children in the intervention arm having more severe baseline characteristics than control children and higher recruitment rates in the intervention than control arm.</p><p>In the qualitative interviews, clinicians from both arms of the trial reported preferential recruitment of less unwell children as these were quicker to deal with and easier to combine with the research. This was particularly true in the control arm, where larger numbers of well children, relative to the intervention arm, were recruited. Evidencing Hawthorne effects (whereby clinicians modified their behaviour in response to their awareness of being in the trial) is challenging in RCTs without concurrent observational studies, but our 2011&#x02013;2013 cohort study (in which we developed the algorithm)<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> showed antibiotic prescribing rates (37%) higher than both our intervention (25%) and control (16%) arms. It is therefore possible that Hawthorne effects may have been acting to reduce prescribing in both arms of our trial. Although we did not overtly advertise that the trial was focussing on reducing antibiotic prescribing, the clinicians may have inferred the aims of the trial. Our previous work with these practices may have alerted some clinicians to our aims, coupled with national and local campaigns to increase awareness of antimicrobial resistance. The control clinicians used the same web-based tool during consultation to record study data. Thus, our data collection in itself among the controls may have inadvertently increased risk perception (by providing risk information, although partially obscured among the data collected that was previously unavailable to clinicians) as well as provide &#x02018;test&#x02019; conditions.</p><p>The web-based data collection tool and review of medical notes were appropriate vehicles for resource-use data collection. The principal driver of higher NHS costs in the intervention group was longer initial GP appointments, when the web-based system was being used. There was little evidence on quality of life because of limited data availability.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>There are many strengths to this feasibility trial.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Recruitment was so rapid that we stopped a month earlier than planned, with robust data collection and few missing values.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We adequately resourced the trial to achieve excellent follow-up with little attrition, building up relationships with the families and using several types of communication media as an effective way of obtaining data for our web-based entry system.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We reduced variation in practice recruitment levels, compared with our previous cohort study,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> with a higher median number of patients per practice and fewer non-recruiting practices.</p></list-item><list-item><p>None of the intervention web-sessions was abandoned and clinicians thought it was quick and easy to use compared with other interventions.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Clinicians highly valued having the personalised leaflet as an alternative to a prescription.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Apart from differential recruitment and potential Hawthorne effects, we are aware of three other weaknesses.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>First, the intervention was designed to be used as part of a decision aid, but it became apparent that some clinicians only used the intervention after the treatment decision was made.

</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Results in context with other research</title><p>We have constructed a complex intervention associated with lower antibiotic prescribing rates (from 37% to 25%) compared with data from similar practices in the same area a couple of years earlier,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> but an even lower rate among concurrent controls (16%). Local data over a 4-year period suggest the extremely low prescribing rates among the control practices do not reflect usual practice, which may be due to differential recruitment.</p><p>Antibiotic prescription data from a large primary care database, covering 537 UK general practices during 1995&#x02013;2011 suggest the rate of prescribing for RTIs in children and adults initially fell around the millennium but by 2011 had risen to 40%.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Our estimate of 37% among children from a large cohort study conducted between 2011 and 2013<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> is a robust estimate and a reduction in prescribing by almost a third to 25% is worth pursuing. To do this, a future trial must overcome the dual problems of differential recruitment and Hawthorne effects.</p><p>A primary care feasibility trial of patients with back pain<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> that also experienced differential recruitment recommended identifying patients, using independent researchers, before randomisation. However, back pain is a chronic condition giving research teams time to identify and invite patient participation. The acute nature of childhood respiratory infections prevent prior identification and the cost of using independent researchers at multiple primary care sites would be prohibitive. One approach would be to select primary care sites that adopt a triage system for children with cough and work more closely with these different systems to help reduce selection bias. An alternative would be a &#x02018;lighter touch&#x02019; design using practice level using routinely collected data and practice level consent, negating the need to consent and recruit individual patients postrandomisation. The unit of interest would be the practice rather than the patient, so all patients seen in a specified time would be included. Amoxicillin suspension is the main antibiotic given to children with acute cough and RTI and has been successfully used previously<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> as a proxy marker to assess antibiotic prescribing at the practice level.</p><p>The Hawthorne effect is not uncommon in clinical trials in general or indeed in trials specifically aimed at reducing antibiotic prescribing,<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> but the mechanisms of effect and magnitude are not well understood.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Many valuable lessons have been learnt from this feasibility study, and a redesign is required for any future trial. To negate differential recruitment and reduce the possibility of a Hawthorne effect, a &#x02018;light touch&#x02019; efficient design is needed that avoids patient recruitment at the clinician level and uses data already routinely collected by the practices themselves. Better training in the use of the intervention and encouragement to use the tool as part of the consultation process would be facilitated if the intervention is embedded within current practice systems. Removing the need for clinicians to recruit patients or enter data other than that required for the tool would both reduce the time added to consultations and preserve usual practice among the control clinicians.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/bmjopen-2016-014506.supp1</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary data 1</title></caption><p>
