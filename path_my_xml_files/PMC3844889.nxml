Some studies have shown that erythropoietin have some non-hematopoietic protective effects on ischemia-reperfusion injury in myocardial cells. We evaluated the effect of exogenous EPO infusion on reducing ischemia-reperfusion injuries and improvement of cardiac function by echocardiography shortly after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>43 patients were joined the study and randomly divided in two groups, EPO group: receiving standard medication and CABG surgery plus 700 IU/kg erythropoietin (PD Poietin, puyeshdaroo, Iran) and control group: receiving standard medication and CABG surgery plus 10cc normal saline as placebo. The cardiac function was assessed by Echocardiography in all patients in before, 4 days after and also 30 days after CABG operation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Echocardiography indicated that EF had no differences between EPO and control group at 4 days (47.05&#x000b1;6.29 vs 45.90&#x000b1;4.97, P=0.334) or 30 days after surgery (47.27&#x000b1;28 vs 46.62&#x000b1;5.7, P=0.69). There were no differences between EPO and control group in wall motion score index at 4 days (P=0.83) or 30 days after surgery (P=0.902). In EPO group: Left ventricle end systolic and diastolic diameter (LVESD, LVEDD) had reduction, as compared to control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data suggest that peri-operatively exogenous EPO infusion can&#x02019;t improve ventricular function and Wall motion index in first weeks after surgery. But as compared to control group, reduction in LVEDD and LVESD at 4 days or 30 days after CABG surgery in EPO group suggested that EPO had correlation with reduction of myocytes remodeling and reperfusion injury early after CABG surgery.</p></sec></body></article>
