The Breast&#x02014;Activity and Healthy Eating After Diagnosis (B-AHEAD) trial tested 2 weight loss diet and exercise programmes versus a control receiving standard written advice during adjuvant treatment. This article identifies differences in characteristics between patients recruited from the main trial site to those of the whole population from that site during the recruitment period and identifies barriers to recruitment. A total of 409 patients with operable breast cancer were recruited within 12 weeks of surgery. We compared demographic and treatment factors between women recruited from the main trial coordinating site (n = 300) to the whole breast cancer population in the center (n = 532). Uptake at the coordinating site was 42%, comparable to treatment trials in the unit (47%). Women recruited were younger (55.9 vs 61.2 years, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), more likely to live in least deprived postcode areas (41.7% vs 31.6%, <italic>P</italic> = .004), and more likely to have screen-detected cancers (55.3% vs 48.7%, <italic>P</italic> = .026) than the whole breast cancer population. The good uptake highlights the interest in lifestyle change around the time of diagnosis, a challenging time in the patient pathway, and shows that recruitment at this time is feasible. Barriers to uptake among older women and women with a lower socioeconomic status should be understood and overcome in order to improve recruitment to future lifestyle intervention programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>lifestyle intervention</kwd><kwd>diet</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>recruitment</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1534735416687850"><funding-source id="funding1-1534735416687850"><institution-wrap><institution>Genesis Breast cancer Appeal Ltd</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1534735416687850">GA 08-006</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award2-1534735416687850"><funding-source id="funding2-1534735416687850"><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000272</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding2-1534735416687850">PB-PG-0107-12313</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735416687850"><title>Introduction</title><p>Observational studies associate excess weight at breast cancer (BC) diagnosis, and weight gain after diagnosis with increased BC specific and all cause mortality<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> and decreased quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> These data suggest weight loss or preventing weight gain will improve the outcome for BC patients.

Thus, BC patients appear equally interested to join lifestyle and treatment interventions at the time of diagnosis and commencing adjuvant treatment. At the time of recruitment to the B-AHEAD trial, the main recruiting center had 13 other surgical and treatment trials also open to recruitment. Though not supported by data, these studies could have affected recruitment to the B-AHEAD trial, not because they precluded women from joining the study, but because clinicians may not have wished to overburden a patient to consider a lifestyle study as well as a treatment or surgical study. The good uptake may be consistent with the hypothesis that a BC diagnosis may be a &#x0201c;teachable moment&#x0201d; when women may be responsive to making beneficial lifestyle changes.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Of 531 early stage breast cancer patients in a US survey, 57% indicated that they would welcome health promotion interventions &#x0201c;at diagnosis or soon after.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>This article is one of the few to report uptake to weight control trials among BC patients during adjuvant treatment. Three diet and exercise trials among women scheduled to have adjuvant chemotherapy reported uptake figures of 45%,<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> 65%,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> and 81%.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> However, these trials did not clarify whether they approached all eligible women within a certain time frame as we have done, or if they used a selective approach that would have given a higher level of recruitment. Djuric et al<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> recruited 56% of eligible women to their randomized diet and exercise trial during chemotherapy where recruitment was incentivized with a $25 payment for each of the 3 study visits. Exercise-only trials during adjuvant treatment have reported uptakes of 63% in Australia,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> 47% in the United States,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> 44% in the Netherlands,<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> and 11% in the United Kingdom.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Participants on the Australian exercise trial were on average 7 years younger than the general BC population, a finding similar to the B-AHEAD trial.</p><p>An important finding was the comparable uptake among women scheduled for chemotherapy versus those who were not. Weight gain is a particular problem for chemotherapy patients<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> and one might perceive this group to be more reluctant to join such a trial due to higher anxiety levels and treatment burden.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> Factors affecting BC prognosis such as grade or tumor type did not influence uptake. We did, however, find a lower uptake among patients with a mastectomy, which was previously reported in the PACES study, an exercise study during adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>The lower average age of recruited patients in this trial and fewer women older than 70 years compared with the whole population is a concern and reflects previous data highlighting lower recruitment of older women to BC clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> This lower uptake may be because older women have declined entry or may reflect appropriate exclusion from the trial due to existing comorbidities. A review of recruitment to 985 breast cancer treatment trials in Canada found that older women were less likely to be eligible for trials, physicians were less likely to have a discussion around trials with older women, and even when meeting eligibility criteria older women were less likely to be recruited.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Conversely, a US study found that older breast cancer patients were equally likely to take part in treatment trials if they were eligible.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> Strategies to maximize uptake of older women are important since around a third of newly diagnosed breast cancers in both the United States and England occur in women older than 70 years.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup></p><p>Our study population lived between 2 and 60 miles from the center, with a median distance of 8.6 miles. Distance from home to recruiting center was not cited as a factor for declining study participation. The BEST-Participation-Study, a randomized trial testing an exercise intervention during radiotherapy for breast cancer, which involved attending a central location for an exercise class twice weekly for 12 weeks, reported distance from the center as a significant factor in recruitment.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> The difference between these trials is likely to reflect the fact we deliberately minimized the travel burden to trial participants by hosting the supervised diet and exercise classes in a number of venues proximal to participants&#x02019; homes around the region. The reimbursement for transport costs in our study may have helped overcome difficulties with travel.</p><p>We sought to recruit women of any weight to the B-AHEAD trial and reported a comparable uptake between different BMI categories. This is consistent with an earlier small diet and exercise trial (n = 9).<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> The remaining weight control trials among women of any weight have not reported whether there are any differences in uptake between these 2 groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The BEST-Participation-Study focused on exercise to reduce fatigue and not weight control and also found no difference in BMI between participants and nonparticipants.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Ethnicity also did not affect recruitment in this trial; however, our population of BC patients are mainly white Caucasian.

It is recognized that increased deprivation levels are linked to poorer health behaviors, for example, lower levels of physical activity and higher rates of smoking,<sup><xref rid="bibr35-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> and previous UK research has found poorer survival after BC among more deprived women.<sup><xref rid="bibr36-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Methods for improving engagement in clinical trials among more deprived women must be developed and implemented. There is some evidence from other cancer trials that effective initiatives could include improving readability of leaflets or using video presentations instead of written materials, improved communication skills of health care professionals, and using satellite clinics closer to patients&#x02019; homes.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Schemes to offer financial assistance to reimburse the added cost of travel associated with cancer clinical trials have been shown to improve recruitment among patients with lower incomes and those living further away from the research center and this is an important area that all trials should consider to improve equality.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> The greater uptake among women with screen-detected cancers may also reflect the greater uptake among women from more affluent areas who are more likely to attend screening,<sup><xref rid="bibr38-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> are more motivated to engage in positive health behaviors and perhaps more interested in diet and exercise.<sup><xref rid="bibr39-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="bibr40-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>Previous research has reported that recommendation from the oncologist was an important factor for deciding to enter a trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr41-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> We did not collect data on the input of the oncologist within the different recruiting centers. However, future lifestyle trials should engage the support and enthusiasm of oncologists, in addition to the research nurses, to increase the likelihood that they promote the trial to potential participants. Adequate research staff levels are also crucial after patients have been initially approached. Five percent of women approached regarding B-AHEAD were unable to be recontacted within the 12-week time frame for recruitment due to inadequate levels of recruiting staff.</p><p>We were unable to produce a CONSORT diagram as we failed to obtain full uptake data in all recruiting centers. This problem has previously been highlighted with cancer exercise trials<sup><xref rid="bibr42-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup> and BC treatment trials.<sup><xref rid="bibr43-1534735416687850" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></sup> CONSORT diagrams allow assessment of studies&#x02019; generalizability and future studies should endeavor to collect and publish full recruitment data. A limitation of the present paper is that the conclusions we have made for the UHSM patients may not be applicable to the other recruiting centers with different patient populations.</p><p>Here we present UK data showing successful recruitment to a diet and exercise trial using the cancer research network, at a challenging time for BC patients soon after surgery, and among patients facing the prospect of chemotherapy. The data describe the population to which the outcomes of the B-AHEAD study, to be published in a future article, will be applicable. Future studies should aim to gather complete uptake data from all centers and explore ways to engage older and lower socioeconomic women in interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the participants and the teams in the recruiting centers.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> The views expressed are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the National Health Service, the National Institute for Health Research, or the Department of Health.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethical Approval:</bold> All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.
