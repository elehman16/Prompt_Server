This occurs due to negligence of oral hygiene, changing life-style, habits, and addictions. It is <italic>Kapha Rakta Pradhana Vyadhi</italic>. In modern dentistry papillary or marginal gingivitis can be correlated with <italic>Sheetada</italic>, on the basis of similarities in symptoms, involvement of anatomical structure, etiology and prognosis. The epidemiological studies conducted by American Academy of Periodontology shows that gingivitis of varying severities is nearly universal. It is estimated that over 80% of the world's population suffers from gingivitis. In this clinical study, 106 patients were registered among them 103 completed the treatment and were randomly divided by lottery method into two groups. In Group-A, <italic>Dashana Samskara</italic> paste local application on gums and in Group-B, <italic>Dashana Samskara Choorna Pratisarana</italic> on gums was given. After enrollment of the patients in the study cardinal symptoms of <italic>Sheetada</italic> (gingivitis) such as, <italic>Raktasrava</italic>, <italic>Krishnata</italic>, <italic>Prakledata</italic>, <italic>Mriduta</italic>, <italic>Mukhadaurgandhya</italic>, and also the objective criteria such as oral hygiene index, Gingival Index (GI-S), and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI-S) were studied before and after the treatment.

Being the gateway of the alimentary canal, it reflects the body health. <italic>Acharya Sushruta</italic> classified the diseases of <italic>Mukha</italic> according to the seven subsites &#x02013; <italic>Oshtha</italic> (lips), <italic>Dantamoola</italic> (gingiva and tooth supporting structures), <italic>Danta</italic> (teeth), <italic>Jihva</italic> (tongue), <italic>Talu</italic> (palate), <italic>Kantha</italic> (throat) and <italic>Sarvasara</italic> (oral mucosa).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>]</p><p><italic>Sheetada</italic> is a disease described elaborately in Ayurveda as a type of <italic>Dantamoolagataroga</italic> (periodontal disease). The symptomatology of <italic>Sheetada</italic> can be considered as general marginal and papillary gingivitis, which may progress into periodontitis if not treated properly. <italic>Sheetada</italic> occurs due to vitiated <italic>Kapha</italic> and <italic>Rakta</italic>. The clinical features of the disease are <italic>Raktasrava</italic> (bleeding gums), <italic>Krishnata</italic> (discoloration of gums), <italic>Prakledata</italic> (moistness), <italic>Mriduta</italic> (spongyness), <italic>Shotha</italic> (gingival swelling), <italic>Mukhadaurgandhya</italic> (halitosis) at the initial stage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] In a later stage, <italic>Paka</italic> (suppuration), <italic>Dantamamsa Shiryamanata</italic> (gum recession) and <italic>Chalata</italic> (tooth mobility) may be seen. For the management of this disease systemic therapy, such as <italic>Nasya</italic> (insufflation), and local therapies such as <italic>Raktavisravana</italic> (blood letting), <italic>Pratisarana</italic> (local application), <italic>Gandoosha</italic> (mouthwash), <italic>Kavala</italic> (gargle), and <italic>Pralepana</italic> (paste) are advocated.</p><p>Gingivitis is a similar entity in modern dentistry and it was recognized as a clinical disorder in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Gingivitis is non-destructive periodontal disease. If left untreated, it may progress to periodontitis, which is a destructive form.</p><p>Periodontal disease is widely regarded as the second most common oral disease world-wide after dental decay.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] In the United States, it is prevalent in 30-50% of the population, but only about 10% have severe forms.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Several population based studies have shown its high prevalence and risk in systemic health. Modern research suggests that systemic health may be affected by oral hygiene more than previously recognized. For example, a recent review discussed possible etiological associations between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease in general and infective endocarditis specifically as well as rheumatoid arthritis, pneumonia, and preterm birth and low birth weight.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>]</p><p>The epidemiological studies conducted by American Academy of Periodontology show that gingivitis of varying severities is nearly universal and it is estimated that over 80% of the world's population suffers from gingivitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] Among children and adolescents the incidence rate is 52.03%. In the 3<sup>rd</sup> National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey, it was found that 50% of adults had gingivitis in at least 3-4 teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In Gujarat, the prevalence of gingivitis was found to be 74.45%.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>In the present era prevailing treatment modalities, such as scaling and polishing, root planning, and gingivo plasty have their own limitations. Moreover, these modalities do not focus on regenerating and improving the health of the gingiva.</p><p>To overcome these problems, in Ayurvedic classics several treatment modalities such as <italic>Pratisarana</italic>, <italic>Gandoosha</italic>, and <italic>Kavala</italic> have been mentioned for the management of <italic>Sheetada</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Among these, <italic>Pratisarana</italic> has been selected in this study and it is a kind of local application which mainly possesses therapeutic effects such as <italic>Shodhana</italic> (cleansing) and <italic>Ropana</italic> (growing). In <italic>Pratisarana</italic>, <italic>Choorna</italic> (fine powder) is mixed with lukewarm water to make a paste; the paste is taken on a fingertip and then massaged on the gums with mechanical pressure exerted in a specific direction. This process removes the food debris and plaque, which are the main causative factors of the disease. Further, <italic>Pratisarana</italic> helps to increase blood circulation and enhances gingival defense mechanism, giving strength to the gingival fibers to maintain the gingival, and the periodontal health.</p><p>Repeated advocacy of different <italic>Acharyas</italic> aroused an interest in a search for a better remedy for gingivitis from the medicinal heritage of Indian Materia Medica. An Ayurvedic formulation that is <italic>Kapha-Pitta Shamaka</italic> (pacifying <italic>Pitta</italic> and <italic>Rakta</italic>) and has <italic>Shothahara</italic> (anti-inflammatory), <italic>Krimighna</italic> (anti-microbial) and <italic>Rasayana</italic> (rejuvenation) properties is likely to be effective for the management of <italic>Sheetada</italic>.</p><p><italic>Dashana Samskara Yoga</italic> formulation is documented in Ayurvedic literature.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] It is a widely used classical formulation for treating all types of oral cavity disorders. It is mainly dominant with <italic>Katu</italic> (astringent) and <italic>Tikta Rasa</italic> (bitter taste); <italic>Laghu</italic> (light), <italic>Rooksha</italic> (rough), and <italic>Tikshna</italic> (stronge) <italic>Guna</italic> (properties); <italic>Katu Vipaaka</italic>; <italic>Sheeta Veerya</italic> (cold potency); and <italic>Kapha Pitta Shamaka Karma</italic>. Further, it's <italic>Shothahara</italic> (anti-inflammatory), <italic>Lekhana</italic>, <italic>Shodhana</italic>, <italic>Raktasthambhana</italic> (styptic), and <italic>Krimighna</italic> (anti-microbial) properties would help to remove the gingival pathology. Its <italic>Rasayana</italic> (immuno-promotive) property improves the gingival defence mechanism and helps to regenerate gingival tissues.</p><p>Although the <italic>Choorna</italic> (powder) form is a classical formulation, it has some demerits like short shelf life, greater chances of contamination, and inconvenience of application. Thus, patients were less likely to use it consistently and be satisfied with its benefits. To overcome these problems, a paste form of same the formulation was used. Pastes are widely used for dental disorders because they tend to be the most suitable and convenient formulation. It was in sterile form, and therefore has less likelihood of microbial contamination. It also has a longer shelf life.</p><p>After studying the classical references and results of previous research works,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] this present study was planned to compare the effect of <italic>Dashana Samskara Yoga</italic> clinically in paste and powder forms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Method of preparation paste</title><p>Nearly 30% hydroalcoholic extracts of each ingredient of <italic>Choorna</italic> (except <italic>Karpoora</italic> and <italic>Khatika</italic>) 25% w/w out of total <italic>Choorna</italic> was mixed with the base of gum acacia and sorbitol 48%.

The epidemiological studies show that the prevalence rate is high among children and adolescences,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] because of age related changes and lack of awareness. In this study, majority of patients (42.28%) were reported in the age group of 31-45 years that is the late phase of adolescence. Data clearly implies that above group of patients were under sub-clinical stage during their adolescence age and presented with <italic>Sheetada</italic> in our OPD in the late adolescence phase.</p><p>Global studies show that prevalence of gingivitis is more common among males.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] However, maximum patients observed in the present study were females. This may be because of general trend of the female patients attending the hospital. As day time male patients may be engaged with their professional duties. Another factor may be females are careless about their oral health because of lack of time and awareness. In this study, among female patients, 57% were under premenopausal stage. It also could be the reason that majority of patients were females because studies also claim that hormonal imbalance have a direct role to play in the pathogenesis of gingivitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]</p><p>It was observed in the present clinical study that maximum numbers of patients were belonged to rural area. This finding is supported by several previous research works.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] They have proved that in general, the prevalence and severity of periodontal disease are slightly higher in rural areas than in urban areas. It may be due to lack of awareness and poor oral hygienic practice. The previous studies show that periodontal disease is inversely related to increasing levels of education.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>Maximum that is 48.11% of patients registered in this study, were having <italic>Kapha-Pitta Prakriti</italic> (constitution) and all of them presenting with moderate grade of gingivitis. Owing to the involvement of <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> and <italic>Rakta Dhatu</italic> in <italic>Sheetada</italic>, <italic>Kapha-Pitta Prakriti</italic> is more prone to this disease due to the <italic>Aashrayashrayi Bhava</italic>. The majority of the patients were having moderate gingivitis, which indicates that maximum patient's gingival status can be regained to normal condition with proper management with early diagnosis.</p><p>It is a known fact that general condition of GIT favors the normal nourishment and health of the body tissues. It was observed that majority of the patients i.e., 54.72% were having <italic>Avara Jarana Shakti</italic> (low digestive power) and <italic>Mandagni</italic> (low biological fire). These may favor the formation of <italic>Ama</italic> (undigestive food) and initiation of <italic>Samprapti</italic> (aetio patogenesis) of <italic>Sheetada</italic>.</p><p>Present study shows that majority of patients had chronicity between 6 months and 12 months. It indicates that the disease is chronic in nature. Because of patient's unawareness of their oral health, they were not able to detect bleeding from gums as early symptom.</p><p>Nearly 54% of patients presented with fair oral hygiene. This may be due to lack of awareness of oral hygienic measures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] Maximum patients were using brush as a cleansing tool. This reveals that in this modern era it is a common tool for cleansing teeth. It is proved that with brush one can clean the interdental areas, pits, and fissures on the teeth. However, most important thing is which method of brushing is used. In this study, maximum patients were using horizontal brushing pattern. It is an improper pattern by which debris at inter dental area, pits, and fissure areas and more or less at cervical areas may not be removed, which plays major role in initiation or progression of the disease, not only that, but also improper technique and hard bristles damages the gingiva and its frequent use leads to increased friction leading to gingivitis or it may injure the enamel and cause abrasion of tooth surface. Nearly 95.28% patients were using tooth paste as a cleansing material. It indicates the changed trend of cleaning material, particularly in urban area, which prevents the gums and teeth from microbes. Because of the traditional <italic>Datuna</italic> (tooth stick) and tooth powder are not much in practice in urban area.</p><p>Nearly 77.36% of the patients found cleaning their teeth only once in a day, in morning and before breakfast. It indicates lack of importance of oral hygiene after taking food. It results in bacterial growth at the place of food collection resulting in dental plaque.</p><p>Maximum patients were vegetarians i.e., 83.02% who were taking <italic>Madhura Rasa</italic> dominant diet that is 49.06%. Protein rich diet is mainly responsible for the integrity of the periodontium and plays main role in the promotion and maintenance of gingival and periodontal health. Majority of vegetarian diets are rich in carbohydrates and fibrous content. It shows that lack of proteinous diet may have a role to play in gingival disorders. <italic>Madhura Rasa</italic> is responsible for vitiation of <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> leads to initiation of <italic>Samprapti</italic> of <italic>Sheetada</italic>.
