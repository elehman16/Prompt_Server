Pathologically the underlying process of atherosclerosis is driven by inflammatory mechanisms, which are activated in ACS patients. Previous studies have investigated the role of inflammatory markers in this process, including interleukin 1 (IL-1) and C Reactive Protein (CRP). Pre-clinical studies indicate that IL-1 may be a primary driver of ACS and that the naturally occurring interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) may inhibit the atherosclerotic process. This study will investigate the effects of IL-1ra on inflammatory markers in man.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Three centres in the UK are planning to recruit 186 Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction patients to receive either interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (Anakinra) or matching placebo. Patients will receive a daily subcutaneous injection of either study drug or placebo over a 14 day period. The primary outcome is area under the curve of high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein (CRP) over the first 7 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The MRC-ILA-HEART Study is a proof of concept clinical trial investigating the effects of IL-1ra upon markers of inflammation in patients with Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction. It is hoped this will provide new and exciting information in relation to an "anti-inflammatory" strategy for patients with acute coronary syndrome.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ISRCTN89369318</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Acute coronary syndromes (ACS), caused by coronary atherosclerotic plaque destabilisation and interruption of coronary flow, are common, serious conditions that account for 15% of all deaths in the UK and are associated with considerable morbidity among survivors. ACS are classified by the presenting ECG: patients with persistent ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) generally require early reperfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], whereas those with non ST-elevation (NSTEMI) ACS require early risk stratification and revascularisation as necessary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. There remains, however, considerable risk in the non-ST elevation ACS patients: the average risk of death at 6 months is 6.2% with 19.3% re-attending hospital because of heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. It is known that inflammatory processes are activated in ACS. This proposal is for a proof of concept clinical trial of a new and exciting anti-inflammatory strategy for the treatment of NSTEMI ACS based on pre-clinical investigations that we wish to translate to man.</p><sec><title>Inflammation and atherosclerosis</title><p>The past decade has seen a growth in treatment options available for ACS as a consequence of better understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. At a biological level the process is driven by inflammatory mechanisms in the vessel wall where atherogenesis is initiated by lipids and other environmental agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Instability of the plaque atheroma so as to cause the disease to present is also viewed as an inflammatory process, predominantly where plaque macrophages destabilise the cap of the atheroma, resulting in the formation of an intra-coronary thrombus.</p><p>The therapeutic implications of these pathogenic pathways are that primary and, to some extent, secondary prevention are targeted at mutable risk factors (smoking cessation, blood pressure control, lipid lowering etc.) and anti-thrombotic strategies for the treatment and prevention of intracoronary thrombus. Evaluation of therapeutic strategies designed to treat the inflammatory processes involved in acute or chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) is at an early stage. Some agents may potentially have anti-inflammatory properties (statins in particular and fish oils) but this is not their primary mechanism of action and proving beneficial effects consequent upon the anti-inflammatory properties of these agents has been difficult.</p><p>Since the description of ACS as an inflammatory event potential sources of, and functions for, inflammatory cytokines in this process have been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. IL-1 is an apical cytokine in the innate inflammatory response transducing signals from bacterial products through pattern recognition receptors, complement activation and TNF&#x003b1;. IL-1 has plausible actions in arterial wall inflammation in the setting of atherosclerosis, in particular its effects on endothelial cells (activation) and vascular smooth muscle cells (proliferation). There are two agonistic cytokines (IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;) that signal via the Type 1 IL-1 receptor and there is a specific Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), the only known naturally occurring cytokine antagonist, that inhibits IL-1 actions by binding to the Type 1 IL-1 Receptor (IL-1RI), blocking the receptor and preventing IL-1 from binding thereby preventing receptor signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Relevance of interleukin-1</title><p>The suggestion that IL-1 is involved in the pathogenesis of CAD, and in particular in ACS, is derived from a number of sources as there is no animal model of this condition. IL-1 and IL-1ra are expressed in diseased human coronary arteries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Coronary artery IL-1&#x003b2; is up-regulated in porcine coronary arteries after balloon injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Genetic studies have indicated that polymorphic variants within the IL-1 cluster that have net pro-inflammatory effects are associated with angiographic CAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>In mouse models of atherosclerosis IL-1ra inhibits the formation of intimal fatty streaks in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and IL-1&#x003b2; deficient mice when crossed onto an apo e-/- background have reduced atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Relevant to vessel wall healing, we have data from mice and pigs that indicate the vessel wall response to injury (neointima formation) is an intensely IL-1 dependent event [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the porcine coronary artery, the neointima response to balloon angioplasty (a model of arterial wall rupture in some way analogous to that which occurs in ACS) is reduced in its amount by a 14 day s.c. infusion of IL-1ra. We have crossed the IL-1R1-/- mouse with the apo e-/- and found reduced atherosclerosis. This double knockout, unable to signal IL-1, has no rise in blood pressure with fat feeding (in contrast to the apo e-/- control mice) and this is associated with reduced serum amyloid A levels (mice do not appear to have CRP), reduced markers of oxidative stress in the arterial wall and preservation of endothelial cell function in resistance arteries. We have reproduced the blood pressure rise inhibition and the modulation of oxidative stress seen in the IL-1R1-/-, apo e-/- double knockout by using s.c. IL-1ra treatment in apo e-/- mice.</p><p>In a cohort of 63 NSTEMI ACS patients we examined the impact of IL-1 gene polymorphisms upon markers of endothelial cell activation and CRP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The intron 2, VNTR polymorphism that we have previously described as associated with reduced endothelial cell production of IL-1ra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (i.e. endothelial pro-inflammatory) was associated with significant increases in soluble markers of endothelial activation at the time of NSTEMI ACS, including the rise in plasma vWF, a marker known to be associated with clinical outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>Overall, our preliminary data indicate that 1) IL-1 is a potent mediator of arterial inflammation in the context of atherosclerosis and vessel wall injury and 2) IL-1 inhibition restores endothelial function, reduces inflammatory vessel wall responses and reduces vascular oxidative stress. We wish now to translate these findings to man.</p></sec><sec><title>Markers of inflammation in ACS</title><p>ACS, as has been stated before, is an intensely inflammatory event at the level of the vessel wall. Data from angioscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], angiography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], IVUS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] as well as functional cell biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] indicate that ACS is frequently associated with widespread coronary activation and inflammation, indicating a pancoronary inflammatory state. It has also become clear that serum markers of inflammation are predictors of complications following an episode of ACS and that statin therapy associated with lower achieved levels of CRP are associated with improvement in outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These data suggest that modulation of inflammation in the coronary artery would be predicted to translate to clinical benefit. There is considerable interest in markers of outcome in ACS. These broadly fall into two groups; those that measure the size of the infarct and those that are measures of the pathogenic process in the vessel way and may reflect both the magnitude and duration of the process. In the former group are the markers of myocyte damage. Cardiac-specific Troponin is now recognised as a more sensitive and specific marker of myocardial necrosis than creatine kinase and its MB isoenzyme. Elevation of serum Troponin has been shown to identify patients with ACS at risk for adverse clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In the latter group (markers of the pathological process) are the markers of inflammation, coagulation and of platelet activation. We believe that there are plausible links between IL-1 activation and these markers. The acute phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In NSTEMI ACS, treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CRP rises and peaks between 24 and 48 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. It is clear, however, that in some patients there is persistent elevation with maybe 49% of patients having a CRP &#x0003e;3 mg/L at discharge and these patients were identified as having increased chances of recurrent admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The absolute levels of CRP have been shown to have a high sensitivity (87%) and a low specificity (54%) for subsequent myocardial infarction in patients presenting with an ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There is a difficulty using a percentage change in CRP, either for individual patients and predicting outcome or between two groups of (treated) patients, in that there is no baseline level from which comparisons can be made. Differences in outcomes in the PROVE-IT trial, however, were associated with differences in the achieved CRP level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Biologically, CRP production by hepatocytes has to be induced and this has been shown to be driven by the IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines. Serum levels of IL-6 have been shown to be elevated in patients with ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and an elevation of IL-6 is an independent marker of increased mortality in ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The relationship between IL-1 and IL-6 is well defined with IL-1 inducing IL-6 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has, however, proved difficult to reliably measure IL-1&#x003b2;; a cytokine that is devoid of a signal sequence directing release and which probably circulates at a very low level.</p><p>During NSTEMI, a rise in von Willebrand Factor (vWF) between 24 and 48 h predicts adverse clinical events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and an association between circulating levels of IL-6 and von Willebrand factor (vWF) has recently been shown to determine prognosis in patients with ACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. IL-1 has been shown to augment thrombin-induced release of vWF from human endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra)</title><p>There are two agonistic cytokines (IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;) that signal via the Type 1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) and a specific Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), (the only known naturally occurring cytokine antagonist) that inhibits IL-1 actions by binding to the IL-1R1, blocking the receptor and preventing IL-1 from binding thereby preventing receptor signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>IL-1ra is available for the treatment of a number of inflammatory conditions as a recombinant, non-glycosylated, N-terminal methionine added protein (Kineret/Anakinra, Amgen). Although less successful than anti-TNF therapies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), there appears to be considerable benefit in the management of Juvenile arthritis (Still's disease), and it is the treatment of choice in the rare autoinflammatory illnesses typified by Muckle-Wells syndrome. From all of the indications in which IL-1ra has been used it has emerged that IL-1ra is a very safe form of treatment and appears to be devoid of the side-effect of re-activation of infectious illness seen with anti-TNF therapies. The only problems encountered are mild, reversible injection site reactions and neutropaenia in &#x0003c;1% of patients after a month or more of treatment.</p><p>Dosing with IL-1ra is simple. A single, daily, subcutaneous 100 mg injection of IL-1ra is the standard dose of IL-1ra for all individuals with normal renal function. In RA this causes a 35% reduction in CRP after approximately 1 week of treatment. Higher doses do not achieve any greater reduction in CRP of relief of RA symptoms. Single daily dosing schedules are used in the sucessful treatment of Juvenile arthritis and Muckle-Wells. The half-life of IL-1ra is 4&#x02013;6 hours with maximum absorption from an s.c. injection at 3&#x02013;7 hours. (Data on file supplied by Amgen).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>All of these data indicate that the IL-1 cytokine has the potential to act as a primary driver of ACS. Prolonged coronary activation is associated with worse outcome in ACS. It is therefore plausible that blockade of the IL-1 system could be of therapeutic benefit. We believe our pre-clinical data indicates that a purely anti-inflammatory approach based upon Interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibition using IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) is a feasible and logical therapy for ACS and this approach could open a new therapeutic paradigm for evaluation in further studies.</p><sec><title>Aim of study</title><p>The main objective is to assess whether treatment of NSTEMI ACS with IL-1ra alters the inflammatory process involved in this condition</p></sec><sec><title>Trial design</title><p>Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled multi-centre phase II clinical trial</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>1.

The hospital pharmacist will issue the relevant drug package. (Please see appendices for pharmacy information).</p><p>The study drug and placebo will be provided by Amgen Inc in its commercially available recombinant form which is in clinical use for the treatment of arthritic conditions. The study drug and placebo will be relabelled by Amgen, in collaboration with CTEU according to MHRA guidelines.</p><p>The first dose of IL-1ra will be given within 24 h +2 h of the positive Troponin. Injections will be given at a standardised time (24 &#x000b1; 2 h after the previous dose), immediately after blood sampling. IL-1ra or placebo will administered to the patient by the research nurse while the patient is in hospital. During the hospital stay, the patient will be taught to self-administer the injection by the research nurse and on discharge will continue at home. This has proven possible in other ACS trials that required self injection of subcutaneous heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Full written guidance on self injection will also be provided to patients. If self injection is found not to be possible in an individual patient for unexpected reasons, an alternative method will be sought (e.g. district nurse, or attending the hospital) to try and maintain full compliance with scheduled study drug regimen after discharge. Patients will also be asked to complete a daily injection diary. All personnel will be blinded to the identity of the syringe contents.</p></sec><sec><title>Concomitant treatments and procedures</title><p>All patients will receive standardised additional treatments according to best practice including aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin (intravenous or low-molecular weight), a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor and a statin. Other medication will be at the physicians' discretion. It is the intention that all patients will proceed to coronary angiography according to current guidelines, and subsequent revascularisation if necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Drug composition</title><p>Each vial contains 100 mg of anakinra in 1 ml (100 mg/ml). Anakinra is a human interleukin &#x02013; 1 receptor antagonist (r -metHuIL -1ra) produced by recombinant DNA technology in an E coli expression system.</p></sec><sec><title>Marketing authorisation Holder</title><p>Amgen Europe B.V., Minervum 7061, 4817 ZK Breda, The Netherlands</p></sec><sec><title>Placebo composition</title><p>Each vial consists of sodium citrate, sodium chloride, disodium edentate, polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide and water for injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening and enrolment</title><p>Participating centres and investigators have extensive experience of clinical trials and admit large numbers of patients with acute coronary syndromes. It is expected that screening for eligible patients will occur on a daily basis and potentially eligible patients will be approached for consent to participate. Screening for patients should occur routinely in ward areas that admit ACS patients. Centres are encouraged to screen and enrol at the weekends and out of hours depending on local resources. Each centre is requested to randomise and follow-up an average of 62 patients (30 per annum or 2&#x02013;3 patients per month) over a 2 year period.</p></sec><sec><title>Screening procedure</title><p>A member of the research team will screen patients for eligibility as soon as possible after presentation. If patients meet the eligibility criteria they will be given the patient information sheet to consider. Patients will be given as much time as they require to consider taking part but due to the acute nature of this condition, patients will be recruited as soon as possible after the positive troponin is confirmed. A TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) and GRACE risk score will be determined for each patient at baseline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Informed consent</title><p>"Informed consent" requires individual discussion with the patient about the nature of the procedures to be conducted in a language that is easy to comprehend. The patient should fully understand that he/she might be allocated to either the IL-1ra or the placebo group and the potential adverse effects of participation. The patient should also understand that his/her refusal to participate in the study will not affect the quality of subsequent medical care and if they do consent to participate they may withdraw at any point without affecting their care.</p><p>Before any trial-related procedures may be performed, informed consent must be obtained from the patient by the investigator by means of a signed declaration. The investigator must sign in the CRF to confirm that informed consent was obtained and store the original of the signed declaration of consent in the patient's notes. A copy should be given to the patient and a copy filed in the CRF.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Randomisation will be performed using a 24-hour voice interactive system set up the trial co-ordinating centre (Clinical Trials and Evaluation Unit (CTEU) of the Royal Brompton Hospital, London). Centres will be asked for a few simple details about the patient including initials, date of birth and eligibility criteria. The caller will be given a randomisation number, corresponding to blinded study treatment, and a fax or e mail will be sent to the centre confirming this.

IL-1&#x003b2; effects are mediated via the IL-1 receptor that is antagonised by IL-1ra. As with other receptors, stimulation may result in down-regulation and inhibition in up-regulation. We aim to demonstrate this by measurement of IL-1r mRNA expression. Genomic DNA and mRNA samples will be collected, stored and studied. These will be used to study the genetic substrate of observed differences in inflammatory markers and also effects of IL-1ra treatment &#x02013; with initial experimental questions being as outlined here.

This is based upon the log-transformed value of the area under the curve and a standardised difference (difference/standard deviation [D]) of approximately 0.45. The standardised difference had been used since it is very difficult to estimate what the values of the log-transformed AUC will be. A change of 0.45 on the standardised normal will correspond to a one-third change in the primary outcome, regardless of the scale of the measurement, assuming the outcome measure is normally distributed. As the sample size is sufficiently powered to detect a change equivalent to one-third on the standard normal, it will also be sufficient to detect the same level of change on the primary outcome measure. It is anticipated that follow-up will be near complete in this study. However, allowing for data loss, for whatever reason, of 10% in each arm we have increased the required sample size to approximately 180 patients (60/centre). Furthermore, the sample size needs to be adjusted for the 2 interim analyses that will be conducted during the trial. Using the method of O'Brien and Flemming (1979) gives an increased sample size of 184 patients.).</p></sec><sec><title>Interim analyses</title><p>A limited number of interim analyses will be performed by the trial statistician as specified by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). The accumulating results will not be available to the trialists or other principal investigators. The final, definitive analysis of the trial data will be conducted 25 months after the date of commencement of the trial. The interim analysis will test for efficacy, safety and futility. The method of O'Brien and Fleming suggests that stopping for efficacy will only occur if the first interim analysis shows a treatment effect equivalent to p &#x0003c; 0.0005 or if the second interim analysis shows a treatment effect equivalent to p &#x0003c; 0.014.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary analysis</title><p>Primary analysis will be of log-transformed AUC of 7 day CRP. The primary analysis will include all patients with at least 4 follow-up readings, on an intention-to-treat basis, and a secondary analysis will include only those with all follow-up readings on a per-protocol basis. ANOVA (analysis of variance) will be used to analyse the primary outcome measure and to estimate the treatment effect. For patients with at least 4 readings, any missing measurements will be imputed using the last observation carried forward method. After adjustment for the interim analyses, based on the method of O'Brien and Fleming, the primary endpoint will be considered to be statistically significant if it shows a treatment effect equivalent to p &#x0003c; 0.045.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial organisation and committees</title><sec><title>Trial steering committee (TSC)</title><p>The main role of the TSC is to monitor and supervise the progress of the trial.

Cardiac Magnetic Resonance imaging sub study</title><p>The Leeds cohort of patients will undergo baseline and follow-up Gadolinium enhanced CMR as a quantitative measurement of extent of myocardial injury. We wish to evaluate the possible mechanisms of any potential benefit and, therefore, feel that investigation of myocardial function, infarct size and oedema is justified. CMR is an accurate and reproducible technique for making these assessments. CMR can distinguish between scar tissue (following myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndromes) and normal (viable) myocardium using the late gadolinium hyper-enhancement technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. CMR can also differentiate acute from chronic infarction, based on the principle that acute infarctions are surrounded by tissue oedema secondary to the inflammatory process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Thus, CMR is well suited to extend our understanding of the mechanism of any potential benefit from IL-1ra treatment at the time of NSTEMI ACS. Therefore, we plan a CMR sub-study in the Leeds patients who will have a CMR scan within 48 h of presentation using the protocol outlined below. A follow-up scan, using the same protocol, will be performed after the completion of randomised therapy. Quantification of myocardial oedema, myocardial scar and ventricular volumes/function will be performed on both scans. Exploratory statistical analysis will be undertaken for serial change in these measures within patients and between groups.</p><sec><title>CMR imaging procedure</title><p>1) Localisers and breath-hold plan scans to define LV short axis. 2) Resting wall-motion sequence. Multiphase HLA, VLA and short axis cine stack (10&#x02013;12 slices) using a fast gradient echo sequence to assess wall motion. Then in identical scan planes; Breath hold, black blood, T2-weighted triple inversion recovery sequence. 3) Late gadolinium hyper-enhancement CMR: T1-weighted, segmented inversion-recovery sequence 15 minutes after intravenous injection of Gadolinium (0.2 mmol/kg). This protocol will be piloted on 20 patients before the start of the main clinical trial.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2. ST-Holter segment analysis sub study</title><p>As soon as possible after recruitment, between days 2 and 4 of treatment, Sheffield patients will be identified as suitable for ST segment monitoring. Exclusion criteria will include bundle branch block, significant conduction abnormality, digoxin therapy or serious electrolyte disturbance. The presence of other potentially confounding features, such as mitral valve prolapse, posture change, changes due to body habitus and temperature change will be assumed to be similar in the two groups. A Holter monitor will be attached using the 3 standard leads for 24 h. If catheterisation be performed during the period of the recording, an appropriate entry will be made on the time log prior to the monitor being removed and replaced afterwards. If revascularisation be undertaken, the monitor will not be replaced. The monitor will be removed by one of the ECG technicians after 24 h (or as just stated) and analysed by Ms Gomersall (an experienced ECG technician who works in Sheffield), using the standard Reynolds protocol for ST segment analysis. She will be blinded to the identity of the treatment. The number of ischemic events, their frequency and total duration will be compared in both treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Forearm endothelial cell response sub study</title><p>This study will examine the effect of Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) on vasomotor and fibrinolytic function in the forearm circulation of patients with acute coronary syndromes. The pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis alpha-&#x003b1; (TNF-&#x003b1;) have been implicated in the initiation and amplification of local and systemic inflammatory responses leading to the development of, and progression of atherosclerosis. However the direct <italic>in vivo </italic>effects of cytokines in patients with IHD on endothelial vasomotor and fibrinolytic function are unknown. As acute coronary syndromes are associated with both impaired fibrinolytic function and transient elevation of acute phase proteins we wish to establish whether IL-1ra affects endothelial function.</p><p>Patients will be recruited for the main study. Those recruited in Edinburgh (n = 62) will be asked if they are also prepared to participate in this sub-study. Recruited subjects will attend on two occasions. A comparison of IL-1ra versus placebo on endothelial function will be undertaken. The first study will be performed on days 2&#x02013;4 following recruitment, at a standardised time following administration of either IL-1ra or placebo (typically 1&#x02013;4 h). The second study will be performed on day 14 at the same time of day as the first study. Volunteers will have fasted and avoided caffeine for at least four hours and avoided alcohol for 24 hours prior to each study. The subjects will undergo brachial artery cannulation with a 27 standard wire gauge under controlled conditions. Forearm blood flow will be measured in the infused and non-infused arms by venous occlusion plethysmography using mercury-in-silastic strain gauges. Blood samples will be obtained from 17-gauge venous cannulae inserted into the antecubital fossae of both forearms.</p><p>Selective infusions into the brachial artery of the non-dominant arm will be undertaken. Substance P will be infused at 2, 4, 8 pmol/min, acetylcholine at 5, 10 and 20 &#x003bc;g/min (endothelium-dependent vasodilator that does not release t-PA), and sodium nitroprusside at 2, 4 and 8 &#x003bc;g/min (endothelium-independent vasodilator that does not release t-PA) will be infused for 5 min at each dose. Blood samples will be taken simultaneously from each forearm at baseline, immediately following, and at 4 further time points after the TNF-&#x003b1; infusion (total less than 200 mls on each occasion). These time points have been derived using the results of previous work to minimise non-contributory venous samples. Blood will be taken to assess stimulated coagulation factors and cytokines. Samples for plasma cotinine, haematocrit, white cell count will also be taken.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Tim Clayton and Michael Roughton for statistical support &#x02013; funded by MRC-ILA-HEART grant and NHS R&#x00026;D</p><p>Fiona Nugara for data management &#x02013; funded by MRC-ILA-HEART study grant and Royal Brompton Hospital</p><p>Pauline Newlands for database design &#x02013; funded by MRC-ILA-HEART study grant and Royal Brompton Hospital</p><p>Study Support</p><p>MRC-ILA-HEART is funded by a grant from the Medical Research Council (MRC), grant reference number G0502131.
