The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) as a treatment option for paediatric CFS/ME because there is good evidence that it is effective. Despite this, most young people in the UK are unable to access local specialist CBT for CFS/ME. A randomised controlled trial (RCT) showed FITNET was effective in the Netherlands but we do not know if it is effective in the National Health Service (NHS) or if it is cost-effective. This trial will investigate whether FITNET-NHS is clinically effective and cost-effective in the NHS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Seven hundred and thirty-four paediatric patients (aged 11&#x02013;17 years) with CFS/ ME will be randomised (1:1) to receive either FITNET-NHS (online CBT) or Activity Management (delivered via video call). The internal pilot study will use integrated qualitative methods to examine the feasibility of recruitment and the acceptability of treatment. The full trial will assess whether FITNET-NHS is clinically effective and cost-effective. The primary outcome is disability at 6 months, measured using the SF-36-PFS (Physical Function Scale) questionnaire. Cost-effectiveness is measured via cost-utility analysis from an NHS perspective. Secondary subgroup analysis will investigate the effectiveness of FITNET-NHS in those with co-morbid mood disorders.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">If FITNET-NHS is found to be feasible and acceptable (internal pilot) and effective and cost-effective (full trial), its provision by the NHS has the potential to deliver substantial health gains for the large number of young people suffering from CFS/ME but unable to access treatment because there is no local specialist service. This trial will provide further evidence evaluating the delivery of online CBT to young people with chronic conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ISRCTN registry, registration number: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN18020851">ISRCTN18020851</ext-link>.

Young people and parents/carers who are interested will be emailed an information pack including: an age-appropriate Patient Information Leaflet (PIL), and links to an online &#x02018;consent to contact&#x02019; form and Revised Children&#x02019;s Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS) questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The &#x02018;consent to contact&#x02019; form and RCADS questionnaire will be completed using a secure electronic system used for data capture called Research Electronic Data Capture <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://project-redcap.org">http://project-redcap.org</ext-link> (REDCap). After &#x02018;consent to contact&#x02019; is completed an eligibility assessment will be carried out with both the young people and their parents/carers. Following this, the recruitment consultation is performed. The eligibility assessment and recruitment discussions usually take place during one telephone/video call; however, they can also take place over separate telephone/video calls if preferred. These discussions will be audio-recorded with consent/assent. The trial design and interventions will be explained; young people and their parents will be given the opportunity to read the age-appropriate PIL, ask questions and can have as long as required to make an informed decision. The researcher will seek age-appropriate consent/assent from the young person and parents/carers via the online REDCap system. Those who decide not to take part will be invited to talk to a qualitative researcher about their decision and verbal agreement will be recorded during the recruitment consultation. They will be offered a face-to-face assessment and treatment by the Bath specialist paediatric CFS/ME service and continue to receive standard medical care. Further consent for an interview will be obtained at the time of the interview.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par42">Participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio, by the research team, to receive either FITNET-NHS or Activity Management using an automated web randomisation service. Allocation will use minimisation to facilitate balance by age and gender, and preserve allocation concealment. Because of the nature of the intervention, it is not practical to blind either the participant, family or the clinical service to treatment allocation. GPs will be informed of the allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Interventions</title><p id="Par43">The Bath specialist paediatric CFS/ME service will provide both treatment arms. Both interventions will be delivered so that participants receive treatment at home, online. The Activity Management arm is akin to usual care for out-of-area referrals, who would normally have an assessment (face-to-face) with follow-ups via video call. The difference with Activity Management delivered within the FITNET-NHS Trial is that participants do not need to travel for the initial assessment as this too is delivered via video call.

Participants will have three to six video appointments (one assessment and up to five follow-ups). Parent/carer attendance is optional.</p><p id="Par45">During the assessment (around 90 min), the therapists: will discuss the different types of activity &#x02013; including cognitive activity (high concentration and low concentration) &#x02013; which vary according to age; carry out a detailed assessment of the individual&#x02019;s current activity levels; and collaboratively agree a &#x02018;baseline&#x02019;, which is the average level of activity. Participants will receive information on CFS/ME, activity management, sleep and symptom management.</p><p id="Par46">The first follow-up video call will be arranged 2 to 6 weeks after assessment depending on participant preference. If the patient still requires clinical care further follow-up video calls will be organised from 2 to 6 weeks later.

The programme has 19 psycho-educational and CBT chapters for young people and a parallel programme for their parents. Participants and their parents have separate accounts and log-ins. The psycho-educational chapters include information on: CFS/ME; the causes of CFS/ME; the relationship between CFS/ME, anxiety, depression and other illnesses; how diagnosis is confirmed; treatment for CFS/ME; how to explain CFS/ME to friends and what the future (without CFS/ME) is likely to look like.</p><p id="Par50">The CBT section is activated by a clinical psychologist once the young person/parent has completed the psycho-educational chapters. Parental chapters explore and address parents&#x02019; beliefs and behaviours towards their child with CFS/ME, focussing on their role as carers. In participants younger than 15 years, parents/carers are supported to act as a coach. In those older than 15 years, parents/carers are encouraged to step back and support their child taking responsibility for their treatment. The CBT chapters focus on cognitive behavioural strategies with instructions on exercises for identifying, challenging and changing cognitive processes that contribute to CFS/ME and increasing self-efficacy with respect to fatigue, the ability to be active and work towards recovery. There are two protocols depending on the pattern of activity levels. If participants are identified as being relatively active with a varying level of activity, they first find their baseline before increasing slowly.

If effectiveness and cost-effectiveness are demonstrated for either arm, the NHS has the potential to deliver substantial health gains for the large number of young people suffering from CFS/ME but unable to access treatment because there is no local specialist service. If it is feasible this method could be used for other long-term conditions where young people do not have local specialist services. Results from the qualitative methods will tell us about patient experiences of the intervention content and mode of delivery, how to improve these types of interventions and how to deliver treatment from a single centre in the UK.
