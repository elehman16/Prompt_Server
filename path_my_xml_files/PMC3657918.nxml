In this era of health care cost containment, it is important that anesthetic drugs used for outpatient ambulatory surgery have rapid emergence, less postoperative nausea vomiting (PONV), adequate analgesia, and quick recovery. Local anesthesia with intravenous sedation called as procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) is widely being used for female laparoscopic sterilization. PSA is a technique of administering sedatives or dissociative agents with analgesics to induce a state that allows the patient to tolerate unpleasant procedures while maintaining cardiorespiratory function. Drugs used for PSA should provide an adequate level of sedation while minimizing pain, anxiety, and the potential for adverse drug-related events, maximizing amnesia, and maintaining a stable cardiovascular and respiratory status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] Unfortunately, at present, no single agent exists that has all of the aforementioned qualities, so physicians must use combinations of different drugs at varying doses to achieve as many of the desired goals as possible. The most recent PSA combination to be described in the literature is that of low-dose ketamine and propofol (ketofol). To our knowledge, ketamine&#x02013;propofol (ketofol) combination has not been used as procedural sedation and analgesia technique in laparoscopic tubal ligation. The present study was planned to comparatively evaluate postoperative recovery characteristics, duration of hospital stay, patient comfort and acceptability between ketamine&#x02013;propofol and fentanyl&#x02013;propofol for PSA in patients undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>We conducted this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study in 100 patients of ASA PS grade I, aged 18-45 years, scheduled to undergo laparoscopic tubal ligation (Falope ring placed around a loop of the tube) under PSA at Shrimati Sucheta Kriplani Hospital. The study was approved by the institutional ethical committee and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients who had history of upper respiratory tract infections, asthma, or allergy to propofol or ketamine or receiving treatment for any psychiatric or neuromuscular disease, patients with seizure disorder, acid reflux, hiatus hernia, severe anemia, gross obesity, hepatic, cardiac, or pulmonary diseases were excluded from the study.</p><p>Patients were kept fasting overnight. They were randomly allocated by a computer-generated random number table into two equal groups as follows:</p><p>Group PF &#x02013; Fentanyl group (<italic>n</italic>=50)</p><p>Group PK &#x02013; Ketamine group (<italic>n</italic>=50)</p><p>The sequence was delivered in a sealed envelope on the morning of surgery.</p><p>On arrival in the operating room, monitor for pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram (ECG), and non-invasive blood pressure were attached, and the baseline readings recorded. An intravenous catheter was placed and Ringer Lactate was given at the rate of 4 ml/kg/h. Intravenous midazolam 0.02 mg/kg was given to all patients of both groups 5 min prior to the procedure.</p><p>Group PF received premixed injection fentanyl 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg + propofol 2 mg/kg and group PK received premixed injection ketamine 0.5 mg/kg + propofol 2 mg/kg over 30 seconds intravenously. Fentanyl and ketamine were diluted with normal saline to make a volume of 10 ml. The drugs were then mixed with propofol in weight-appropriate dosages to make a final volume of 20 ml. All the drugs were prepared by an anesthesiology resident not involved in the study. Incision site was infiltrated infraumblically with 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine. If necessary, propofol was repeated in a dose of 0.5 mg/kg on patient's movement to surgical stimulus.</p><p>Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic pressure, mean arterial pressure, peripheral oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were monitored and recorded at the following time intervals: Baseline (after 5 min on the OT table), immediately before sedation, 1 min after sedation, and thereafter at 3-min intervals till the end of procedure. ECG and SpO<sub>2</sub> were monitored continuously.</p><p>Side effects such as respiratory depression (respiratory rate &#x0003c;8 breaths per minute, apnea longer than 15 seconds or SpO<sub>2</sub>&#x0003c;92%), hypotension (more than 20% decrease from the initial value), and bradycardia (heart rate &#x0003c;60 beats per minute), increased secretions, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, visual disturbances, delirium, pruritis and any other side effect were recorded. After the procedure (from end of skin stitching), the time to meet Modified Aldrete score[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] &#x02265;8 was measured. This was recorded as the recovery time. Then, the patients were shifted to the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). The time to discharge was decided by the Post Anesthetic Discharge Scoring System (PADSS).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] The time interval between the entry to PACU and the time point at which PADSS achieved a score &#x02265;9 was recorded as the time to discharge. Supplemental drug requirement was also recorded.</p><p>Comfort score (1, very unpleasant; 2, unpleasant; 3, neither pleasant nor unpleasant; 4, pleasant; 5, very pleasant) was noted to see patient satisfaction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Medications used for the treatment of PONV and pain were recorded when given in PACU. Postoperative analgesic (injection diclofenac sodium 1.5 mg/kg) was administered when the pain score was &#x02265;3 on the 10-mm Visual Analog Scale. Criteria used for the administration of postoperative antiemetics (injection ondansetron 4 mg) were the presence of mild to severe nausea and/or emesis. All the observations were made by an anesthesiology resident who was unaware of group allocation and blinded to the study drug.

Discharge was probably delayed because of adverse effects like nausea and vomiting, and delay in voiding in the ketamine group. Recovery time in the fentanyl group was less than that in the ketamine group, the reason being an earlier return of consciousness. Although this difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), a difference of about 6 min is not significant clinically. The patients were more comfortable and more satisfied with the propofol&#x02013;fentanyl combination as compared to the propofol&#x02013;ketamine combination due to lesser incidence of nausea and vomiting. Although the heart rate was comparable, blood pressures were consistently higher in the ketamine group, ascribed to the sympathomimetic activity of ketamine.</p><p>Most of the major complications of female sterilization result from general anesthesia or from heavy sedation during local anesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Since general anesthesia is known to be responsible for at least one-third of all the deaths associated with sterilization,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] PSA can be offered as a safer alternative. Goals of PSA include providing an adequate level of sedation while minimizing pain, anxiety, and the potential for adverse drug-related events, maximizing amnesia, and maintaining a stable cardiovascular and respiratory status.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The ideal pharmacologic agent for PSA would accomplish all of these goals and would have quick onset and offset, be safe in all age groups, inexpensive, and equally efficacious in multiple routes of administration. PSA combinations commonly used are propofol and low-dose ketamine (ketofol) or propofol with opioids. Although these combinations of drugs for PSA have been used in various procedures, there is no mention of their use in patients undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation.</p><p>Akin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] compared a combination of propofol and fentanyl with propofol and ketamine, but in 40 adult patients undergoing endometrial biopsy. They observed that there was no difference in the recovery times, but the discharge was delayed in the ketamine group. The longer discharge time with ketamine was caused by the higher frequency of vertigo, nausea, and visual disturbances. With regard to patient satisfaction, the propofol&#x02013;fentanyl group was superior.</p><p>Vallejo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] compared postoperative nausea, emesis, analgesia, and recovery between the propofol&#x02013;ketamine and propofol&#x02013;fentanyl in outpatient laparoscopic tubal ligation done under general anesthesia. The authors observed no differences with respect to operating times, pain, nausea and vomiting or its treatment, Visual Analog Scale scores, pruritis, and sedation on PACU admission, PACU discharge, and hospital discharge between the two groups. The ketamine group had a higher heart rate, required more pain medication, and had a higher frequency of dreaming on PACU admission than the fentanyl group. These differences became insignificant on discharge. The authors concluded that propofol&#x02013;ketamine did not improve postoperative nausea, emesis, analgesia, or recovery, compared with the propofol&#x02013;fentanyl combination.</p><p>Badrinath <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] investigated the combination of propofol with ketamine at various doses in patients undergoing breast biopsy with local anesthesia. They added 2.5 &#x003bc;g of sufentanil depending on the discomfort and pain experienced by the patient. They also observed that the increased frequency of nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances due to ketamine prolonged the time to discharge. Jackobson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] used four different drug combinations in patients undergoing termination of pregnancy and reported that propofol&#x02013;ketamine combination led to the highest frequency of postoperative pain, psychomimetic side effects, and emesis. Although ketamine did not delay discharge, they concluded that propofol&#x02013;fentanyl was the most suitable combination. Daabiss <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of different concentrations of propofol&#x02013;ketamine in children scheduled for procedural operations. They found delayed recovery and discharge time in patients with higher doses of ketamine due to incidence of clinically significant psychomimetic effects and delayed cognitive function recovery.</p><p>To conclude, the combination of fentanyl (1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) and propofol (2 mg/kg) leads to faster recovery, earlier discharge, and better patient acceptability than the combination of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and propofol (2 mg/kg) for procedural sedation and analgesia in patients undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arora</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Combining ketamine and propofol (ketofol) for emergency department procedural sedation and analgesia: A review</article-title><source>West J Emerg Med</source><year>2008</year><volume>9</volume><fpage>20</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19561698</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Aldrete</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The post-anesthesia recovery score revisited</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>1995</year><volume>7</volume><fpage>89</fpage><lpage>91</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7772368</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Recovery pattern and home readiness after ambulatory surgery</article-title><source>Anesth Analg</source><year>1995</year><volume>80</volume><fpage>896</fpage><lpage>902</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">7726431</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Grace</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><name><surname>Lesteour</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sala</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Stewart</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A randomized comparison of low-dose ketamine and lignocaine infiltration with ketamine-diazepam anesthesia for postpartum tubal ligation in Vanuatu</article-title><source>Anaesth Intensive Care</source><year>2001</year><volume>29</volume><fpage>30</fpage><lpage>3</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11261907</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bordahl</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name><name><surname>Raeder</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Nordentoft</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kirste</surname><given-names>U</given-names></name><name><surname>Refsdal</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Laparoscopic sterilization under local or general anesthesia?
