AIS may change the respiratory dynamics and the performance of inspiratory and expiratory muscles, affecting ventilatory capacity. </p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Patients with AIS aged 10 to 20 years old were randomly assigned to receive an aerobic exercise-training program or no treatment. They were evaluated for respiratory muscle strength before and after the treatment period by means of manovacuometry, thorax and spine radiographs. Physical therapy exercising protocol comprised three weekly sessions including stretching and aerobic exercises during four months. </p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p> Forty five patients received physical therapy and 45 patients received no treatment (control group). The mean maximum inspiratory pressure (Pi<sub>max</sub>) was -52.13 cm H<sub>2</sub>0 and the maximum expiratory pressure (Pe<sub>max</sub>) was 62.38 cm H<sub>2</sub>0. There was a significant increase of Pi<sub>max</sub> and Pe<sub>max</sub> (p=0,000) in the group receiving physical therapy. There were no drop-outs and no adverse events in this study. Respiratory muscle strength, scoliosis and kyphosis degrees were not statistically correlated. </p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p> Exercising is beneficial to patients with AIS, who have shown significant increases in respiratory muscle strength after physical therapy. There was no correlation between respiratory pressure and spine deformity.

These findings are corroborated by the present work, in which the strength measurements are not correlated with the angular value of the spinal deformity.

Similarly, the increase of inspiratory muscle strength is probably related to a higher residual ability to support metabolic and ventilatory demands of physical training.<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
