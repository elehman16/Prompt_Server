Effective pharmacological approaches need to target alterations in the nociceptive system that are responsible for pain and disability. Extensive animal research has demonstrated that pain conditions are associated with plastic changes of the central nervous system that alter the processing of the somatosensory and nociceptive input <xref rid="pone.0043896-Woolf1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. These changes result in reduced pain thresholds to sensory stimuli, enhanced pain after supra-threshold stimulation and enlargement of the areas of local and referred pain. All these manifestations have been consistently detected in human chronic pain <xref rid="pone.0043896-Curatolo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref> and are likely to be highly relevant in terms of amplification of pain and disability. Thus, pharmacological targeting of neuroplastic changes is one important aim of translational pain research.</p><p>A relevant aspect of neuroplastic changes in inflammatory and neuropathic conditions is the reduction in inhibitory glycinergic and GABAergic control of dorsal horn neurons: a reduction in the GABA<sub>A</sub> -mediated endogenous inhibitory control within the central nervous system leads to exaggerated pain and hyperalgesia <xref rid="pone.0043896-Zeilhofer1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Potentiation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-mediated synaptic inhibition by benzodiazepines reverses pathologically increased pain sensitivity in animal studies <xref rid="pone.0043896-Knabl1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043896-Reichl1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Subtype-selective compounds targeting the alpha2 and/or alpha3 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor produce antihyperalgesia in mice and rats without sedation and without tolerance induction <xref rid="pone.0043896-Knabl2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. These findings open new perspectives for a more selective targeting of pain pathways with GABAergic drugs.</p><p>Benzodiazepines produce anti-hyperalgesia in animal models by acting as agonists at the benzodiazepine-binding site of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor <xref rid="pone.0043896-Knabl1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. These compounds can therefore be studied to explore the potential usefulness of GABA-agonism in human pain conditions. To date, little is known on the effects of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor targeting drugs on nociceptive processes in humans. A review on the efficacy of non-opioid analgesics in human experimental pain models did not include these drugs <xref rid="pone.0043896-Staahl1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. We are not aware of comprehensive experimental human studies on the efficacy of drugs acting at GABA-receptors. This information is important to evaluate the potential clinical usefulness of these compounds in pain management and to guide future research.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of two agonists at the benzodiazepine-binding site of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (shortly named as benzodiazepines) on different mechanisms of pain processing, using a multimodal experimental testing procedure in healthy volunteers. Clonazepam was studied because it is probably the most commonly prescribed benzodiazepine in chronic pain management. Clobazam is another benzodiazepine that may cause less sedation than clonazepam <xref rid="pone.0043896-Wildin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043896-vanderMeyden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> and might also have anti-hyperalgesic properties. Clobazam has been therefore selected as test compound, with clonazepam as positive control and tolterodine as active placebo.</p><p>The ultimate aim of the study was to explore the potential usefulness of GABA-agonism for the control of clinical pain, providing guide for future clinical research. The results were positive for a subgroup of experimental pain modalities, supporting further investigation of GABA-agonism in clinical pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol for this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043896.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0043896.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethic statement</title><p>The study was approved by the cantonal ethics committee (No. 152/09), registered in the Clinical Trials Protocol Registration System (NCT01011036), and performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

All subjects were tested in the morning and had been instructed to take a very light breakfast at home. The minimum interval between breakfast and drug intake was 3 h.</p><p>Clobazam (Urbanyl&#x000ae;, Sanofi-Aventis AG, Meyrin, Switzerland) is a benzodiazepine. To our knowledge, it has never been tested for analgesic or antihyperalgesic properties. Unlike 2 mg clonazepam, 20 mg clobazam did not affect significantly cognitive and psychomotor functions, possibly because of its unusual 1&#x02013;5 chemical structure <xref rid="pone.0043896-vanderMeyden1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Clonazepam (Rivotril&#x000ae;, Roche Pharma AG, Reinach, Switzerland) is probably the benzodiazepine most widely used for the treatment of clinical pain, although the evidence behind this practice is weak <xref rid="pone.0043896-Wiffen1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. It was therefore chosen as positive control.</p><p>The doses of clobazam and clonazepam were chosen based on the following considerations. Clonazepam is typically prescribed in chronic neuropathic pain at doses between 0.5 and 1 mg, and 2 mg a day is an average dose for this indication <xref rid="pone.0043896-Hugel1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Typical anticonvulsant starting doses of clonazepam and clobazam are 0.5&#x02013;2 mg and 10&#x02013;20 mg, respectively <xref rid="pone.0043896-Riss1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. A dose of 20 mg of clobazam has been shown to be less sedative than 1 mg of clonazepam and should be equipotent <xref rid="pone.0043896-Wildin1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Therefore these doses have been chosen for the present study.</p><p>Tolterodine (Detrusitol&#x000ae;, Pharmacia Gmbh, Pfizer Group, Berlin, Germany) is an anticholinergic compound <xref rid="pone.0043896-Nilvebrant1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Anticholinergic compounds usually cause some sedation and dry mouth; to our knowledge, they are devoid of analgesic effects. Because of its sedative properties, tolterodine has been chosen as an active placebo in order to keep double blinding.</p><p>Flumazenil (Anexate&#x000ae;, Roche Pharma AG, Reinach, Switzerland) selectively antagonizes or attenuates the effects of benzodiazepines on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors <xref rid="pone.0043896-Whitwam1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. To minimize the risk of seizure, a dose of 0.2 mg iv was chosen.</p><p>The subjects received the study medications in a randomized order. A computer-generated random list was prepared by the hospital pharmacy and was known only by the hospital pharmacy. The drugs were enclosed by the hospital pharmacy in the same type of capsule to assure blinding. The pharmacy delivered the blinded capsules to the investigators, numbered according to the defined randomization order.

Before capsaicin injection, the skin of the forearm was cleaned using an antiseptic wipe and allowed to air dry. The injection site was marked midway between the elbow and the wrist. Using a surgical skin marker, 4 lines were drawn through the injection site, so that they intersected the corners of a regular octagon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0043896-g002">figure 2</xref>). These lines were marked every 0.5 cm from the center to the edges using a predefined grid. This resulted in the creation of triangles radiating from the intersection of the 4 lines outwards.

A white skin elevation appeared during injection ensuring correct injection.</p><p>Static mechanical hyperalgesia was judged to be present when the subjects reported that applying a 512 mN von Frey Hair, 5 and 30 minutes after capsaicin injection, elicited pain with an intensity of at least 4 using a numerical rating scale (NRS, whereby 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no pain and 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;worst pain). Only these subjects were included in the study. In order to document pain induction, the subject recorded pain intensity at injection and 5 minutes post-injection using a 10 cm visual analogue pain scale (VAS), whereby 0&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;no pain and 10&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;worst pain imaginable.</p><p>The area of secondary hyperalgesia was assessed using a calibrated 512 mN von Frey hair. The punctuated probe was moved along the 8 radial lines defined above, starting approximately 6 cm away from the site of injection, at each mark in steps of 0.5 cm. The weighted von Frey hair was placed gently on the skin and the load was applied for 2 seconds. The volunteers were asked to report when the pricking sensation changed to a pain sensation. At least 4 seconds elapsed between consecutive stimuli. This procedure was repeated for each vector. The number corresponding to the marker at which sensation changes as described above was noted and the individual numbers were used to calculate the area of hyperalgesia.</p><p>The area of dynamic mechanical hyperalgesia was determined by gently stroking a hand-held cotton wool tip on a 1 cm strip of the skin, at a rate of approximately 1 cm/s. Subjects were asked to report when the sensation changed from a non-painful to a painful sensation. The borders of dynamic hyperalgesia were delineated similarly to the determination of static hyperalgesia.</p><p>Additionally, mechanical pain sensitivity was assessed using a set of seven weighted pinprick stimuli to obtain a stimulus-response function. The test was applied 1 cm inside the outer border of the pinprick hyperalgesic area, using a set of 7 graded von Frey hair mechanical stimulators with fixed stimulus intensities (custom-made at Aalborg University, Denmark). The flat contact area of the stimulators has a 0.2 mm diameter, and the 7 stimulators exert forces of 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 mN. The order of stimulation was defined randomly by computer. The stimulators were applied at a rate of 2 s on/2 s off. Subjects were asked to give a pain rating for each stimulus on a 10 cm VAS. Two assessments for each stimulation were made and the mean of these 2 measurements was used for the data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f4"><title>Pressure stimulation</title><p>Pain detection and tolerance thresholds were measured with an electronic pressure algometer (Somedic, H&#x000f6;rby, Sweden) applied at the center of the pulp of the 2<sup>nd</sup> toe. The probe had a surface area of 1 cm<sup>2</sup>. The pressure was increased from 0 at a rate of 30 kPa/s to a maximum pressure of 1200 kPa. Pain detection threshold was defined as the point at which the pressure sensation turned to pain. Pain tolerance threshold was defined as the point at which the subject felt the pain as intolerable. If the threshold was not reached at 1200 kPa, this value was considered as threshold. Three assessments were made and the mean of these 3 measurements were used for the data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2f5"><title>Conditioned pain modulation (CPM)</title><p>This method explores the endogenous modulation of nociceptive input.

The subjects were asked to keep the hand in the water until they felt an intolerable sensation of pain and were forced to remove the hand from the container, with a maximum time of 2 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2f7"><title>Pressure stimulation after cold pressor test</title><p>Pressure pain detection threshold was measured again at the same time as the subject was withdrawing the hand from the water (one single measurement).

For pharmacokinetics, blood samples (6 ml) were collected in heparinized tubes at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 4 and 24 hours after drug administration. A specific LC-MS/MS assay was developed and validated in the laboratory of the Division of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology of the Geneva University Hospital.</p><p>The pharmacogenetic investigation was made in order to control for this factor in case of outlier concentrations of clobazam. It took place 1&#x02013;4 weeks before the first testing session to evaluate the metabolic activity of cytocrhome P-450 involved in clobazam metabolization.</p><p>Phenotype: in vivo activities of 2C19 and 3A4/5 was assessed using micro-doses of omeprazole 2 mg (2C19) and midazolam 0.1 mg (CYP3A4/5), both administered orally at the same time. Two hours after the drugs intake, 2 venous blood samples (6 ml) were collected into heparinized tubes and centrifuged. According to a standardized protocol, the phenotype was determined by calculating the metabolic ratio between deconjugated midazolam and its metabolite 1&#x02032;-OH-midazolam for CYP3A4 and the ratio of omeprazole and its metabolite OH-omeprazole for CYP2C19 2 h after the drug intake.</p><p>Genotype: DNA extracted from blood samples was used for genotype determination.

The following minor deviations from the study protocol were made.</p><p>The body side to which the pain tests were applied was not selected by randomization, as originally planned; we decided to perform most tests on the dominant side in order to place the volunteer with the tested side close to the devices; see section 2.6, &#x0201c;general methodological aspects&#x0201d;.</p><p>The skin temperature before application of capsaicin was measured, but not recorded; since the skin temperature in the range of 32&#x000b0;C+/&#x02212;1 was a condition for performing the experiment and no analysis on this parameter was planed, we did not record the individual temperatures; see section 2.6, &#x0201c;intradermal capsaicin&#x0201d;.</p><p>For the cold pressor test, we renounced to record the pain intensity continuously using an electronic VAS, because this measurement was not an outcome and in order to simplify the experiment.</p><p>The recordings of the DSST test were limited to 120 min and after flumazenil, in order to simplify the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The primary variable was the area of static hyperalgesia induced by capsaicin injection. The additional measures were secondary variables. No data on the drugs under investigations were available. In a previous study that employed the capsaicin model, pregabalin caused a reduction in the area of hyperalgesia of 10.91 cm<sup>2</sup>, with a standard deviation of 11.54 <xref rid="pone.0043896-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. This results in a sample size of 11, adopting a 5% level for statistical significance and an 80% power, two-sided. In a conservative prediction of the effects of the drug that we investigated, we planned to study 16 subjects.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The main analysis was a two-way repeated measures ANOVA (SigmaStat 3.5, Systat Software Inc, Chicago, Il, USA), with medication and time as factors of repetition. Non normally distributed data were rank transformed before performing the ANOVA. The analysis tested primarily for the interaction of drug with time (timepoint of the measurements). In case of no significant interaction, we tested the overall effects of the &#x0201c;factors&#x0201d; drug and time. In models with significant interactions, the main effects of the factors drug and time are not interpretable and are therefore not presented. Pairwise comparisons were performed by the Holm-Sidak method.</p><p>Because of the high variability of the plasma levels of clobazam (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">results</xref>), a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling was not feasible. Since the time at which clobazam reached the peak plasma concentration was very variable across subjects, we assumed that its effect might be better detected by considering only the highest drug effect before administration of flumazenil (referred to as &#x0201c;peak value analysis&#x0201d;). We therefore performed a repeated-measure ANOVA by considering as value after medication only the highest drug effect before administration of flumazenil (referred to as &#x0201c;peak value analysis&#x0201d;). This was done for all three drug sessions, in order to keep an unbiased placebo control. For threshold measurements, the peak was the highest value, reflecting the maximum analgesic effect; conversely, for area of hyperalgesia and VAS assessments, the peak analgesic effect corresponded to the lowest value of these parameters.</p><p>Finally, we also assumed that including subjects with delayed peak plasma level of clobazam or too low plasma levels during the phase of testing may prevent the detection of drug effects. We therefore repeated the ANOVA analyses after exclusion of subjects with clobazam plasma peaks beyond 2 h after study medication and plasma concentrations lower than 200 &#x000b5;g/ml during the same period (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;8) (referred to as &#x0201c;subgroup analysis&#x0201d;). The limit of 200 &#x000b5;g/ml was chosen because this is the described mean peak concentration after an oral dose of 10 mg <xref rid="pone.0043896-Pullar1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>.</p><p>A p-value&#x0003c;0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

In all participants capsaicin elicited pain with an intensity of at least 4 (NRS scale). One of these volunteers was excluded from the analysis because his area of hyperalgesia after capsaicin injection was larger than the vectors drawn on the skin, rendering the measure of the primary endpoint impossible.

Pharmacogenetic do not explain this variability, since all except one subject were CYP 2C19 extensive metabolizers. The reason for this variability is probably related to delayed absorption. All subjects were tested in the morning and had been instructed to take a very light breakfast at home. Considering the transfer time to the research unit and the additional 2-hours time before drug administration (interview, instruction, training of tests), it is unlikely that our healthy subjects had still some gastric content at the time of drug intake.

Thus, a conclusive answer to this question cannot be given. However, in the context of experimental work in rodents and humans, this partial result is not surprising. Failure to detect efficacy with part of the experimental pain modalities is a common finding also with drugs characterized by established clinical efficacy <xref rid="pone.0043896-Staahl1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043896-Staahl2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.

Drugs probably affect these dimensions differentially, leading to different sensitivities of pain models to the analgesic effect of drugs.</p><p>We cannot rule out that part of the results were positive by chance. However, some arguments are suggestive for a true anti-hyperalgesic and analgesic effect of the drugs investigated. For the primary endpoint, a significant result was obtained with the main analysis on the interaction of drug with time. The result on the primary endpoint is consistent with the findings of basic research. A further argument is the pattern of response that emerges by a collective analysis of the secondary endpoints, as summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0043896-t004">table 4</xref>. None of the pressure pain modalities revealed an effect of clobazam and clonazepam; none of the tests that employed von Frey hair stimulation detected any effect; and none of the cutaneous electrical pain tests yielded any significant result. Conversely, all the three intramuscular pain tests were able to detect analgesic effects of the benzodiazepines. These effects were consistent with the findings obtained with cuff algometry, a model that probably acts, at least in part, by nociceptive stimulation of the muscles. Because of this cluster pattern, it is unlikely that the significant effects that were detected are the result of chance. Rather, they confirm the finding of the aforementioned study, which found responses to different stimulation modalities to represent distinct dimensions of pain perception <xref rid="pone.0043896-Neziri1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Such dimensions seem to be affected differently by analgesic drugs.</p><p>Accordingly, our study provides information for future investigations that will analyze the effect of benzodiazepines. The data indicate that models of deep pain and hyperalgesia are probably most suited.</p><p>There was no difference between clobazam and clonazepam regarding the effect on the primary endpoint, i.e. the area of static hyperalgesia. However, clonazepam was associated with stronger impairment of psychomotor performance. This suggests that clobazam may offer potential advantages in the clinical management of pain; further clinical investigations on this compound would be desirable.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Conclusions and perspectives</title><p>The present study provides some evidence for an anti-hyperalgesic and analgesic action of agonists at the benzodiazepine-binding site of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. The results are not conclusive, since positive findings were obtained with part of the analyses. Furthermore, the clinical significance of the possible effects of the specific drugs investigated is questionable. Nevertheless, the data support further research in the field of GABA-modulation. GABA-agonists that selectively act at subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub>-receptors produce potent antihyperalgesia in animal models, in the absence of sedation <xref rid="pone.0043896-Knabl2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043896-DiLio1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043896-Zeilhofer2" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. Some subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor modulators were investigated in clinical studies for the treatment of anxiety <xref rid="pone.0043896-Rudolph1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0043896-deHaas1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Analgesic or antihyperalgesic actions of these selective compounds have not been tested in humans. The perspective holds that, due to the minimally sedating properties of these selective drugs, doses higher than for unselective compounds might be used: the consequent higher receptor occupancy could lead to significant anti-hyperalgesic or analgesic effects in clinical pain conditions. Finally, the results of the present study provide information on which models have to be selected for future investigations: methods that induce hyperalgesia and deep pain may be most promising for detecting the effects of GABA<sub>A</sub>-agonists.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0043896.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>
