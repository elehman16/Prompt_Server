Diabetic and posttraumatic cataracts were excluded from the study. The nuclei were immersed immediately in balanced salt solution and shaken to remove the adherent residual cortex. The nuclei were then placed over a grid, illuminated from below, and photographed. Parameters such as illumination, distance of the camera from the nucleus, magnification, and ISO were standardized for obtaining the images.</p><p>Lanosterol 25 mM was prepared by adding double distilled H<sub>2</sub>O to a mixture of 12.5 g lanosterol (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Japan) 1.1 g (EDTA)<sub>2</sub> Na, 0.55 g alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, and 200 ml EtOH to a final volume of 1.1 l. Control solution was prepared similarly but by excluding lanosterol. It was noted that lanosterol was only partially soluble in the above-mentioned solution; similar to experience of the original authors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>By random selection, 20 nuclei were immersed in 25 mM of lanosterol solution, and the rest in the control solution without lanosterol and stored in dark for 6 days.

However, we were unable to replicate the results of Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. in our study using human cataractous nuclei. Lenticular opacification progressed in 90% nuclei in the lanosterol group and in 70% of the control group. The grade of opacification after 6 days of incubation was also not significantly different between the two groups. One of the observers felt that one nucleus appeared less opaque, but this was not supported by the other observer and is too weak a link to rely upon [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>(a) Pre- and (b) post-incubation images of the lanosterol incubated nucleus graded as regression of lenticular opacity by one observer</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJO-63-888-g007"/></fig><p>It is unlikely that the deviation in our experimental technique of not using whole lenses but the nucleus be the reason we were unable to replicate the results of the study by Zhao <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. have shown that lanosterol acts by reversing the protein aggregation within the lens fibers.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] As we used only nuclei, lanosterol would have better access to the lens fibers with no capsule or cortex to act as a barrier and hence should have resulted in clearer lenses in contrast to our finding of the progression of opacification.</p><p>Given that we replicated the methods described by Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. with the exception of replacing animal lenses with human nuclei, one can only postulate that lanosterol in the given concentration described by Zhao <italic>et al</italic>. is inappropriate for reversing protein aggregation in the nuclei of human lenses. Human cataractous lens is likely to be tougher than rabbit and dog lenses and hence, the concentration of lanosterol used by us may have been inadequate to reverse the cataract in senile human lenses. However, we found no difference in the progression of cataract between the control and lanosterol-treated lenses. It is also possible that proteins other than lanosterol play a role in senile human lenses, given that the earlier study was done in a family with congenital cataract. The differences in the molecular pathways of congenital and senile cataracts have been elucidated by Hejtmancik <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Multiple authors have shown that congenital cataracts are usually secondary to accumulation of altered protein residues due to missense mutations and ferritin levels in specific cases. They have also indicted age-related imbalance of chaperones and accumulation of degraded and denatured normal proteins in senile cataract.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Further, basic science research will provide us more distinction between the two pathologies.</p><p>It also remains to be seen if immersion of intact lenses with the capsule or altering lanosterol concentration or the solute may result in positive outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Twenty-five mM lanosterol solution failed to reverse nuclear opacity of human
