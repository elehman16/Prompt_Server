Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus is a potentially pre-cancerous condition, affecting 375,000 people in the UK. Patients receive a 2-yearly endoscopy to detect cancerous changes, as early detection and treatment results in better outcomes. Current treatment requires random mapping biopsies along the length of Barrett&#x02019;s, in addition to biopsy of visible abnormalities. As only 13&#x0200a;% of pre-cancerous changes appear as visible nodules or abnormalities, areas of dysplasia are often missed. Acetic acid chromoendoscopy (AAC) has been shown to improve detection of pre-cancerous and cancerous tissue in observational studies, but no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to date.
</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods&#x02002;</title><p>
A &#x0201c;tandem&#x0201d; endoscopy cross-over design. Participants will be randomized to endoscopy using mapping biopsies or AAC, in which dilute acetic acid is sprayed onto the surface of the esophagus, highlighting tissue through an whitening reaction and enhancing visibility of areas with cellular changes for biopsy. After 4 to 10 weeks, participants will undergo a repeat endoscopy, using the second method. Rates of recruitment and retention will be assessed, in addition to the estimated dysplasia detection rate, effectiveness of the endoscopist training program, and rates of adverse events (AEs). Qualitative interviews will explore participant and endoscopist acceptability of study design and delivery, and the acceptability of switching endoscopic techniques for Barrett's surveillance.
</p></sec><sec><title>Results&#x02002;</title><p>
Endoscopists&#x02019; ability to diagnose dysplasia in Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus can be improved. AAC may offer a simple, universally applicable, easily-acquired technique to improve detection, affording patients earlier diagnosis and treatment, reducing endoscopy time and pathology costs. The ABBA study will determine whether a crossover &#x0201c;tandem&#x0201d; endoscopy design is feasible and acceptable to patients and clinicians and gather outcome data to power a definitive trial.

Barrett&#x02019;s esophagus (BO) is a change in the cells of esophageal tissue and a precursor to esophageal cancer. BO carries a risk of cancer 30 to 150 times greater than that for an age-matched population without BO, and affects 375,000 people in the UK
<xref rid="JR808-1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="OR808-2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
. Esophageal cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the UK and carries a poor 5-year survival rate of &#x0003c;&#x0200a;5&#x0200a;%
<xref rid="OR808-3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="OR808-4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
. Current guidelines recommend regular surveillance (between 2&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;5 years according to length of Barrett&#x02019;s) to detect and remove early dysplasia,
<xref rid="JR808-5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
as patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer within a surveillance program have earlier-stage disease and longer survival times
<xref rid="JR808-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="JR808-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
.
</p><p>
The current gold-standard technique for detecting dysplasia in surveillance programs involves quadrantic esophageal biopsies every 2&#x0200a;cm during endoscopy (Seattle protocol). This is necessary as only 13&#x0200a;% of dysplastic changes appear as visible nodules
<xref rid="JR808-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
. However, up to 40&#x0200a;% of early cancers are missed, as despite multiple biopsies, only a small proportion of the total surface area of the esophagus is sampled
<xref rid="JR808-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
. In practice, only 50&#x0200a;% of surveillance endoscopies are estimated to adhere to this method as it is laborious and time-consuming, poorly tolerated by patients, and expensive to process biopsies
<xref rid="JR808-10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>
. Research to improve surveillance effectiveness and test performance has been recognized as a priority
<xref rid="JR808-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
.
</p><p>
Currently, the key limitation to Barrett&#x02019;s surveillance is the macroscopic invisibility of Barrett&#x02019;s dysplasia. Methods proposed to enhance dysplasia visibility, thus permitting targeted biopsies, include dye sprays,
<xref rid="JR808-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>
<xref rid="JR808-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="JR808-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
electronic image intensifiers built into the endoscope namely: narrow band Imaging,
<xref rid="JR808-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
Fujinon intelligent color enhancement
<xref rid="JR808-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
and autofluorescence imaging
<xref rid="JR808-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>
. However, evidence focuses on high-risk populations where dysplasia has already been identified, or in the follow-up of patients treated endoscopically for dysplasia. It is lacking in a surveillance population, where dysplasia prevalence is significantly lower.
</p><p>
When sprayed on Barrett&#x02019;s mucosa, acetic acid (AA) highlights specific surface patterns
including dysplasia and cancer, which can be readily recognized by the trained endoscopist
<xref rid="JR808-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>
. After application of AA, dysplastic tissue appears red against the surrounding Barrett&#x02019;s making it easily visible (
<xref rid="FI808-1" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x0200a;1</xref>
)
<xref rid="JR808-19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
. This process is reversible, causes no damage to tissues and can be repeated. Two large cohort studies have demonstrated the efficacy of AA for detection of Barrett&#x02019;s dysplasia in a high-risk population, reporting sensitivities of 90&#x0200a;% to 95&#x0200a;% and specificities of 75&#x0200a;% to 85&#x0200a;%
<xref rid="JR808-20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>
<xref rid="JR808-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>
. Further research suggested that the number of biopsies could be substantially reduced using AA-targeted biopsies instead of quadrantic biopsies, reducing pathology costs by 97&#x0200a;%
<xref rid="JR808-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
. A recent retrospective study suggested that the AA method may detect more dysplasia than protocol-guided biopsies in a Barrett&#x02019;s surveillance population; 4.3&#x0200a;% vs 1.4&#x0200a;%, however, that study had a number of limitations in that it did not control for endoscopist, was retrospective and liable to confounding

However, prior to a definitive study, a feasibility study is required to establish whether a cross-over design involving 2 endoscopies per participant is acceptable, by assessing recruitment and retention rates and exploration through qualitative interviews.

<uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://www.sealedenvelope.com">https://www.sealedenvelope.com</uri>
will be used. Patients will be unable to detect whether acetic acid had been used and thus will be blinded to the procedure method. The endoscopist will be blinded to the histological results of the previous endoscopy for an individual participant. It will not be possible to blind the histopathologist
as the Seattle protocol produces a greater number of biopsies for processing.
</p></sec><sec><title>Study intervention</title><p>Study participants will receive an endoscopy using both methods, at an interval of 4 to 10 weeks, with the initial endoscopy method determined by randomization allocation. The endoscopies will be performed with high-definition processors (Olympus Lucera Elite or Spectrum and Pentax EPKi7000) and high-definition gastroscopes (Olympus HQ290 or H260 and Pentax i10 series) without use of electronic chromoendoscopy or alternative dye sprays.

Following the interview, brief field notes will be taken to record any immediate reflections and emerging themes.</p><p>Endoscopist participants: At least 8 endoscopists who had participated in delivering the ABBA trial will be recruited to take part in telephone interviews at the completion of the trial. Topics for the interview include concerns regarding the procedure prior to training, experience of training, perception of usefulness and suitability of the AA technique and feasibility study methods for the definitive trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Participants will be identified by a unique number in the database and audio recordings. Audio recordings will be transcribed and entered into NVivo 10 (QSR International, Melbourne, Australia).</p><p>Data will be analyzed through a process of thematic analysis using the Framework approach. Categories will be independently coded by 2 researchers, and a member of the steering group will read a sample of transcripts to generate a preliminary framework without knowledge of the original researchers&#x02019; list. In case of disagreement, a solution will be sought to clarify the meaning of a code/theme developed. A deductive approach to map themes from the 2 groups of participants (patients and endoscopists) will enable us to compare and contrast similarities and differences of attitudes, perceptions and experience.</p></sec><sec><title>Public patient involvement</title><p>Patients, carers and the public from Heartburn Cancer UK and the University of Portsmouth School of Health Sciences and Social Work ENGAGE group were involved
in the grant application, study design including interview schedules, and will be involved in study delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>Favorable ethical approval for this study was given by the National Research Ethics Service (NRES) Committee, South Central&#x0200a;&#x02013;&#x0200a;Berkshire, reference 15/SC/0085.</p><p>Because the study involves 2 endoscopies, participants will be exposed to the risk of experiencing endoscopy-related AEs twice. However, the overall risk of such events is very small, and the benefit:risk of having 2 methods of detecting potential dysplasia may outweigh the small increased risk of AEs. Secondly, there is a delay of a maximum of 6 weeks for histology to become available due to the requirement for blinding of the second endoscopy. However, in the case that cancer is detected during either endoscopy, samples will be prioritized, immediate referral for treatment made, and the participant withdrawn so as not to delay treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>The ABBA study is funded by National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research for Patient Benefit (RFPB) program (Project Number PB-PG-1013-32045).</p></sec><sec><title>Dissemination</title><p>The results of this feasibility study will be disseminated to all groups who are able to offer input and suggestions for further work, i.&#x0200a;e. patients with Barrett&#x02019;s and patient support groups, gastroenterologists, pathologists, and those involved in managing the workflow for the Barrett&#x02019;s surveillance program within the British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ABBA feasibility study is the first randomized cross-over trial exploring the use of acetic acid chromoendoscopy (AAC) in a Barrett&#x02019;s surveillance population. It has been designed to provide comprehensive quantitative and qualitative data to inform and power a definitive, multicenter RCT. It will clarify whether a crossover tandem endoscopy design is a feasible approach for this study for patients and endoscopists, or whether a larger trial would require a parallel design.</p><p>
When introducing any new technique into mainstream clinical practice it is vital that we understand how to train clinicians to perform the technique safely. This has been lacking in the introduction of other endoscopic techniques, e.&#x0200a;g. indigocarmine chromoendoscopy in ulcerative colitis surveillance or colonic polyp in vivo diagnosis, where efficacy has been demonstrated by experts, but with no consideration of how to train all practicing endoscopists on the technique
<xref rid="JR808-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>
<xref rid="JR808-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
. Evidence from in vivo diagnosis studies of colonic polyps showed results obtained in expert hands can be very different to those obtained in a general hospital,
<xref rid="JR808-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
and therefore development and assessment of appropriate training is a key element of this study. This activity also promotes cross-working of endoscopists across units, and enables up-skilling as well as skill-sharing which will benefit endoscopists normal practice. It also grows and strengthens the existing network of clinicians with an interest in Barrett&#x02019;s research, and contributes to timely delivery of trials in this area, to maximise patient benefit.
</p><p>The use of qualitative methods to examine patient and clinician barriers and facilitators to the adoption of AAC is essential to inform future pathways to implementation. Health care should be patient-centered. If a change in practice is to be recommended, it is important we understand the best way of making these changes, and the best way of presenting information on new techniques to patients to reduce potential anxiety and to reassure patients that they are still receiving the best care.</p><p>Finally, we would like to highlight the essential role of the Public Patient contributors in providing feedback throughout study development and delivery, and working within the research team to ensure the patient-facing aspects of the study are kept pragmatic and appropriate for patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would especially like to thank our patient representatives, Mrs. Mimi McCord and members of the University of Portsmouth School of Health Sciences and Social Work ENGAGE group (Nigel Churchill, Debbie Ridley, Sue Baddeley, Mary Coppins-Brown) for their contributions to the development of the trial and for providing their ongoing enthusiastic support.
