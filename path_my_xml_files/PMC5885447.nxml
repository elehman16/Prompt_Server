Several adjuvants such as opioids and alpha-2 agonists added to intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine (0.5%) have been shown to prolong sensory and motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] An alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist such as clonidine administered intrathecally, intravenously, or orally is known to prolong the effect of spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] In addition, lack of respiratory depression makes dexmedetomidine, a suitable adjunct in various clinical situations. Intravenous dexmedetomidine has also been shown to decrease anesthetic requirements during general anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Low-dose intravenous dexmedetomidine prolongs motor and sensory blockade during spinal anesthesia without undesirable side effects.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 agonist with relatively high &#x003b1;2/&#x003b1;1 activity (1620:1) as compared to clonidine (220:1).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The elimination half-life is 2&#x02013;3 h. It acts on presynaptic alpha-2 receptors situated in locus coeruleus in the brain stem bringing about sedative and analgesic effects. Postsynaptic activation in the central nervous system inhibits sympathetic activity, resulting in decrease in heart rate and blood pressure. In addition, dexmedetomidine infusion may result in increased activation of alpha-2 receptors at the spinal cord, resulting in inhibition of nociceptive impulse transmission.</p><p>Sedative, amnestic, and analgesic properties of small-dose dexmedetomidine infusions were studied by Hall <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Both small and moderate doses of dexmedetomidine produce significant sedation. This sedation is easily reversible by verbal or physical stimuli. Once aroused, the individuals are able to perform various tasks that include verbal, motor, and cognitive domains.</p><p>Whizar-Lugo <italic>et al</italic>. administered intravenous dexmedetomidine or intravenous clonidine to prolong spinal anesthesia produced by 15 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine in patients undergoing open abdominal hysterectomy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Patients in the dexmedetomidine group received 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine started 20 min after spinal anesthesia and administered over 20 min followed by 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h until the end of the surgical procedure while those in the clonidine group received 4 &#x003bc;g/kg of clonidine as an infusion over 20 min starting 20 min after the spinal block. Sensory and motor blockades were significantly prolonged in both the dexmedetomidine and clonidine groups.</p><p>The effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine on duration of spinal anesthesia using 4 mL of 2% prilocaine was studied by Tekin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Patients who received a loading dose of dexmedetomidine 1 &#x003bc;g/kg within 10 min of spinal anesthesia followed by a maintenance dose of 0.4 &#x003bc;g/kg/h for 50 min showed significant prolongation of sensory as well as motor blockade. A similar study by Al-Mustafa <italic>et al</italic>. showed that intravenous dexmedetomidine given following spinal anesthesia prolongs sensory and motor blockade.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Patients receiving intravenous dexmedetomidine had a Ramsay sedation score that ranged between 2 and 5 (on a scale of 1&#x02013;6).</p><p>Intravenous dexmedetomidine was found in several studies to prolong sensory and motor blockade produced by spinal anesthesia using either bupivacaine or ropivacaine.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Similar findings were reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Abdallah <italic>et al</italic>. that included 364 patients from 7 intermediate to high-quality randomized controlled trials.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Another meta-analysis that included 412 patients from 8 trials looked at the effects of intravenous and intrathecal dexmedetomidine on spinal anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The reviewers concluded that both intravenous and intrathecal dexmedetomidine produced significant prolongation of the duration of sensory and motor blockade following spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Current evidence in literature supports the use of intravenous (as well as intrathecal) dexmedetomidine for producing a significant prolongation of the sensory and motor blockade following spinal anesthesia. We wanted to investigate the influence of administering a calculated dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine intravenously either as a bolus (1 &#x003bc;g/kg) or as a bolus-plus-infusion (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg each) on the sensorimotor effects following subarachnoid anesthesia with 12.5 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine. We also wanted to determine whether administering the same dose of dexmedetomidine in two regimes (bolus vs. bolus-plus-infusion) would alter the adverse effect profile.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p>Following approval from the Institutional Ethics Committee, 75 consenting adults aged between 18 and 65 years belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status (ASA-PS) 1 or 2 scheduled to undergo elective infraumbilical or lower limb surgery in the supine position under subarachnoid anesthesia were enrolled into this prospective, randomized, double-blind study. A detailed preoperative evaluation was performed on the day before surgery, and standard fasting orders advised.</p><p>While one of the two anesthesiologists not involved in collecting the data picked the lot and prepared the solutions to be administered intravenously, another anesthesiologist who was blinded to the study drug administered performed subarachnoid block and recorded the sensorimotor effects of spinal anesthesia. Patients were randomly allocated into one of the three groups using a computer-generated random number table. Patients in bupivacaine group (Group B) received 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl intravenously over 10 min followed by another 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl over next 60 min. Patients in bupivacaine-dexmedetomidine bolus (BDexB) group received 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl containing 1 &#x003bc;g/kg of dexmedetomidine (rounded to nearest 10 micrograms) intravenously over 10 min followed by 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl over next 60 min. Patients in bupivacaine-dexmedetomidine bolus-plus-infusion (BDexBI) group received intravenous dexmedetomidine in a total dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg (rounded to nearest 10 micrograms). Half of this dose (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) diluted in 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl was administered over the first 10 min, followed by the remaining half dose (0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg) diluted in 20 mL of 0.9% NaCl over the next 60 min. Intrathecal bupivacaine (2.5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine heavy) was administered in all three groups at L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> or L<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>5</sub> interspace using a 25 standard wire gauge Quincke-Babcock spinal needle at the end of the first 10 min when delivery of &#x0201c;test drug infusion&#x0201d; was complete.</p><p>On arrival in the operating room, standard monitors including 5-electrode electrocardiogram monitoring Lead II and V<sub>5</sub>, noninvasive blood pressure, and pulse oximetry were established and baseline vitals recorded. Intravenous access was secured in the nondominant hand, and an infusion of Ringer lactate was started at 100 mL/h. Hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine (12.5 mg) was injected at L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> or L<sub>4</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>5</sub> interspace after confirming free flow of clear cerebrospinal fluid. The time of intrathecal drug injection was noted as time &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; and the patient turned supine.</p><p>Onset of sensory blockade at T<sub>10</sub> was noted. In addition, 2-segment regression time (defined as recovery of sensory block by two segments from the highest sensory level achieved in that patient) and sensory recovery (defined as recovery at S<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;S<sub>4</sub> dermatomes) were also noted. Motor blockade was periodically assessed till a modified Bromage score of 3 (inability to flex hip, knee, and ankle) was obtained. This time was denoted as onset of motor blockade. Attainment of a modified Bromage score of 0 (ability to flex hip, knee, and ankle) was noted to herald recovery from motor blockade.</p><p>Sedation score was noted on a 6-point Ramsay sedation score as also blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, and pruritus were noted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>After collecting the data for 30 patients (10 in each group) in Phase I of the study, we did an interim statistical analysis. Aiming for a power of study of 80% to detect at least 60 min difference in duration of analgesia (sensory recovery), the sample size required was 23 patients in each group. The sample size was determined using ANOVA. We included 25 patients in each group for better validation of results. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS for Windows Version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA. Onset of sensory and motor blockade was analyzed by nonparametric test while recovery characteristics were analyzed using ANOVA.

While bradycardia and arterial desaturation occurred more frequently in patients receiving intravenous dexmedetomidine, they were easily treatable. Hypotension occurred more often in the patients receiving only spinal anesthesia (and no intravenous dexmedetomidine). Review of the sensory level achieved in individual patients in the three groups showed that the number of patients in whom the level of sensory block was between T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>6</sub> was comparable in all three groups (3 each in group bupivacaine or group BDexB and 4 in group BDexBI). The number of patients in whom the level of sensory block was between T<sub>8</sub> and T<sub>12</sub> was likewise comparable in all three groups (22 each in group bupivacaine or group BDexB and 21 in group BDexBI). As the level of sensory block was comparable in all the three groups in our study, we believe that the higher incidence of hypotension in our patients who received only spinal anesthesia with bupivacaine (without any intravenous dexmedetomidine) was a chance occurrence.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Adverse effects following intravenous dexmedetomidine and subarachnoid anesthesia</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOACP-34-46-g003"/></table-wrap><p>Nausea was noted only in one patient (control group).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>Discussion</title><p>We studied the effect of intravenous dexmedetomidine given either as a bolus or a bolus-plus-infusion on subarachnoid anesthesia with intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine.</p><p>Time for onset of sensory blockade was not significantly altered by the use of dexmedetomidine and was comparable to the previous studies.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, Harsoor <italic>et al</italic>. reported a faster onset of sensory block in dexmedetomidine group compared to control group (129.6 s vs. 66 s).[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The mean time for 2-segment regression of sensory blockade was significantly prolonged in our study which is in agreement with other studies.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Onset of motor blockade was also found to be comparable in all three groups.
