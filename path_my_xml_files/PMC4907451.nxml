The WHO recently approved two plastic ring devices, one of which is increasingly used in HIV prevention programs.[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] While these devices require no sutures and have few significant adverse events, the major drawback is they remain on the penis for one week, resulting in necrosis at the base of the foreskin; consequently, healing is prolonged and occurs by secondary intention.</p><p>The Unicirc surgical instrument uses an approach fundamentally different from plastic ring devices and functions identically to the Gomco clamp used in early infant circumcision. It is a single-use-only metal and plastic disposable surgical instrument, now in its second version.[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The Unicirc creates circumferential compression of the base of the foreskin, which fuses the mucosal and skin surfaces and eliminates bleeding after the foreskin is excised. The fused skin edges are sealed with cyanoacrylate adhesive to promote healing by primary intention. The procedure does not require injectable anesthetic or sutures.</p><p>The objective of this randomized field trial was to compare the minimally invasive Unicirc technique to conventional open surgical circumcision for important clinical outcomes and adverse events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec012"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was designed and conducted according to the guidelines found in WHO&#x02019;s Framework for Clinical Evaluation of Devices for Adult Male Circumcision[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (Framework).</p><sec id="sec013"><title>Trial design</title><p>This was a single-center non-blinded, parallel randomized controlled trial with 2:1 (Unicirc: Surgical) allocation ratio in balanced blocks of 15.</p><p>The South African Medical Association&#x02019;s Ethics Committee (SAMAREC) approved the study and the informed consent. We obtained written informed consent from each participant. All participants were adults. The procedures took place on four dates between July 15 and August 7, 2015. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier is NCT02443792.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Participants</title><p>Healthy uncircumcised men at least 16 years of age (the age of consent in S. Africa) were eligible for the study. Participants were recruited via posters and word of mouth. Men were recruited from 3 clinics associated with Andrew Saffy Memorial hospital, serving the Lonmin group of platinum mines, situated in Rustenberg, North West, South Africa.</p><p>We excluded volunteers with current illness, bleeding disorder, reaction to local anesthetic, infection, or any penile abnormality potentially complicating circumcision.</p><p>All subjects had an HIV test performed as per hospital policy, and were referred appropriately. No recruited volunteer was excluded because of HIV status and investigators were unaware of HIV status.</p><p>We asked participants to abstain from sexual intercourse for at least 4 weeks after the circumcision and until the wound was completely healed.

Sizing was determined using a disposable sizing plate similar to that used for plastic ring devices. Prior to use, the instruments were gas sterilized in sealed packages. The Unicirc instrument was applied to the glans; the foreskin was then pulled over the transparent bell with the surgeon&#x02019;s fingers and adjusted to ensure adequate removal of foreskin. No surgical instruments were used to position the instrument. The Unicirc was then screwed tightly and left in place for 5 minutes before the foreskin was excised with a surgical scalpel. The Unicirc was removed and the fused skin-mucosal edges were sealed with cyanoacrylate skin adhesive (Derma-Flex QS&#x02122;). Operative time was counted from the time the procedure was begun until the dressing was applied (i.e. including the 5 minute waiting time). There were four different Unicirc diameters used in the study: 2.6 cm, 2.9 cm, 3.2 cm, and 3.5 cm.</p><p>We covered the wound with Hypafix&#x02122; adhesive dressing and absorbent gauze. We instructed participants to keep the wound dry, to leave the gauze in place until it became soiled, and to remove the Hypafix&#x02122; after 3 weeks if it was still in place.</p><p>We observed participants for 30 minutes after the procedure, and gave them written postoperative instructions with cellular telephone contact information of the doctor.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Outcomes</title><sec id="sec019"><title>Primary Outcome Measure</title><p>Intraoperative duration.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Secondary Outcome Measures</title><p>Intraoperative and postoperative pain; adverse events (intraoperative and postoperative); wound disruption, healing at 4 weeks; patient satisfaction; and, cosmetic result.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>Adverse events</title><p>The Framework served as the guideline for evaluating adverse events (AEs). Mild AEs required little or no intervention (e.g. slight bleeding), moderate AEs required active treatment (e.g. antibiotics or suturing), and severe AEs required transfusion or hospitalization, or resulted in permanent damage. Key AEs evaluated were anesthetic complications, bleeding, hematoma, infection, problems with urination, subsequent procedures conducted to correct complications or poor cosmetic results, and occupational exposure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec022"><title>Sample Size</title><p>We based the sample size on the Framework which states: &#x0201c;Studies involving about 100 men (range 50 to 300) are suggested as a compromise between assessing safety, documenting the presumed advantages of the new method, and ensuring rapid progress through the different stages of clinical assessment.

Operative duration was longer than in previous studies,[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] but Unicirc required approximately half the operative time compared to the surgical technique. We believe that the relatively long operative times were the result of the surgical style of the two participating doctors. We expect even greater time-savings as the generalist doctors gain more experience with the Unicirc method. Because the Unicirc operative duration includes 5 minutes of waiting for the tissues to fuse, multiple procedures can be performed simultaneously using the WHO&#x02019;s MOVE model of task-sharing.[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Unicirc requires no surgical instruments other than a scalpel, no injectable anesthetic, and no sutures. The retail cost of a sterile pack for a Unicirc circumcision is US$5 versus US$20 for the surgical pack, Derma-Flex QS US$15.50, and EMLA cream US$4.30 in South Africa. The cost of the Unicirc has not been determined but will likely be similar to plastic ring devices. Men can return to work the next day and do not need to take a day off work for a one-week device removal visit. Because there is never an open wound, Unicirc can be performed as a clean, rather than a sterile, procedure. These factors and the substantial time-savings with Unicirc are likely to substantially reduce overall cost and assist in mass VMMC scale-up. However, a formal economic evaluation is required to quantify the overall cost of the Unicirc method compared to other techniques.</p><p>Adverse events were low with no significant differences between groups. There were 2 intraoperative complications with Unicirc, one related to surgical inattention and one related to faulty packaging by staff. The Unicirc kit is now pre-packaged at the factory to prevent mismatching of parts.</p><p>One Unicirc participant experienced postoperative bleeding which required suture. In the first study with this instrument, there were no postoperative bleeds in 50 subjects;[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] in the second study, postoperative bleeding occurred in 5 (4.5%) subjects.[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] As in the prior studies, there were no hematomas with Unicirc. Because of the small risk of postoperative bleeding, we recommend that sites capable of suturing perform Unicirc circumcisions.</p><p>This study showed superior healing and cosmetic results using the Unicirc method. Absorbable sutures frequently cause small ulcerations at the entry and exit points, which probably accounted for the differences in healing. There were 28% minor wound disruptions following Unicirc (vs. 16% following surgical), but they were not clinically important and did not delay overall healing.</p><p>After numerous paediatric[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and adult[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157065.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0157065.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] studies, there remains no doubt that cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive is superior to sutures in VMMC. We used high viscosity, quick-setting 2-octyl cyanoacrylate, which applied easily and cured quickly. The one clear caveat is that the wound must be kept dry postoperatively; nothing adheres to macerated skin.</p><p>The use of topical anesthetic, coupled with this sutureless technique, will reduce the risk of needlestick injuries and therefore the transmission of blood borne infections.</p><p>This field study was unblinded and was performed at a single center by two doctors. Wound healing was assessed by the doctors themselves and there was no independent assessment. Followup at four weeks was not complete, but we feel that all adverse events were accounted for, since followup at 7 days was complete and almost all VMMC complications occur in the first week. The study was underpowered to evaluate adverse events, but neither this nor prior Unicirc studies have shown elevated adverse event rates compared to other methods.</p><p>Two plastic ring devices have been approved by WHO and are now being used in HIV prevention programs. However, healing is delayed by secondary intention, so these devices do not meet the criterion laid out in WHO&#x02019;s Framework that new devices have &#x0201c;more rapid healing than current methods and/or might entail less risk of HIV transmission in the immediate postoperative period.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Furthermore, the fact that the placement of plastic ring devices is faster than surgical circumcision is misleading, because the necessity for a second visit for device removal nullifies any time advantage. There is direct evidence of HIV shedding from unhealed circumcision wounds in HIV-infected men at 3 weeks, suggesting caution in using plastic ring devices because of delayed healing by secondary intention.[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] It is also likely that increased HIV acquisition may occur among men who have sex with HIV-infected partners prior to complete healing of circumcision wounds. Tetanus is probably more likely to occur with plastic ring devices than other methods due to the presence of necrotic material.[<xref rid="pone.0157065.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec032"><title>Conclusions</title><p>VMMC with Unicirc under topical anesthetic and wound sealing with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive is rapid, heals by primary intention, has superior cosmetic results, and is potentially safer than open surgical VMMC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec033"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157065.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>Sutureless adult voluntary male circumcision with topical anesthetic: a randomized field trial of Unicirc, a single-use surgical instrument.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157065.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0157065.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Sutureless adult voluntary male circumcision with topical anesthetic: a randomized field trial of Unicirc, a single-use surgical instrument.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0157065.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs.
