was to evaluate the effects of therapeutic continuous ultrasound (US) on patients with
rotator cuff disease. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-two patients were treated with a
standard physiotherapy program consisting of a hot-pack, transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation (TENS), exercises, and US that was supervised by the same physiotherapist. The
patients were randomly assigned to either a group that received true US (n=11) or one that
received sham US (n=11). [Results] There were significant differences between the pre- and
post-intervention UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale and Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome scores,
VAS, and external rotation (ER) peak torque 60&#x000b0;/second values for both the true and sham
US groups. However, the between-group differences were not statistically significant.
[Conclusion] In patients with rotator cuff disease, physiotherapy interventions
effectively treat the pain, improve the clinical status, and increase the muscle strength
of the shoulder ER at a low constant angular velocity, with functional improvement being
seen immediately after treatment. However, at the end of the intervention, the US had
yielded no additional efficacy to the physiotherapy treatment regimen of the patients with
rotator cuff disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Rotator cuff disease</kwd><kwd>Therapeutic ultrasound</kwd><kwd>Shoulder rehabilitation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Rotator cuff disease is the most common cause of shoulder pain, particularly among the
middle-aged and elderly. It is the most commonly diagnosed cause of shoulder dysfunction
being the causative factor in 74% of cases of shoulder pain. With increasing age, the
tendons that form the rotator cuff undergo progressive degenerative changes which can lead
to partial or full-thickness tearing of the tendons, resulting in pain, weakness and
dysfunction in the rotator cuff and scapular muscles, tightness in the soft tissues, and
postural abnormalities<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Rotator cuff disease can possibly be treated successfully with conservative management, but
this depends upon the gender of the patient and tear size as well as the degree of
atrophy<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conservative management aims
to control pain, improve patients&#x02019; range of motion (ROM), and enhance the scapulothoracic
rhythm and function. Conservative management also includes patient education and the use of
analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and injections, functional
rehabilitation, and manual therapy along with physiotherapy modalities such as therapeutic
ultrasound (US), which is used to promote healing and regeneration in inflamed tissue,
reduce pain and muscle spasms, and improve ROM<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, some studies have found that the
use of US does not significantly improve shoulder problems<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of therapeutic continuous US on pain,
functional status, and isokinetic shoulder rotator strength in patients with shoulder pain
due to rotator cuff disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study involved of 22
patients with rotator cuff disease (11 males, 11 females; age range, 52&#x02013;81 years) who were
treated at the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of Baskent University
Hospital in Adana, Turkey. A physiotherapist randomly assigned half of the patients to a
true US group and the other 11 to a sham US group. Selection was done by drawing lots. These
assignments were unknown to both the patients and the physiatrist working with them. This
study was approved by the local ethics committee of Baskent University, and written informed
consent was obtained from all of the patients.</p><p>The inclusion criteria of the study were: the presence of unilateral shoulder pain and
limited active movement for at least four weeks prior to the study, normal passive shoulder
movement, a diagnosis of rotator cuff disease by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and no
physiotherapy for the shoulder in the four weeks prior to the study. In addition, potential
study subjects needed to have at least two of the following positive impingement signs:
positive results in the Speed, Neer, or Hawkins tests or the drop arm, lift-off, or
supraspinatus isolation tests; a resistant, painful shoulder during internal and external
rotation (IR and ER); or pain during the abduction of the shoulder with a painful arch<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The consecutively referred patients who
met these criteria were informed about the details of the study.</p><p>Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: a history of acute trauma, surgery
or a fracture to or in the proximity of the shoulders, ROM limitation in the upper
extremities, a neurological deficit in the upper extremities, an underlying inflammatory
rheumatic disease, or signs of cervical pathologies that might be associated with shoulder
pain.</p><p>The rotator cuff pathologies were graded in three stages according to the results of MRI,
with stage 1 indicating acute inflammation with either tendonitis or bursitis, stage 2
signifying chronic inflammation either with or without degeneration, and stage 3
representing patients with a rupture of the cuff<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. All the patients were evaluated before and immediately after
rehabilitation (20th day) by the same physiatrist using the visual analog scale (VAS),
University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Shoulder Rating Scale, and the Constant-Murley
Shoulder Outcome score as well as isokinetic measurements of the shoulder ER and IR
muscles.</p><p>The Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome score assesses the range of functional active movement
of a normal, diseased, or treated shoulder. It is comprised of subjective assessments of
pain (15 points) and activities of daily living (ADL) (20 points) together with objective
measures of ROM (40 points) and shoulder strength (25 points) that are added and have a
maximum possible score of 100<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale includes an evaluation of pain and a patient satisfaction
rating together with functional active forward flexion, and strength of forward flexion
assesment performed with manual muscle testing. The maximum possible total score is 35
points, with higher scores indicating better shoulder function<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To perform the isokinetic evaluation, we used a Biodex System 3 Pro&#x02122; dynamometer (Biodex
Medical Systems, Shirley, NY, USA) to test the isokinetic strength of the shoulder ER and IR
muscles at constant angular velocities of 60&#x000b0;/second, and 180&#x000b0;/second via a
concentric/concentric mode, and these tests were performed by the same physiatrist. To
standardize the measurements, we created a new test protocol for the isokinetic mode menu of
the machine. Before the testing of each patient began, the dynamometer was calibrated, and
its position was established according to the standard measurement technique in which the
device was tilted 50&#x000b0; and oriented 20&#x000b0; and the seat was tilted 85&#x000b0; and oriented 15&#x000b0;. In
addition, before the isokinetic muscle testing, 1&#x02005;mL intra-articular 2% prilocaine was
injected into the affected shoulder to enable painless movement. The patients were then
seated on a supine position in the isokinetic dynamometer chair at 80&#x000b0; hip flexion and 90&#x000b0;
knee flexion with their ankles unrestricted. Their trunks and legs were stabilized using
straps across the chest, waist, and upper thighs. Muscle strength was tested with the
shoulder in a modified neutral position (45&#x000b0; abduction and 30&#x000b0; flexion), and the elbow
flexed at 90&#x000b0;. The axis of rotation was adjusted with the axis alignment being longitudinal
through the head of the shaft of the humerus and the center of the glenohumeral joint in the
horizontal plane. The elbow axis was aligned parallel to the entrance axis of the
dynamometer, and the neutral hand position was adjusted as indicated by the user&#x02019;s manual.
Next, the movement range was set to a painless 90&#x000b0; shoulder rotation around the modified
neutral position (45&#x000b0; of IR and 45&#x000b0; of ER). Gravity correction was also used for the testing
position. All of these isokinetic protocols were performed exactly according to the
manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations.</p><p>After explaining the procedure to the patients, they were familiarized with it by
performing three submaximal and five maximal repetitions at each speed. In addition, a
30-second rest period was provided between the familiarization trials and the testing. The
isokinetic evaluation at 60&#x000b0;/second and 180&#x000b0;/second consisted of five and 10 repetitions of
maximal effort for each respective movement. A 10-second rest period was allowed after each
measurement with a five-minute rest between the testing of the two shoulders.</p><p>We also measured the isokinetic strength at peak torque (PT) of ER and IR at each speed and
used the highest torque value (Newton meters) recorded during the isokinetic efforts in the
analysis.</p><p>The true US group received continuous US via a Gymna Combi 200 device for two-channel
electrotherapy (GymnaUniphy N.V. Bilzen, Belgium) operated at a frequency of 1.1&#x02005;MHz and at
an intensity of 1.5&#x02005;W/cm<sup>2</sup>. The transducer head had an area of 4.7&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>
and an effective radiating area of 4.1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>. While sitting on a table, the
patients placed an arm on their lap with their hand in a supinated position. Using slow
circular movements, the physiotherapist applied the transducer head over the glenohumeral
joint, covering an area of approximately 10&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup> for a five-minute period. For the
sham US group, the intervention was performed with the same device set to the &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; mode,
and the transducer head applied to the same area in the same way with the same transmission
gel.</p><p>Afterwards, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and hot packs were applied
to the patients of both groups for 20 minutes each, and then for 30 minutes, the patients
perfromed exercises that included active and passive shoulder ROM, Codmann exercises,
capsular stretching, isometric and isotonic exercises for strengthening the rotator cuff,
biceps, and deltoid muscles, and scapulohumeral stability exercises. These exercises were
performed at the rehabilitation clinic and supervised by the same physiotherapist. At the
start of the therapy, or when a patient had severe pain or discomfort, passive restricted
ROM exercises and gentle stretching were used. At a later phase or when discomfort or pain
had lessened, exercise shifted toward active ROM exercises, and gradually isometric and
dynamic resistance exercises were added, resulting in a longer duration of the exercise
session. TENS (STT-500, Stratek, Korea) was applied with a frequency of 100&#x02005;Hz and current
of 8.4 mA over the glenohumeral joint for 20 minutes. All of the patients received the same
physiotherapy program from the same physiotherapist.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics for Windows version 17.0 software
program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). For each continuous variable, distribution normality
was checked using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests and histograms. Comparisons
between groups were performed using the Mann-Whitney U test for the data that was not
normally distributed. In addition, the pre- and post-intervention data were analyzed via
repeated measures analysis, and p values of &#x0003c; 0.05 were considered to be statistically
significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The true and sham US groups were evaluated according to age, gender, affected extremity,

scapular muscles, decreased ROM in the shoulder complex, degeneration and inflammation of
tendons and bursae, acromial dysmorphology, capsular tightness, and glenohumeral
instability, are commonly believed to contribute to rotator cuff disease<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. For this reason, the rehabilitation of
this disease aims to control pain, improve ROM, and provide scapulothoracic rhythm and
function<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>When evaluating the efficacy of physiotherapy programs for rotator cuff disease, joint
mobility and stretching, relaxation, and exercise programs are deemed to be beneficial for
strengthening the rotator cuff muscles<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. In our study, the physiotherapy
interventions led to improvements in the results of the VAS, UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale and
Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome test in both the true and sham US groups. Furthermore, the
results of our short-term intervention suggest that conservative management of rotator cuff
disease can lessen the patients&#x02019;pain, enhance their functionality, and increase their
satisfaction levels. Y&#x00131;ld&#x00131;r&#x00131;m et al.<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>
performed US, infrared, and TENS on patients with rotator cuff disease together with an
exercise program, and they also saw improvement in the same three evaluation
instruments.</p><p>Therapeutic US is commonly used for the conservative treatment of rotator cuff disease and
is generally prescribed in conjunction with other interventions. When applied with
appropriate intensity and frequency, it increases the temperature in soft tissues with a
high protein density. The physiological effects of US are increased blood flow, vascular
permeability, and local metabolism and enhanced fibrous tissue extensibility and muscle
relaxation<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in a review of
the biophysical effects of therapeutic US, Baker et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that these effects were unlikely to be beneficial. In
addition, they suggested that there was relatively little evidence to show that US had
beneficial effects in vivo, and, therefore, it was mere conjecture to conclude that US had
positive effects on patients with rotator cuff disease. They also determined that any
changes that occur in an in vivo condition or in the extracellular fluid initiate a
protective reaction that minimizes the effects on cells, tissues, and organs and that these
protective mechanisms may at least be partly responsible for the discrepancy between the
results of in vitro US studies and the findings of a small number of high-quality,
randomized, controlled trials.</p><p>The present study, continuous US resulted in no differential improvements in the VAS,
Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome test, and UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale, with the exception of
the ADL subgroup scores of the Constant-Murley Outcome test, which increased in the US
group. Calis et al.<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the efficacy
of US, laser treatment, and exercise for 15 sessions with patients who had rotator cuff
disease and concluded that there were statistically significant improvements as a whole in
their ROM, VAS and Constant-Murley Outcome scores. However, their results did not
demonstrate that US was superior to the other interventions. In another study that evaluated
the use of US in conjunction with ice compresses, TENS, and exercises in the treatment of
rotator cuff disease, Celik et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> found
that US did not provide any additional improvement in ROM, VAS or Constant-Murley Shoulder
Outcome scores of the patients. Moreover, in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, Kurtai&#x0015f;
et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> demonstrated that 10 minutes of US
provided no additional benefit when applied together with hot-packs, interferential current,
and exercise interventions in the management of soft tissue disorders of the shoulder.
However, they did show that this combined therapy program improved the patient&#x02019;s pain and
ROM and raised the Shoulder Disability Questionnaire (SDQ) and Health Assessment
Questionnaire (HAQ) scores in the study population as a whole. Furthermore, in the review by
Faber et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, they found that adding US
to the treatment regimen did not change the functional levels of the patients, and some
studies have also demonstrated that there is little evidence for the effectiveness of
therapeutic US in the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal problems or for the
promotio of soft tissue healing<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Isokinetic assessment of the rotator cuff is a common and reliable component of shoulder
muscle examinations. Additionally, because of the extensive mobility of the shoulder,
various testing positions and articular planes can be used for isokinetic evaluation; hence,
finding a consensus protocol has been difficult. The test position plays a vital role in the
outcome measures, and the ability to reproduce the measurements depends on the selected
position<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, we evaluated
the isokinetic muscle testing based on the concentric/concentric protocol in the seated
position with the retracted shoulder in a modified neutral position. While it is possible
that this was not the best position to evaluate the shoulder rotators, we believe that any
limitations this position might have caused were probably mitigated by the patients
remaininig in the same position throughout the isokinetic evaluations.</p><p>In our trial, the ER PT 60&#x000b0;/second values increased in both the true and sham US groups,
but the ER PT 180&#x000b0;/second values did not increase in either group. The low angular component
of the isokinetic evaluation is usually the most painful and difficult for the patients. For
this reason, a decrease in pain after treatment may reflect as an improvement due to the ER
PT measurement at the low angular velocity. A high angular velocity can be associated with
functional activities. In our patients, the high angular velocity rates did not differ
between the pre- and post-physiotherapy sessions, but the UCLA Shoulder Rating Scale and
Constant-Murley Shoulder Outcome scores that are used for the functional evaluation of
patients improved. These higher scores appear to contradict the results of the isokinetic
high angular velocity rates. In this study, we also found that US was found to have no
effect on the isokinetic measurements of the ER muscles at the end of the intervention, and
this was true at both the low and high angular velocity rates. It was additionally found
that our physiotherapy program did not improve the isokinetic strength of shoulder IR at the
end of intervention in both the true and sham US groups.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first and only study to evaluate the effect of
therapeutic US on the isokinetic muscle strength of patients with rotator cuff disease. Our
findings demonstrate that continuous US therapy, when combined with other physiotherapy
interventions, provides no additional treatment benefits with regard to pain, functional
status, or isokinetic strength. Reduction of pain after physiotherapy may result in better
functioning of the shoulder in daily living activities and this may have helped to improve
muscle strength.</p><p>Further studies are needed on this subject because of the limitations of our study. One
issue was the low number of patients. New studies that feature larger sample sizes could
help to verify our findings. In addition, it is possible that the patients did not
understand the pre-intervention isokinetic testing of the control evaluations, and thus the
subsequent post-intervention testing, but this lack of understanding could not be measured.
Another limitation was that the muscles of the rotator cuff were not isokinetically tested
during other movements. Furthermore, the long-term patient results are unknown, and we also
did not analyze our patients&#x02019; need for analgesics. Finally, there is no accepted
standardized method for the physiotherapy modalities and rehabilitation interventions used
in this study.</p><p>According to the results of our study, physiotherapy modalities may lower disability rates
by improving muscle strength and function while easing the pain of patients with rotator
cuff disease. In addition, our findings indicate that therapeutic US does not provide any
additional healing effect when combined with other physiotherapy interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Haahr</surname><given-names>JP</given-names></name><name><surname>&#x000d8;stergaard</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Dalsgaard</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Exercises versus arthroscopic decompression in patients
