passive static stretching group. [Methods] Glycated hemoglobin was measured before and
after the 8-week training period. [Results] Glycated hemoglobin levels decreased
significantly in the passive static stretching group, and there were significant
differences in blood glucose levels between the 2 groups. [Conclusion] Passive static
stretching of the skeletal muscles may be an alternative to exercise to help regulate

strong for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. T2DM is a chronic disease characterized by decreased insulin
sensitivity and overall poor glucose control. Exercise is a generally accepted component of
the nonpharmacologic treatment for T2DM<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.
The systematic review by Boule et al. indicates structured exercise programs have a
statistically and clinically significant beneficial effect on glycemic control in patients
with T2DM<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, patients with
T2DM who use insulin, low-intensity exercise significantly reduces the prevalence of
hyperglycemia<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Despite the benefits of physical activity, many people with T2DM do not exercise regularly.
For some individuals, secondary diabetes-related complications such as lower-limb
amputations, neuropathies, hypertension, nephropathies, and retinopathies can either
contraindicate exercise or make it more difficult. In addition, many elderly people with
T2DM do not have sufficient physical ability to perform aerobic exercise and thus have
problems maintaining euglycemia<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Passive static stretching occurs when sustained tension develops within a person&#x02019;s muscles
through external forces. Several studies suggest passive stretching can increase cellular
glucose uptake. Accordingly, blood glucose levels could decrease following a program of
successive sustained muscle stretching. In addition, because passive stretching requires
minimum effort by the person performing the stretch, people with T2DM who are reluctant or
unable to exercise may be willing to follow a stretching protocol<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, this study determined the effect of passive
static stretching on blood glucose levels in people with T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifteen in-patients with T2DM at a hospital in Busan, Korea participated in this study.
Patients were eligible if they were sedentary (i.e., not participating in regular aerobic or
strengthening exercises 6 months before the study) and willing to commit to an 8-week
supervised exercise program<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. All patients
were diagnosed with T2DM confirmed by a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level 6.5% or higher as
a criterion for the diagnosis of diabetes<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. All patients meeting the inclusion criteria were given verbal and
written information about this study. The patients provided informed consent prior to
participating. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of Daegu
University.</p><p>Patients were randomized to the control group (<italic>n</italic> = 7) or passive static
stretching group (PSS, <italic>n</italic> = 8). The control group was instructed to maintain
their diet and medications for diabetes and not to perform any exercise during the
experiment. Meanwhile, patients in the PSS group followed the same instructions as the
control group but received a 40-minute intervention consisting of 6 lower-body and 4
upper-body static passive stretches. For each stretch, the muscle was held in the stretched
position for 30 seconds and was repeated 4 times. Each repetition was separated by a
15-second relaxation period, and different stretches were separated by a minimum of 1
minute. A description of stretch is provided in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table

glucose levels in patients with T2DM. The results showed HbA1c levels decreased
significantly after an 8-week passive static stretching intervention. There are several
possible mechanisms that could explain how passive stretching of skeletal muscles decreased
blood glucose levels. According to a review by Dohm<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, glucose transport into the skeletal muscles is primarily mediated
by a glucose transport protein, GLUT-4; accordingly, exercise can increase GLUT-4 levels in
the skeletal muscles. Furthermore, increased metabolic activity accompanying passive muscle
stretching is related to the GLUT-4 activation pathway<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, passive
muscle stretching could induce the incorporation of GLUT-4 into the stretched skeletal
muscles.</p><p>Other studies also support the possibility of stretching-induced incorporation of GLUT-4
into the skeletal muscles. First, the activity of protein kinase B controls GLUT-4
incorporation; accordingly, protein kinase B is activated by passive stretching of isolated
muscles<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Second, Sun et al. report
that ischemia induces the translocation of GLUT-4 to the plasma membrane of cardiac
myocytes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>; accordingly, passive
stretching of the skeletal muscles can cause ischemia<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Third, in an experimental study by Roberts et al.,
exercise-induced increases in nitric oxide levels resulted in increased glucose
transport<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>; accordingly, passive
stretching can increase nitric oxide release from excised soleus muscles by 20%<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finally, mitogen-activated protein kinase
activity stimulates glucose uptake in muscle cells<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>; Martineau et al. report that the activity of mitogen-activated
protein kinase directly reflects the magnitude of mechanical stress (e.g., actively or
passively generated tension) applied to the muscle<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The results of this study are subject to several limitations. The sample size is
insufficient to generalize the results to all patients with T2DM. In addition, as HbA1c
reflects the average plasma glucose level over the preceding 2&#x02013;3 months, the 8-week study
period might have been too short to determine changes in blood glucose levels as a result of
stretching<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, further
studies are required to ascertain the long-term (i.e., more than 3 months) effects of
passive static stretching on blood glucose levels in a larger population of patients with
T2DM.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Murano</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Asakawa</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Mizukami</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Factors increasing physical activity levels in diabetes
