This phenomenon of an aging population requires a more efficient resources allocation in health care; the demand of health treatments coming from an aging population can be fulfilled through the implementation of new procedures, mostly based on behavioral theories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. For instance, the biological aging process is associated with structural and functional deterioration in most physiological systems, including the neuromuscular and cardiovascular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These deteriorations can affect the ability of older adults to cope with and perform everyday activities. Consequently, there has been a tendency - amongst both the medical community and general public - to view older people as vulnerable, unproductive, and non-contributing members of society. However, in recent years, attitudes have begun to change and emerging research insights demonstrate that an active and engaged lifestyle in older adults contributes not only towards successful aging, but to a healthy economy and society more generally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Indeed, many older adults with active participation in social and leisure activities report good levels of psychological wellbeing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. These behavioral approaches to health care are increasingly applied to different treatments.</p><p>The activity theory of aging suggests that wellbeing in older adults is promoted by (a) higher levels of participation in social and leisure activities, and (b) role replacement when roles must be relinquished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition to the benefits of remaining psychologically stimulated, social and leisure participation may also maintain or promote wellbeing in older adults due to increased physical activity. For example, research demonstrates that the activation of bodily systems promotes a greater range of motion and muscle tone, and improves digestive system functioning and cardiovascular health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. More specifically, endurance training is purported to be effective for decreasing fat mass [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], resting heart rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and resistance training can increase basal metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], bone mineral density (BMD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], muscle strength and power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and muscle and connective tissue cross-sectional area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>A recent review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] has suggested that successful aging training programs can be distinguished by both the content (that is, the mental and physical demand and/or behavioral aspects) and the social context of the activities. Social activity affects wellbeing by reducing the risks of social isolation and facilitating (a) emotional intimacy, (b) socio-emotional support, (c) reinforcement of self-identity and social roles, and (d) a sense of being valued. Furthermore, productive activity may influence health and wellbeing in older adults through satisfaction with outcomes, economic gains, mental stimulation, comforting personal routines, sense of purpose, and increased self-efficacy and/or self-esteem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>As already indicated, psychological wellbeing is a key determinant of quality of life in older people. According to the <italic>Broaden and Build Theory of Positive Emotions</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], negative emotions serve to narrow focus and attention, whereas positive emotions serve to broaden thoughts and behaviors. Thus, by broadening their thoughts and actions, older-aged adults are better able to cultivate positive emotions and build important coping resources including psychological, intellectual, and physical aptitude. Indeed, there is a strong correlation between quality of life and attitudes towards aging in older adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Of particular interest in this regard, are gender differences in terms of physical activity engagement. For example, due to factors such as menopausal transition (MT), there is evidence to suggest that older women are less likely to engage in physical activity than older men [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This in turn can compound stress levels and increase the risk of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Several training methods such as aerobic training, strength training, multicomponent exercise training and whole body vibration (WBV) may improve health outcomes in older-aged women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. WBV utilizes high frequency mechanical stimuli (generated by a vibrating platform) that are transmitted through the body where they load the bone and stimulate sensory receptors. Multicomponent exercise training comprises strength training and various balance improving exercises. Significant health improvements are associated with multicomponent exercise training programs in older-adult samples, including the prevention of bone fractures and osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Likewise, WBV is associated with improvements in strength, power, and balance in body composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] - including in obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Findings also demonstrate that occupational exposure to WBV is associated with favorable alterations in mood state that are directly proportional to exposure time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Despite these promising findings, very few studies have focused on the link between these exercise training programs and psychological outcomes (for example, quality of life, psychological wellbeing, happiness, and so on) in older women. Accordingly, the aim of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial that assesses these relationships in order to inform the structure and development of exercise training programs for older women.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Hypotheses and design</title><p>Starting from current literature, we hypothesize that specific physical activity, WBV, may promote psychological wellbeing and quality of life in female aged subjects, if compared with Multicomponent Training program and normal physical activity.

The Psychological scale administrations and training intervention will be conducted at the biomechanics lab in the UCAM Research Center for High Performance Sports.

After the completion of the inclusion procedure, the clinical psychologist will obtain the file containing the condition to which the patient is allocated.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><p>The interventions protocol will consist of six months of training for both groups of vibratory platform and Multicomponent Training. Both groups, WBV and Multicomponent Training, will follow three training sessions per week, with a recovery time between sessions ranging from 24 to 72&#x000a0;hours.</p></sec><sec><title>WBV training</title><p>After the warm-up consisting in eight minutes of static cycling, active stretching and joint mobility, participants will perform the WBV training. The vibration stimulus will consist of uniform vertical oscillations Power Plate&#x000ae; Next Generation (Power Plate North America, Northbrook, IL, USA). Subjects will stand on the platform holding quarter squat positions with the feet shoulder-width apart. Then, they will perform ankle extensions with the following work sequence (establishing a rhythm of 100&#x000a0;bpm: 1&#x000a0;bpm for the concentric phase; and 5&#x000a0;bpm for the eccentric phase). After the familiarization 2-weeks, subjects will train 3 days per week for 6&#x000a0;months (72 sessions) using a vibrating training program that will begin with 5 sets and a frequency of 35&#x000a0;Hz per session and increasing by 11 sets and 40&#x000a0;Hz frequency for the last month, maintaining a series of parameters: vibration amplitude (4&#x000a0;mm) working time (60&#x000a0;seconds) and recovery time (60&#x000a0;seconds).</p></sec><sec><title>Multicomponent Training</title><p>In the same way, and after the warm-up consisting in eight minutes of static cycling, active stretching and joint mobility, participants will perform the Multicomponent Training. This training will combine vertical jumps and high-intensity walking. During the first month, small reactive vertical jumps (without knee and ankle flexion) will be performed. After the first month, subjects will perform drop jumps progressively starting at a height of 5&#x000a0;cm and finishing at 25&#x000a0;cm at the end of the program (increases of 5&#x000a0;cm each month). Additionally, the sets will be increased from 4&#x000d7;10 jumps to 6&#x000d7;10 each week, finishing the last week with 4&#x000d7;10. In this sense, the drop jumps will be the same each month but the total load (imposed by height) will increase progressively. Regarding the aerobic exercise, the load will increase progressively along the six months. The intensity will range between 50 to 75% of reserve heart rate; the volume will range between 30 to 60&#x000a0;minutes.</p></sec><sec><title>Control group</title><p>Control group participants will be asked to continue their daily lives normally and maintain regular physical activity during the six-month duration of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>Besides the psychological screening baseline at one week after the beginning of training (T1), all participants will be assessed at three months (T2) and six months (T3).Moreover, at the baseline assessment, questions on demographic variables (for example, age, marital status, work, educational level, socioeconomic status), psychiatric history (for example, previous diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety, family history regarding psychiatric diagnosis), and/or health behaviors (for example, alcohol use, smoking habits, physical activity) will be included.</p><p>All participating sample were screened for psychological aspects by the following standardized measures:</p><sec><title><italic>Primary outcome measures</italic></title><p><bold>SF-12 Health Survey</bold> It is a self-administered test that assesses the global health status by the subjective point of view of the subject.

The SHS has been validated in 14 studies with a total of 2,732 participants. Preliminary results have indicated that the SHS has high internal consistency, which has been found to be stable across samples. Test-retest and self-peer correlations have suggested good to excellent reliability, and construct validation studies of convergent and discriminant validity have confirmed the use of this scale to measure the construct of subjective happiness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title/><p><bold>Proactive Attitude Scale (PA)</bold> It assesses the presence of a proactive attitude that is a relatively persistent personal belief in the rich potential of changes that can be made to improve oneself and one&#x02019;s environment.

Although several studies have been conducted on the aging status and prevention, very few randomized controlled trials have focused on the link between specific physical activity and psychological wellbeing in adult women. A randomized controlled trial that assesses their relationships may be useful in order to improve the quality of prevention programs and then promote the general wellbeing of the national population. Given the progressive increase of the elderly population in Europe, prevention plays a key role in containing health costs and comprises a large portion of health expenditure. Because of the known link between lifestyle and disease in aging and the high cost associated with lifestyle diseases, improving and promoting health in middle and older age is in fact becoming a European health and research priority. The comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of these behavioral prevention treatments, to determine estimates of the health care cost savings obtainable through these approaches, is left for future research.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>PAHA Protocol has been registered on Clinical Gov database with ID NCT01966562.
