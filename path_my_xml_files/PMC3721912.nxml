Certain healthcare procedures induce bacteraemia with organisms that can cause endocarditis; these bacteria are usually sensitive to antibiotics. Therefore antibiotics should be given to patients with pre-disposing heart disease before procedures that may cause bacteraemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref></p><p>On this basis, prophylaxis against infective endocarditis has become routine in most countries,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R02">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref> even though no prospective study has proved that it is effective.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R01">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R04">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R07">7</xref> The use of topical antiseptics has been another approach to reduce the entry of bacteria into the blood stream.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R08">8</xref></p><p>Since studies on the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis in humans cannot be done for ethical and practical reasons, clinical studies have focused on the prevention of bacteraemia by administration of antimicrobial agents before dental treatment. There is a paucity of data on the effectiveness of amoxicillin, clindamycin and the oral antiseptic, chlorhexidine in eliminating post-extraction bacteraemia in black patients. We therefore carried out a study to assess and compare the effectiveness of these drugs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2a"><title>Methods</title><p>Adult black patients attending the dental clinic in Prince Mshiyeni Memorial Hospital, Umlazi, near Durban were included in the study after informed consent had been obtained. They were healthy, had no history of cardiovascular disease, had not received antibiotics in the previous two weeks and were not allergic to penicillin. Any patient found to have a dental abscess or who required the extraction of more than one tooth was excluded.</p><p>Using a computer-generated randomisation table, patients were randomised into four groups of 40 each. Group A served as a control group and was given no therapy prior to dental extraction. Group B rinsed their mouths vigorously with 10 ml of 0.2% chlorhexidine for one minute and expectorated. This procedure was repeated one minute later. Groups C and D took 3 g amoxicillin or 600 mg clindamycin orally, respectively. All treatments were given one hour prior to the dental extraction.</p><p>Only one tooth was extracted per patient. The same dental surgeon performed the procedure using dental forceps. No surgical procedures were used in any patient.</p><p>The skin at the site of the venepuncture was prepared using 0.5% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol. Using standard aseptic techniques, 8&#x02013;10 ml of blood was drawn three minutes after the extraction in each patient.</p><p>Three to 5 ml of blood were injected directly into BACTEC (Becton Dickinson, Maryland, USA) blood culture vials type 6b (aerobic) and 7d (anaerobic), after the used needle was replaced with a new sterile needle, and the rubber septum on the BACTEC vials was disinfected with alcohol. The blood culture bottles were transported to the Microbiology Department, King Edward VIII Hospital, Durban within two hours of collection and were immediately incubated at 37&#x000b0;C. In the case of the aerobic bottles, this also included agitation on BACTEC shakers for the first 24 hours.</p><p>The blood culture vials were tested on days one, three, five and seven, and positive vials were sub-cultured and Gram-stained smears were prepared. The aerobic vials were sub-cultured onto chocolate, blood and MacConkey agar plates, which were incubated for 48 hours in air plus 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. The anaerobic vials were sub-cultured onto 10% blood agar plates with and without amikacin, which were incubated for 48 to 72 hours in anaerobic gas pak (Becton Dickinson, USA) jars with appropriate controls. The organisms isolated were further identified using conventional laboratory methods and the identity of streptococcal isolates was confirmed using the API Strep 20 (API, France) system.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R09">9</xref></p><p>The study was approved by the ethics committee of the Nelson R Mandela School of Medicine, University of Natal, Durban.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results in each group were arranged in a contingency table and were analysed using Fisher&#x02019;s exact test (one-tailed probability).
