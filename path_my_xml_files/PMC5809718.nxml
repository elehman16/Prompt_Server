Several observational analyses noted positive associations between improvements in water, sanitation, and handwashing conditions and child growth, but at the time this study was conceived there were no published randomised controlled trials specifically powered to evaluate the effect of such interventions on child growth as a primary outcome. Subsequent published trials of sanitation interventions have reported mixed results. Systematic reviews of complementary feeding interventions have reported small but significant improvements in child growth. More recent evidence from lipid-based nutrient supplementation trials has been mostly consistent with these earlier systematic reviews. Chronic enteric infection might affect children's capacity to respond to nutrients; however, we found no published studies comparing the effect on child growth of nutritional interventions alone versus nutritional interventions plus water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions. Although many programmatic interventions target multiple pathways of enteric pathogen transmission, systematic reviews have found no greater reduction in diarrhoea with combined versus single water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions. There is little direct evidence comparing interventions that target a single versus multiple pathways. Only three randomised controlled trials compared single versus combined interventions in comparable populations at the same time. None of these trials found a significant reduction in diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years who received combined versus the most effective single intervention.</p><p id="para50"><bold>Added value of this study</bold></p><p id="para60">This trial was designed to compare the effects of individual and combined water quality, sanitation, hygiene, and nutrient supplementation plus infant and young child feeding counselling interventions on diarrhoea and growth when given to infants and young children in a setting where child growth faltering was common. The trial had high intervention adherence, low attrition, and ample statistical power to detect small effects. Children receiving interventions with nutritional components had small growth benefits compared with those in the control cluster. Water quality, sanitation, and handwashing interventions did not improve child growth, neither when delivered alone nor when combined with the nutritional interventions. Children receiving sanitation, handwashing, nutrition, and combined interventions had less reported diarrhoea. Combined interventions showed no additional reduction in diarrhoea beyond single interventions.</p><p id="para70"><bold>Implications of all the available evidence</bold></p><p id="para80">The modest improvements observed in growth faltering with nutritional supplementation and counselling are consistent with other trials that report similar levels of efficacy in some contexts. By contrast to observational studies that report an association between growth faltering and water, sanitation, and hygiene assessments, this intervention trial provides no evidence that household drinking water quality, sanitation, or handwashing interventions consistently improve growth. This trial further supports findings from smaller trials that combined individual water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions are not consistently more effective in the prevention of diarrhoea than are single interventions.</p></boxed-text></p><p id="para90">Environmental enteric dysfunction is an abnormality of gut function that might explain why most nutrition interventions fail to normalise early childhood growth.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> Environmental contaminants are thought to induce the chronic intestinal inflammation, loss of villous surface area, and impaired barrier function that combine to impair food and nutrient uptake.

We grouped pregnant women who lived near enough to each other into a cluster to allow delivery of interventions by a single community promoter. We hypothesised that the interventions would improve the health of the index child in each household. Each measurement round lasted about 1 year and was balanced across treatment arms and geography to minimise seasonal or geographical confounding when comparing outcomes across groups. We chose areas with low groundwater iron and arsenic (because these affect chlorine demand) and where no major water, sanitation, or nutrition programmes were ongoing or planned by the government or large non-government organisations.

The drinking water and handwashing interventions were household level interventions. The nutrition intervention was a child-specific intervention. We assessed the diarrhoea outcome among all children in the compound who were younger than 3 years at enrolment, which could underestimate the effect of interventions targeted only to index households (drinking water, and handwashing) or index children (nutrition). After the study results were unmasked, we analysed diarrhoea prevalence restricted to index children (ie, children directly targeted by each intervention).</p><p id="para150">The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Committee at The International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR-11063), the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of California, Berkeley (2011-09-3652), and the institutional review board at Stanford University (25863).</p></sec><sec id="cesec40"><title>Participants</title><p id="para160">Rural households in Bangladesh are usually organised into compounds where patrilineal families share a common courtyard and sometimes a pond, water source, and latrine.

We reviewed maps of plotted households and made clusters of eight expectant women who lived close enough to each other for a single community promoter to readily walk to each compound. We used a 1 km buffer around each cluster to reduce the potential for spillover between clusters (median buffer distance 2&#x000b7;6 km [IQR 1&#x000b7;8&#x02013;3&#x000b7;7]).

For each visit, a promoter's guide detailed the visit objective, the target audience, the specific steps, and materials to be used. Discussions, video dramas, storytelling, games, songs, and training on hardware maintenance were included in different visits. The breadth of the curriculum varied by the complexity of the intervention. Promoters delivering combined interventions were expected to spend sufficient time to cover all of the behavioural objectives with target households. Promoters did not visit control households. Promoters received a monthly stipend equivalent to US$20, comparable to the local compensation for 5 days of agricultural labour.</p><p id="para230">The water intervention, which was modelled on a successful intervention from a previous trial,<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11</sup></xref> provided a 10 L vessel with a lid, tap, and regular supply of sodium dichloroisocyanurate tablets (Medentech, Wexford, Ireland) to the household of index children. Households were encouraged to fill the vessel, add one 33 mg tablet, and wait 30 min before drinking the water. All household members, but especially children younger than 5 years, were encouraged to drink only chlorine-treated water. Non-index households in the compound did not receive the water intervention.</p><p id="para240">The latrine component of the sanitation intervention targeted all households in the compound. All latrines that did not have a slab, a functional water seal, or a construction that prevented surface runoff of a faecal stream into the community were replaced. If the index household did not have their own latrine, the project built one. The standard project intervention latrine was a double pit latrine with a water seal.<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13</sup></xref> Each pit had five concrete rings that were 0&#x000b7;3 m high. When the initial pit filled, the superstructure and slab could be moved to the second pit. In the less than 2% of cases where there was insufficient space for a second pit or the water table was too high for a pit that was 1&#x000b7;5 m deep, the design was adapted. Nearly all households (99%) provided labour and modest financial contributions towards the construction of the latrines. All households in sanitation intervention compounds also received a sani-scoop, which is a hand tool for the removal of faeces from the compound,<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr"><sup>14</sup></xref> and child potties if they had any children younger than 3 years.<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15</sup></xref> Promoters encouraged mothers to teach their children to use the potties, to safely dispose of faeces in latrines, and to regularly remove animal and human faeces from the compound.</p><p id="para250">The handwashing intervention targeted households with index children. These households received two handwashing stations, one with a 40 L water reservoir placed near the latrine and a 16 L reservoir for the kitchen. Each handwashing station included a basin to collect rinse water and a soapy water bottle.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr"><sup>16</sup></xref> Promoters also provided a regular supply of detergent sachets for making soapy water. Promoters encouraged residents to wash their hands with soapy water before preparing food, before eating or feeding a child, after defecating, and after cleaning a child who has defected.</p><p id="para260">We aimed to deploy interventions so that index children were born into households with the interventions in place. In the combined intervention arms, the sanitation intervention was implemented first, followed by handwashing and then water treatment.</p><p id="para270">The nutrition intervention targeted index children. Promoters gave study mothers with children aged 6&#x02013;24 months two 10 g sachets per day of lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS; Nutriset; Malaunay, France) that could be mixed into the child's food. Each sachet provided 118 kcal, 9&#x000b7;6 g fat, 2&#x000b7;6 g protein, 12 vitamins, and ten minerals. Promoters explained that LNS should not replace breastfeeding or complementary foods and encouraged caregivers to exclusively breastfeed their children during the first 6 months and to provide a diverse, nutrient-dense diet using locally available foods for children older than 6 months.

Children in the nutrient supplement and counselling group grew somewhat taller than controls. Children in households that received a combination of water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition had no greater growth benefit than those receiving the nutrition-only intervention. Compared with control households, caregiver-reported diarrhoea prevalence was significantly decreased in households that received any of the interventions, except those who received only the drinking water treatment.</p><p id="para520">The trial's statistical power to detect small effects and high adherence to the interventions suggest that the absence of improvement in growth with water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions was a genuine null effect. These results suggest either that the hypothesis that exposure to faecal contamination contributes importantly to child growth faltering in Bangladesh is flawed or that the hypothesis remains valid but the water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions used in this trial did not reduce exposure to environmental pathogens sufficiently to reduce growth faltering. Future articles from our group will describe the effects of intervention on environmental contamination with faecal indicator bacteria and on the prevalence and concentration of enteric pathogens in stool specimens from children and thus provide insight on how effectively the interventions altered environmental contamination and enteropathogen transmission.</p><p id="para530">The effect of the nutrition intervention, which corrected one sixth of the growth deficit compared with international norms of healthy growth, was consistent with other randomised controlled trials of postnatal LNS that have reported variable and generally small effects on linear growth.<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> This variation is probably because of contextual factors that affect a population's capacity to respond to an intervention. The water, sanitation, and handwashing intervention did not affect crucial contextual factors to amplify the effect of the nutrition interventions in rural Bangladesh. Continued research should explore interventions to reduce growth faltering.</p><p id="para540">Although intervention households generally reported less diarrhoea, people who received the intervention might have been grateful and, out of courtesy, reported less diarrhoea.<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> However, compared with control households, intervention households reported no reduction in bruising or abrasions (negative control outcomes), so there was no evidence of systematic under-reporting of all health outcomes. It also seems unlikely that courtesy bias would affect each of the interventions except the drinking water intervention.

The unexpectedly low diarrhoea prevalence among control children suggests decreased transmission of diarrhoea-causing pathogens during the WASH Benefits trial compared with recent evaluations. This low transmission provided less opportunity to interrupt transmission and less statistical power to show that interruption.</p><p id="para560">Combining interventions to improve drinking water quality, sanitation, and handwashing provided no additive benefit for the reduction of diarrhoea over single interventions. The unexpectedly low diarrhoea prevalence suggests low transmission of enteric pathogens through some of the pathways, which might have prevented any additive benefit from the combined interventions. Combined interventions did not compromise observed adherence to recommended practices. If a substantial proportion of the reduced diarrhoea was because of courtesy bias, this bias might mask subtle additive benefits. The only previous randomised controlled evaluations of multiple interventions versus single interventions also found no additive benefit of multiple components of water, sanitation, and handwashing on reported diarrhoea among children younger than 5 years.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Because transmission pathways of enteropathogens vary by time and location, this absence of an additive effect with combined interventions is unlikely to generalise to all locations.

Mortality was not a primary study outcome. Although the confidence limits are broad and the p value is borderline (p=0&#x000b7;037), a causal relationship from the interventions is plausible, since diarrhoea and poor nutrition are risk factors for death among young children in this setting. Notably, reduced mortality was only seen in the intervention groups that saw improved growth (nutrition groups), which were the groups with objective indicators of biological effect. Forthcoming investigations of the timing and causes of death assessed by verbal autopsy, distribution of enteropathogens among intervention groups, and effect of interventions on respiratory disease will provide additional evidence to assess the biological plausibility of a causal relationship between the combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition intervention and reduced mortality.</p><p id="para580">The randomised design, balanced groups, and high adherence suggests that the absence of an association between water, sanitation, and handwashing interventions and growth is internally valid, but this intervention was implemented in one socioecological zone (rural Bangladesh) during a time of low diarrhoea prevalence.

Although more intensive interventions could lead to even better practices, it seems unlikely that large-scale routine programmes could implement interventions with such intensity.</p><p id="para600">Because the sanitation intervention targeted compounds with pregnant women, these interventions only reached about 10% of residents in villages where interventions were implemented. If a higher threshold of sanitation coverage is necessary to achieve herd protection, then this study design would preclude the detection of this effect. We used compounds as the unit of intervention because they enabled us to deliver intensive interventions with high adherence for thousands of newborn children. In addition, we expected compound-level faecal contamination to represent the dominant source of exposure for index children because of the physical separation of compounds, and because children younger than 2 years of age in these communities spent nearly all of their time in their own compound.</p><p id="para610">The combined water, sanitation, handwashing, and nutrition intervention had sustained high levels of adherence. Although the full range of benefits of these successfully integrated interventions are yet to be fully elucidated, our findings suggest there might be a survival benefit. Forthcoming articles by our group will report the effects of intervention on biomarkers of environmental enteric dysfunction, soil-transmitted helminth infection, enteric pathogen infection, biomarkers of inflammation and allostatic load, anaemia and nutritional biomarkers, and child language, motor development, and social skills.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl10"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref10"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Richter</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Risk of poor development in young children in low-income and middle-income countries: an estimation and analysis at the global, regional, and country level</article-title><source>Lancet Glob Health</source><volume>4</volume><year>2016</year><fpage>e916</fpage><lpage>e922</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27717632</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref20"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Black</surname><given-names>MM</given-names></name><name><surname>Walker</surname><given-names>SP</given-names></name><name><surname>Fernald</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Early childhood development coming of age: science through the life course</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>389</volume><year>2016</year><fpage>77</fpage><lpage>90</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">27717614</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref30"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Dewey</surname><given-names>KG</given-names></name><name><surname>Adu-Afarwuah</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Systematic review of the efficacy and effectiveness of complementary feeding interventions in developing countries</article-title><source>Matern Child Nutr</source><volume>4</volume><issue>suppl 1</issue><year>2008</year><fpage>24</fpage><lpage>85</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18289157</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref40"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Humphrey</surname><given-names>JH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Child undernutrition, tropical enteropathy, toilets, and handwashing</article-title><source>Lancet</source><volume>374</volume><year>2009</year><fpage>1032</fpage><lpage>1035</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19766883</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref50"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Cumming</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name><name><surname>Cairncross</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Can water, sanitation and hygiene help eliminate stunting?
