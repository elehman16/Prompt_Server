two different types of treatment for people with complex regional pain syndrome type 1,<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> but we did observe a difference in the use of healthcare resources. Because
currently there is no effective management available, less economic costs with
comparable outcomes are relevant and interesting.</p><p>Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 is a debilitating condition that usually
develops following injury, but can also arise spontaneously.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> The disorder is characterized by pain and sensory, autonomic, motor, and/or
trophic changes.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> There is emerging evidence that pain-related fear and avoidance behavior can
lead to disease deterioration and the development of chronic pain-related
disability.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>
Despite elaborate research, treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 can
still be disappointing and there is a need for more high-quality evidence for the
effectiveness of most therapies.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup></p><p>In the present randomized controlled trial, we compared a Pain Exposure Physical
Therapy approach to the Dutch conventional guideline-based treatment in patients
with complex regional pain syndrome type 1.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> The guideline includes pharmacological interventions with various drugs and
intensive pain-contingent physical therapy sometimes taking a few months or even
years. Key element of the Pain Exposure Physical Therapy intervention is to
stimulate the use of the affected extremity while simultaneously ignoring the
pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Although we
found no difference in clinical effect between both interventions we expected that
early and forced use in daily life, without the use of medication, would lead to
lower costs.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Pain Exposure Physical Therapy
follows a time-contingent treatment scheme with a maximum of five treatment
sessions.</p><p>Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 is a very costly disorder. Annual costs for
chronic regional pain syndrome type 1 in the Netherlands have been estimated between
&#x020ac;32.5&#x02009;million and &#x020ac;47.3&#x02009;million, including medical costs as well as nonmedical costs

recruited from hospitals and general practitioners in the region of the Radboud
University Medical Center, in Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Recruitment took place
from January 2009 until June 2011. Patients were included if they fulfilled the
diagnostic criteria for complex regional pain syndrome type 1 as proposed by
Harden et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> age between 18 and 80&#x02009;years, and first assessment between 3 and 24&#x02009;months

pain syndrome type 1 in more than one extremity, a relapse of complex regional
pain syndrome type 1, impairments of the contralateral extremity or prior
sympathectomy of the affected extremity, or when they were pregnant or
lactating. We used the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting

costs and travel expenses. These categories included physical therapy
consultations, both as part of the allocated intervention and as outpatient
physical therapy consultations, general practitioners consultations,
consultations of the Pain Treatment Center at our university hospital,
consultations of other healthcare providers (e.g. podiatrists,
anesthesiologists for Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation),
medication costs, and travel expenses. Only the costs directly related to
the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 were incorporated in
the analyses. Volumes of care were measured using the electronic patient
record system and patients&#x02019; medical records. Associated costs were verified
with individual information from health insurance companies, after patients
had given written consent for this. Cost prices were determined using
standard unit cost prices according to the Dutch guidelines for costing
research and the currency was euro.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Travel expenses were calculated by multiplying the total traveled
distance from home to the healthcare provider with the standard travel
expense rate.</p></sec><sec id="section15-0269215518757050"><title>Health-related quality of life</title><p>Health-related quality of life was measured with the EuroQol-5D-3&#x02009;L (EQ-5D),<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> a validated so-called health-related quality-of-life instrument.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> This instrument is available in a validated Dutch translation.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The EQ-5D is a generic health-related quality-of-life instrument
comprising five domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities,
pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. The EQ-5D index is obtained by
applying predetermined weights to the five domains. This index gives a
societal-based global quantification of the patient&#x02019;s health status on a
scale ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Patients were asked to
rate their overall health-related quality of life on a visual analog scale
consisting of a vertical line ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health
status) to 100 (best imaginable).</p><p>We converted the EQ-5D score into a utility score using the Dutch algorithm.
The utility score has a maximum of 1, indicating optimal health. A utility
score of 0 equals death, but the score can also be negative, as some
conditions are thought to be worse than death. By multiplying the utility
score with the amount of time in which the score is applicable and then
aggregate these scores over the relevant timeframe (trapezium method),
quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) can be computed.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section16-0269215518757050"><title>Clinical measurements</title><p>We measured the severity of complex regional pain syndrome type 1 using the
Impairment level Sum Score&#x02014;Restricted Version (range of 4&#x02013;40, with a lower
score indicating less impairment), which consisted of three measurement
parameters focusing on typical signs and symptoms (pain, active range of
motion, and temperature).<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Pain Disability was measured using the Pain Disability Index. This is
a widely used questionnaire for measuring disability related to
musculoskeletal pain. It is a seven-item questionnaire with a score ranging
from 0 to 70 points that assesses to which extent daily activities are
disrupted by pain. A lower score indicates less disability.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="section17-0269215518757050"><title>Data analyses</title><p>We analyzed the data according to the intention-to-treat principle. Differences
in costs between treatment groups were calculated using a generalized linear
model with a log link function and with a gamma distribution to account for
skewness in the data. For analyzing health-related quality of life we used
univariate analysis of covariance, with treatment as fixed factor and EQ-5D
utility at baseline as covariate. The analyses of the clinical outcomes have
been described previously.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> If a significant difference in EQ-5D score is found the &#x0201c;efficiency&#x0201d;
decision rule will follow the net monetary benefit approach where the effect
difference in QALYs (according to the EQ-5D difference score) will be multiplied
with an appropriate willingness to pay for a QALY (as used in the Netherlands).
Then the cost difference is subtracted from this score, leading to an
incremental net monetary benefit (iNMB), and the result of this iNMB should be
larger than zero for being efficient. If no significant difference in EQ-5D is
found we use a cost minimization analysis for the criterion &#x0201c;efficiency.&#x0201d;

it saves costs when compared to conventional treatment in patients with complex
regional pain syndrome type 1. Patients in the group receiving the new therapy made
fewer visits to see healthcare professionals. Similar to the findings of the
effectiveness study, in which we found no significant clinical effects, there was no
significant difference in health-related quality of life between groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Calculated according to the intention-to-treat principle, Pain Exposure
Physical Therapy was on average &#x020ac;1088 less costly than conventional treatment.</p><p>The strengths of the study are its randomized prospective design, the relatively long
follow-up period (i.e. 9&#x02009;months), blinded collection of cost data<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and the fact that this is the first trial comparing Pain Exposure Physical
Therapy to conventional treatment in complex regional pain syndrome type 1. The
number of patients switching between groups and the lack of data on productivity
losses are limitations of this study.</p><p>Directly after randomization but prior to treatment initiation, 14 patients deviated
from the trial protocol and received a different treatment than to which they were
assigned. The exact reason why this happened is unknown, but it stresses the
importance of a thorough and careful explanation of what patients might expect when
they participate in a randomized controlled trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Perhaps, this is particularly important in patients who suffer from a
debilitating and very painful condition such as complex regional pain syndrome type
1. As a result, the primary intention-to-treat analysis was based on mixed groups
and this may have yielded a conservative effect estimate. Further, not all patients
who were allocated to the intervention group and received Pain Exposure Physical
Therapy adhered to the treatment protocol. Nine patients received some form of
medication or other conventional treatment. Most of this treatment was prescribed by
their general practitioners, who were not involved in the trial. It was often not
clear whether this medication was primarily related to complex regional pain
syndrome type 1, but it could have had an effect on the patients&#x02019; complaints. That
is why we included these costs in the analyses.</p><p>Regarding generalizability, the conventional treatment adhered to the Dutch national
guideline, and although this guideline was based on internationally published
research articles,<sup><xref rid="bibr15-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> standard treatment may be different in other countries.</p><p>The difference in medication costs turned out to be smaller than anticipated, and
even reversed in the intention-to-treat analysis probably due to the reasons
described above. The difference in travel expenses is due to fewer consultations,
both with the physical therapist and the anesthesiologist, in the Pain Exposure
Physical Therapy group. The difference in physical therapy costs are relatively
small, because in Pain Exposure Physical Therapy there are two physical therapists
working together throughout each treatment session.</p><p>We initially intended to collect the cost data from the patients themselves. However,
this turned out to be logistically unfeasible and resulted in data that were too
incomplete. We therefore decided to collect the required information directly from
the hospital administration system and from health insurance companies after
informed consent of the patients involved. This allowed for reliable overviews of
the actual healthcare costs. Unfortunately, we did not receive the required
information on healthcare costs from all the contacted health insurance companies.
That is why cost data were available for only 48 out of the 56 patients. These data
were missing at random, because they did not correlate with the measured value.
Therefore, we did not impute missing data and we only used the data available for
our cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p>For the cost-analysis, we did not include costs caused by omission to work or
productivity losses. Although we cannot make a substantiated statement, Pain
Exposure Physical Therapy seems to be more relevant for society because of the
shorter duration of treatment and perhaps quicker return to work.</p><p>As mentioned before, this is the first trial studying the effects and
cost-effectiveness of Pain Exposure Physical Therapy in patients with complex
regional pain syndrome type 1. The Cochrane systematic review on physical therapy in
patients with complex regional pain syndrome type 1 found 18 randomized trial
studying a variety of physical therapy interventions such as electrotherapy
modalities (ultrasound, transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation (TENS), laser,
interferential therapy, and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy), both supervised
and non-supervised exercise (active, active-assisted, passive, stretching,
strengthening, mobilizing, and functional), manual lymphatic drainage, pain
management advice, and sensory-motor rehabilitation strategies (graded motor
imagery, mirror therapy, virtual body swapping, and tactile sensory discrimination training).<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> About 15 of the 18 trials had high risk of bias. There was very-low-quality
evidence suggesting that cortically oriented grade motor imagery and mirror therapy
might be useful to improve pain and disability.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> None of the trials studied Pain Exposure Physical Therapy, and only one study
investigated cost-effectiveness and found that physical therapy was cost-effective
compared to occupational therapy and usual care.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr23-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>In conclusion, we can state the analysis of our trial was hampered by the proportion
of patients who switched groups prior to treatment initiation and the lack of data
on productivity losses. Despite that, the results are in line with previously
reported positive studies on this intervention by our group.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr10-0269215518757050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The differences in costs are
in favor of the intervention group. Pain Exposure Physical Therapy can be considered
a promising treatment for complex regional pain syndrome type 1, but its
(cost)effectiveness needs to be further explored in sufficiently powered and
methodologically sound randomized controlled trials.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215518757050" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical Messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-0269215518757050"><list-item><p>Pain exposure physical therapy is less costly than conventional
