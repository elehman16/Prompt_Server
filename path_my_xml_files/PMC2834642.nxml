Higher exacerbation rates have been related to a faster decline in lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and a larger reduction in quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In addition, mortality has been shown to increase with frequent, severe exacerbations, particularly if these require hospitalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Exacerbations account for between one-third to one-half of the health economic burden of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Reducing exacerbations is now one of the goals of COPD maintenance treatment, and long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids have been moderately efficacious in this regard [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The role of respiratory bacterial pathogens in COPD has been clarified in recent years. It is likely that 40-50% of exacerbations are related to bacterial infection, particularly strains that are new to the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This engenders airway and systemic inflammation that results in worsening airway physiology, ultimately manifesting as respiratory and systemic symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The presence of bacteria in the airways in stable COPD, long thought to be innocuous, may also contribute to COPD pathogenesis by causing inflammation and thereby structural airway damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>It is possible, therefore, that reduction of airway bacterial load and/or prevention of new strain acquisition in COPD patients by the use of antibiotics may reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations. Results of previous trials of prophylactic use of antibiotics in COPD conducted prior to 1970 demonstrate inconsistent and small benefits of such therapy. However, these studies were limited by the small numbers of patients included, the use of low doses of narrow-spectrum antibiotics, and by inadequate efficacy assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Though widely used for treatment, respiratory fluoroquinolones have not been investigated in the prevention of COPD exacerbations. These drugs have several characteristics that make them attractive as prophylactic agents in COPD, such as potent <italic>in-vitro </italic>antimicrobial activity against the major pathogens in COPD, excellent penetration into respiratory tissues, high oral bioavailability, and proven efficacy in the treatment of exacerbations, including increasing the exacerbation-free interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the PULSE study was conducted to determine whether intermittent pulsed therapy with the respiratory fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, was more efficacious than placebo in the reduction of exacerbations of COPD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Stable COPD patients recruited for this study had to be at least 45 years of age, have smoked for at least 20 pack years, had a ratio of pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) to forced vital capacity (FVC) &#x02264; 0.70 as well as a percent predicted forced expiration volume in 1 second (PFEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x02264; 80%. In addition, they had to have chronic bronchitis as defined by the American Thoracic Society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and at least two exacerbations requiring treatment with antibiotics and/or oral steroids in the 12 months prior to enrolment. Further inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>: Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Pre-specified protocol violations resulted in patients being excluded from the per-protocol (PP) population (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>: Pre-specified protocol violations). The study was approved by local ethics review committees and all patients gave written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>PULSE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicentre international clinical trial that was conducted at 76 centres in 15 countries. Within 1 week of screening, eligible patients were randomly assigned to treatment with either moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 5 days or matching placebo for 5 days. Treatment was repeated every 8 weeks for a total of 6 courses. After randomization, patients were seen every 8 weeks for clinical evaluation to record any exacerbations and adverse events, and to dispense the medication course. Adherence to treatment was assessed by collecting and counting remaining pills at the subsequent study visit. At each visit, spirometry was performed and disease-related health status was assessed by using the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). An end-of-treatment (EOT) visit was performed at 48 weeks after randomization. Three additional follow-up visits at 8-weekly intervals were conducted for a total study duration of 72 weeks.</p><p>Clinical laboratory assessments, including blood chemistry and haematology, were performed pre-treatment, 24 weeks after randomization, and at the end of treatment.</p><p>Patients were requested to continue with their usual medication during the study, including long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled steroids; any adjustment made to this therapy during the study was one reason for exclusion from the PP population. Patients were instructed to continue with study medication in the event of an exacerbation.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The primary efficacy end point was the frequency of exacerbations during the treatment period, from randomization to the EOT visit at 48 weeks. The primary definition of exacerbation was an extended definition added before unblinding to maximize clinically relevant events. This definition included any confirmed acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) or unconfirmed pneumonia or any other lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) with the exception of confirmed pneumonia, all requiring intervention (start of systemic antibiotic and/or start of systemic steroid and/or hospitalization within 7 days of the start date of exacerbation) and with a minimum of 2 weeks between the start of two consecutive exacerbations.</p><p>The secondary definition included any confirmed AECB (but excluded confirmed/unconfirmed pneumonia and any other LRTIs), minimally 2 weeks between start of two consecutive exacerbations whether or not intervention was documented.</p><p>Definitions of AECB and confirmed and unconfirmed pneumonia are given in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>: Definitions of exacerbations.</p><p>Secondary efficacy outcomes included hospitalization and mortality, changes in disease-related health status assessed with the SGRQ and changes in lung function measured as %PFEV<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Adverse events (coded using the MedDRA system) and medications were collected at each study visit.

A total of 1404 eligible patients were enrolled. Of these, 1157 were randomized to either moxifloxacin (N = 573) or placebo (N = 584). Four patients in each group did not receive the study drug, leaving 569 and 580 patients in the ITT population for moxifloxacin and placebo, respectively. The primary analysis population was PP EOT, for which 351 and 387 patients in the moxifloxacin- and placebo-treated groups were eligible. Reasons for exclusion from the PP EOT population were similar between the moxifloxacin and placebo treatment arms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Demographic and baseline clinical characteristics of the ITT and PP EOT populations are shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>: Demographic, clinical and medical characteristics at baseline. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline characteristics between the ITT and PP EOT populations, or between patients randomized to moxifloxacin or placebo. Premature terminations during the 48-week study period were more frequent in the moxifloxacin group (n = 102, 17.8%) than in the comparator group (n = 78, 13.4%) (p = 0.036). The main reason for premature discontinuation was consent withdrawal in both treatment arms (n = 33, 5.8% and n = 28, 4.8% in the moxifloxacin- and placebo-treated patients, respectively).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Progression of patients through the study</bold>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1465-9921-11-10-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Frequency of exacerbations</title><sec><title>Overall population</title><p>Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> illustrate the distribution of the number of exacerbations for the PP EOT and the ITT populations, respectively.

This corresponds to NNTs of 28 and 19, respectively. Pre-specified subgroup analyses demonstrated that the reduction in exacerbations with moxifloxacin was seen in COPD of all severity categories, among smokers and ex-smokers, and in patients receiving concomitant COPD treatments including inhaled steroids and long-acting bronchodilators. In a <italic>post-hoc </italic>analysis, a larger (45%) reduction in the odds of exacerbation, corresponding to an NNT of 7, was seen among patients who reported purulent/mucopurulent sputum at baseline. The extent of reduction in exacerbations in these patients is similar to that seen with long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled steroids in recent clinical trials in COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In a study with bronchoscopic sampling, sputum purulence was shown to be a reliable indicator of significant bronchial infection in patients with exacerbations of COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. It is possible that sputum purulence is also a marker for chronic bronchial infection in stable COPD, thereby explaining the greater benefit with prophylactic antibiotic treatment in these patients.</p><p>Intermittent moxifloxacin did not significantly improve overall health status, reduce rates of hospitalization or mortality, or slow the ongoing decline in lung function in COPD. The size and duration of the study were not adequate for these secondary end points. In the patient population recruited in this study, hospitalization and mortality rates were low, making it difficult to observe a difference between the two treatment groups. In terms of lung function, it is, perhaps, ambitious to expect improvements in underlying COPD in such a relatively short study of only six 5-day courses of an antibiotic.</p><p>There were more adverse events with moxifloxacin than with placebo, however, the overall levels of drug-related adverse events were low in both groups (9.3% with moxifloxacin and 3.8% with placebo) and comparable to findings in another large study with moxifloxacin in AECOPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The most common treatment-related adverse events related to the gastrointestinal tract, which also resulted in more premature terminations (3.6% vs 1.8%, in the moxifloxacin- and placebo-treated groups, respectively; p = 0.07). <italic>C. difficile </italic>infection was not reported in any of the patients taking moxifloxacin.</p><p>A major concern with antibiotic use is the emergence of resistant organisms. Regular monitoring of sputum flora and, in a subgroup, of faecal flora was therefore an essential part of the PULSE study. There was a transient increase in MIC of one strain of <italic>S. pneumoniae </italic>and three isolates of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. However, these isolates did not persist or cause exacerbations, and resistance emergence was not seen among patients in either moxifloxacin or placebo arms. The dosing regimen in PULSE was based on pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic principles, with intermittent dosing of a potent antibiotic at full doses, rather than use of therapeutic or subtherapeutic doses for prolonged periods. We speculate that such a dosing regimen was related to the lack of resistance emergence seen in this study although longer periods of observation are needed to confirm this. Patients who had colonization of moxifloxacin-resistant <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>at baseline were excluded from this study but those with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>sensitive to moxifloxacin were included. The detection of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>with a higher MIC during the study than those present at screening/randomization suggests that patients colonized by this organism in the airway should not be considered for the therapeutic regimen described in this study. Further long-term studies are required to determine whether this type of intermittent preventive antibiotic therapy circumvents the development of resistant organisms.</p><p>There are three main limitations of the present study. The first is that there were fewer than expected exacerbations, despite the use of a wider definition of an exacerbation to maximize the number of events; only 0.88 were reported in the placebo group compared with the predicted 1.4 exacerbations per patient during the 48-week study period, with approximately 50% of the placebo group experiencing no exacerbations during 48 weeks. This 'placebo' effect of reduced exacerbations has been observed in other clinical trials and is probably related to closer monitoring and better compliance with maintenance COPD treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Secondly, maintenance therapies for COPD, such as long-acting bronchodilators and inhaled steroids, which could affect frequency of exacerbations, were not standardized across all patients in this study. However, the frequency of such treatments did not differ between the treatment arms and benefit with moxifloxacin was seen in subgroups receiving such concomitant treatment. Finally, it is possible that some exacerbations were unreported due to the absence of daily monitoring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>The use of inhaled steroid and long-acting bronchodilators, both anticholinergic and beta-agonists, does result in a reduction in exacerbations. However, in a recent trial, when inhaled salmeterol/fluticasone was added to tiotropium, there was no additional reduction in frequency of exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Current optimal therapy for COPD often does not result in an exacerbation-free patient. Increased incidence of pneumonia with inhaled steroids is an adverse effect when these drugs are used to reduce exacerbations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Alternative approaches to reducing exacerbations are therefore required in some patients with COPD.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Prevention of acute and chronic infection in COPD would be best achieved by augmenting the innate and adaptive immune responses with vaccines and novel drugs. Until this is possible, treatment with intermittent pulsed moxifloxacin could be indicated in certain subgroups of patients. Such patients include those with baseline purulent/mucopurulent or purulent sputum production, who are not colonized by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and who have an unacceptable frequency of exacerbations in spite of maximal therapy with inhaled agents for COPD or who experience complications such as pneumonia with these treatments. Though PULSE demonstrates that intermittent treatment with moxifloxacin is an effective option for preventing acute exacerbations in patients with COPD, further studies are required to determine the optimal patient population as well as dosing regimen and therapy duration for this approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Sanjay Sethi has received research grants (26,000 USD) from Bayer HealthCare and honoraria for attendance at advisory boards and speaking work (23,000 USD) over the last 3 years.</p><p>Paul Jones has received honoraria (total 5,500 USD) from Bayer HealthCare AG for lecturing and attendance at advisory boards.</p><p>Marlize Schmitt Theron is a salaried employee of Bayer Pty Ltd.</p><p>Marc Miravitlles has received honoraria (total 11,000 USD) from Bayer HealthCare AG for consultancy and speaking work over the last two years.</p><p>Ethan Rubinstein has no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p><p>Jadwiga A.
