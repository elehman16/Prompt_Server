However, some wounds may break open or be left to heal from the bottom up (i.e. healing by secondary intention). Surgical Wounds Healing by Secondary Intention (SWHSI) are often more complex to manage, and require additional treatments during the course of healing. There is significant uncertainty regarding the best treatment for these complex wounds, with limited robust evidence regarding the clinical and cost-effectiveness of different dressings and treatments; one such treatment is Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) which is frequently used in the management of SWHSI. Previous randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of NPWT have failed to recruit to time and target, thus we aimed to conduct a pilot RCT to assess the feasibility of conducting a future, full-scale RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This pilot RCT will test the methods and feasibility of recruiting, randomising, and retaining participants into a larger trial of NPWT verses usual care for patients with SWHSI. Participants will be randomised to receive either NPWT or usual care (no NPWT) and will be followed up for 3&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide a full assessment of methods for, and feasibility of, recruiting, randomising, and retaining patients with SWHSI in a trial of NPWT versus usual care. On the basis of this pilot trial, a full trial may be proposed in the future which will provide additional, robust evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of NPWT in the management of SWHSI.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinical Trial Registry: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12761776?q=&#x00026;filters=conditionCategory:Skin%20and%20Connective%20Tissue%20Diseases&#x00026;sort=&#x00026;offset=6&#x00026;totalResults=197&#x00026;page=1&#x00026;pageSize=10&#x00026;searchType=basic-search">ISRCTN12761776</ext-link>, registered on 10 December 2015 &#x02013; retrospective registration.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1661-1) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Surgical wounds</kwd><kwd>Negative pressure wound therapy</kwd><kwd>Secondary intention</kwd><kwd>Healing</kwd><kwd>Randomised controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007602</institution-id><institution>Programme Grants for Applied Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RPPG060910171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chetter</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>A substantial number of surgical operations are conducted in the NHS each year, with most involving an incision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The edges of these incisions are often held together whilst healing occurs (primary closure); however, many surgical wounds break open or are left open to heal (healing by secondary intention). Surgical Wounds Healing by Secondary Intention (SWHSI) present a significant management challenge as they may remain open for many months and/or require multiple, additional treatments (e.g. prolonged hospitalisation, reoperation, infection management) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. As a result, management of SWHSI presents a significant financial burden to the NHS and also impacts substantially on patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>There is much research evidence available to guide the management of SWHSI; however, as NICE reflected in their 2012 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], there is a need for robust, experimental evidence to assess the most clinical and cost-effective dressings and treatments for surgical site management. Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) has become a widely used intervention for SWHSI, albeit more frequently within acute rather than community settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. NPWT devices apply negative pressure to a wound via a dressing which theoretically promotes wound healing by removing exudate and reducing infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The device is generally only used for part of the SWHSI treatment pathway rather than to the point of healing.</p><p>A Cochrane Review in 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] specifically investigated NPWT as a treatment for SWHSI; however, the review found only two trials eligible for inclusion. On the basis of this limited evidence and the fact that NPWT is widely used in the NHS to treat SWHSI, there is an urgent need to assess the effectiveness of this intervention in this specific patient population.</p><p>Previous trials of NPWT have struggled to recruit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and so it would seem to be essential, before embarking on a full RCT, to assess the feasibility of conducting such research. Our study, therefore, seeks to ascertain the feasibility of conducting a full RCT in this area, specifically investigating the appropriate methods to use to collect meaningful and worthwhile data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design</title><p>This study is a pilot RCT conducted in three centres to test the methods and feasibility of a full RCT of NPWT compared with usual care (no NPWT) for SWHSI. Informed consent will be obtained from each patient prior to randomisation into the study. Eligible patients will be individually randomised to one of two treatment arms: (1) NPWT or (2) usual care (no NPWT).</p><p>The key objectives of this trial are to determine the methods and feasibility of conducting a larger RCT in this area.

The pilot trial will be preceded by promotion of the study with surgeons and nurses in both settings.</p><p>All patients who experience a SWHSI (at any point following surgery) will be screened for trial eligibility by their clinical care team. Potential participants will then be approached with further details of the study by surgical or nursing staff (clinical or research) during ward rounds, routine care or home visits, depending on patient circumstance.</p><p>Potential participants will be provided with a patient information sheet and will be given at least 24&#x000a0;h to consider their involvement in this research. Patients will then have the opportunity to discuss the study with the research team prior to completing the study consent form.</p><p>We aim to randomise 50 patients for this pilot trial over a 7-month period. As evidenced by Edwards et al. in 2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], nonconditional, monetary incentives are shown to double response rates to postal questionnaires; participants will, therefore, be sent a &#x000a3;5 unconditional cash token with their final questionnaire (at 3&#x000a0;months post randomisation). Participants who consent to receiving weekly text messages, and provide a mobile telephone number to facilitate this, will also be reimbursed &#x000a3;5 to cover any costs incurred in responding to weekly pain assessment text messages.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Patients will be randomised into one of two arms: (1) NPWT or (2) usual care (no NPWT) on a 1:1 basis. To remove the potential for selection bias, allocations will be concealed through use of a central randomisation service implemented by an independent member of staff at the York Trials Unit, University of York. Study sites will contact a remote telephone service to provide details of the participant and to receive details of the treatment allocation. Randomisation will be conducted using a pregenerated sequence of random permuted blocks with stratification by wound area (&#x0003c;28&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>, &#x02265;28&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Due to the nature of the intervention it is not possible to blind participants or health care professionals to trial treatment. Feasibility of blinded outcome assessment of healing will, however, be assessed as part of this trial. Assessors blind to trial treatment allocation will be provided with copies of wound photographs and will be asked to confirm whether (1) they deem the wound to be healed (full wound epithelialisation), and (2) they believe they know the allocated treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Sample size</title><p>As this is a pilot trial, and the primary objective is to determine measures of feasibility and acceptability rather than to detect a treatment effect, a formal sample size calculation has not been conducted. We will, however, aim to randomise approximately 50 patients as a means to assess recruitment, randomisation, and retention of participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Experimental group: Negative Pressure Wound Therapy</title><p>There are several NPWT systems available within the NHS; however, for the purposes of this trial we originally permitted the use of the following CE-marked products currently used in acute and community settings in Hull and Leeds: (1) V.A.C.&#x000ae; (KCI), and (2) Renasys&#x000ae; (Smith and Nephew). A further device (PICO&#x000ae; &#x02013; Smith and Nephew) has subsequently been added as a trial device in a recent protocol amendment.</p><p>NPWT treatments consist of a vacuum pump into which a disposable plastic canister is placed to enable wound exudate to be collected. The canister is attached to pressure resistant tubing to create an airtight seal. The wound to be treated is filled with a suitable dressing (foam or gauze) along with a nonadherent layer, if required, to protect blood vessels or organs and/or to prevent dressing adherence.</p><p>In this trial, the choice of machine and duration of NPWT will be decided by the treating health professional in conjunction with the participant and nurse. Pressure cycles and dressing change frequency will be completed as per standard practice and recorded. The only stipulation with regards NPWT use is that this must be clinically appropriate. When not being treated with NPWT, participants in this arm of the trial will be treated as per usual care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Comparator group: Usual Care (no NPWT)</title><p>The control group participants will receive usual care. This is likely to be wound dressings which will be changed every 1&#x02013;3 days, or sometimes less frequently, as determined by the treating surgeon or nurse in line with standard practice. The trial protocol does not stipulate the type of dressings which should be used as part of usual care as there is no evidence to suggest that any one dressing is more clinically or cost-effective than another. Control dressings are, therefore, selected by the clinician on the basis of the dressing most appropriate for the patient. The types of primary and secondary dressings used, and the frequency of dressing change, will be recorded throughout the trial.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>A full statistical analysis plan for primary and secondary analyses will be generated prior to completion of recruitment for this trial. The Trial Management Group and the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee (DMEC) will review this prior to commencement of outcome analysis. During the trial regular reports will be prepared for the DMEC with regards data quality and safety.</p><p>The analyses will be conducted following the principles of intention-to-treat. All outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics overall and by trial group.</p><p>The primary clinical outcome of time to healing will be presented using Kaplan-Meier curves for interest only, recognising that the study is not powered to detect clinically important treatment effects. This analysis will be conducted using blinded outcome assessment dates of healing if possible. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis will be conducted, subject to sufficient data, to investigate the inclusion of additional covariates shown to be important in an earlier SWHSI cohort (e.g. contamination level of surgery, wound infection), along with the stratification factor (baseline wound size) used in the randomisation for this trial. The impact of SWHSI history, location of SWHSI on the body and infection at any time during follow-up (as a time dependent covariate) will also be explored.</p><p>Cost-effectiveness will be explored by calculating a mean total cost per trial arm using resource use and relevant unit costs for each participant. Should sufficient data be available, EuroQoL 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire data will be used to calculate a mean quality-adjusted life year (QALY) for each trial arm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Patient and Public Involvement</title><p>Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) comes from a patient user group comprising 10 members who have contributed to the design and conduct of the study. This has included input on the outcomes collected, study documentation design and wording, and will include input into planned dissemination of research findings. The group members are patients who have participated in an earlier SWHSI cohort study. PPI members will be appropriately reimbursed for their participation in line with INVOLVE guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>The Trial Steering and Data Monitoring and Ethics Committees</title><p>As this is a pilot trial, the study will be monitored closely by an in-house Trial Management Team who will meet on a monthly basis.

As would be expected with a feasibility trial, some barriers have been identified which may impact on recruitment and time to completion of the pilot or larger RCT in the future.</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Engagement of sites</title><p>During the set-up of the trial, the research sites have worked closely with their clinical colleagues to promote the trial. Promotion included contact with specialist teams, letters to surgeons, and posters advertising the study to clinical staff. Despite these efforts engagement of surgical and clinical colleagues has been mixed which has resulted in slower than anticipated recruitment. Continued efforts at a local level have helped to alleviate the lack of engagement as the trial has progressed resulting in an improvement in recruitment rate. Substantial work during set-up, and use of additional strategies to engage clinical staff should, however, be explored ahead of commencement of a larger RCT.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Governance issues</title><p>Governance delays arose in one NHS trust due to circumstances outside of the trial&#x02019;s control. This subsequently delayed opening of two colocated study sites, which impacted upon recruitment rate in the early stages of the trial. Despite this reduced recruitment in the early stages of the trial, recruitment has subsequently increased in all trusts, with the study meeting the target monthly recruitment in the following 4&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>At the time of submission the trial is open to recruitment.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec22"><title>Additional file</title><p>
