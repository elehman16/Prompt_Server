balance in patients with chronic stroke. [Subjects and Methods] Participants included 30
patients with stroke who were randomly assigned to the proprioceptive training group
(n=15) or control group (n=15). Participants in the proprioceptive training group
underwent proprioceptive training and received general physical therapy each for a total
of 20 thirty-minute sessions, five times per week, during a period of four weeks; the
control group received general physical therapy for a total of 20 sixty-minute sessions,
five times per week, during a period of four weeks. [Results] All participants were
evaluated with the Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and Activities-specific
Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale instrument before and after intervention. After training,
the differences in BBS, TUG, and ABC scores in the proprioceptive group were significantly
greater than those in the control group. [Conclusion] In conclusion, proprioceptive
training was effective on balance ability. Therefore, proprioceptive training may be
efficient when combining general physical therapy with phase proprioceptive training for
patients with impairments of balance. Further research is needed to investigate
proprioceptive training methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Proprioception training</kwd><kwd>Balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Patients with stroke typically show decreased motor skills and impairment to their senses,
cognition, and visual perception; moreover, they encounter impaired physical function,
making independent walking difficult due to a reduction in balance ability, walking speed,
and gait endurance<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Most patients with stroke
will have twice the postural perturbation while standing than will a normal person<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> and have a reduction in stability limits as
well<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such a reduction in balance
ability makes it difficult for patients to walk and produce functional movement, which can
lead to difficulties in everyday life; furthermore, if a patient with stroke experiences a
fall, it can further negatively affect their walking ability<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, balance retraining is one of the most important
categories for rehabilitation in patients with neurological impairment such as
hemiparalysis<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sensory systems utilized for balance are the proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual
systems<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Generally, patients with
stroke experience damage to all three sensory systems, with proprioception being affected
the most in approximately 11&#x02013;85% of the patient population<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Proprioception provides basic information for balance, and is
spread throughout the skin, ligaments, tendons, and muscles<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>; information such as postural recognition, body location, joint
speed, angle, and its ratio of movement that control each movement of each bodily activity
is transmitted to the central nervous system, which allows for the production of normal
movement, maintains dynamic safety for the joints, and protects the joints from external
damage<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Such damage to proprioception
can exhibit great difficulties in maintaining postural control for patients with stroke<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>; in particular, damaged lower limb
proprioception can affect postural body sway<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. As a result, proprioception recovery is an important factor during
rehabilitation for these patients, and has an important role in preventing functional
instability and further injury to the damaged joints<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, studies on methods for improving proprioception
following damage have found that providing unstable surfaces for patients with stroke during
rehabilitation can increase external agitation, quickly modify sensory and motor skills by
effectively changing postural orientation capability, and help patients independently change
their own posture<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In targeting patients
with ankle joint instability, Matsusaka et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> found that balance training on unstable surfaces reduced the time
required to normalize the patients&#x02019; postural sway, and Eun-jung Kim et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> concluded that training helped improve
walking speed, walking posture, and lower limb muscles strength. Furthermore, Hong-won Suh
and Myung-chul Kim<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> claimed that
training on unstable surfaces was more effective than that on stable surfaces in improving
proprioception in patients with chronic stroke. As mentioned before, studies conducted thus
far have focused on analyzing the patient&#x02019;s standing posture balance on an unstable surface.
However, there is a lack of research on a training program involving a dynamic versus a
static environment. Moreover, because muscle activity patterns are different between static
postures and dynamic postures, researchers suggest that posture adjustment rehabilitation
should be conducted more dynamically to understand its carryover effect on function and
effectiveness<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the
following study aimed to assess the effectiveness of phased proprioception training on the
balancing ability of patients with stroke.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty patients with stroke, admitted at C hospital located in Gyeonggido, were enrolled;

balance ability reduction among patients with stroke were a reduction in joint movement,
changes in muscle tension, muscle weakness, damaged visual perception, and decline in
proprioception. Additionally, a reduction in balance ability along with proprioception can
lead to problems with lower extremity joints and spatial awareness while walking, which
ultimately increases difficulty in maintaining balance for the patient<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. These issues can hinder daily activities, motor recovery,
and ultimately increase fall risk<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>To compare the balance ability of patients before and after proprioception training, we
utilized the BBS, TUG test, and ABC scale to measure changes in the patient&#x02019;s balance
ability. These methods are generally used quite often for evaluating the changes in balance
ability; moreover, they can evaluate balance ability without the need for specialized
equipment, and are therefore widely used for clinical testing<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Among them, the TUG test quantifies dynamic balance ability and
functional mobility. Additionally, this method has been proven to be reliable and valid in
measuring clinical changes over time<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Healthy men have been shown to have average TUG values of between 8&#x02013;13.1 seconds<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the test takes &#x0003c;10 sec to complete
in normal people with no neurological damage<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finch et al.<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>
showed that values below 10 seconds indicated that the person has independent balance
ability, values between 20 and 30 seconds showed that, although independent, the person
posed an increased fall risk, and values higher than 30 seconds indicated that the person
was dependent in activities of daily living.</p><p>Elizabeth et al.<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted basic
tactile, spatial, and proprioception training in sitting and standing positions with the
eyes closed in 21 acute stroke patients for two weeks, and found statistically significant
improvements in postural control and TUG scores. Similarly, Park<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup> found that TUG scores reduced from 20.5 seconds to 15.3
seconds in stroke patients that had engaged in an ankle joint proprioception training
program. The TUG tests conducted in this research showed similar results. This can be
interpreted as the result of improved balance ability through an increase in lower limb
spatial positional sense and body weight support capacity through proprioception training.
The BBS is widely used as a method for measuring balance ability in hemiplegic patients due
to senile diseases and stroke while moving or in a standing posture<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Geiger et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted balance and movement research on stroke patients and
reported that BBS scores increased from 45.36 to 51.54 after participation in a visual
feedback exercise program. Byung-yong Hwang<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup> also found an increase in BBS scores from 49.5 to 50.6 in the
proprioception training group. The BBS scores in the current study also showed an increase
from 45.47 to 47.07 in the proprioception training group. This can be explained as an
improvement in maintaining postural stability through reflexive postural control and dynamic
responsiveness and a protective reflex on unstable surfaces through muscle contraction
around the ankle joints.</p><p>The ABC scale is an evaluation method composed of an ordinal scale, which has been
recognized for its reliability and validity, and found to be appropriate for use in
evaluating various factors influencing balance in a clinical environment<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Wang-hoon Ahn et al.<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a comparative analysis between a balance
training group and control group including chronic stroke patients on unstable surfaces, and
confirmed a statistically significant difference in ABC scale values between the test group
and control group before and after the intervention. Similar to previous studies, the
current study also found statistically significant improvements in the proprioception
training group. This can be interpreted as the result of increased balance confidence
through an improvement in the balancing and walking ability of stroke patients after
proprioception training; moreover, these improvements led to increased participation and
activity of the patients.</p><p>Our research confirmed improvements in balance ability of stroke patients after
participating in proprioception training in the current study. In terms of muscle activity,
the involved muscles contract to maintain balance on the unstable surface. Furthermore, the
reason for increased muscle activity resulting from increased instability is that the body
is reacting in an effort to ensure balance and stability in an unstable environment<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Additionally, balance training on unstable
surfaces enhance joint mobility, normalize neuromuscular control, and improve unconscious
motor response to afferent nerve stimulation required for dynamic joint control<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. This continued stimulation facilitates
increased muscle spindle sensitivity through gamma-motorneurons, which is then transferred
to a-motorneurons that activate muscle fibers resulting in improved motor output. This was
found to have a positive effect on joint stability<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the improvement in balance ability in the current study
can be explained to be the result of increased muscle activity through proprioception
training on unstable surfaces, ultimately leading to improved joint stability.</p><p>Proprioception is based on feedback and feedforward control mechanisms and provides
information on the movement and location of individual body parts. This mechanism assists in
correcting and maintaining posture, and controlled and coordinated movements between the
head, body, upper and lower limbs<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Balance training on unstable surfaces is very effective in increasing proprioceptive inputs
and allows the proprioceptive receptors to process the information more efficiently<xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><sup>)</sup>, resulting in changes in the recruitment
patterns of the nerve roots<xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Furthermore, balance training on unstable surfaces increases nerve conduction velocity speed
of group II functional neurons, which in turn reduces the time required for muscle
activation in postural control<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Moreover, afferent nerve input through the cerebral cortex is improved, which allows for a
more effective response to external agitation while walking<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref><sup>)</sup>. In conclusion, phase proprioceptive training is effective in
patients with chronic stroke with reduced balanced ability. Further research in this area is
warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Belgen</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Beninato</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>The association of balance capacity and falls
