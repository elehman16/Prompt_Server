Introduction</title><p> In recent years, various uses of wax and fat microspheres in the pharmaceutical field have come into forefront, involving the microspheres technology [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The goal of any drug delivery system is to provide a therapeutic amount of drug(s) to the proper site in the body in order to promptly achieve and thereby to maintain the desired drug concentrations during treatment. This idealized objective can be achieved by targeting the drugs to a specific organ or tissue with the help of controlling the release rate of the drug during the transit time in gastrointestinal tract. Poorly water-soluble drugs, which are lipophilic in nature mix, easily with fat and show good absorption rate. Among the reported conventional methods different strategies have been developed in recent years to design different types of wax microspheres loaded with hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs using toxic solvents. The use of such solvents during formulation is of environmental concern and also faces challenge to human safety. To overcome these problems, in the present investigation, water is used to prepare wax microspheres by meltable dispersed emulsified cooling-induced solidification method. Furthermore, the process was optimized to produce microspheres to give better yield with spherical geometry and predictable dissolution pattern.</p><p> Cetyl alcohol (CA), used in the current study, has good pharmaceutical and biological properties [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. CA is hard, but oily to the touch, and is devoid of taste or smell, making it very useful as an ingredient in cosmetics, as a pharmaceutical excipient. It is an innocuous material generally regarded as essentially nontoxic and nonirritant, biodegradable, biocompatible, nonimmunogenic, gastroresistant, of high carrier capacity, and having controlled release of drug, low production costs, reproducible properties, and good shelf life. But the hypersensitivity reported in some cases may be due to impurities in commercial grades of CA. In pharmaceutical formulations, it is used in the preparation of suppositories, delayed release solid dosage forms, emulsions, lotions, creams, and ointment. Regulatory status: it is included in the FDA as inactive ingredient and in nonparenteral medicines licensed in the UK [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>IM is a nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory agent with antipyretic, analgesic properties and is an indole derivative designated chemically as 1-(p-chlorobenzoyl)-5-methoxy-2-methyl-1H-indole-3-acetic acid. IM is an odorless, pale yellow to yellow tan crystalline substance. It is lipid-soluble, practically insoluble in water and sparingly soluble in alcohol. IM has a pKa of 4.5 and is stable in neutral or slightly acidic media and decomposes in strong alkali. The suspension has a pH of 4.0&#x02013;5.0 and it has a melting point between 155&#x000b0;C and 161&#x000b0;C and has molecular weight of 357.8. IM has a molecular formula of C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>16</sub>ClN0<sub>4</sub> [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nowadays IM is widely used in the treatment of active stages of moderate-to-severe stages of rheumatoid arthritis. IM should be dosed at least 2&#x02013;3 times per day. Due to its narrow therapeutic index, the frequency of adverse effects is dosing related [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Considering the long therapeutic regimen of osteoarthritis therapy, the administration of IM may induce adverse side effects on gastrointestinal tract (GIT) as well as central nervous system (CNS), renal and cardiac systems [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The occurrence of these adverse effects can be reduced by the use of controlled release formulations [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Oral conventional dosage forms are administered 2-3 times a day to maintain adequate and effective therapeutic concentration in blood; however, it fails to protect the patients against morning stiffness [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Development of controlled release formulation of IM has several advantages over the other conventional dosage forms, such as reduction in occurrence of high initial peak plasma concentrations, protection against morning stiffness, prolonged duration of action, improved bioavailability, patient compliance and reduction in adverse effects [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The side effects could be lowered by controlling the drug release and by adjusting the absorption rate. This can be achieved by employing suitable modification in the manufacturing process [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Previous experimental results have demonstrated that the waxes are biocompatible, nonimmunogenic material used for the entrapment of drug and its controlled drug release in the intestinal tract [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Delivering the drug in the intestinal environment from fatty CA microspheres could be manipulated by suitable coating techniques [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The chief characteristics of enteric coating are their impermeability to gastric juice, but susceptibility to intestinal juice [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Desired plasma levels can be achieved without the risk of side effects using once-a-day dose of controlled release preparation [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These findings suggested that the kinetic control is an effective route for preventing the toxicity of IM.</p><p> The aim of the present study was to formulate, characterize, and study the <italic>in vitro</italic> release of IM from microspheres and compare with commercially available oral formulation Microcid SR (75&#x02009;mg capsule) furthermore, to investigate the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of two different oral IM formulation (optimized microsphere formulation and Microcid SR 75&#x02009;mg capsule) following a single dosing in healthy Albino sheeps in order to prove the bioequivalence between the preparations.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Methods</title><sec id="sec2.2.1"><title>2.2.1. Preparation of Microspheres</title><p>9&#x02009;gm of CA was melted in a china dish kept on water bath. To the melted wax mixture, IM (3&#x02009;gm) previously passed through sieve no. 100 was dispersed in melted wax mass and stirred to obtain a homogeneous mixture. The resultant mixture was then poured into 150&#x02009;mL of phthalate buffer solution (pH 4.5), previously heated to a temperature higher than melting point of CA (&#x0003e;50&#x000b0;C). The surfactant, Tween 80 (0.3% w/w), was added to the above mixture and stirred mechanically at 900&#x02009;rpm using a stirrer (RQ-127A, Remi, India). Spherical particles were produced due to dispersion of molten CA in the aqueous medium. The mixture was stirred continuously above the melting point of CA at 900&#x02009;rpm for 5&#x02009;min. The temperature of the reaction mixture was cooled rapidly and brought down to 10&#x000b0;C by the addition of cold water. The resultant solid spheres were collected by filtration and washed with water to remove surfactant residue. Air-drying was carried out at room temperature for 48&#x02009;h to give discrete, solid, and free flowing microspheres. A total of five formulations were prepared by varying the CA to drug ratios (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2.2"><title>2.2.2.

Results and Discussion</title><p> Evidence has [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] shown in the recent years that wax/fatty materials have the physical properties and behavior suitable to prepare gastroresistant, biocompatible, biodegradable microspheres to release the entrapped drug in the intestinal lumen [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In the present study, a modified novel meltable dispersion emulsified cooling-induced solidification method was employed using inert fat (CA) and nontoxic solvents to entrap the drug. In the present study, various parameters were studied such as drug and CA ratio, stirring speed and time, amount of surfactant added, volume of the aqueous phase used, effect of pH on drug entrapment, temperature of the aqueous phase, and rapid cooling studies. Therefore the influence of the above parameters was highlighted. When the pH value of the external aqueous phase was acidic, the solubility of the drug was reduced and the encapsulated amount of the drug increased. The maximum drug load was obtained at pH 4.2 (phthalate buffer). As the pH increased from 4.2 to 7.0, the percent of IM loading was reduced from 21.52 to 3.92%.</p><p> In the present study, it was found that 150&#x02009;mL of aqueous phase is suitable for producing the spherical microspheres. Resultant microspheres did not have any surface irregularities and are nonaggregated. As the volume of external phase increased, the yield was reduced and the resultant microspheres were irregularly shaped. When the volume of the aqueous phase was less than 150&#x02009;mL, the resultant microspheres were highly aggregated in nature and highly impossible to distinguish as an individual microsphere. In order to avoid the formation of irregularly shaped larger particles, in the present method, 150&#x02009;mL of aqueous phase was used. </p><p>Incorporation of drug into CA microspheres required the addition of tween 80 as a surfactant, at an optimum concentration to reduce the interfacial tension between the hydrophobic material and external aqueous phase. An attempt was made to incorporate drug in the CA microspheres without the addition of a surfactant. But the process has a failed, as it resulted in an aggregate cake-like mass during the solidification of CA. This may be due to repulsion resulting from high interfacial tension between the hydrophobic CA material and external aqueous phase. It was found that tween 80 having an HLB value of 15 was suitable to increase substantially dispersion of CA in external aqueous phase and promote drug incorporation in the CA microspheres. To obtain an optimal surfactant concentration, various concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.6% (w/w) of the total formulation were tested. Discrete microspheres with good flow properties using an optimum concentration of surfactant 0.3% w/w (tween 80) were used. Concentrations of tween 80 ranging from 0.1 to 0.2% w/w failed to produce reproducible microspheres. The resultant CA microspheres were composed of irregular masses, which were not possible to distinguish as individual microspheres [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p> Temperature of the aqueous phase was maintained at 5&#x000b0;C higher than the melting point of the CA in the corresponding formulations. From SEM studies it was observed that the resultant microspheres were free from surface irregularities, except some wrinkles. It was also observed that when the temperature of the aqueous phase was less than 5&#x000b0;C than the melting point of the CA, big flakes were produced.</p><p>In the present study, to produce the spherical discrete microspheres, an optimum drug to CA ratio of 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;3 w/w was used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). It was found that higher amount of drug to CA ratio (2&#x02009;:&#x02009;3) produces aggregate masses during the cooling process. It may be due to reduced melting point of the CA. SEM photographs also indicated the presence of the crystals on the surface of the microspheres. The resultant microspheres were unsuitable for pharmaceutical uses. Hence an optimum 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;3 ratio was used to prepare microspheres [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. </p><p> It was observed that the average size of the microspheres ranged between 12 to 32&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m as presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. The important factor that influences the size distribution of microspheres is the optimum stirring speed and stirring time. A stirring speed of 900&#x02009;rpm and stirring time of 3&#x02009;min were used to obtain reproducible microspheres. It was observed that with the increase in the stirring speed from 900 to 1100&#x02009;rpm there was a decrease in the average size of the spheres and recovery yield of the microspheres. It is due to small-sized wax microspheres, which were lost during successive washings. When the stirring speed was lower than 900&#x02009;rpm, larger pellets were formed. It was also found that an increase in stirring time, from 2 to 4&#x02009;min (at a stirring speed of 900&#x02009;rpm), there was a decrease in the recovery yield of microspheres. When the stirring time was lower than 2&#x02009;min, it was observed that some amount of melted material adhered to the sides of the beaker during the cooling process resulting in lower recovery of yield.</p><p> Microparticulate drug delivery systems are formulated as single unit dosage forms in the form of capsule or tablet. Such microparticulate systems should possess the better and adequate micromeritic properties. The obtained micromeritic properties are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. The values of angle of repose were well within the range, indicating reasonable good flow potential for the microspheres. The tapped density values ranged between 0.42&#x02009;g/cm<sup>3</sup> and 0.51&#x02009;g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The results of % compressibility index ranged from 10.19% to 13.98%, suggests good flow characteristics of the microspheres (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>). The better flow property indicates reasonable and good flow potential of prepared microspheres. </p><p> SEM photographs showed that the CA microspheres were spherical in nature and had a smooth surface with inward dents and shrinkage, which is due to the collapse of the wall of the microspheres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Microphotography reveals the absence of crystals of the drug on the surface of microsphere, indicating uniform distribution of the drug within the microspheres. The rate of solvent removal from the microspheres exerts an influence on the morphology of the final product. Interestingly, for microspheres dried at room temperature for 24&#x02009;h, the sphericity values were nearer to the value 1, whereas for microspheres cured for 24&#x02009;h at 4&#x000b0;C, the obtained sphericity values ranged between 1.13&#x02013;1.19. The removal of residual moisture content from microspheres during curing exerts an influence on the morphology of the final product [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p> DSC studies were performed on pure drug, empty, and drug-loaded microspheres, have shown sharp endothermic peaks. IM exhibits a sharp endothermic peak at 161.3&#x000b0;C presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. It was observed that presence of endothermic peak of the drug at 161.4&#x000b0;C in the drug-loaded CA microspheres indicates that the drug is uniformly distributed in the wall of the microspheres [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. </p><p> FTIR spectra for IM and formulation F<sub>3</sub> are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. The characteristic IR absorption peaks of IM comparing the IR spectra at 3413 (aromatic C&#x02013;H stretching), 2618 (carboxylic acid stretching), 1695 (C=O stretching), 1600 (C=C stretching), 1452 (O&#x02013;CH<sub>3 </sub>deformation), and 1236&#x02009;cm<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (O&#x02013;H deformation) were not altered after successful encapsulation of drug, indicating no chemical interactions between the drug and CA used. A comparison and an interpretation of this region in our spectra agree with their conclusions [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><p> The percent of drug loading in the formulations was found to be in the range of 18.67&#x02013;21.52%. It was low in the formulation F<sub>4</sub> (19.46) and more in F<sub>3</sub> (23.52). </p><p> The encapsulation efficiency (%) was found to be more in formulation F<sub>3</sub> (94.34%) as compared to F<sub>1</sub> (89.54%), F<sub>2</sub> (89.63%), F<sub>5</sub> (88.98%), and F<sub>4</sub> (87.67%). From this result, it can be concluded that the formulation F<sub>3</sub> had more encapsulation efficiency. </p><p>From the release studies depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, it was observed that there is no significant release of drug at gastric pH from fat microspheres. At the end of 8th&#x02009;h, <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release from F<sub>3</sub> (96.32%) was slower than Microcid SR (98.98%) in the intestinal environment. Drug was released in a biphasic manner consisting of initial fast release followed by a slow release in intestinal pH from the CA microspheres [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The decreased <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release from CA microspheres might be due to more hydrophobicity and influence of molecular weight of CA. <italic>In vitro</italic> drug release was considerably retarded from the CA microspheres when compared to Microcid SR. The rate of drug release followed first order release kinetics and numerical data fitted into Peppas model showed that the mechanism of drug release from CA microspheres was fickian diffusion (F<sub>1</sub>-0,412<sub>, </sub>F<sub>2</sub>-0.415<sub>,</sub> F<sub>3</sub>-0.398<sub>,</sub> F<sub>4</sub>-0.421, F<sub>5</sub>-0.431, and Microcid SR-0.476). After an initial burst effect, the subsequent release of drug from microspheres was slow.</p><p> Microcid SR 75&#x02009;mg capsule and formulation F<sub>3</sub> were subjected for stability studies for 90 days. It was observed that <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release from Microcid SR 75&#x02009;mg capsule and formulation F<sub>3</sub> at the end of 90 days (8th&#x02009;h) were 99.43 and 95.09%, respectively. However, no significant change in <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release from both the products was noticed after the study period, indicating good stability for the prepared formulation. </p><p>Drug content uniformity for Microcid SR 75&#x02009;mg capsule and formulation F<sub>3</sub> was found to be 74.83&#x02009;mg and 74.80&#x02009;mg, respectively. The percents of drug content uniformity of Microcid SR 75&#x02009;mg capsule and formulation F<sub>3</sub> are 99.76 and 99.49%, respectively. Hence, the percent of drug content uniformity in both products were well within the limits as per United State Pharmacopoeia and National formulary specification [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p> Recovery of the IM from the plasma was calculated by comparison of peak height ratio after direct injection of IM or MA to the peak height of the same concentrations of the analytes extracted from plasma. In both cases the absolute IM recovery from plasma was over 91%. The extraction solvent selected in this investigation gave higher recoveries and clean extracts than other solvents tested. Plasma spiked with 500&#x02009;ng/mL of IM and 1000&#x02009;ng/mL of MA the retention times for IM and MA were 5.52 and 8.23&#x02009;min, respectively. Sensitivity of HPLC assay qualitative confirmation of the purity of IM and MA peaks were obtained (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>). The limit of quantification was 50&#x02009;ng/mL of IM in plasma when 0.5&#x02009;mL plasma was placed. The obtained mean correlation coefficients for the standard curves (<italic>n</italic> = 6) was 0.998. Assay was shown to be sensitive, capable of reliably detecting IM concentrations in plasma as low as 50&#x02009;ng/mL. Interferences from endogenous compounds were overcome by using an acidic buffer (citrate buffer pH 3.0) to alter the pH of the aqueous phase before extraction. To prevent the substantial interferences from endogenous compounds, strong acid-like HCl was employed.</p><p>The mean plasma concentration as a function of time is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and the calculated pharmacokinetic parameters of Microcid SR and F<sub>3</sub> formulations are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4">Table 4</xref>. After oral administration of both products, more mean <italic>C</italic>

<sub>max</sub> values obtained for Microcid SR 75&#x02009;mg capsule and formulation F<sub>3</sub> was statistically insignificant. Mean plasma concentrations of IM for both products in all experimental conditions were within the therapeutic concentration range (300&#x02013;3000&#x02009;ng/mL) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> values for both products do not exceed the above limit in all animals. It was observed the plasma concentration of IM falls below detection limit (50&#x02009;ng/mL) after 24&#x02009;h in all animals following administration of either product. On the basis of the therapeutic concentration range of IM, it could be concluded that the therapeutic effects of both formulations would be probably be maintained for about 12&#x02009;h following a single dose administration. Thus it could be predicted that the two controlled release formulations included in this study are associated with a similar onset of therapeutic response following a single dose administration under fasting conditions. Furthermore, it could be predicted that both controlled release formulations in this study are associated with a similar onset of therapeutic response, following a single dose administration under fasting conditions.</p><p>The time taken to reach peak plasma concentration <italic>T</italic>

From the study it was observed that reduced fluctuations combined with the elevated mean plasma concentration from both products offer advantage in protecting patients against morning stiffness [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. </p><p> The systematic availability of IM can be determined by comparison of the area under the plasma concentration (AUC) versus time curves. The mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> values for Microcid SR and formulation F<sub>3</sub> were 12478&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;&#x02009;104.21&#x02009;ng/mL&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 12145&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;&#x02009;87.32&#x02009;ng/mL&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively. Slow <italic>in vitro</italic> release of IM from the products Microcid SR and F<sub>3</sub> formulations may be responsible for the decreased AUC values when compared to the reported conventional dosage forms [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The average value of the individual and mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;24</sub> ratio at 95% confidence limit (0.8&#x02013;1.25) was within acceptable limits for bioequivalent products [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In order to obtain <italic>in vitro-in vivo </italic>correlation, drug absorption profiles were compared for Microcid SR and formulation F<sub>3</sub> using the cumulative fraction of the drug absorbed <italic>in vivo</italic> against cumulative fraction of the drug dissolved <italic>in vitro</italic> up to 8&#x02009;h. From the study it was noticed that both products showed an adequate correlation. Currently accepted criteria in the US for bioequivalence for most dosage forms require that the mean pharmacokinetic parameters of the test dosage forms should be within 80&#x02013;120% of the reference dosage form using 90% confidence interval. Pharmacokinetic parameters clearly indicate that the parameters of F<sub>3</sub> are in good agreement with Microcid SR. The observed mean AUC<sub>0&#x02013;<italic>&#x0221e;</italic></sub>values for Microcid SR and formulation F<sub>3</sub> were 12632&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;&#x02009;132.12&#x02009;ng/mL.h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> and 12452&#x02009;&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;&#x02009;96.32&#x02009;ng/mL.h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> which does not show any significant statistical difference between the products.</p><p>On the basis of FDA recommendation [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the two products, Microcid SR and formulation F<sub>3</sub>, can be considered bioequivalent. No untoward effects were observed by any of the subjects after the administration of either product. Thus, the two formulations can be considered similar, because all the subjects are very well tolerated. These observations clearly indicate the absence of high peak plasma concentrations (&#x0003e;5000&#x02009;ng/mL), which are very often associated with adverse effects due to drug accumulation [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], because of the accumulation effect.

Conclusion</title><p>The objective of the study was to prepare and evaluate wax microspheres loaded with IM by optimized meltable dispersion emulsified cooling-induced solidification method for controlled release. The method employed was simple, rapid, and economical and does not imply the use of toxic organic solvents. The results of the drug entrapment and micromeritic properties exhibited fairly good spherical nature as evidenced by SEM photograph. The compatible state of the drug-loaded wax microspheres was evaluated by FTIR and DSC. Both formulations were found to be bioequivalent and both formulations showed an adequate correlation between cumulative fractions dissolved <italic>in vitro</italic> and cumulative fractions absorbed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Optimized formulation F<sub>3</sub> and marketed product Microcid SR showed similarity in drug release profiles and <italic>in vivo</italic> bioequivalent behavior.
