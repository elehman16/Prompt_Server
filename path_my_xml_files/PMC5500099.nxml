If microcurrents of a physiological amperage were delivered into damaged muscle tissues, it could control the altered membrane function by various mechanisms, such as the maintenance of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis and the upregulation of ATP production.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Previous studies revealed that treatment of muscle damage with microcurrent therapy with low amperage &#x0003c;500&#x0200a;&#x003bc;A can reduce the severity of muscle symptoms.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> However, the mechanism of MENS has not yet been clarified and it is presumed that MENS has various therapeutic effects owing to differences in microcurrent parameters such as ampere and frequency. The hypothesis of this journal is that MENS with tailored parameters could improve muscle function in the elderly by preventing muscle damage and promoting recovery. As far as we are aware, there have been no randomized clinical trials that have used microcurrent therapy for the rapid improvement of muscle function. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of short-term MENS on the strength, endurance, and activity of muscle in the elderly.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Study design</title><p>This study used a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, sham-controlled design and was performed at Soonchunhyang University Hospital (SCHUH), Seoul, South Korea, from February 2016 to December 2016. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (SCHUH 2016&#x02013;01&#x02013;005&#x02013;001) of SCHUH. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant.

The microcurrent generator (EMI; Cosmic Co, Seoul, Korea) was a portable handheld device that provides 4 electrode outputs. We applied 2 identical microcurrent devices to each the upper and lower limbs. It was programmed to provide an alternating current characterized by a monophasic rectangular pulse format, with polarity reversal every 3 seconds. The frequency was 8&#x0200a;Hz and the intensity was 25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;A. This current intensity was significantly lower than the human sensory threshold. The appearance of the sham microcurrent stimulator was identical to the real stimulator, but there was no electrical current, even when it was operational. During the 40 minutes of application, participants were allowed to perform gentle movements so that the equipment installed on the body was not hindered.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7407-g002"/></fig></sec><sec><label>2.5</label><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>All outcomes were measured at baseline and after the application.

The secondary outcome was the RMS values of the EMG signal.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Study design for intervention and outcome assessments.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e7407-g003"/></fig><p>Single leg heel-rise test (HRT)<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> was designed to evaluate muscle endurance in elderly subjects. The parameters of HRT were: number of plantar flexions, time in seconds, and velocity (plantar flexions per second). The HRT was performed with the individual standing barefoot. Participants were supported by the dominant hand on the wall to maintain balance. An instrument was created so that the individual performed plantar flexion with a maximal range across all repetitions. To determine the full range of plantar flexion, participants initially performed the first plantar flexion as high as possible until they were supported by metatarsophalangeal joints. Then, the heights with their ankle in a full plantar flexion were measured using an elastic height-measuring instrument, and it was fixed at 1&#x0200a;cm below the level. To ensure the quality of the HRT, the subjects were instructed to touch the instrument with their head during every plantar flexion repetitions. Participants repeated plantar flexions as much as possible at full speed until they could no longer repeat owing to fatigue. Verbal instructions were given only at the beginning of the trial and no encouragements were given during the evaluation. The examiner registered the number of repetitions and the total time required for the trial.</p><p>Handgrip strength test (HGS, kg)<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> of the dominant arm was performed to evaluate handgrip muscle strength using a Jamar dynamometer fixed with the level II. Participants sat with an upright spine with their head in a neutral position and relaxed shoulders. The arm was adducted to the trunk with the elbow in a neutral position. The hip joints were flexed at 90 degree and slightly abducted with both feet supported on the ground. Only the test administrator was able to read the values and the participant did not know the values achieved. There was a break interval of approximately 45 seconds between each trial. The mean value (kilogram) of the 3 trials was calculated for statistical analysis. A total of 2 measurement sessions were obtained from each participant at baseline and after the intervention.</p><p>The root mean square values (RMS, &#x003bc;V)<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> of the EMG signal were measured during the maximal isometric contraction of the grasp muscles at the same time with HGS testing. The data of muscle spectrography were collected using a Medelec Synergy electromyographic device (Oxford Instruments Medical Inc, UK). The surface EMG signal was recorded with a pair of disc electrodes applied to the flexor digitorum profundus muscle belly and 4&#x0200a;cm apart using electroconducting gel with Ag/AgCl<sub>2</sub> (Natus Neurology Inc). The EMG signal was sampled at 48&#x0200a;kHz and digitally processed with a filter &#x0201c;band pass&#x0201d; (10&#x0200a;Hz&#x0223c;10&#x0200a;kHz) to reduce noise. The participant's skin surface was cleaned with alcohol and hair was removed before the electrodes were placed to reduce the chance of capturing interference. The precautions can reduce the surface impedance and improve the signal conductivity. The capture time of muscle activity was 50&#x0200a;ms during a period of maximal grasping. As with the HGS test, there was approximately a 45-second rest interval between each trial. The mean RMS value (&#x003bc;V) of the 3 trials was used for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec><label>2.6</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To estimate the sample size, we conducted a pilot trial as no previous studies could provide guidance regarding population size and power. In the trial, 9 volunteers underwent the HGS and the EMG test for evaluating RMS value before and after microcurrent stimulation. Among the outcomes, the RMS value was selected to estimate the number of subjects. To detect this difference in a randomized controlled trial using a paired <italic>t</italic> test assuming a 5% 2-tailed significant level (an alpha of 0.05), a power of 90%, and a 20% dropout rate, the suggested sample size was 18 subjects per group. With a slight increase in sample size, a total of 38 subjects (19 subjects in each group) participated in the present study. All demographic data are presented as the mean and standard deviation (SD), unless otherwise noted. Normality of distribution was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test.

Previous studies reported that tailored microcurrent stimulation can be helpful in restoring or regenerating damaged muscles. Studies on the efficacy of microcurrent stimulation for recovery from delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) have reported that 200&#x0200a;&#x003bc;A of microcurrent therapy or an electromembrane microcurrent patch of 20&#x0200a;&#x003bc;A provided significant protection and recovery from DOMS.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Moreover, recent studies have reported that the MENS could be effective in promoting the regeneration process of injured skeletal muscles or the activation of local stem cells in animal models.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> However, there might be no conclusion as to the specific mechanisms of the results and whether these mechanisms can be also helpful for rapid improvements in muscle function. In this study, real microcurrent stimulation significantly improved the mean change in handgrip strength (kilograms), whereas it markedly reduced the RMS value of the EMG signal that represents the activity of muscle fibers. It is possible that participants in the real MENS group achieved more handgrip power efficiently through minimal recruitment of the muscle. Moreover, the real microcurrent stimulation also significantly improved the numbers of plantar flexions and time for HRT. However, the sham MENS group showed the opposite results, which is thought to be because muscle fatigue induced by baseline HRT was not sufficiently relieved during the 40 minutes of sham microcurrent stimulation. The way in which microcurrent therapy caused the discrepancy between the 2 groups is not known. Previous studies also reported that microcurrent therapy can prevent muscle damage compared to the sham treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Excessive accumulation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> can alter membrane integrity, which gradually induces morphological and functional changes in the contractile structure of the muscle.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> The main mechanism of MENS is maintaining intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in damaged muscle cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> Muscle weakness during aging suggests that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent excitation-contraction coupling might be impaired.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> During muscle contraction, membrane depolarization activates voltage sensing Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in transverse tubules (Ca<sub>v</sub>1.1). The activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can then activate the SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release channel and ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR-1). The subsequent increase in cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> is essential for attenuating age-dependent muscle strength.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> Our previous study (unpublished data) showed that calcium homeostasis was achieved after application of microcurrent (25&#x0200a;&#x003bc;A, 8&#x0200a;Hz) for 1 minute to increase intracellular calcium by tachypacing in mouse heart cells. However, the mechanism of impaired SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in aging muscle has to be explained.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, it is difficult to determine the definition of the healthy elderly because the spectrum of physical abilities might be wide, even though the same selection criteria were applied. Therefore, it is unclear whether the results are applicable to all elderly population, regardless of the degree of muscle dysfunction, or to other age groups. Second, the application time of 40 minutes can be too short to cause sufficient changes in muscle function, although the main purpose of this study was to observe improvements in muscle performance through short-term MENS. Finally, this study did not include a follow-up evaluation. Thus, the long-term effects of MENS on muscle function still need to be addressed in the future.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this study found that short-term application of MENS could enhance the muscle functions in the elderly. Long-term randomized, controlled trials with follow-up assessments are needed to confirm our results.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index, CI = confidence interval, DOMS = delayed onset muscle soreness, EMG = Electromyography, HGS = handgrip strength test, HRT = single leg heel-rise test, IQR = interquartile range, MENS = Microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulation, RMS = root mean square, SD = standard deviation, SR = sarcoplasmic retinaculum.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This research was supported by the Soonchunhyang University Research Fund.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Janssen</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Heymsfield</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Ross</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group>
