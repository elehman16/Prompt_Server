<bold>Objectives</bold>&#x02003;The objective of our study was to test the hypothesis that in utero repair of surgically created spina bifida in a sheep model using cryopreserved human umbilical cord (HUC) patch improves neurological outcome.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>&#x02003;Spina bifida with myelotomy was surgically created in timed pregnant ewes at gestational day (GD) 75. The fetuses were randomly assigned to unrepaired versus HUC and treated at GD 95 and then delivered at GD 140. Neurological evaluation was performed using the Texas Spinal Cord Injury Scale (TSCIS), bladder control using ultrasound, and the hindbrain herniation.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>&#x02003;Three lambs without the spina bifida creation served as controls. There were four lambs with spina bifida: two were unrepaired and two underwent HUC repair. The control lambs had normal function. Both unrepaired lambs had nonhealed skin lesions with leakage of cerebrospinal fluid, a 0/20 TSCIS score, no bladder control, and the hindbrain herniation. In contrast, both HUC lambs had a completely healed skin defect and survived to day 2 of life, a 3/20 and 4/20 TSCIS score (nociception), partial bladder control, and normal hindbrain anatomy.</p><p>

</p><p>It remains unclear whether it is beneficial to perform the intrauterine repair with a patch system to create not only a watertight barrier but to reduce scar formation and inflammation. Both of these mechanisms may prevent damage to the spinal cord.<xref rid="JR160051-6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Recently, we have reported that cryopreserved human umbilical cord (HUC) provides a watertight barrier and helps regenerate the skin defect, preserves spinal cord anatomy, and prevents hindbrain herniation in a sheep model of surgically created spina bifida.<xref rid="JR160051-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The rationale of adopting HUC as a patch is based on the promising clinical outcome of cryopreserved amniotic membrane used in cornea, skin, and for the repair of tendon and ligaments<xref rid="JR160051-8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> to deliver anti-inflammatory and antiscarring effects.<xref rid="JR160051-9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>

<xref rid="JR160051-11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> HUC, like an amniotic membrane, also exert similar therapeutic actions but is thicker when flattened as a sheet.<xref rid="JR160051-12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Herein, we provide additional evidence to support the notion that the aforementioned histological healing results<xref rid="JR160051-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> are correlated with clinical benefit in the preservation of neurological functions in a sheep surgical model of spina bifida. The study was performed as a pilot study to demonstrate the feasibility of using the HUC patch to study the neurological outcomes in a myelotomy spina bifida model.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Texas McGovern Medical at Houston (protocol AWC-12&#x02013;007). All animal care was in compliance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p><sec><title>Creation of Spina Bifida Model</title><p>Timed-pregnant sheep with twin or triplet gestations verified by ultrasound were obtained from K-Bar Livestock, L.L.C. (Bastrop, TX) for the creation of the sheep model of spina bifida as previously reported.<xref rid="JR160051-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Briefly, the first surgery was performed on gestational day (GD) 75 (term: 145 days) under general anesthesia with the animal placed in a supine position with left lateral tilt. Under sterile conditions, a laparotomy was performed using a midline incision followed by hysterotomy to expose the lower fetal lumbar/sacral spine. As described previously,<xref rid="JR160051-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> the spina bifida defect was surgically created by removing the skin to create a defect of 4 cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;4 cm. The paraspinous muscles and posterior lamina of the vertebra at 4 to 5 levels between L3 and L6 vertebral levels were also removed to expose the spinal cord. Myelotomy was performed by incising the meningeal coverings of the spinal cord using an 18-gauge needle and the central canal at the midline of the spinal cord was entered to allow the egress cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). After the fetus was repositioned back into the amniotic cavity, the uterine incision was closed in two layers using 2&#x02013;0 Vicryl suture (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ). The procedure was then repeated on the second fetus in the remaining uterine horn. After completion of the procedure, the uterus was placed back into the abdomen and the skin and fascial incisions were closed. The fetuses that did not undergo spina bifida creation served as controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Repair of the Spina Bifida Defect</title><p>The fetuses that survived to the repair phase after the creation of the defect were randomly assigned to the unrepaired group versus repair using HUC. The fetuses assigned to HUC repair, underwent this procedure on GD 95, that is, approximately 3 weeks after the initial surgery. HUC (AmnioGuard; TissueTech Inc., Miami, FL) was processed from donated full-term human placentas after cesarean delivery recovered in compliance with American Association of Tissue Banks and the good tissue practices set forth by the Federal Drug Administration. After removing the umbilical vessels, the umbilical cord was flattened to create a patch of various sizes. The HUC patch was sutured to the skin edge of the spina bifida defect in the fetus using 4&#x02013;0 Monocryl (Ethicon Inc.) in a continuous running locking fashion. The unrepaired fetuses were managed expectantly.</p></sec><sec><title>Delivery by Cesarean Section and Neonatal Care</title><p>All fetuses were delivered at GD 139 to 142 days by planned laparotomy and hysterotomy under general anesthesia or spinal anesthesia with sedation. After delivery of the fetus, the cord was clamped and cut. The fetuses were transitioned to the room air by stimulation and drying. The lambs were kept alive for 2 days after delivery for neurological assessment. The ewe was euthanized immediately after cesarean delivery.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Outcome Assessment</title><p>The clinical assessment of the hind limbs function was performed by videotaping the examination. The masking of treatment assignment of each lamb was performed by covering the lower spine of the lamb with a bandage of 10 cm&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10 cm. Three independent examiners, blinded to the treatment assignment of lambs, reviewed the videos to evaluate neurological outcomes using Texas Spinal Cord Injury Scale (TSCIS).<xref rid="JR160051-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
</p></sec><sec><title>Neurological Assessments</title><p>Neurological assessments were first performed by standard clinical neurological examination techniques using the TSCIS (<xref rid="TB160051-1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This scale allows for a combined score gait, proprioceptive positioning (knuckling) and nociception up to 10 points per limb. A maximum overall score of 40 can be assessed for all four limbs.<xref rid="JR160051-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The gait was assessed by tail walking (holding the lamb upright by the tail or using a sling near the lower spine area) if the lamb is not able or unwilling to voluntarily ambulate. Scores of 0 to 6 are assigned based on the presence and clinical significance of movement, for example, limb protraction. Proprioceptive positioning (also referred to as knuckling) was measured by a postural reaction test by placing the dorsum of the manus or pes on a nonsticky surface while the lamb's ventrum was supported with one hand. It was scored as normal (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;2) if they were able to correct the limb immediately. Lambs that replaced the hoof, but took a prolonged period of time to do so (&#x0003e; 2&#x02009;seconds or had difficulty doing so were referred to as delayed (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;1). An absent response was scored as zero. Nociception was assessed by applying a painful stimulus to the limb and observing the lamb for physiological retraction or behavioral (orientation toward the stimulus, vocalization, licking) responses.<xref rid="JR160051-16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Superficial nociception (soft tissue pain) was tested by applying a hemostat to the interdigital webbing.<xref rid="JR160051-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> If no superficial nociception was detected, deep nociception (bone or joint pain) was evaluated by cross-clamping a nail bed, digit, or the distal limb with a hemostat.<xref rid="JR160051-18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Lambs were scored as having normal nociception (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;2), no superficial nociception (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;1), and no deep and superficial nociception (score&#x02009;=&#x02009;0).

The maximum dimensions were used as the prevoid bladder volume, while the dimensions measured immediately after voiding was used as the postvoid volume. If there was constant leakage of urine without spontaneous voiding, volumes at 1-hour intervals were chosen to calculate the pre/postvoid volume ratios.</p></sec><sec><title>Euthanasia and Harvest of Tissues</title><p>After the neurological assessment, the lambs were intubated and general anesthesia was administered. Euthanasia was performed by exsanguination under anesthesia. Following thoracotomy pericardial sac was entered and the left ventricle was catheterized to infuse1,000 units of intravenous heparin administered into the circulation. Subsequently, the right atrium was incised to allow for bleeding. Through the left ventricular cannula, 10% normal buffered formalin (NBF) was infused until the bleeding through the right atrium was clear. The head and neck were separated from the remaining body and the defect site was excised fixed with 3 cm margin of tissue.

The transmission and reception were based on the vendor-supplied birdcage resonator with 155&#x02009;mm i.d. using ParaVision (PV 5.1) as the scanner's operating system.

The hindbrain herniation findings in the current study noted on MRI are similar to the findings seen with midline sagittal sections of the hindbrain in our recent investigation.<xref rid="JR160051-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Cumulatively, including our previous publication, 8/8 (100%) lambs with surgically created spina bifida that then underwent HUC repair demonstrated the absence of hindbrain herniation.<xref rid="JR160051-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In contrast, we noted lack or absence of CSF in the lateral ventricles and around the brain in the unrepaired lambs. The unrepaired spina bifida lamb that demised 3 hours after delivery had the most severe hindbrain herniation along with the complete absence of CSF in the calvarium. The lack of ventriculomegaly despite hindbrain herniation has been previously noted by other researchers in the sheep model of spina bifida.<xref rid="JR160051-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, in human, the spina bifida is associated with enlargement of lateral ventricles.<xref rid="JR160051-22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The explanation for the difference remains unknown.</p><p>In our study, we followed the method first reported by Meuli et al<xref rid="JR160051-13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> to surgically create a spina bifida lesion at midgestation in sheep. In addition, similar to what has been advised by Paek et al<xref rid="JR160051-23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and Bouchard et al,<xref rid="JR160051-21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> we created a myelotomy to allow egress of the CSF to cause an hindbrain herniation. Finally, we performed the surgical repair 3 weeks after the initial creation to allow sufficient exposure of the spinal cord to the amniotic fluid. Furthermore, the uncovered defects were randomly assigned to repair or no repair to reduce the assignment bias. Furthermore, in one of our ewes, there were all three interventions: control, unrepaired spina bifida, and HUC-repaired spina bifida. This served as an internal validity of our findings.</p><p>This is the first study to use the TSCIS scale to quantify sensory and motor function in a spina bifida animal model. The scale has been validated for four-legged animals, such as dogs with spinal cord injury.<xref rid="JR160051-15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> This scale incorporates proprioception and nociception in addition to gait. Brown et al<xref rid="JR160051-25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> used a locomotor scale in 20 lambs, of which 15 had a surgically created spina bifida, and showed reproducibility to quantify hind limb motor function. However, the locomotor scale does not incorporate proprioception and nociception pathways, which are important parts of spinal cord function. In our study, the lack of complete recovery in the TSCIS was secondary to the inability for the spinal cord to regenerate after myelotomy where the spinal cord is intentionally damaged during the surgical creation of the spina bifida. This phenomenon has been well observed in spinal cord injury in the mammalian animals.<xref rid="JR160051-26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> The relative preservation of the nociception reflexes despite a complete lack of locomotor function and proprioception was unexpected. The pain fiber pathway in the spinal cord could explain the findings. Pain fibers travel into the spinal cord, crosses to the opposite side in front of the central canal at the same level and ascend through the lateral and anterior spinothalamic tracts.<xref rid="JR160051-28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> During the myelotomy, which is performed posteriorly in the midline of the spinal cord, the lateral and anterior parts of the spinal cord are untouched. The sensory and proprioception pathways ascend on the same side of the spinal cord through medial lemniscuses of the posterior column, which are damaged during the creation of the defect.</p><p>Spina bifida affects bladder function due to inadequate bladder wall development and thus leads to poor bladder filling and increased postvoid residual volume<xref rid="JR160051-29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> causing lifelong morbidity in more than 90% of children.<xref rid="JR160051-30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Both of these manifest with increased postvoid residual volumes requiring intermittent bladder catheterization.<xref rid="JR160051-32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In this study, we evaluated postvoid residual volumes in the lambs using 2D ultrasound. The repair of the spina bifida reduced the postvoid residual volume by 50% compared with a lack of spontaneous voiding in the unrepaired lambs. The improvement noted in the urinary function could be secondary to preservation spinal cord tissue in the repaired lambs at the S2&#x02013;S4 level where the micturition reflex occurs, which is below the site of the spina bifida level of L2&#x02013;L6.<xref rid="JR160051-7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="JR160051-34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, in the unrepaired, the lower spinal cord may be further damaged due to continued exposure to the amniotic fluid.</p><p>We had anticipated a higher degree of spinal cord function preservation in the HUC repaired lambs due to its known anti-inflammatory, antiscarring, and regenerative properties. This hypothesis was based on the identifying heavy chain hyaluronic acid (HC-HA)/pentraxin 3 (PTX3) as the relevant tissue characteristic from amniotic membrane, similar biological composition, and properties as HUC, responsible for the aforementioned actions. HC-HA/PTX3 is formed by the tight association between PTX3 and HC-HA complex, which consists of high molecular weight HA covalently linked to the heavy chain 1 of inter-&#x003b1;-trypsin inhibitor through the catalytic action of tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6.<xref rid="JR160051-35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
