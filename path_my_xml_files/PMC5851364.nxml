day care service users, who had been classified into Care Grades 1 and 2 based on Japan&#x02019;s
long-term care insurance system. [Subjects and Methods] Intervention was provided for 29
Care Grade 1 or 2 day care service users. During intervention, expiratory muscle training
was performed by slowly expiring using the abdominal muscles and a device after maximal
inspiration. Each intervention session lasted for approximately 10 minutes, and 2 sessions
were held weekly for 3 months to compare respiratory function test values before and after
intervention. [Results] The results were favorable. The vital capacity (VC) and peak
expiratory flow (PEF) significantly varied between before and after intervention.
[Conclusion] Expiratory muscle training generally improved their respiratory function,
particularly their VC and PEF that significantly varied between before and after
intervention. As both of these items influence the cough capacity, they may be key to the
prevention of aspiration pneumonia. Expiratory muscle training may also contribute to
activities of daily living (ADL) and the quality of life, and it is expected to play an
important role in rehabilitation as a field of preventive medicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Frail elderly</kwd><kwd>Respiratory function</kwd><kwd>Expiratory muscle training</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In Japan&#x02019;s super-aging society, caring for the elderly is a serious issue, and the

The exclusion criteria were as follows: 1) those with serious heart disease,
2) those with a history of pneumothorax, 3) those with impaired comprehension and a score of
20 or lower on the Revised Hasegawa Dementia Scale as a cognitive function test, and 4)
those who did not consent. In addition, those who showed signs of infection during the
training period and those who became unable to continuously participate in training withdrew
from the study.</p><p>During intervention, expiratory muscle training was performed by slowly expiring using the
abdominal muscles and a device after maximal inspiration. This device resists expiratory.
The expiratory muscle training device (Threshold PEP; CHEST M. I., Inc., Japan) used for
training is compact, light, and easy to use, as it is only necessary to hold it in the mouth
when expiring. The loading level was set at 60% or lower of the maximum permissible pressure
in each case. Each intervention session lasted for approximately 10 minutes, and 2 sessions
were held weekly for 3 months to compare test values before and after intervention.</p><p>The respiratory function test was conducted using an electronic spirometer (Multifunctional
Spirometer HI-801; Nihon Kohden Corporation) to measure basic items, in addition to the
maximal expiratory muscle strength.</p><p>For statistical analysis, the Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used to evaluate the users&#x02019;
respiratory function before and after intervention. SPSS Statistics Ver. 20 was also used,
with the significance level set at &#x0003c;5% of the risk rate.</p><p>The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Kan-etsu Chu-oh Hospital (approval

dysfunction and complications, such as nerve system, bone, and joint diseases. Therefore,
medical checks or other appropriate safety confirmation processes should be performed before
starting muscle strength training or rehabilitation. Outpatient care facilities need to
consider its influences on their users&#x02019; circulatory/respiratory function when providing
it.</p><p>In the case of care-dependent individuals, it is important to prevent their expiratory
muscle strength from decreasing. In a study involving healthy individuals and Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, expiratory muscle training improved their
respiratory function related to the expiratory flow rate<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, while such changes were not observed in another study<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Kim et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> provided expiratory muscle training for a healthy elderly group, and
reported that their maximal expiratory muscle strength increased.</p><p>The age of the elderly involved in the present study was similar to that of this group, but
the former were care-dependent, and their activity levels were reduced. However, expiratory
muscle training generally improved their respiratory function. This result seems to be due
to improvement of chest expansion and increase of expiratory muscle activity, particularly
their VC and PEF that significantly varied between before and after intervention. As both of
these items influence the cough capacity, they may be key to the prevention of aspiration
pneumonia.</p><p>Expiratory muscle training may be useful for all facilities providing conventional exercise
programs for their users, represented by outpatient and home-visit rehabilitation centers,
as well as health-promoting exercise classes for care prevention. As such training may also
contribute to ADL and the quality of life, it is expected to play an important role in
rehabilitation as a field of preventive medicine.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by many people. The authors would like to express their sincere
