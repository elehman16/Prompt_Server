warm-up on the isokinetic muscle torque (at 60&#x000b0;/sec) and muscle power (at 180&#x000b0;/sec) of the
flexor muscle and extensor muscle of the knee joint. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects
of this study were 10 healthy students with no medically specific findings. The warm-up
group and warm-up with stretching group performed their respective warm-up prior to the
isokinetic muscle torque evaluation of the knee joint. One-way ANOVA was performed by
randomized block design for each variable. [Results] The results were as follows: First,
the flexor peak torque and extensor peak torque of the knee joint tended to decrease at
60&#x000b0;/sec in the warm-up with stretching group compared with the control group and warm-up
group, but without statistical significance. Second, extensor power at 180&#x000b0;/sec was also
not statistically significant. However, it was found that flexor power increased
significantly in the warm-up with stretching group at 180&#x000b0;/sec compared with the control
group and warm-up group in which stretching was not performed. [Conclusion] Therefore, it
is considered that in healthy adults, warm-up including two sets of stretching for 20
seconds per muscle group does not decrease muscle strength and muscle power.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Stretching</kwd><kwd>Warm-up</kwd><kwd>Muscle power</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stretching is helpful for injury prevention, flexibility of periarticular connective

The American College of
Sports Medicine<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> advises that stretching
is effective in warm-up and cooldown before and after aerobic exercise, and that it should
be included in rehabilitation exercise programs in terms of musculoskeletal injury
prevention. In static stretching, the most commonly used among the different types of
stretching, a static is maintained for 10&#x02013;45 seconds up to the maximum range of motion (ROM)
centered on the agonist muscle required during exercise. This practice increases body
temperature, is effective for injury prevention, and is used by most athletes in the
field<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Conventionally, studies showing
that static stretching improves exercise performance and flexibility and is effective for
injury prevention are dominant<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>However, despite the fact that stretching is broadly used in such a way, putting together
previous studies associated with this, it is considered that pre-exercise stretching
temporarily decreases muscle strength, power, and sports performance<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this regard,
Nelson et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that pregame
stretching inhibited the exertion of maximum muscle strength, vertical jumping ability, and
muscle endurance. However, Perrier et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that no significant difference in the Sargent jump was
observed between their static stretching group and their control group.</p><p>Likewise, even if there is a possibility that static stretching might adversely affect
exercise performance and athletic performance, it is recognized as a partial element of
warm-up, and warm-up including static stretching is performed in most fields of recreational
sports. Because of this, further studies on temporary effects of flexibility exercise in
performance of activities related to physical strength are needed. Thus this study was
conducted in order to verify the effect of pre-exercise static stretching on muscle strength
and muscle power by evaluating the muscular function of the knee joint using an isokinetic
machine by type of warm-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 10 students who were attending S University in Seoul,
Republic of Korea, had no medical problem, and consented to participate in the experiment
after the purpose of the study was fully explained to them. Their physical characteristics
are as shown in <xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Gender</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">n</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body fat (%)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.0&#x000b1;3.4</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">175.6&#x000b1;5.5</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.5&#x000b1;9.0</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.0&#x000b1;7.2</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap> below. This study was approved by the ethics committee of the Institutional
Review Board of Sahmyook University.</p><p>To achieve the purpose of this study, subjects were asked to avoid drinking and smoking one
day before the experiment, not to participate in excessive physical activity and nonroutine
social activity, and to maintain normal sleeping hours in order to secure proper test data.
On the day of the experiment, they were asked to consume a light meal, arrive at the
measurement room by 09:00 a.m., and take a rest.</p><p>For comparison of muscle strength and muscle power according to the presence or absence of
warm-up with stretching, the same subjects were classified into a control group that did not
perform warm-up, a warm-up group that performed simple running and joint exercise, and a
warm-up with stretching group. The control group directly underwent isokinetic muscle
testing without warm-up, while the warm-up group started power walking at a strength of
40&#x02013;60% of the predicted maximum heart rate, performed light running for 10 minutes, and then
underwent isokinetic muscle testing. The warm-up with stretching group performed light
running for 5 minutes, performed static stretching, and then underwent isokinetic muscle
testing. The stretching program consisted of 12 types stretching of the global muscles of
the whole body. Two repetitions of each stretching motion were performed, each taking 20
seconds, and the entire stretching program took 10 minutes to perform. All subjects rested
for one minute after warming up and then underwent isokinetic muscle testing of the knee
joint. The sequence of performance of each warm-up was individually randomized. In
successive weeks, each group was tested according to the type of warm-up being utilized.
This occurred over a period of three weeks, with the control group, warm-up group, and
warm-up and stretching group allowed a week to rest in between tests.</p><p>A knee extension/flexion isokinetic dynamometer (Humac Norm Testing &#x00026; Rehabilitation
System; CSMI) was used for this study. First, the subjects were asked to have a seat on the
Humac Norm stand, which was made to allow the hip joint to bend at 90 degrees, and then the
anatomical axis of rotation of the knee joint was adjusted in accordance with the
dynamometer axis of the dynamical system. The upper body, pelvis, and femoral region were
fixed using a three-point safety belt and thigh strap, and the axis of the foot and
dynamometer was fixed to the direct upper part of the medial ankle bone using a Velcro
strap. The opposite lower extremity was fixed with a limb stabilization bar. To prevent the
influence of the weight of the axis of motion of the tested lower leg and isokinetic machine
on the torque of the knee joint, gravity effect torque was measured and entered in a
computer, and range of motion (ROM) was limited to between 0&#x000b0; of extension and 90&#x000b0; of
flexion. Then, the test procedure was explained to the subjects. They were asked to extend
and flex the knee by exerting their maximum strength as soon as possible, to keep their
trunk up against the back rest during the test, and to hold onto the handle of the machine
with their hands. The subjects performed maximal test of 4-times repetition. Each maximal
test was conducted with an angular speed of 60&#x000b0;/sec (velocity of 60&#x000b0;/sec) for measurement of
isokinetic muscle strength and with an angular speed of 180&#x000b0;/sec (velocity of 180&#x000b0;/sec) for
measurement of isokinetic muscle power. The exercise was conducted twice prior to testing so
that adaptability to the test was improved for subjects and optimal results were achieved.
Also, for motivation during testing of maximal isokinetic strength and isokinetic power,
subjects were verbally encouraged, and were allowed to view their torque graphs during
testing as a form of visual feedback.</p><p>In this study, for analysis of muscle strength and muscle power, measurements of the left
and right knee joints were divided into each independent variable, and data processing was
performed. For data analysis, the mean and standard error were calculated per variable using
the SPSS for Windows, version 12.0, software. In addition, one-way ANOVA was performed using
a randomized block design for analysis of differences in the isokinetic muscle strength and
muscle power of the extensor muscle and flexor muscle of the knee joint between groups. When
there was a significant difference between groups, the least significant difference post hoc
test was used. The significance level for statistical verification was set to 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, prior to evaluation of muscle strength (60&#x000b0;/sec) and muscle power (180&#x000b0;/sec)

flexibility, reduces the possibility of injury, and contributes to the performance of
advanced techniques. In particular, static stretching maintains a performed posture without
bound, and studies on such stretching effects<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup> have reported that it can improve muscle
strength. Young and Elliott<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> reported
that flexibility training to prevent stiffness of upper limbs was improved exercise
performance of the bench press, and Wilson et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and Worrell et al.<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that peak torque increased in the hamstring muscle.
However, many recent studies have expressed skepticism with regard to results indicating
that stretching has a positive effect on improvement of exercise performance or injury
prevention<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In a study targeting 22 university students, Nelson et al.<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that after static stretching, knee flexor peak torque
showed a significant decrease, approximately 7.5%, and knee extensor peak torque decreased
by 5.6%, compared with the control group. Cramer et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> and Marek et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, who conducted stretching in women in their twenties and healthy
university students, reported that it had a negative effect on isokinetic peak power. Causes
for reduced muscle strength after stretching include decreased motor unit activation or
neural factors, such as changes in reflex sensitivity, and mechanical factors including
changes in muscular elasticity affected by the length-tension relationship<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, Behm and Chaouachi<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> and Fowles et al.<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that static stretching would decrease the
autonomy of the reactive nerve of the muscle spindle and the sensitivity of the receptor,
and that stretching continued for more than tens of seconds would extend muscles and
decrease pressure on the joint, leading to impaired the requirement of Type II muscle at
need to muscle power and speed expression. Cramer et al.<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, who measured peak torque and performed electromyography after
acute stretching, found that force production and muscle activation decreased both in the
stretched leg and unstretched leg, arguing that the reason why peak torque decreased in the
unstretched leg was that the inhibitory mechanism of the central nervous system acted as a
result of stretching of the opposite leg.</p><p>On the other hand, according to the study of Unick et al.<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, performance of the vertical jump test in female basketball players
after static stretching and dynamic stretching, revealed that neither stretching types
influenced jumping ability. Also, according to the study of Little and Williams<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, performance of static stretching and
dynamic stretching in soccer players, showed that neither of the stretching types influenced
jumping ability, but dynamic stretching improved high-speed performance.</p><p>In this study, changes in the flexor peak torque and extensor peak torque of the knee joint
were compared after static stretching in relatively active university students. This study
tended to decrease in the warm-up with stretching group at 60&#x000b0;/sec compared with the control
group and warm-up group, but without statistical significance. In addition, extensor peak
power at 180&#x000b0;/sec was not found to be statistically significant. However, flexor peak power
at 180&#x000b0;/sec was shown to increase significantly in the warm-up with stretching group
compared with the control and warm-up groups. Therefore, the results of this study show that
performance of the two sets of pre-exercise stretching for 20 seconds by muscle group did
not decrease isokinetic torque and muscle power during exercise.</p><p>It is considered that causes for differences in results after stretching include the
specificity of the subjects and their exercise capacity in addition to methodological
differences, that is, type, level, time, and frequency of stretching. Therefore, it is
concluded that further studies are required to verify the type, time, and frequency of the
most proper stretching method according to the level of exercise.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by a Sahmyook University Research Grant.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Shellock</surname><given-names>FG</given-names></name><name><surname>Prentice</surname><given-names>WE</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Warming-up and stretching for improved physical
