Some trials evaluating clinical interventions using short message service (SMS) text-messaging systems have shown important outcomes, although evidence is limited. We have developed a novel SMS system integrated with clinical care for use by people with hypertension in a low-resource setting. We aim to test the efficacy of the system in improving blood pressure control and treatment adherence compared to usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a pragmatic individually randomised three-arm parallel group trial in adults treated for hypertension at a single primary care centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention is a structured programme of clinic appointment, medication pick-up reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education delivered remotely using an automated system with either informational or interactive SMS text-messages. Usual care is supplemented by infrequent non-hypertension related SMS text-messages. Participants are 1:1:1 individually randomised, to usual care or to one of the two active interventions using minimisation to dynamically adjust for gender, age, baseline systolic blood pressure, years with hypertension, and previous clinic attendance. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up from baseline measured with research staff blinded to trial allocation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with 80% or more of days medication available, proportion of participants achieving a systolic blood pressure less than 140&#x000a0;mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90&#x000a0;mmHg, hospital admissions, health status, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with treatment and care, and patient related quality of life. Anonymised demographic data are collected on non-participants.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The StAR trial uses a novel, low cost system based on widely available mobile phone technology to deliver the SMS-based intervention, manage communication with patients, and measure clinically relevant outcomes. The results will inform implementation and wider use of mobile phone based interventions for health care delivery in a low-resource setting.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02019823?term=SMS&#x00026;rank=6">NCT02019823</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Globally, high blood pressure is the leading single risk factor for cardiovascular and related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Individual patient-level data have shown that usual blood pressure is &#x0201c;strongly and directly&#x0201d; associated with cardiovascular and overall mortality risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and that lowering blood pressure reduces this risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Controlling blood pressure at a population level may be associated with a decrease in cardiovascular disease regardless of the increasing burden of obesity and diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The burden of disease associated with hypertension is greatest in low-resource settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], where there is a need for better control of blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Treatment to lower blood pressure includes drug and non-drug measures as well as modification of known life-style associated risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Long-term blood pressure control requires integrating medication taking into daily life to support adherence and persisting with treatment.</p><p>A wide range of different strategies and interventions has been used to support patients in adhering to treatment plans, although results are not consistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. One strategy that may facilitate such support is the integration of a patient&#x02019;s mobile (or cellular) phone in the process of health care delivery. Globally, the mobile phone has become the preferred tool for communication and access to information bringing together communication and computing technology. Mobile-phone-based interventions could address individual-level factors in health by facilitating timely patient access to relevant health information and support, making patient-provider communication easier, and providing context-specific support and prompts to action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Despite widespread interest in the potential for mobile phone based interventions to deliver disease management and health-related behaviour change sustainably and at scale, published evidence of effectiveness is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. SMS-text messages are available on all mobile phone platforms and with all providers. Text messages have the potential to provide information alone (informational) or provide two-way communication (interactive or bi-directional). Some but not all trials suggest that SMS text-message reminders may improve clinic attendance, retention in care, and self-reported medication adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Two trials in Spain with short follow-up periods have explored the efficacy of SMS-based interventions for people with hypertension to improve treatment compliance and blood pressure control. Although the trials results suggest potential for small to moderate effect sizes in improved compliance and blood pressure control, the effects were not statistically significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design and hypothesis</title><p>The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a twelve-month, pragmatic three-arm parallel group trial.

At the final twelve month follow-up, anthropometry is repeated and blood pressure measured, a follow-up questionnaire is administered by a research assistant and clinical records are reviewed to capture intervening clinical events and changes in medical management. Participants who miss their scheduled visit at 12 months are actively traced by community-based research staff; if cause for non-attendance is hospital admission or death, then hospital records or death certificate data are obtained.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size calculations</title><p>The trial is powered on the primary outcome measure and based on a comparison of mean blood pressures between the usual care group and each of the intervention groups at 12 months.</p><p>A decrease in systolic blood pressure of 5&#x000a0;mm Hg is associated with clinically important reduction in the relative risk of stroke and coronary heart disease events. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] Based on a study population similar to that expected for the StAR trial population we used the standard deviation (SD) of systolic blood pressure (22.0&#x000a0;mm Hg) to calculate the required sample size. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]</p><p>With a proposed sample size of at least 1215 participants (no fewer than 405 for each group) and a 1:1:1 allocation ratio, the trial will have power of 90% with an alpha of 0.05 (two-sided), to detect an absolute mean difference of 5&#x000a0;mm Hg in the change in systolic blood pressure at 12 month from baseline, allowing for up to 20% loss to follow up.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomisation</title><p>Following receipt of a &#x0201c;Welcome&#x0201d; SMS text-message confirming trial registration on the system, participants are randomised using a secure, remote, web-based computer schedule within one week of recruitment. A minimisation procedure, overseen by an independent statistician, is used to dynamically adjust randomisation probabilities minimising chance differences in gender (male, female), age (&#x0003c;55&#x000a0;years, &#x02265; 55 years), baseline systolic blood pressure (&#x0003c;140&#x000a0;mmHg, &#x02265; 140&#x000a0;mmHg), years with hypertension (&#x0003c; 10 years, &#x02265; 10 years), and previous clinic attendance (regular, irregular, unknown) between the groups. Research staff and clinic staff remain blind to the allocated treatment group.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and management</title><p>We used software platforms that are non-proprietary, open-source, stable and widely available to deliver the mobile-phone based intervention at scale in a low-resource setting. We selected software that was easily customisable and suitable for use by non-technical field staff. Patient data is collected by fieldworkers using Internet-enabled mobile phones (HTC Wildfire S, HTC Corporation, Taiwan, Android OS 2.3.5) and tablet computers (Motorola Xoom, Motorola Corporation, Illinois, Android OS 4.0.4). Data entry is through on-screen case report forms developed using the open-source mobile-device application Sana Mobile (Sana, MIT, Massachusetts). The medical record is held in OpenMRS version 1.6.1 (OpenMRS, Limited, Michigan). OpenMRS is an open-source client&#x02013;server software platform initially designed as an electronic medical record and health system management platform for low-resource settings. The database uses a &#x0201c;concept dictionary&#x0201d; which stores the terms describing each data variable. It is accessible through a web-based interface and the platform allows the development, upload and installation of custom-coded modules into the main framework enabling seamless interactivity with Sana Mobile. Participant blood pressure readings are transferred directly from the sphygmomanometer to the tablet computer using a Bluetooth&#x02122; protocol. Data are then securely transferred to a dedicated mobile dispatch server (MDS) using SSL transport layer encryption (data are uploaded incrementally to handle intermittent data connectivity). The MDS then compiles and uploads all the information to an individual patient electronic medical record in OpenMRS.</p><p>Data collected using Sana Mobile are error-checked using range and logic checks built into Sana at time of collection. All other data uploaded directly to the database, such as patient appointment attendance, are error-checked by the OpenMRS software before integration on the server. These include data format and range checks, appointment date checks and alignment between uploaded and existing data. The database is regularly backed up and password-protected, with differing levels of access for different research staff.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical methods</title><sec><title>Analysis of primary and secondary outcomes</title><p>The primary statistical analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. We will endeavour to obtain full follow-up data on every participant to allow a full ITT analysis. The results from the trial will be reported as comparative summary statistics (difference in response rate or means) with 95% confidence intervals. All statistical tests will use a 5% two-sided significance level. The trial results will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 statements. A full detailed analysis plan (including plans for subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis) will be prepared and finalised before unblinding of the data.</p><p>We will analyse the primary outcome (change in systolic blood pressure at 12 months from baseline) using a mixed-effects model on data collected at 6 and 12 months. An interaction between time and randomised group will be fitted to allow estimation of treatment effects (i.e. informational versus usual care, and interactive versus usual care) at each time point. The model will adjust for baseline systolic blood pressure and minimisation factors.</p><p>The secondary outcome measure of adherence will be dichotomised with a threshold of 80% (of days covered) to determine the proportion of participants judged adherent to medication. We will use chi-squared tests to examine differences between allocated groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Sub-group analyses</title><p>We will carry out sub-group analyses of the primary outcome, systolic blood pressure and the main secondary outcome, adherence over last three months, by age (&#x0003c;50&#x000a0;years, &#x02265;50&#x000a0;years), sex (male, female), number of years with hypertension (&#x0003c;1, 1&#x02013;5, &#x0003e;5), baseline blood pressure (&#x0003e;140, &#x02264;140 mmHg), presence of one or more co-morbid conditions, and self-reported adherence at baseline.</p><p>Missing data will be reported with reasons given where available and the missing data pattern explored. We will explore the mechanism of missing data, though the mixed-effects model does implicitly account for data missing at random.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Reporting of adverse events for this trial</title><p>Reporting of serious adverse events will be limited to events not already listed as primary or secondary outcomes, but which might reasonably occur as a consequence of the trial. Additionally we will record adverse events that might be reasonably related to SMS text-messaging including hand or finger pain, or involvement in an accident as a result of sending or receiving a text.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical approval</title><p>The Human Research Ethics committees of the University of Cape Town, the University of Oxford, and the Metro District Health Services, Western Cape have reviewed and approved the protocol (HREC UCT 418/211, HREC OXTREC 03&#x02013;12). Trial procedures are compliant with the Declaration of Helsinki and the trial is registered with the South African National Clinical Trials Register (SANCTR DOH-27-1212-386) and ClinicalTrials.gov (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://NCT02019823">http://NCT02019823</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Consent</title><p>Eligible, willing participants complete a written consent form during the initial trial visit. Any participant who has given consent but loses capacity to consent during the trial will be withdrawn. Identifiable data already collected with consent will be retained and used in the analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Publication and dissemination of results</title><p>The results of the trial will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will be available on PubMed Central within six months of publication. Dissemination of results to patients will take place via community meetings, patient organisations, and the local media. Trial data will be made available on a public access database.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol presents the design of a randomised controlled trial testing the efficacy of a text-messaging intervention to support patients in their treatment adherence and improve blood pressure control. This is the first controlled trial testing the efficacy of text messaging in a large population for hypertension, at low cost and in a low-resource setting. The technology support for this trial is innovative, based on open-source software, and not only supports an interactive messaging system using standard and widely available SMS messaging, but also integrates clinical care and trial management.</p><p>In addition to testing the efficacy of the intervention, this study will provide information to further develop clinical care in low-resource settings and maximise the usefulness of new technology at low cost. It will provide an evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of integrating different aspects of clinical care through a delivery platform which uses the patient&#x02019;s mobile phone as an identifier and means of direct contact. The setting provides a particular challenge, set in a large peri-urban public sector clinic with a high patient load, typical of urban centres in Africa and the global south. We are recruiting participants from a clinic facility that are likely to be broadly representative of those receiving care for hypertension at primary care level.</p><p>The trial has been designed to address the limitations of previous studies of SMS text-messages to support treatment adherence for chronic diseases; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] the intervention was developed using a formal process to synthesise existing evidence, the opinion of clinical staff, and patients with chronic diseases, and iteratively tested in pilot work. There is a large bank of possible messages, and the delivery system (including interactive bi-directional SMS text-messaging) is automated. The duration of the intervention and the length of follow-up will allow us to explore effects of the intervention on adherence and persistence with treatment, and to assess whether habituation to the intervention might moderate the effect. The outcomes include measurement of adherence, as a key explanatory variable associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes, and blood pressure as a clinically relevant outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>KB, TB, NL, BR, MN, LT, AF conceived of the study.
