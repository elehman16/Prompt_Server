Although there are many approaches to hysterectomy, which depend on clinical criteria, certain patients may be eligible to be operated in any of the several available approaches. However, most comparative studies on hysterectomy are between two approaches. There is also a relative absence of data on long-term outcomes on quality of life and pelvic organ function. There is no single study which has considered quality of life, pelvic organ function and cost-effectiveness for the three main types of hysterectomy. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide evidence on the optimal route of hysterectomy in terms of cost-effectiveness by way of a three-armed randomized control study between non-descent vaginal hysterectomy, total laparoscopic hysterectomy and total abdominal hysterectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A multicentre three-armed randomized control trial is being conducted at the professorial gynaecology unit of the North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Ragama, Sri Lanka and gynaecology unit of the District General Hospital, Mannar, Sri Lanka. The study population is women needing hysterectomy for non-malignant uterine causes. Patients with a uterus&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;14&#x000a0;weeks, previous pelvic surgery, those requiring incontinence surgery or pelvic floor surgery, any medical illness which caution/contraindicate laparoscopic surgery and who cannot read and write will be excluded. The main exposure variable is non-descent vaginal hysterectomy and total laparoscopic hysterectomy. The control group will be patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy. The primary outcome is time to recover following surgery, which is the earliest time to resume all of the usual activities done prior to surgery. In total, 147 patients (49 per arm) are needed to have 80% power at &#x003b1;-0.01 considering a loss to follow-up of 20% to detect a 7-day difference between the three routes; TLH versus TAH versus NDVH. The economic evaluation will take a societal perspective and will include direct costs in relation to allocation of healthcare resources and indirect costs which are borne by the patient. A micro-costing approach will be adopted to calculate direct costs from the time of presentation to the gynaecology clinic up to 6&#x000a0;months after surgery. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) will be obtained by calculating the incremental costs divided by the incremental effects (time to recover and QALYs gained) for the intervention groups (NDVH and TLH) over the standard care (TAH) group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The cost of the procedure, quality of life and pelvic organ function following the three main routes of hysterectomy are important to clinicians and healthcare providers, both in developed and developing countries.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">The study was registered in the Sri Lanka clinical trials registry (SLCTR/2016/020) and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.slctr.lk/trials/515">U1111-1194-8422</ext-link>) on 26 July 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-2295-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Non-descent vaginal hysterectomy</kwd><kwd>Total laparoscopic hysterectomy</kwd><kwd>Total abdominal hysterectomy</kwd><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Quality of life</kwd><kwd>Pelvic organ function</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008968</institution-id><institution>National Research Council Sri Lanka</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16-086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wijesinghe</surname><given-names>Prasantha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p id="Par14">Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological surgery, with up to 100,000 procedures performed annually in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The optimal route of a hysterectomy for a patient will depend on the pathological nature, uterine size, uterine descent, endometriosis and the likelihood of pelvic adhesions and adnexal masses, previous pelvic surgery and the surgeon&#x02019;s preference. Although there are many methods of doing a hysterectomy the methods in mainstream practice are; total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), non-descent vaginal hysterectomy (NDVH) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH). In some instances the best route is obvious; e.g. if the uterus is larger than 20&#x000a0;weeks, a TAH may be the optimal method. While in uterine prolapse, with coexistent cystocele or rectocele, a vaginal hysterectomy and repair may be the best route to deal with all the problems. However, there is a group of patients with benign gynaecological conditions for whom any one of the three main methods can be applied. It is worth finding out what is the most cost-effective method of hysterectomy in this ubiquitous group which includes a significant proportion of women undergoing hysterectomy.</p><p id="Par15">Most comparative studies on hysterectomy are between two approaches; vaginal versus laparoscopic, abdominal versus laparoscopic or vaginal versus abdominal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. These studies and even systematic reviews are underpowered to detect a difference in major complications such as visceral injuries between the three main methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Although initial studies suggested an increased risk of urinary tract damage in TLH, the risk may not be that high now when the effects of the learning curve of laparoscopy and the evolution of the technique of TLH are considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Although direct costs appear to be high for TLH, a shorter postoperative hospital stay and lower indirect costs appear to make it more cost-effective compared to the standard TAH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There is evidence to suggest that VH appears to be less costly compared to LH according to the eVALuate trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However to date, there has been no direct comparison of costs between VH and TAH. Neither has there been any study which has attempted to shed light on the costing of hysterectomy in developing countries, where the emphasis should be on cost-effectiveness. Cost of healthcare interventions is an important aspect to consider in limited-resource settings. Although free public healthcare is available in Sri Lanka, it is important to know the cost incurred due to the huge burden on taxpayers. Therefore, direct health sector-related costs should be explored if cost-effectiveness is the ultimate aim, especially for a low- and middle-income country. Indirect costs incorporating loss of productivity are important, especially when the target population involves the population workforce, to get a wider perspective of costs incurred. Against such a backdrop, an ideal costing study would need to involve a broader societal perspective considering direct costs related to the health sector and indirect costs incorporating recovery-related costs and loss of productivity.</p><p id="Par16">There is also a relative paucity of data on long-term outcomes; quality of life, urinary, bowel and sexual function in randomized controlled trials comparing surgical approaches to hysterectomy for which well-validated instruments on pelvic organ function would need to be applied in a standardised manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, postoperative recovery and quality of life should be regarded as key outcomes in trials on approaches to hysterectomy for benign disease as these are the ultimate tests of effectiveness. To date there is no study which has considered quality of life, pelvic organ function and cost-effectiveness for the three main types of hysterectomy. The aim of this study is to provide evidence on the optimal type of hysterectomy in terms of cost-effectiveness by way of a three-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT) between NDVH, TLH and TAH in a low-resource setting.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par17">We hypothesize that TLH and NDVH are better than TAH in terms of time to recover, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), pelvic organ function and cost-effectiveness.

The end point for QALYs is 6-months while for urinary, vaginal and sexual function it is 1-year. Patients who do not complete follow-up in these secondary outcomes will be right censored up to their respective end-points. Post hoc pairwise analysis between TAH, NDVH and TLH will be done using COX regression. The other outcomes; operative time, anaesthesia time, postoperative hospital stay, cost, pain scores and blood loss will be analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test with post hoc comparisons. The complications will be described for each category. A fully specified Statistical Analysis Plan will be provided before opening the database.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p id="Par42">The economic evaluation will take societal perspective and will include direct costs related to utilization of healthcare resources in the hospital and indirect costs which are borne by the patient. A micro-costing approach will be adopted to calculate utilization of hospital resources from the time of presentation to the gynaecology clinic up to six months after surgery. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) will be obtained by calculating the incremental costs divided by the incremental effects (time to recover and QALYs gained) for the intervention groups (NDVH and TLH) over the standard care (TAH) group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Resource use and costs</title><p id="Par43">Direct costs would include surgical costs, clinic costs, investigation costs and care during hospital stay. Surgical costs will consider staff cost, equipment cost, anaesthetic costs and cost of basic utilities; water, electricity and building cost. Clinic costs will entail staff cost, equipment cost and cost of basic utilities for clinics during the preoperative and postoperative period. Investigation costs will include laboratory and imaging costs for preoperative period and postoperative period. Information on routine investigations; full blood count, blood urea, serum electrolytes, urine full report, ECG, chest X-ray, transvaginal ultrasound scan (TVS) and any other additional investigation would be collected from clinic and in-ward medical records by the data collector on to a data sheet. The cost of hospital stay will include staff costs, cost of medicines and basic utilities. Information on healthcare costs were obtained from the medical supplies division of the Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka. Information on labour costs and basic utilities were obtained separately for each centre. Indirect costs will consider costs of additional investigations and medicines paid for by the patient, travel costs to and from the hospital/clinic, cost for carers and productivity losses for the patients and families and will be obtained by patient-filled questionnaires.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Organisational structure</title><p id="Par44">The study office is in the professorial obstetrics and gynaecology unit of the faculty of medicine, University of Kelaniya. It communicates with North Colombo Teaching Hospital-Ragama and District General Hospital, Mannar on specific issues. Each site is responsible for randomization and data collection. Monthly meetings are held in the study office with the participation of the involved gynaecologists at North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Ragama and the lead gynaecologist from District General Hospital, Mannar to ensure the smooth running of the trial. Six monthly updates will be provided to the Faculty of Graduate Studies of the University of Kelaniya and the Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry (SLCTR) along with yearly progress reports to the funding agency, National Research Council (NRC) of Sri Lanka. The study is supervised by its project management group, which consists of a representative of the grant agency and representatives from the study centres.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Local organisation in centres</title><p id="Par45">Each centre will have a lead gynaecologist who will be the point of contact for that centre whose responsibilities will be: to establish the study locally, obtaining the required regulatory approval; to appoint and train a local research assistant; to inform all relevant local staff about the study (e.g. other consultant gynaecologists, junior medical staff, research assistants and ward staff); take responsibility for complications of the study locally; and notify the study centre of any unexpected complications due to the study. Fortnightly meetings involving gynaecologists, research assistants, junior medical staff and paramedical staff will be held at each local centre. The involved gynaecologists will identify eligible patients, explain the different surgery options to them, and ensure that study documentation has been provided and that informed consent has been obtained.</p><p id="Par46">Each centre will have a local research assistant to organise recruitment of patients to the study. The responsibilities of the research assistant will be to: ensure that each participating patient has received the patient information leaflet and has given informed written consent, ensure that each participant has received all self-administered questionnaires, collect all relevant medical data on to the data sheet, keep a log of all eligible women and their recruitment status, maintain a register of all recruited patients, contact participants at relevant assessment points to obtain required data (at 1&#x000a0;week, 6&#x000a0;weeks, 3&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year), systematic filing of study documents, data entry on to the computer database, notify the local lead gynaecologist of any problem or complication and inform local staff of progress of the study. In order to improve recruitment, research assistants will identify any eligible women in the ward who may have been missed at the gynaecology clinic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Research governance</title><p id="Par47">The computer unit of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya will help to provide centralised database support. The principal investigator will ensure that sufficient mechanisms are in place for monitoring the quality of the study with timely routine reports of adverse effects. The trial will comply with the UK Data Protection Act 1998. The trial statistician will have access to the final trial dataset and will manage access rights to the dataset. If compliance with legal, data protection and ethical guidelines are met anonymised trial data will be shared with other researchers once all planned data analysis is complete.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Safety monitoring and premature termination of study</title><p id="Par48">All surgeries will be done by consultants competent in the relevant type of hysterectomy, i.e., for an example all hysterectomies will be done by specialists who have operated on a minimum of 25 procedures. Any complication would be managed as per standard guidelines and necessary multidisciplinary input sought if required. All complications will be reviewed by an independent clinical review panel comprising three experienced gynaecologists. A list of all the possible complications will be made available at each site. It is the responsibility of the researchers and all other grades of staff to inform the clinical review committee of any complication through incident report forms, which are available in each setting. The clinical review panel will assess if the complications in the TLH or NDVH group exceed in amount or severity compared to the standard treatment (TAH group). If so, the disadvantaged arm of the study will be terminated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Main ethical issues</title><p id="Par49">All three hysterectomy methods described above are standard treatment modalities in operative gynaecology. Therefore, we believe that we are not intentionally harming patients by including them in this clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Dissemination policy</title><p id="Par50">The results of the study will be submitted for publication to peer-reviewed medical journals and presented at symposia regardless of the outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par51">Studies in low-resource settings are hampered by financial limitations and feasibility in terms of time and collection of good quality accurate data. This protocol considers many relevant aspects concerned with the comparison of total abdominal, non-descent vaginal and total laparoscopic hysterectomy in one study for a lower-middle-income country where evidence on surgical outcomes especially in the form of randomized controlled trials are hard to come by. We believe these reasons make this protocol appealing for other researchers in similar settings.</p><p id="Par52">As this is a multicentre study the involvement of multiple surgeons is inevitable and this can raise the issue of various skill levels and affect the outcome of surgery rather than a single operator. Although the issue of multiple surgeons is a limitation to the study itself, the generalisability of the results to the rest of the country would be more in our design of a pragmatic multicentre study involving multiple surgeons for each method rather than a single-centre study with a single surgeon for each method. In a study of this nature, it would not be possible to blind the patients nor the surgeons as the scars are distinct in each method. Although this is a limitation it is unavoidable and only the statistician will be blinded. The use of objective questionnaires, for patients&#x02019; as well as for assessors will also help to minimize bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par53">The primary outcome, of time to resume usual activities, could be subject to recall bias. As it is a patient-reported outcome it has the advantage of being the best estimator of convalescence in the eyes of patients despite being subjective. Pelvic organ function is also assessed through patient-filled questionnaires as there is no objective method of assessing postoperative pelvic organ function. Although patient-reported outcomes can be subjective, validated questionnaires such as the ones used in this study make these assessments more valid and reliable. These questionnaires are the only available, non-invasive and generically applicable tools that can be used in low-resource settings.</p><p id="Par54">Major complications (bladder, ureteric, bowel) are relatively rare in hysterectomy for benign surgery and as such a very large sample size would be needed if it was selected as the primary outcome. This is not feasible in our context and this study is underpowered to detect these problems. However, it could be assumed that if these complications were to occur, it would in some way be reflected by the time to recover and QALYs as these measures will show the overall quality of life of the individual concerned. Assessment of menopausal symptoms post-hysterectomy would need serum FSH levels before and after surgery if it is to be assessed in a quantitative manner, but it is not available in the public sector in Sri Lanka. Post-hysterectomy vaginal vault prolapse is a rare long-term complication following hysterectomy which would require follow up at least of up to 10&#x000a0;years, which is not feasible in our setting.</p><p id="Par55">Despite these disadvantages, this randomized controlled trial will provide level 1 evidence regarding the three main methods of hysterectomy in terms of operative time, postoperative hospital stay, cost, convalescence, sexual dysfunction, bladder, bowel function and QALY&#x02019;s. It will also establish a quantifiable and reproducible method of accessing outcomes for benign gynaecological surgery.</p><p id="Par56">Although exact figures for rates of hysterectomy are difficult to obtain for developing countries it can be assumed to be very high due to the non-availability of levonorgestrel intrauterine system and other medical alternatives due to financial constraints, and as such TAH is often offered by default. This study will shed light on whether it is indeed the most appropriate in terms of health- related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. If it is not, i.e. if NDVH or TLH is better than TAH, it will suggest a change in attitude of gynaecologists, resource allocation from the Ministry of Health and even postgraduate training to lay more emphasis on alternative methods of hysterectomy.</p><p id="Par57">There is very limited information on costs related to healthcare interventions in Sri Lanka possibly due to a misconception of <italic>&#x02018;free health&#x02019;</italic>. The societal viewpoint in calculating costs in our study will generate an accurate picture of both direct hospital-related and indirect patient-related costs. The micro-costing approach used in this study is reported to be the most accurate method in calculating hospital cost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, this study will provide valuable information on costing a surgical intervention, the methodology of which will be helpful across the board for other specialities as well as similar scenarios in other developing countries.</p><p id="Par58">Sri Lanka is a lower-middle-income country, and as such it is important for us to enquire in to cost to ensure that maximum value for money is obtained with the limited resources at hand. Therefore, cost-effectiveness should be the benchmark to assess healthcare interventions in such a backdrop. This study will shed light on the optimum type of hysterectomy in terms of cost-effectiveness considering both the clinicians and patients&#x02019; perspectives.</p><sec id="Sec24"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par59">The first patient was randomised to the trial on 1 August 2016.
