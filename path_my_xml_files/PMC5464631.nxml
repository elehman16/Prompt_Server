The nasopharyngeal microbiota in cattle plays an important role in overall respiratory health, especially when stresses associated with weaning, transport, and adaptation to a feedlot affect the normal respiratory defenses. Recent evidence suggests that cattle diagnosed with bovine respiratory disease complex have significantly less bacterial diversity. The objective of this study was to determine whether feeding weaned beef calves Se-enriched alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic>) hay for 9 weeks in a preconditioning program prior to entering the feedlot alters nasal microbiota. Recently weaned beef calves (n = 45) were blocked by sex and body weight, randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups with 3 pens of 5 calves per treatment group, and fed an alfalfa hay based diet for 9 weeks. Alfalfa hay was harvested from fields fertilized with sodium selenate at a rate of 0, 45.0 or 89.9 g Se/ha. Blood samples were collected biweekly and analyzed for whole-blood Se concentrations. Nasal swabs were collected during week 9 from one or two calves from each pen (total n = 16). Calculated Se intake from dietary sources was 3.0, 15.6, and 32.2 mg Se/head/day for calves consuming alfalfa hay with Se concentrations of 0.34 to 2.42 and 5.17 mg Se/kg dry matter, respectively. Whole-blood Se concentrations after 8 weeks of feeding Se-fertilized alfalfa hay were dependent upon Se-application rates (0, 45.0, or 89.9 g Se/ha) and were 155, 345, and 504 ng/mL (<italic>P</italic><sub>Linear</sub> &#x0003c; 0.0001). Microbial DNA was extracted from nasal swabs and amplified and sequenced. Alpha rarefaction curves comparing the species richness (observed OTUs) and overall diversity (Chao1, Observed OTU, and Shannon index) between calves fed selenium-biofortified alfalfa hay compared with control calves showed that Se-supplementation tended to be associated with an enriched nasal microbiota. ANOSIM of unweighted UniFrac distances showed that calves fed high Se-biofortified alfalfa hay clustered separately when compared with control calves in the PCoA plot (<italic>R</italic> = 0.216, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04). The bacterial orders <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> and <italic>Flavobacteriales</italic> were increased in healthy control calves compared with <italic>Clostridiales</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidales</italic> being increased in calves fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay. Although there were strong trends, no significant differences were noted for any of the bacterial taxa. Based upon these findings, we suggest that weaned beef calves fed Se-biofortified hay tend to have an enriched nasal microbiota. Feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay to weaned beef calves prior to entering the feedlot is a strategy for increasing nasopharyngeal microbial diversity.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Agriculture Research Foundation, Oregon State University</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Jean A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funded in part by a grant from the Agriculture Research Foundation (J.

Se deficiency can cause nutritional myodegeneration, also known as white muscle disease, characterized by muscle weakness, heart failure, unthriftiness, and death. Insufficient Se intake can cause subclinical diseases resulting in poor livestock performance. The role of Se in animal health is based primarily on the functions of selenocysteine-containing proteins, many of which have antioxidant activities [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Oxidative stress is a primary mechanism by which reactive oxygen species (ROS) influence biological processes and may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease by modifying the expression of proinflammatory genes. The beneficial effects of Se supplementation may result from selenoproteins converting harmful ROS to less reactive molecules, as well as influencing the expression of redox-regulated genes [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>In Se-deficient areas, several means of Se supplementation are available, e.g., organic Se-yeast can be added to feed, or inorganic Na selenite can be added to mineral mixes for free-choice consumption. Agronomic biofortification is an alternative approach, whereby the Se concentration of forage is increased through the use of Se-containing fertilizer amendments [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. We have demonstrated that Se-fertilization is an effective strategy for Se supplementation in sheep [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179215.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Our goal was to apply this Se-supplementation strategy to weaned beef calves to optimize cattle health.</p><p>Conversely, Se toxicity and livestock death can occur when cattle consume excessive amounts of Se in their diet. For example, consumption of Se-accumulator plants, including species of <italic>Astragalus</italic>, <italic>Brassica</italic>, <italic>and Stanleya</italic>, which survive in soils with high Se concentrations, can cause toxicity. Although cattle do not typically eat these plants, care should be taken when grazing in areas where they grow. Death can also occur when excessive amounts of inorganic Se are injected. The majority of published experimental work on selenosis in ruminants (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]) is based on studies using inorganic forms of Se, such as sodium selenate or sodium selenite, whereas the predominant chemical form of Se in forage is selenomethionine [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In some cattle, chronic dietary exposure for 4 months to 0.28 and 0.8 mg Se/kg in the form of selenomethionine resulted in mild (subclinical) to severe (clinical) forms of alkali disease [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Selenium is regulated as a feed additive by the Food and Drug Administration because of its potential toxic effects. In Oregon, the use of Se as a soil amendment is not regulated. Thus, Se deficiency in cattle, caused by low Se intake, can be mitigated by increasing the Se concentrations in hay fed to cattle.</p><p>Dietary glutamine supplementation has been shown to regulate intestinal immunity, for example though enhancement of secretory IgA production, and studies in mice show that glutamine supplementation acts in part by altering the intestinal bacterial community [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179215.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It is thought that functional amino acids regulate immunity by modulating gene expression, protein synthesis, and cellular signaling (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]). We have previously shown that Se supplementation alters gene expression profiles associated with innate immunity in circulating neutrophils of sheep. Thus, we hypothesized that Se supplementation in cattle might also alter bacterial communities.</p><p>Similar to the role of the intestinal microbiome in gastrointestinal health, the respiratory microbiome is a strong determinant of respiratory health [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The nasal microbial ecosystem primes the immune system and provides colonization resistance against acquisition of new pathogens, plus it contains potential pathogenic bacteria living among harmless commensals [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. There is recent evidence to suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiota plays an important role in respiratory health in cattle [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179215.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex had significantly less bacterial diversity and fewer Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) in their nasopharynx [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Reduced diversity of nasopharyngeal microbiota may be a risk factor to BRD development [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The nasopharyngeal microbiota of beef cattle undergoes major evolution from weaning to 40 days after arrival at a feedlot [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hypothetically, this may explain why cattle are most susceptible to bovine respiratory disease (BRD) complex during transition to a feedlot environment. The question thus arises, beyond the use of antibiotics and vaccines, might disease prevention be achieved by altering environmental factors to impact the success of specific bacterial species in this territorial competition [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to determine whether feeding weaned beef calves Se-enriched alfalfa (<italic>Medicago sativa</italic>) hay for 8 weeks in a preconditioning program prior to entering the feedlot alters the nasal microbiota. We hypothesized that feeding weaned beef calves forage fertilized with increasing amount of Na-selenate would improve the overall diversity of the nasal microbiome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animal ethics statement and study design</title><p>The experimental protocol was reviewed and this study was approved by the Oregon State University Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUP Number: 4705). This was a prospective clinical trial of 9-week duration (October 10, 2015 through December 10, 2015) involving 45 weaned beef calves, primarily of Angus breeding. The study design consisted of 3 treatment groups, with three pens of five animals per treatment. The study was conducted at the Steer Metabolism barn on the Oregon State University campus (Corvallis, OR, USA).</p><p>Corvallis is located at an elevation of 72 m within the Marine West Coast climate zone. Temperatures are mild year round, with warm, sunny summers and mild, wet winters with persistent overcast skies. Because of its close proximity to the coast range, temperatures dropping below freezing are uncommon. Average monthly temperatures for November are 10.8&#x000b0;C (high) and 3.3&#x000b0;C (low). Rainfall total is 110.9 cm/yr. Typical distribution of precipitation includes about 50% of the annual total from December through February, lesser amounts in the spring and fall, and very little during summer.</p><p>The weaned beef calves ranged in age from 6.5 to 9 months (222 &#x000b1; 6.4 days; mean &#x000b1; SEM) and originated from the Oregon State University beef ranch, Corvallis, OR, USA. Body weights at weaning ranged from 240 to 334 kg (286 &#x000b1; 9.3 kg, mean &#x000b1; SEM), and body condition scores ranged from 6 to 7 (1 to 9 scale). There were 17 heifers and 28 steer calves in the study. Routine farm management practices, including vaccinations and deworming, were the same for all treatment groups.</p><p>Using a randomized complete block design, calves were blocked at the time of weaning by sex and body weight and then assigned to one of 3 treatment groups of 15 calves each. Ear tags were used to identify calves. Calves were then placed by treatment group into pens (3 pens of 5 calves/treatment group). The pens were 14 m<sup>2</sup>/calf; concrete flooring in open lots that were strip cleaned once weekly; shavings in loafing area with 4.5 m<sup>2</sup>/calf; concrete bunks with 98 cm of feeder space/calf; all measurements exceeded requirements [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] with continuous access to water, feed bunks, and shelter.</p><p>Calves were fed 70% alfalfa hay and 30% grass hay twice daily. The amount of hay fed was adjusted weekly to ensure that calves had all they wanted for consumption yet with minimal wastage. The ration was formulated for growing beef calves in the 250 to 350 kg weight range to achieve a target average daily gain of 0.5 kg/day. The goal was to feed hay at a rate of 70% alfalfa and 30% grass hay. Calves were transitioned to their respective alfalfa hay sources over a 7 day period. Alfalfa hay was fed as follows: 0.68 kg/head/day 1; 1.14 kg/head/day 2; 1.59 kg/head day 3; 2.27 kg/head/day 4; 2.95 kg/head/day 5; 3.41 kg/head/day 6; and 3.86 kg/head/day 7. During this first week, grass hay was added to achieve a total hay intake of 5.45 kg/head/days 1 and 2; 5.91 kg/head/days 3 and 4; 6.36 kg/head/days 5 and 6; and 6.82 kg/head/days 7 and 8. Thereafter, calves were fed 70% alfalfa hay and 30% grass hay with increases as needed to provide all the hay they wanted for consumption yet with minimal wastage. By week 9, calves were consuming between 8.18 to 9.09 kg hay/head/day.</p><p>Prior to this study, calves had free-choice access to a mineral supplement containing 120 mg/kg Se from sodium-selenite. The mineral supplement (dry matter basis) was in loose granular format and contained 57.0 to 64.0 g/kg calcium; 30.0 g/kg phosphorus; 503 to 553 g/kg salt (NaCl); 50.0 g/kg magnesium; 50 mg/kg cobalt; 2,500 mg/kg copper; 200 mg/kg manganese; 200 mg/kg iodine; 6,500 mg/kg zinc (Wilbur-Ellis Company, Clackamas, OR). During this feeding trial, mineral supplement was added as a top dressing to the hay for each pen of calves at the rate of 0.1 mg Se/kg of dry matter intake [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. At the beginning of the study this calculation was 0.49 mg Se/head/day, or 4.08 g mineral supplement/head/day.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Selenium fortified-alfalfa hay</title><p>The soil was enriched with Se by mixing inorganic sodium-selenate (RETORTE Ulrich Scharrer GmbH, R&#x000f6;thenbach, Germany) with water and spraying it onto the soil surface of an alfalfa field at application rates of 0, 45.0, or 89.9 g Se/ha immediately after the second cutting of hay in July 2014. The application rates were chosen based on a previous study [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Third-cutting alfalfa hay was harvested 40 days after Se application and then analyzed for nutrient and Se content. Alfalfa yield was approximately 4.9 ton/ha. A Penn State forage sampler was used to take 25 cores from random bales in each hay source (0, 45.0, or 89.9 g Se/ha). Samples were collected prior to beginning the feeding trial for each alfalfa hay source. Core samples were mixed well and representative samples selected for analysis. Alfalfa hay samples were submitted to commercial laboratories for routine nutrient analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0179215.t001">Table 1</xref>; Cumberland Analytical Services, Maugansville, MD) and Se analysis (Utah Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, Logan, UT). Alfalfa hay dry matter determination was completed at a temperature of 105&#x000b0;C for 12 to 14 h in a forced draught oven. Methods for crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF), ash, and minerals were performed according to the Association of Official Analytical Chemists [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The neutral detergent fiber (NDF) was determined according to Van Soest et al. [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Soluble protein was determined according to Krishnamoorthy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Plant samples were prepared for Se analysis as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and Se determined using inductively coupled argon plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-MS; ELAN 6000, Perkin Elmer, Shelton, CT). Quantification of Se was performed by the standard addition method, using a 4-point standard curve. A quality-control sample (in similar matrix) was analyzed after every 5 samples, and analysis was considered acceptable if the Se concentration of the quality-control sample fell within &#x000b1; 5% of the standard/reference value for the quality control.</p><table-wrap id="pone.0179215.t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id

Fixed effects in the model were Se application rate (0, 45.0, and 89.9 g Se/ha), gender, baseline WB-Se (as linear covariate), time (after 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of feeding Se enriched hay), and the interaction between Se application rate and time. An unstructured variance-covariance matrix was used to account for variation of measures within calves. The unstructured variance-covariance matrix provided the most parsimonious variance-covariance matrix based on the lowest value by the Aikaike Information Criterion. To evaluate the effect of Se application rate, linear and quadratic contrasts were constructed. In addition, the linear response of the dependent variable Se forage content or WB-Se concentrations of beef calves to the independent variable Se fertilization rate were evaluated using univariate regression in PROC REG.

The nasopharygeal microbiota in cattle plays an important role in overall respiratory health, particularly when stressors such as weaning, transportation, and feed adaptation affect the normal respiratory defenses (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). Recent evidence suggests that limiting colonization of opportunistic bacterial pathogens will reduce BRD in feedlot cattle (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). However, vaccinations do not completely protect against infections. And, the use of low dosages of oral prophylactic and therapeutic group medications converts opportunistic pathogenic bacteria in the respiratory tract into reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In one study [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], cattle diagnosed with BRD had significantly less bacterial diversity and fewer OTUs at feedlot entry prompting researchers to conclude that reduced diversity of nasopharyngeal microbiota may be a risk factor to BRD development. As a result, new strategies for preventing respiratory disease in feedlot cattle have been suggested, for example, nasal probiotics [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Our results suggest that feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay to weaned beef calves prior to entering the feedlot is another strategy for increasing nasopharyngeal microbial diversity.</p><p>Rarefaction curves comparing the species richness (observed OTU number) and overall diversity (Chao1, Observed OTU, and Shannon index) among weaned beef calves fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay compared with healthy control calves showed that calves fed the highest concentration of Se-biofortified alfalfa hay had more (1236 vs 887) OTUs identified at a depth of 7,214 sequences. This number of OTUs was comparable with results previously reported in feedlot cattle [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Calves receiving Se-supplementation had linearly increasing alpha diversity measures, although increases were not statistically significant. Thus, weaned beef calves fed Se-biofortified hay tended to have an enriched nasal microbiota.</p><p>In our study, a total of 16 bacterial phyla were identified compared with 8 in the previous report [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the control calves, the majority of the sequences were classified as <italic>Proteobacteria</italic> (44%), but in calves receiving Se-biofortified hay <italic>Firmicutes</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> were slightly more or equally prevalent. <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> and <italic>Tenericutes</italic> were also present in lower percentages. Three phyla showed significant differences among calves, in that calves receiving Se-biofortified hay had greater percentages of <italic>Tenericutes</italic>, <italic>Lentisphaerae</italic>, and <italic>Planctomycetes</italic>. The phyla composition in our calves fed Se-biofortified hay was more consistent with that of calves in a previous study that had been in the feedlot for 60 days vs calves at feedlot entry [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The beta diversity was measured using the phylogeny-based unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances. ANOSIM of unweighted UniFrac distances showed that this clustering was significant (<italic>R</italic> = 0.362, <italic>P</italic> = 0.03). When the unweighted UniFrac distances for nasopharygeal microbiota in control calves were compared with calves fed high-Se alfalfa hay, the two groups were different (<italic>P</italic> = 0.04) from one another, although the associated <italic>R</italic>-value was modest (0.216). The <italic>R</italic>-value was higher (0.332) for the weighted UniFrac distance between these two groups and tended to be significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.056). Calves fed the medium-Se alfalfa hay also tended to be different from control calves (<italic>P</italic> = 0.069). Holman et al. [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] also reported that calves at feedlot entry and after 60 days in the feedlot were different from one another based on beta diversity, thus indicating difference in microbial structure across time.</p><p>The linear discriminant analysis of bacterial taxa showed that bacterial orders were altered between the control calves and calves fed Se-fortified hay. The bacterial orders <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> and <italic>Flavobacteriales</italic> were increased in healthy control calves compared with <italic>Clostridiales</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidales</italic> being increased in calves fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay. Although there were strong trends, no significant differences were noted for any of the bacterial taxa. Thus, it is likely that many bacterial traits coexisting together, rather than differences in specific types of bacteria, are responsible for overall changes in the ecosystem.</p><p>Analysis of bacterial functions induced by feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay revealed differences in metabolic pathways. For example in calves fed high levels of Se-biofortified hay there were enriched metabolic pathways involved in bacterial chemotaxis, transcription, sporulation, and starch and sucrose metabolism. The overall significance of these findings requires further study.</p><p>Calves likely have greater Se requirements during periods of stress such as during weaning and movement to a feedlot, which is one of the most stressful times for beef calves [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Selenium plays an important role in immune responses of cattle. For example, in a previous study we showed that calves fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay had higher antibody titers after vaccination with <italic>J-5 E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> bacterin, and that vaccine-specific antibody titers increased linearly with increasing Se content of the hay [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. We have seen a similar effect on antibody responses to <italic>J-5 E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> bacterin in adult beef cows grazing Se-fertilized forage [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In the previous study with weaned beef calves, overall health was improved as feedlot calves had lower mortality and greater slaughter weights. Neutrophil total antioxidant potential also tended to be greater in calves fed Se-biofortified hay, and neutrophil gene expression was altered [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. For example, two genes involved in innate immune function (IL-8R and L-Selectin) were lower in calves fed the highest level of Se-biofortified alfalfa hay. Genes involved in regulation of thioredoxin levels were also affected by Se treatment. Thus, our previous studies suggest that Se-supplementation above currently recommended levels may have short- and long-term beneficial effects on immune function and cattle production [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179215.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179215.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In particular, the role of Se in altering gene expression may be relevant to alterations in bacterial communities, as noted for functional food amino acids (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179215.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]).</p><p>Research in the last 10 years has demonstrated that the microbiota is important in priming and orchestrating innate and adaptive immune responses of the host (reviewed in [<xref rid="pone.0179215.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]). Whether Se-induced changes in the microbiota underlie the changes we have seen in innate and adaptive immune responses in weaned beef calves in previous studies requires more extensive research.</p><p>In conclusion, feeding Se-enriched alfalfa hay to weaned beef calves for 8 weeks during a preconditioning period to prepare them for the feedlot resulted in enrichment of the nasal microbiome. Calves fed the high-Se alfalfa hay had more OTUs, and beta diversity was different compared with control calves. The bacterial orders <italic>Lactobacillales</italic> and <italic>Flavobacteriales</italic> were increased in healthy control calves compared with <italic>Clostridiales</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidales</italic> being increased in calves fed Se-biofortified alfalfa hay. The mechanism by which dietary Se alters the nasal microbiome was not determined. Future studies are needed to investigate pathways linking dietary Se enrichment to gene expression, immune responses, and mucosal bacterial communities. Feeding Se-biofortified alfalfa hay to weaned beef calves prior to entering the feedlot is a strategy for increasing nasopharyngeal microbial diversity, and may ameliorate a negative risk factor for BRD development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0179215.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Individual bacterial group percentages.</title><p>Mean percentages of the most abundant bacterial groups on the various phylogenetic levels (phylum, class, order, family, genus) identified in nasal samples of randomly chosen healthy control calves (n = 5) and calves fed either medium (n = 6) or high (n = 5) Se-enriched alfalfa hay for 8 weeks.
