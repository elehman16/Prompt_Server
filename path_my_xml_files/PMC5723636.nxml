Attentional mechanisms facilitate this selection via top-down modulation of stimulus representations in the brain. Previous research has indicated that acetylcholine (ACh) modulates this influence of attention on stimulus processing. However, the role of muscarinic receptors as well as the specific mechanism of cholinergic modulation remains unclear. Here we investigated the influence of ACh on feature-based, top-down control of stimulus processing via muscarinic receptors by using a contingent capture paradigm which specifically tests attentional shifts toward uninformative cue stimuli which display one of the target defining features In a double-blind, placebo controlled study we measured the impact of the muscarinic receptor antagonist <italic>scopolamine</italic> on behavioral and electrophysiological measures of contingent attentional capture. The results demonstrated all the signs of functional contingent capture, i.e., attentional shifts toward cued locations reflected in increased amplitudes of N1 and N2Pc components, under placebo conditions. However, scopolamine did not affect behavioral or electrophysiological measures of contingent capture. Instead, scopolamine reduced the amplitude of the distractor-evoked Pd component which has recently been associated with active suppression of irrelevant distractor information. The findings suggest a general cholinergic modulation of top-down control during distractor processing.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>attention</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd><kwd>muscarinic</kwd><kwd>ERP</kwd><kwd>feature</kwd><kwd>N2pc</kwd><kwd>Pd</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="66"/><page-count count="14"/><word-count count="11389"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Selective attention allows adaptive processing of sensory input via top-down control signals, which modulate stimulus-related activity in sensory cortex in favor of behaviorally relevant stimuli (Serences et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Liu et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Jehee et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Lustig and Beck, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). As a result, the cortical representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli is enhanced relative to irrelevant stimuli facilitating their selection for further processing (Fecteau and Munoz, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Serences and Yantis, <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Attentional control of stimulus processing is thought to be influenced by several neuromodulators (Noudoost and Moore, <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Prominent among these is acetylcholine (ACh), which has been shown to optimize stimulus processing in attention demanding contexts (Sarter et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). It remains unknown, however, if this role is limited to spatial attention or if it also extends to feature-based aspects of attention.</p><p>ACh exerts its modulatory role over attentional processes via two different receptor types, namely muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors. These receptor types have different distributions in the brain but also appear to influence distinct aspects of attentional control (Zilles et al., <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Whereas nicotinic ACh receptors are thought to be more involved in novelty and cue detection, muscarinic receptors recruit circuits required for top-down control of attention (Hasselmo and Sarter, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Evidence for the latter stems from spatial cueing studies in monkeys (Davidson et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Davidson and Marrocco, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) and humans (Dunne and Hartley, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), which suggest that the muscarinic antagonist <italic>scopolamine</italic> might reduce the optimal utilization of attentional resources at a cued location. In line with this premise, an electrophysiological study in monkeys (Herrero et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) demonstrated a modulatory effect of scopolamine on spatial attention in visual cortex. However, despite the strong indications of a predominantly muscarinic modulation of top-down attention, there has been only limited research in human participants addressing this issue. Although some studies have confirmed muscarinic effects in visual cortex using neuroimaging methods (Furey et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Mentis et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>), the poor temporal resolution of neuroimaging means that these studies are uninformative with respect to the temporal cascade of information processing that contributes to attentional modulation. To our knowledge, no studies have utilized the excellent temporal resolution of event related potential (ERP) recordings to investigate cholinergic effects during different stages of visual processing in the human brain.</p><p>In this study we asked whether previous findings of cholinergic modulation of top-down attentional control, which focused on spatial attention, can also be generalized to the feature-based aspect of top-down control. Feature-based attention enhances the representation of stimuli with attended features and thus optimizes the search for a target based on target-defining features in the context of spatial uncertainty. This effect can be measured using contingent capture paradigms, in which attention involuntarily shifts toward a spatial cue when the cue contains a feature that matches the current task set (e.g., the color <italic>red</italic>; Folk et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>). As a result, cues matching the task set induce a validity effect, which is characterized by faster detection of targets appearing at cues locations compared to targets in other locations. Together with the electrophysiological characterization of the contingent capture effect this paradigm represents an excellent tool for the measurement of feature-based attention (Folk et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1994</xref>; Ansorge and Heumann, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Ansorge et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Chen and Mordkoff, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Leblanc et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Lien et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Brisson et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Sawaki and Luck, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). We therefore investigated whether the muscarinic antagonist <italic>scopolamine</italic> could affect behavioral and electrophysiological markers of contingent capture.</p><p>To assess the influence of scopolamine on contingent capture we focused analysis on several distinct electrophysiological markers. First, to investigate early processing of visual stimuli, we focused on the visual P1 and N1 components. Both of these components have been shown to be the earliest components modulated by top-down attention, including feature-based attention (Mangun and Hillyard, <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Lange et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Arnott et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Hopf et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Zhang and Luck, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Luck and Kappenman, <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Second, we were interested in components reflecting attentional orienting and distractor suppression, namely the N2pc and Pd. The N2pc is a reliable indicator of spatially selective processing of lateralized, task-relevant visual stimuli when these are presented with distractors (Luck and Hillyard, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1994a</xref>,<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>; Eimer, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Woodman and Luck, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Eimer and Kiss, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kiss et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Luck, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The N2pc has been used in several studies to demonstrate contingent capture (Eimer and Kiss, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Leblanc et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Eimer et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Third, we investigated the Pd (posterior positivity) component, which is closely related to the N2pc component, often follows the N2pc and is involved in distractor suppression (Sawaki and Luck, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hilimire et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kiss et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sawaki et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that modulation of top-down control of attention should be reflected in the modulation of one or several of these components and the nature of the modulation should thus speak to the role of muscarinic modulation of top-down control.</p><p>In light of previous studies of the muscarinic modulation of attention, we predicted that scopolamine would impair the processing advantage for task-relevant features and would therefore reduce the capturing effect of target-colored cues. This effect should be evidenced by a reduction of the validity effect as well as reduced amplitude, or latency shift, in the cue-related N2pc and/or Pd component. We also expected to observe a change in the amplitude of the P1 and N1 related to target-colored cues. Under placebo conditions, the P1 and N1 amplitude for these cues should be increased compared with neutral cues, due to top-down feature-based modulation. Thus, an inhibitory effect of scopolamine on top-down feature-based attention should reduce the amplitude of target-colored cues. To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to dissect specific effects of scopolamine on feature-based top-down attention using electrophysiological recordings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty male Caucasian participants with normal or corrected-to-normal vision and no history of neurological or psychiatric illness were tested.

Sessions were separated by a 7-day washout period and testing took place at the same time of day in both sessions. At the start of each session two gelatine capsules containing 0.8 mg scopolamine or dextrose (Placebo) were ingested with water. The dose for Scopolamine was chosen based on previous publications, which together suggest reliable cognitive effects but minimal sedative effects on performance at this dose of the drug (Ostfeld et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">1959</xref>; Safer and Allen, <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>; Wood et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Participants performed the contingent capture task from 100 (&#x000b1;15) min to 140 (&#x000b1;15) min after drug administration, coinciding with peak plasma levels of the drug (Muir and Metcalfe, <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>; Wood et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">1985</xref>). Side effects were assessed before drug administration, at drug peak and after the contingent capture task had been performed, by measuring blood pressure and heart rate as well as using a visual analog scale (VAS) for subjective side effect ratings (alertness, contentedness and calmness; Bond et al., <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1974</xref>).</p><p>General effects of scopolamine on arousal were tested in a two-alternative forced choice reaction time task, in which participants gave speeded responses to the direction (left, right) of a central arrow using the left and right index finger. This task was administered before drug administration and just before testing with the contingent capture task.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Setup and Stimuli</title><p>Stimulus presentation and recording were implemented using Presentation<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software (Version 14.1)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0001"><sup>1</sup></xref> and a 21&#x02033; CRT monitor with a screen resolution of 1024 &#x000d7; 768 pixels at a viewing distance of 70 cm. Responses were recorded using a standard keyboard. Participants were tested in a contingent capture reaction time task adapted from Lien et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The task required speeded responses to the identity of a letter (L or T) shown in a predefined target color (red or green). Responses were made using the index fingers of the left and right hands. The letter corresponding to each response button was counterbalanced between participants. The target-colored letter appeared with equal probability in one of four placeholder boxes located at the corners of an imaginary square surrounding a central fixation cross on a black background. The boxes subtended 1.8 degrees visual angle and were displayed at a distance of 2.8 degrees from central fixation. The remaining boxes of the target display contained distractor letters, one in a non-target color and two in gray (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The target display was preceded by a cue display, which contained four sets of four dots arranged around the placeholder boxes. Depending on the cue condition the sets of dots were presented in different colors (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and below). The fixation display consisted of the central fixation cross and the four placeholder boxes. RGB values of all colors were measured using a chromameter (Konica Minolta CL-100), and were adjusted to ensure equiluminance between all stimuli.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Trial sequence for the contingent capture task.

Vertical eye movements were recorded with two vertical electrooculogram (EOG) electrodes above and below the left eye, while horizontal eye movements were recorded from electrodes placed at the outer canthus of each eye. Data were analyzed using eeglab 9.0.4.4. (Delorme and Makeig, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>) and FASTER v1.2b. (Nolan et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), implemented in Matlab.</p><p>The resulting EEG data were down-sampled to 512 Hz, re-referenced off-line to the average of all scalp electrodes and segmented into epochs of &#x02212;1000 to +2000 ms surrounding cue onset. Epochs were baseline corrected relative to the pre-cue interval (&#x02212;200 to 0 ms), high-pass filtered to 0.5 Hz and low-pass filtered up to 40 Hz. To eliminate blink and eye movement artifacts an independent components analysis was conducted using FASTER v1.2b. (Nolan et al., <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and the respective components eliminated from the signal of all channels. Finally, the signals in all epochs were checked manually and epochs with extreme transient noise were rejected.</p><p>In the subsequent analyses grand averages were generated for the calculation of the N1, P1, N2pc and Pd components. Peak amplitudes and mean amplitudes were analyzed using a region of interest (ROI) approach. Electrode sets for all analyses were selected based on the peak voltage of each component in a topographic map in the placebo condition and guided by previous reports of each component in the literature. The width of the window used to measure component amplitudes was based on the duration and spatial extent of each component in the grand average waveform. Peak amplitudes were extracted as the maximum voltage for positive components or the minimum voltage for negative components within the respective time window. The mean amplitude was calculated as the average voltage within the time window for each component.

More specifically, we were interested in the cholinergic modulation of feature-based task set on the processing of task-relevant stimuli as well as distractors. To do so we measured the effect of the muscarinic antagonist <italic>scopolamine</italic> on behavioral and electrophysiological measures of contingent capture (Lien et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). In the behavioral data, although scopolamine led to an overall decrease in accuracy, there was no indication of a specific cholinergic influence on contingent capture, with participants exhibiting comparable cue validity effects in both conditions. However, the drug did produce a significant attenuation of the distractor-related Pd component compared with placebo.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Effects of Scopolamine on Performance</title><p>Analysis of behavioral data in the placebo condition confirmed that the task did induce a classical contingent capture effect. Specifically, we observed shorter RTs and increased accuracy after presentation of a valid target-colored cue as well as increased RTs and decreased accuracy after presentation of an invalid target-colored cue (Folk et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Lien et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Despite a non-specific (i.e., cue independent) decrease in accuracy under scopolamine compared with placebo, we did not observe a behavioral modulation of the contingent capture effect by scopolamine. Importantly, scopolamine did not impair performance on the choice reaction time control task, arguing against any simple arousal-based explanation for the overall reduced accuracy under scopolamine. Instead, we suggest that the observed increase in error rate in all conditions of the contingent capture task is related to a disruption of target identification processes. In a previous study in humans using spatial probability to cue the target location, scopolamine decreased the advantage for high probability locations and decreased the disadvantage for low probability locations (Dunne and Hartley, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>). The latter result was interpreted as an impairment in the ability to allocate attentional capacity to the target location. In another study in monkeys during a simple Posner spatial cueing paradigm, scopolamine specifically decreased the validity effect by increasing the reaction time for valid cues compared with invalid or neutral cues (Davidson et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). To our knowledge these are the only published studies to examine the impact of systemic administration of scopolamine in combination with a spatial cueing task. Differences in the complexity of cue and target displays makes any direct comparison difficult. Since in the current study we did not find a modulation of the validity effect by scopolamine, we speculate that the overall reduced accuracy we observed after scopolamine administration is the result of an effect of scopolamine on target identification within a complex target display. Thus, scopolamine might decrease the ability to efficiently identify a target amongst distractor stimuli.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Effects of Scopolamine on Early Visual Components</title><p>We further scrutinized electrophysiological responses related to contingent capture to investigate potential effects of scopolamine on top-down attention, which may not have been apparent in the behavioral measures. To investigate the effect of scopolamine during early stimulus processing we measured the P1 and N1 elicited by the cue display. The analysis aimed to identify differences in P1 and N1 amplitudes to target-colored cues compared with neutral cues, and consequently the modulation of these differences by scopolamine. The P1 component was neither modulated by feature-based, top-down attention, nor by scopolamine. The amplitude of the N1, on the other hand, specifically increased in response to presentation of a target-colored cue compared with a neutral cue, as previously shown in a contingent capture paradigm by Arnott et al. (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). In line with these findings we suggest that the increase in this early visual component reflects a top-down feature-based influence of attention on the processing of the target-colored cue. However, scopolamine did not affect the relative difference in N1 amplitude between target-colored and neutral cue displays. This leads us to the conclusion that scopolamine did not influence top-down influences on early visual components. We suggest that the muscarinic modulation of attention effects in visual cortex, such as those demonstrated in monkey V1, might be restricted to spatial attention (Herrero et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, this suggestion is speculative and requires further experiments in both humans and monkeys to probe the effects of feature-based attention in visual cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Effects of Scopolamine on N2pc Components</title><p>We also measured the N2Pc component as an indicator of contingent capture by stimuli with task relevant features. The N2pc component reflects the allocation of spatial attention toward a selected stimulus. Although the precise function of the N2pc has been a matter of some debate (Eimer, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>; Eimer and Kiss, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Luck, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) it has been consistently linked to the process of target selection. A recent demonstration that the N2pc is observed even in the absence of distractors suggests that it may primarily reflect the enhancement of target features rather than the suppression of distractor information (Mazza et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Loughnane et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><p>Under placebo conditions the N2pc following the cue display indicated a classic contingent capture effect/attention shift toward the target-colored cue, as indicated by an increase in amplitude within the N2pc window compared with the neutral condition. We also measured an N2pc in relation to the target display, which represented an attention shift to the target. In line with this notion, the target-N2pc following an invalid-other-side cue displayed the largest amplitude compared with all other cue conditions, indicating that the spatial attention shift between hemifields further enhanced the N2pc.</p><p>When we compared the amplitudes and latencies of the cue and target N2pc under placebo with those under scopolamine we found no differences. We conclude that scopolamine did not affect the capturing effect of a target-colored cue, as evident in the cue N2pc, and also did not change the attention shifts towards the target in the target display.</p><p>Due to the lack of modulation of the target N2pc, the decrease in accuracy under scopolamine in all cueing conditions cannot be explained by failed or delayed attention shifts toward the target location. Instead, we suggest that scopolamine affected later stages of target processing, occurring after spatial attention is allocated to the target.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Effects of Scopolamine on the Pd</title><p>In the last part of our analysis, we concentrated on a component that followed the cue N2pc, the so-called <italic>posterior positivity</italic> or Pd. This positive deflection in the difference waveform was also observed in the study by Lien et al. (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), who attributed it to a reversal of the N2pc after the cue display was identified as a distractor (Lien et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Although this component was observed in many other previous studies, it was first investigated systematically by Hickey et al. (<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), who named it the posterior positivity, or Pd, and suggested that it reflects the suppression of a distractor stimulus. In their simple discrimination task a Pd was elicited contralateral to an ignored stimulus and was therefore tied to the distractor location. Several subsequent studies confirmed the connection of the Pd with distractor suppression (Sawaki and Luck, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Hilimire et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kiss et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Luck, <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sawaki et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; McDonald et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Hilimire et al. (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) suggested that the Pd reflects the process of distractor suppression during target disambiguation. Sawaki et al. (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) further demonstrated that a Pd is elicited during active suppression of attention shifts toward a distractor as well as during reorienting of attention from a target location. Consequently, Sawaki et al. (<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) suggested that the Pd and N2pc might illustrate opposing processes and even share the same neural source in occipital complex and V4. Based on these findings the Pd has been suggested to reflect an active suppression process regulated by top-down attentional processes (Sawaki and Luck, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>In consideration of the close relationship between the N2pc and Pd, as well as the strong dependence of the Pd on top-down control mechanisms, we further investigated the effects of scopolamine on measures of the cue related Pd. We found that scopolamine significantly reduced the Pd amplitude for invalid as well as valid cues. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, in response to valid and invalid-same-side cues the cue N2pc was closely followed by a Pd, which ended with the onset of the target N2pc. The amplitude of this positive deflection was significantly reduced after application of scopolamine compared with placebo. Due to the switch of attention from one hemifield to the other in the invalid-other-side condition, there was a switch in polarity between the cue and the target N2pc in the difference waveforms (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Therefore, the positive deflection of the cue Pd did not appear as a discrete peak in these waveforms. However, just like in the valid and invalid-same-side condition, the amplitude within the time window of the Pd was significantly reduced under scopolamine.</p><p>We suggest that in our study the Pd reflects termination of contingent capture by the target-colored cue after it was identified as a distractor. As described above, this argument is based on the finding that in visual search for a target, which is defined by a conjunction of several features, a distractor with at least one target-defining feature will automatically capture attention, but attention is rapidly withdrawn from the cue (Sawaki et al., <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Kiss et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This process might be mediated by, or reflected in, the Pd. In line with this argument, the latency of the Pd is thought to depend on the time needed to decide that the item should be suppressed, and is therefore closely related to the complexity of the stimulus as well as the similarity between target and distractor items (Sawaki and Luck, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Here we have provided evidence that scopolamine significantly reduced the amplitude of the Pd, which suggests reduced suppression of information from the cue display. This effect was consistent across all cueing conditions, but failed to alter the behavioral measures of the effectiveness of the cue display or the different measures of the target N2pc. Reducing the delay period between cue and target, as well as modulating the similarity of cue and targets, might be a good approach to further unmask the effects of scopolamine on distractor processing in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Scopolamine and Distractor Suppression</title><p>Evidence of a potential mechanism for distractor suppression underlying the Pd was provided by McDonald et al. (<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) who inspected the succession of ERP events related to attentional capture during visual search. They suggested that the sustained posterior contralateral negativity (SPCN), a marker of visual working memory (Jolic&#x00153;ur et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), was linked to the amplitude of a distractor-related Pd. Distractors that elicited an N2pc and a following Pd did not produce an SPCN. However, there was a trend towards an increase in the SPCN with reduction in the distractor Pd. The authors suggested that the Pd reflects a suppression process, which prevents distractor information from entering working memory. In another study testing the Pd in a delayed match to sample task, distractors presented in the delay period also induced the Pd, if they possessed a target-feature (Sawaki and Luck, <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Sawaki and Luck (<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) suggested that a Pd during the distractor display prevented degradation of target-related information in working memory.</p><p>Though further research is needed to systematically investigate the causal relationship of Pd and SPCN, a potential association between the Pd component and working memory access is particularly interesting in light of our finding that scopolamine can reduce the Pd for irrelevant information. In an early fMRI study, Furey et al. (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>) demonstrated that administration of the cholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine increased working memory performance during encoding. They concluded that the improvement was based on enhanced perceptual processing selectivity for relevant stimuli in extrastriate visual cortex. Since the increase in ACh levels in response to physostigmine activates nicotinic as well as muscarinic receptors, we cannot conclude that this effect is predominantly mediated by muscarinic receptors. However, more evidence for an involvement of muscarinic modulation in distractor suppression was produced in a study using a flanker paradigm (Thienel et al., <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In that study scopolamine increased RTs to incongruent flanker stimuli, which was interpreted as an antagonistic effect on the executive control of attention.</p><p>Together, these findings indicate a specific involvement of the cholinergic system in the modulation of selectivity during distractor suppression in late stimulus processing stages. These data are also in line with a dominant view in the literature of an important role for ACh in top-down control, including the filtering of irrelevant information and noise (Sarter et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>, <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). In consideration of our finding that scopolamine strongly affected a measure of distractor suppression (Pd) but not a measure of attentional capture (N2pc) or top-down stimulus modulation we speculate that previous reports of attentional modulation through the muscarinic pathway might in fact be based on its influence on late stimulus suppression effects. However, further research is needed to specify this interaction. Any such investigations should focus on target-distractor similarities as well as the involvement of working memory. We further anticipate that future research might be able to tie the specific muscarinic effects of top-down control of attention to the more general involvement of the cholinergic system in memory formation (Sarter et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Furey, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Such investigations could further include an assessment of muscarinic modulation of intrinsic oscillations. This approach has not been considered in this study but appears promising in light of recent studies investigating the influence of ACh on intrinsic oscillations in relation to memory as well as attention (Bauer et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Vakalopoulos, <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Eckart et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Limitations</title><p>There are a number of methodological limitations to this study that warrant comment. The first relates to the statistical power of our study. Our sample size of <italic>N</italic> = 30 was adequately powered to observe effects of scopolamine compared with placebo on both behavioral (overall accuracy: Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> = 0.41) and EEG (Pd amplitude: Cohen&#x02019;s <italic>d</italic> = 0.31) measures. Nevertheless, given that these effect sizes were in the small-medium range, it remains possible that we may have observed drug effects on other variables and contrasts of interest (drug &#x000d7; validity) at higher doses or with larger sample sizes. The second limitation relates to the recruitment of a male-only sample. The decision to exclude female participants was taken to avoid variability in drug pharmacodynamics which may occur across the menstrual cycle. Nevertheless, given known interactions between the cholinergic system and estradiol and progesterone (Gibbs, <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), this decision should be revisited in future work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Summary and Conclusion</title><p>Based on previous research which pointed toward involvement of muscarinic receptor activation in the modulation of top-down attention, we investigated the impact of the muscarinic antagonist <italic>scopolamine</italic> on behavioral and electrophysiological markers of contingent capture. Despite strong evidence for top-down modulation of target-features in early stages of processing, we found no evidence for an influence of scopolamine on early visual feature-enhancement or measures of attentional capture by task-relevant features. Instead, we found a consistent reduction in the cue-related Pd component after scopolamine administration. This component has recently been demonstrated to be involved in the suppression of distractor information. We conclude that the previously described influence of ACh on top-down control via muscarinic receptors might be based on a modulation of active suppression of irrelevant distractors. However, the lack of a behavioral correlate of these effects in the current study encourages further research into the involvement of the cholinergic system in distractor processing in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>IL, NM, AJD, JBM and MAB all contributed to the design of this study.
