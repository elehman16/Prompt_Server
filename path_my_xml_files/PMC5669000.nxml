The research team will inform potential participants about the trial and provide them with a patient information sheet. Willing participants will be screened for eligibility by good clinical practice (GCP)-trained research staff, and have the opportunity to ask any questions they may have about the trial, before giving written informed consent for participation (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Patients will be given up to 1&#x000a0;week to make a decision regarding their involvement in the trial; if they are happy to give consent straight away, then this will be allowed. Patients will be free to withdraw from the study at any time without having to give a reason. They will not be eligible to participate in other clinical trials during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Baseline assessment</title><p id="Par28">Participants will have routine baseline blood tests performed, including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, eGFR, liver function tests, calcium and albumin, as well as having their serum 25-OH vitamin D level measured. These tests will be analysed pragmatically using the routine laboratory methods available at each NHS Trust hospital. Northumbria use the cobas e 601 Total 25-OH vitamin D immunochemiluminescence assay (Roche Diagnostics International Ltd., Rotkreuz, Switzerland), which has a detection range of 7.5&#x02013;175&#x000a0;nmol/L and a laboratory-quoted coefficient of variation of 7.7%. At South Tees, the IDS-iSYS 25-Hydroxy Vitamin D<sup>s</sup> immunoassay (Immuno Diagnostic Systems [IDS], Boldon, UK) is used, which has a detection range of 18&#x02013;313&#x000a0;nmol/L and a quoted coefficient of variation up to 11.6%.</p><p id="Par29">Patients will also be asked if they give their consent for an extra sample of blood to be taken and stored anonymously at Newcastle University for research purposes only, including in future research trials. Participants will provide basic demographic data and complete a questionnaire regarding diet and lifestyle to assess their exposure to environmental and dietary vitamin D. Whilst we could not find a validated questionnaire to assess diet and lifestyle influences, the questions we will ask are similar to those reported by Lee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Answers will be recorded in the case report form (CRF), and patients will be allocated a trial identifier that does not contain any patient-identifiable data.</p><p id="Par30">As part of their routine care, participants complete baseline PROMs, which are either the Oxford hip or knee score, and the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L questionnaires (<xref rid="Sec21" ref-type="sec">Appendix 1</xref>). These are routine measures collected by the NHS to assess the quality of care experienced by patients undergoing THR/TKR. These questionnaires, which are used to gather routinely collected data, will be obtained for this trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Randomisation</title><p id="Par31">Those participants with vitamin D deficiency (&#x0003c;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;nmol/L) will be randomised to receive either vitamin D supplementation or no supplementation. Research nurses recruiting participants into the trial will call the research and development (R&#x00026;D) department at the sponsor site by telephone to obtain the participant&#x02019;s randomised group allocation. The central R&#x00026;D administrator will provide this information from a randomisation log generated by the website <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">www.randomization.com</ext-link>. Randomisation will be stratified by study site, and patients will be allocated to either vitamin D supplementation or no supplementation using a 1:1 ratio at both sites. The R&#x00026;D administrator will provide written confirmation of group allocation using secure nhs.net email.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Intervention group</title><p id="Par32">Those patients who are randomised to receive treatment will receive oral cholecalciferol according to their vitamin D level. Patients with insufficiency (25&#x02013;49&#x000a0;nmol/L) will receive 1600 IU/day oral cholecalciferol until 6&#x000a0;months following surgery. Patients with deficiency (&#x0003c;&#x02009;25&#x000a0;nmol/L) will receive 20,000 IU of oral cholecalciferol twice per week for 8&#x000a0;weeks, then receive 1600 IU/day oral cholecalciferol until 6&#x000a0;months following surgery. Patients&#x02019; calcium levels will be re-checked to monitor for hypercalcaemia, and vitamin D treatment will be stopped if this is noted. Patients will not be blinded to their treatment allocation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Control groups</title><p id="Par33">Those participants with a normal vitamin D level (&#x02265;&#x02009;50&#x000a0;nmol/L) will be eligible for inclusion in the trial, but not for randomisation. Along with those patients with vitamin D deficiency who are randomised to receive no supplementation, they will act as control subjects. The control patients will be blinded to their vitamin D status for the duration of the trial and asked not to start taking any supplements containing vitamin D for the duration of their participation in the trial. There are therefore three groups in this trial; patients with vitamin D deficiency who do not receive supplementation, patients with vitamin D deficiency who receive supplementation, and patients with sufficient vitamin D levels. Not providing vitamin D supplementation is current standard practice in the participating NHS trusts, so the control group will, in effect, receive standard care.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p id="Par34">All participants will have blood tests, including re-measurement of 25-OH vitamin D on the day of surgery, prior to the start of the operation. Patients receiving vitamin D supplementation will also have their calcium level re-checked to monitor for hypercalcaemia. They will undergo primary THR/TKR under the care of their consultant orthopaedic surgeon, and no specific guidance is given with regard to choice of implant, surgical approach, closure, peri-operative care, rehabilitation or clinical follow-up; the approach is pragmatic and should be routine care for that unit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Post-operative follow-up</title><p id="Par35">For the purposes of the trial, all participants will be seen again at 6&#x000a0;months following surgery to repeat the diet and lifestyle questionnaire and to re-measure their 25-OH vitamin D level. They will also be reminded about completion of the routine 6-month post-operative PROM scores sent by the NHS. Those participants who were randomised to receive treatment will also be asked to complete an adherence to supplementation questionnaire and return their vitamin D supplement packets.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcomes</title><p id="Par36">The overall aim of this study is to determine if it is feasible to run a large, multi-centre clinical trial to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on outcome following THR/TKR. We will analyse the trial processes, which are key to the future study. We will record the number of eligible patients per site as well as recruitment, retention and refusal rates. The proportion of patients undergoing primary THR/TKR who did not meet the eligibility criteria will also be calculated to ensure that this is not too limiting.</p><p id="Par37">The primary clinical outcome measurement for the trial is the effect of vitamin D on health gain following THR/TKR. Health gain is calculated as the difference between pre-operative and post-operative PROM scores. Condition-specific health gain is measured using either the Oxford hip or knee scores, whilst generic health is measured using the EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L. We will obtain the routine patient-level PROM data that is supplied to NHS trusts to determine these outcomes.</p><p id="Par38">Secondary outcomes include length of hospital stay, readmission rate and complications. To determine these outcomes, we will interrogate data routinely held in patient records and hospital databases at the study sites. These databases will allow the research team to collect demographic data, co-morbidities, hospital episode statistical data (including length of stay, readmission within 30&#x000a0;days of surgery, return to theatre within 30&#x000a0;days of surgery, requirement for critical care during admission), and complication data to include 30-day medical complications, 60-day thromboembolic complications, 90-day mortality and any superficial or deep infections within the study period. Any expected or unexpected adverse events will be recorded on a trial adverse events form and reported to the sponsor. Any serious adverse events, including death, those prolonging or requiring hospitalisation, causing permanent or significant disability/incapacity, or a life-threatening condition, will be reported to the sponsor and the research ethics committee. The relationship to the study will also be determined. The sponsor has usual NHS indemnity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p id="Par39">A secure Excel database (Microsoft Inc., Redmond, WA, USA) will be used to record data. Statistical analysis will be performed using IBM SPSS software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). We will compare health gain between groups at baseline and at 6&#x000a0;months, as well as mean pre-operative and post-operative PROM scores between groups. Significance will be denoted at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05, and we will report 95% CIs as appropriate. The statistical test chosen to compare groups will depend on the data distribution and the level of the data (nominal, ordinal or interval/ratio). For parametric data comparing two groups, Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test for independent samples will be used. The Welch correction will be used if variances are unequal. If the distributions are not normal or the data ordinal, the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test will be used. The chi-square test or Fisher&#x02019;s exact test, depending on observed frequencies, will be used for non-parametric data. Paired tests will be used to compare data within participants pre- and post-surgery as appropriate, with tests (e.g., paired <italic>t</italic> test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) selected depending on the level and distribution of the data as described above. We recognise that outcomes are likely to be confounded with baseline characteristics (e.g., low physical activity levels, age), type of surgery (TKR/THR) and hospital site, and we will investigate the influence of these baseline confounders on outcomes using multivariable modelling (e.g., logistic regression, analysis of covariance). However, given that this is a feasibility study, and it is therefore not fully powered, such multivariable techniques will be used sparingly and only where justified (e.g., sufficient variable-to-participant ratio). The main aim of inferential analysis of clinical outcomes will be to inform a future fully powered study, rather than to draw direct inferences regarding outcomes.</p><p id="Par40">Using the observed mean and SD of the PROM scores collected from this preliminary data, as well as the reported minimal clinically important difference for the Oxford hip and knee scores and EQ-5D-3&#x000a0;L, a sample size calculation can be performed to inform a larger, future trial. The retention rate derived from these feasibility data will be incorporated into the final sample size to allow for possible attrition. The recruitment rate and resource allocation can also be applied to the final sample size required to plan the future trial requirements. The two NHS trusts involved in this trial carried out almost 4500 hip or knee replacements in 2016. We have chosen to recruit 100 patients for this feasibility trial on the basis of an expected recruitment rate at the two NHS trusts over 2&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Data management</title><p id="Par41">Each site will hold data according to the Data Protection Act 1998, and data will be collated in CRFs identified by a unique identification number (i.e., the trial number) only. A trial enrolment log at the sites will list the identification numbers. All data recorded electronically will be held on password-protected NHS trust information technology systems with permission for access as detailed in the delegation log. All study files will be stored in accordance with GCP guidelines. Trial data will be sent to the sponsor via secure nhs.net email and accessed only by the study team. Study documents held by the sponsor will be retained in a secure, locked location for the duration of the trial. All essential documents, including source documents, will be retained for a minimum period of 5&#x000a0;years after study completion. All work will be conducted following NHS trust data protection policy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial management</title><p id="Par42">The trial management group is the executive decision-making body and is responsible for the day-to-day running and management of the feasibility study. Led by the chief investigator, it will consist of the lead investigator, research nurses, and statistician. The team will meet on a monthly basis by teleconference and face-to-face at least once per year. It will monitor adherence to the trial protocols at the trial sites. Quality assurance checks will be undertaken to ensure the integrity of randomisation, study entry procedures and data collection. Safety and efficacy will be assessed using adverse event data collection. This will be analysed 6&#x000a0;months from the study opening to recruitment and again at 12&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Participant flow</title><p id="Par43">The flow of participants in the trial is displayed in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Participant flow in the Vitamin D and Arthroplasty Surgery Outcomes (VASO) study. <italic>eGFR</italic> estimated glomerular filtration rate, <italic>OA</italic> osteoarthritis, <italic>OHS</italic> Oxford hip score, <italic>OKS</italic> Oxford knee score, <italic>PO</italic> Per os / "oral", <italic>THR</italic> Total hip replacement, <italic>TKR</italic> Total knee replacement</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2255_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>

However, these studies have only measured vitamin D levels and have not prospectively observed the effect of supplementation. We can find no randomised interventional trial in the published literature to investigate if vitamin D deficiency is a modifiable risk factor and whether supplementation prior to surgery improves outcomes; this trial would therefore be the first.</p><p id="Par45">For this feasibility trial, we will not delay the date of surgery until vitamin D levels have normalised. One of the questions to answer in this feasibility study is if surgery should be delayed until vitamin D levels are normalised in a definitive trial. Currently we have no good evidence that surgery should be delayed.</p><p id="Par46">The design of this trial has been discussed with the Total Hip User Group, a local expert patient group consisting of patients who have undergone, despite their name, both THR and TKR. They have also had input with regard to the wording of the patient information sheet and informed consent form.</p><p id="Par47">There are a number of limitations to the present feasibility study. Firstly, there are two different methods for measurement of vitamin D used between the two centres, although this is pragmatic, and patients will get repeated measurements at the same hospital with the same analyser. The trial is being conducted in only one region, and therefore geographical influences on vitamin D levels will not be accounted for. The trial period is only recruiting over a short time period, rather than 1 whole year, so seasonal variations in vitamin D level cannot be accounted for. We are not measuring other markers of bone status such as parathyroid hormone, and we are not measuring vitamin D binding protein. We are also giving those patients randomised to treatment standard doses based on their category of insufficiency, rather than treating them individually to a target. Finally, there is no placebo used for the control groups.</p><p id="Par48">The results of this trial will be presented at scientific meetings and submitted for publication in relevant peer-reviewed journals. Results will also be disseminated to patients and staff involved in the trial. Published results will not contain any patient-identifiable data and will be presented for the whole group rather than for individual participants. The results of this trial will be used to inform the design of a definitive, large-scale, multi-centre randomised controlled trial.</p><sec id="Sec20"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par49">The current protocol is version 1, dated 31 January 2017. Recruitment began on 4 May 2017, and the trial was still open at the time of this protocol submission. The trial is expected to run until December 2018.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><sec id="Sec23"><title>Additional files</title><p>
