<bold>Background:</bold> Worldwide, road traffic accidents contribute substantially to the number of deaths and also to the burden of disability. However, there is a lack of research into road traffic accidents as compared to other causes of ill-health. In particular, minor injuries resulting from traffic accidents are not well-studied even though some people with such injuries might be unwell for a long period of time. Support programs that provide people who have had minor traffic-related injuries with psychological help, physical training, and other types of interventions might help people to recover more quickly. However, there is little evidence that would help to answer this question. In the trial reported here, the researchers aimed to find out whether a support program would increase the chance of recovery in people who had experienced minor traffic-related injuries and who were thought to be less likely to recover. Trial participants were randomized to receive either standard medical care or to receive standard care and also to attend a series of workshops where surgeons, psychiatrists, pain specialists, and other staff gave advice about healing, pain management, exercises, and other aspects of self-care. The primary outcome of the trial was whether participants considered themselves to have recovered, 12 mo after the injury.</p><p>
<bold>What the trial shows:</bold> 127 patients were recruited into the study, 62 of whom were assigned to receive standard care only and 65 of whom were assigned to also attend the support workshops. Most participants assigned to the support arm did attend all of the workshop sessions. Patients assigned to attend the support workshops were more likely to report that they had recovered as compared to patients receiving standard care only, and this difference seemed quite substantial. However, there were no statistically significant differences between these two groups in the trial's secondary outcome measures. These secondary measures included scores on rating scales which attempt to measure physical and mental distress and coping ability and the amount of sick leave taken.</p><p>
<bold>Strengths and limitations:</bold> Although the trial was fairly small, it did recruit enough participants to detect an effect in the primary outcome measure, recovery at 12 mo. Additionally, a large proportion of the participants randomized to attend support sessions did actually attend the sessions, and follow-up for the primary outcome measure was virtually complete. Limitations of this study include low follow-up of patients for the secondary outcome measures in the trial. This meant that there was low power to detect clinically relevant changes in these outcome measures. Finally, although many patients were eligible for the trial, only a small proportion could be successfully contacted after being discharged from hospital, and it is possible that those people who did agree to participate were more motivated to recover than patients in general who have these injuries.</p><p>
<bold>Contribution to the evidence:</bold> Most evidence relating to the benefits of support programs such as these have evaluated their effects in patients who have whiplash injuries rather than general traffic-related injuries. However, the results from this trial are compatible with those of similar trials in patients with whiplash injuries and suggest that support programs such as these may be beneficial in patients at risk of not recovering well from their injuries.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ottosson C, Pettersson H, Johansson SE, Nyr&#x000e9;n O, Ponzer S (2007) Recovery after minor traffic injuries: A randomized controlled trial.

While whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) has attracted considerable scientific attention [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], other minor traffic-related injuries have been less well studied<bold>.</bold> However, some studies suggest that other minor injuries may have a similar prognosis as WAD [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Hence, among patients with seemingly trivial injuries, there are individuals with a high risk of substantially delayed recovery. The reasons suggested for a slower recovery, or even for permanent disability, include factors other than purely injury-related ones.</p><p>It has also been suggested that psychosocial and other support programs, given in addition to the correct medical and surgical treatment and rehabilitation, might enhance recovery after traffic injuries. This additional support has been provided in several ways and forms but has almost exclusively been offered to WAD patients [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Provinciali et al. showed that a multidisciplinary program consisting of postural training, manual technique, and psychological support had a significant effect on the time to return-to-work in WAD patients [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In a study by Vendrig et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], it was shown that multidisciplinary treatment with physical training, graded physical activity, occupational therapy, and pain behaviour therapy was effective for patients with chronic WAD symptoms. The positive effects of multidisciplinary treatments in WAD patients have also been confirmed in meta-analyses by Verhagen et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Sefriadis et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>We hypothesized that in patients with risk factors for protracted recovery and suffering from minor traffic-related musculoskeletal injuries, a multidisciplinary group intervention with information about the injury, pain management, activity level, and support of healthy instead of illness behaviour during the acute phase of rehabilitation, might shorten the time to recovery [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of such an intervention in patients with acute traffic-related minor musculoskeletal injuries, rated to be at high risk for delayed recovery, based on the scores obtained in a newly developed prediction ruler (prediction of prolonged self-perceived recovery after musculoskeletal injuries, the PPS). The primary endpoint was the patients' self-perceived recovery after 12 mo.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Potentially eligible patients had sustained traffic-related minor musculoskeletal injuries (Injury Severity Score &#x0003c;9) [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] less than 24 h before arrival to the emergency department (ED) of a large inner-city hospital in Stockholm, Sweden. Exclusion criteria were a major musculoskeletal injury (Injury Severity Score &#x02265;9) [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], age &#x02265;15 y, inability to read and understand Swedish, or impaired cognitive function as judged by the investigators. Consecutive patients were evaluated, but to be eligible for randomization the patients had to have a high risk of prolonged recovery according to the PPS questionnaire [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The PPS is a novel instrument for prediction of non-recovery 4&#x02013;6 mo after a musculoskeletal injury and consists of four questions to be answered by the patient (working status, educational level, and ratings of injury-related pain and mental distress) and a rough injury classification (neck pain after a whiplash type of injury, contusion, dislocation/distortions, or fracture) provided by the staff. We have shown the PPS predicts subjective non-recovery after 6 mo with greater accuracy than predictions based exclusively on information about the injury. The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee and all patients gave their informed consent before inclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Intervention</title><p>Eligible patients were randomised to an intervention or a control group. Both groups received standard medical treatment according to the routines at the department. The intervention offered was based on principles discussed by Fordyce [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], Linton [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Vendrig [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but was adapted for an acute injury population through several workshops with experts in orthopedic surgery, psychiatry, cognitive psychology, anesthesiology/pain treatment, social medicine, epidemiology, physiotherapy, and nursing. The intervention was designed to be simple and clinically practicable and consisted of four group sessions, each lasting for approximately 1&#x000bd; h, once weekly, in open groups. The intervention aimed to supply generic information about tissue healing after injuries and about pain management, to call attention to the importance of self-care, and to propose exercises in relaxation and postural control [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. After a first introductory session (given every week), to which the intervention group was invited within 1 wk after the injury, the subsequent three sessions, held sequentially in 3-wk cycles, were led by the study physiotherapist, the study anaesthesiologist, and the team psychologist, respectively. After having attended the introductory session, new patients entered the cycle with the session that happened to be next. During the sessions, the participants were encouraged to share their experiences with each other. The session leaders acted as group facilitators and also met regularly to coordinate their activities.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Objectives</title><p>This open, randomised controlled clinical trial compared standard treatment with standard treatment supplemented by a multidisciplinary group intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Baseline Data</title><p>Baseline data included information regarding age, sex, injury type (PPS variable), educational level (PPS variable), working status (PPS variable), current diseases, and previous traffic injuries and was collected in connection with the inclusion at the outpatient department before randomisation. Retrospective ratings (i.e., the patients were asked to consider the week before the injury) were carried out to detect signs of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HAD) [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] or signs of posttraumatic stress syndrome (PTSD-10) [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We further asked the patients to rate their functional health status (SF-36 [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]) and level of physical functioning using the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA) [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] the week preceding the injury. Finally, the patients were asked also to rate their current physical (&#x0201c;Rate the level of your injury-related physical discomfort/pain&#x0201d;) and mental (&#x0201c;Rate the level of your psychological discomfort/feelings of depression or anxiety&#x0201d;) distress (both PPS variables) as well as their coping [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] capability (&#x0201c;How well do you think you can handle your current situation?&#x0201d;) on visual analog scales.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was the patients' self-perceived recovery at 12 mo measured by the single question &#x0201c;Do you feel recovered after the injury?&#x0201d; (Yes/no). Secondary outcome measures were the SF-36, the SMFA, the visual analog scales ratings regarding physical and mental distress and coping ability, as well as self-reported duration of sick leave. The patients were followed up by a mailed questionnaire, and if no answer was received the patient was contacted by phone by the study nurse and asked to report whether he/she felt recovered or not.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Sample Size</title><p>The sample size was calculated to detect a difference in the proportions for the primary outcome measure between the control and the intervention groups of 30 percentage points (specifically 30% versus 60%) at the 12-mo follow-up. A total of 49 patients in each group (98 patients) were required to detect this difference with 80% power at 5% significance level, two-tailed. In addition, we anticipated a dropout rate of 25% and the recruitment goal was therefore determined to 140 patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Enrollment, Randomisation, and Blinding</title><p>The patients were identified and informed about the study by the study nurse either while still at the ED or via daily ED listings of admitted patients. Patients who had been discharged were contacted by the study nurse by phone, and if no answer was received, an invitation letter was mailed to the patient. For consenting patients, an outpatient appointment was booked at the orthopaedic out-patient department within a week, whereupon each patient with a high risk of prolonged recovery, according to the PPS questionnaire, was allocated to either of the two treatment arms. Randomisation was accomplished through the opening of sequentially numbered, sealed opaque envelopes (160 envelopes). These envelopes contained information about treatment assignment, which was arranged by staff not involved in the study. The practical arrangements for treatment implementation were made immediately following the randomisation. As blinding of the intervention was impossible, the trial was open but the patients were kept blinded to the results of the PPS prediction.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Fisher's exact test was used to compare the intervention and control groups with regard to the proportion of patients reporting self-perceived recovery at 12 mo (i.e., the primary outcome measure).

Of the 937 consecutive patients assessed for eligibility, no contact was established due to no answers to telephone calls or mailed contact letters in 423 (45%) cases; 287 (31%) declined participation; and nine (1%) patients had an incomplete PPS and therefore could not be included. Thus, of the 218 (24%) patients who consented to participate, the PPS classified 77 as having a low risk of non-recovery, and they were therefore excluded in accordance with the study design. Of the remaining 141 patients, 73 were randomised into the intervention group and 68 into the control group. A total of 14 patients were withdrawn since they had been misclassified by the computer program as belonging to the high-risk stratum when, in fact, they belonged to the low-risk group according to the PPS, six belonging to the control group and eight to the intervention group. Therefore, they were not eligible for randomisation. Consequently, a total of 65 patients were allocated to the intervention group and 62 to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pctr-0020014-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pctr-0020014-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pctr.0020014.g001"/></fig><p>Complete follow-up data assessed from September 2003 through January 2005 were available for 75% (49/65) of the patients in the intervention group and for 71% (44/62) in the control group.

At the 12-mo follow-up the intervention group reported recovery (the main outcome measure) significantly more often than the control group did. Our results can therefore be regarded as encouraging, but as we were unable to statistically confirm improvements in the secondary outcome measures the clinical significance of the treatment benefit remains to be defined.</p><p>A major limitation of this study was that we were able to include only about one fourth of the eligible patients. The reasons for non-participation in the majority, however, were of administrative nature since we could not get in contact with about half of the patients entering the ED. Only one fourth of the non-participants actively declined participation. Even if there is a risk of bias it is reasonable to assume that less than all patients with minor injuries would be interested in any rehabilitation and some might be persons out of reach for any intervention, as suggested by Cutler et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], implying that self-selection may have enriched our study of patients who were more motivated than average. It is, however, reasonable to assume that the same self-selection will also occur if this intervention will be deployed in routine care.</p><p>There are some possible explanations for the lack of significant findings regarding the secondary outcome measures. The first and the most obvious is lack of power; the power calculation was based on the primary outcome with a 30% of difference between the groups. A power calculation for clinical important differences for the secondary outcomes, for example, SF-36, would have yielded a bigger sample size. Second, there are differences between people's interpretation of recovery, and even if not measurable in terms of functional outcome or health-related quality of life, the intervention might have changed this interpretation toward more acceptance of residual symptoms, impairments, or disabilities, as suggested by Beaton [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Third, about 30% of the patients in the intervention group did not participate in all of the four sessions, which might have diluted the effect of the intervention in terms of functional outcome. Fourth, we were able to get complete follow-up data, i.e., the secondary outcome measures, for only about 70% of all patients. On the other hand, the intervention group had a non-significant tendency toward shorter sick leave duration compared to the control group, implying that this type of intervention in the early stage after an injury might have long-term effects also in terms of working capability.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Generalizability</title><p>One of the strengths of this study was that the intervention program was only offered to patients at increased risk of non-recovery as predicted by the PPS questionnaire [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The rationale for this approach was supported by earlier findings indicating that many patients seem to be able to cope with any injury without specific support and that unnecessary treatment might augment their feeling of not being well [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We have previously shown that the PPS can predict an unfavorable outcome with a better accuracy than predictions based exclusively on information about the injury. Even if the PPS has only fair sensitivity and specificity it is the first step toward targeting the patients in need of extra support.</p><p>Another of the strengths is that the intervention was aimed to be clinically applicable and was therefore short and gave the patients flexibility to choose dates for their participation. Over 75% participated in at least three of the four possible sessions, indicating that this goal was mainly reached. The intervention was based on well-known principles and uncontroversial per se. Besides the content of the sessions, the participation itself probably promoted the patients' physical activity level, and the discussions during the sessions were most likely of importance as a means of applying a certain degree of social pressure, inter-participant support, and encouragement. Another important feature of our intervention program was the possibility for continuous contact with the study personnel, an important factor in any medical treatment.</p><p>In conclusion, this study provides some evidence that among selected injured patients with constellations of factors that are indicative of a high risk of a slow return to self-perceived health, a simple group intervention can stimulate recovery. Our intervention, focused on helping the patient appreciate the healthy parts of their injured body and mind and stressing the importance of physical activities already during the early phase of the rehabilitation, should be possible to replicate by others. As our intervention was comparatively simple and moderately demanding, both in terms of health care resources needed and time expenditure on the part of the patients, it tentatively appears to be practicable and economically justifiable in routine care. At least the results are encouraging enough to warrant further studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Overall Evidence</title><p>Despite the common occurrence of minor traffic injuries [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], few studies have addressed the effects of auxiliary supportive measures in consecutive patients with a broad spectrum of traffic-related injuries. Most studies of such interventions have concerned specified conditions such as WAD [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The only exception, to our knowledge, is a study of debriefing in patients with mixed minor traffic injuries [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. This study found a worse than average outcome among patients who received the active intervention, compared to those in the control group. Two principal explanations have been proposed for this unexpected result: first, as the treatment was applied to all patients, including those with an already good prognosis, it is conceivable that unnecessary treatment might have augmented a feeling of not being well in a non-negligible proportion. Second, others have pointed out that debriefing was developed for planned stressful events. Therefore, debriefing might not be effective after unexpected accidents.</p><p>The only randomised controlled study of multidisciplinary treatment that we could find in the literature was performed by Provincali et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They randomly allocated 60 WAD patients to either an experimental multimodal treatment consisting of postural training, manual technique, and psychological support, or to a control treatment with physical agents only, such as electrical and sonic modalities. They found significantly better and more long-lasting improvements among the patients who received the experimental treatment. Although this study, as opposed to ours, was restricted to WAD patients and the control condition involved a specific treatment, the observed effect, albeit surprisingly strong, is consistent with our overall result.</p><p>Other studies, however nonrandomised, of multidisciplinary treatment of chronic WAD [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], suggest that such intervention might be beneficial, with significant reductions in pain among actively treated patients. Apart from the possibility that some of the effect in these observational studies could potentially be attributed to confounding, the interventions were generally much more time and resource consuming than that used in our study.</p><p>Other studies among patients with WAD have focused on specified supportive measures rather than on multidisciplinary treatment. Ferrari et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] were unable to confirm any benefit from an educational pamphlet on outcome. On the other hand, Brison et al. [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] used an educational video as intervention and found a trend toward less severe WAD symptoms. A systematic review by the Cochrane collaboration concerning treatment of WAD [<xref rid="pctr-0020014-b004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] found early mobilization to be effective. Early mobilization was also a part of our intervention. The Cochrane review further concluded that studies of multidisciplinary treatment strategies are warranted.</p><p>Future studies should focus on the clinical significance and cost effectiveness of this intervention. In particular, future studies should be dimensioned so that they are able to confirm clinically important effects in our secondary outcome variables, notably duration of sick-listing and quality of life. Careful measurements of costs, from the perspective of the individual, health care, and society would also be a valuable addition. Further development of the clinical prediction rule, the PPS, still admittedly crude, is also warranted. It is conceivable that a better classification of patients in terms of prognosis will improve the selection of suitable cases and thus enhance the efficiency of the intervention. Finally, additional fine-tuning of the contents in the multidisciplinary intervention, with randomised evaluations of the single components, might improve its performance even more.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>SUPPORTING INFORMATION</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020014-sd001"><label>CONSORT Checklist</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020014.sd001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(50 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pctr-0020014-sd002"><label>Trial Protocol</label><media xlink:href="pctr.0020014.sd002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media><p>(42 KB DOC)</p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Tina Levander, RN, for participating in the planning of the study, in designing the study protocol, in enrollment of patients, in data collection at inclusion and at follow-up, and for being the first contact person for the included patients; Martin Nordlander for participating in the intervention and for being the physiotherapist in the study; Kjell Flodgren for participating in planning the study and in the intervention and for being the psychologist in the study; Ove Landstr&#x000f6;m, MD, for participating in the study design and in the intervention and for being the anaesthesiologist (pain expert) in the study.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="n103" fn-type="COI-statement"><p>
