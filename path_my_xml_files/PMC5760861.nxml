The delayed onset of action of corticosteroids; and their inability to inhibit the leukotriene- and thromboxane-induced inflammation leaves a lacuna in the armamentarium of acute asthma management that some of these newer drugs may have the potential to plug.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The current role of leukotriene-modifiers (e.g., montelukast) in the management of asthma is limited to their use in chronic cases.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In recent times, there has been some interest in probing their role in acute asthma &#x02013; the results ranging for favorable to outright negative.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Thromboxane A2 has role in bronchoconstriction; and the use of thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitors (e.g., ozagrel) in chronic asthma have shown varied results in different population groups &#x02013; Asians showing favorable results.

Hence, our endeavor in this study was to address the issues of any usefulness of montelukast and ozagrel in acute asthma.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aims and objective</title><p>This study aims to study and compare the effects of oral montelukast with oral ozagrel in acute asthma.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized, prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-center, comparative study was initiated after obtaining permission from the Institutional Ethics Committee. The study was conducted in the Department of Respiratory Medicine of a tertiary care teaching hospital attached to a medical college. Patients presenting to outpatient unit or emergency triage from October 2014 to March 2016 with a primary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma requiring hospitalization, were included in the study after taking written informed consent in the language understandable to them. The inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 65, previously diagnosed case of bronchial asthma, a primary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of asthma on presentation, peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) less than or equal to 75% of personal best within the last 12 months or of predicted value, no other acute pathology complicating the present condition such as cardiac, metabolic, or other respiratory causes. The exclusion criteria were smoking history more than 10 pack years, pregnant or breastfeeding females, patient on regular leukotriene receptor antagonists or thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitors within 2 weeks of presentation, intake of oral or parenteral steroids for &#x0003e;5 days within 1 month of presentation, intake of theophylline within 1 week of presentation, need of intubation before presentation, patients on regular Rifampicin, Phenytoin, or Phenobarbitone, history of allergy to montelukast or ozagrel, baseline renal function test, and liver function test derangement.</p><p>History was noted, findings of physical examination were recorded, and laboratory investigations were noted. Forty subjects were included in each arm of the study as we anticipated a minimum difference of 40 L/min in PEFR with a standard deviation of 100 L/min for 80% power at 95% confidence level. Baseline PEFR was measured for all enrolled patients using Mini Wright's PEF meter. The patients were randomized into three groups after 5 min of measuring the baseline PEFR. Patients in all the three groups received standard treatment for asthma exacerbation, i.e., nebulized salbutamol 2.5 mg 6<sup>th</sup> hourly, nebulized ipratropium bromide 500 mcg 6<sup>th</sup> hourly, and intravenous methyl prednisolone 40 mg 8<sup>th</sup> hourly. The investigational drugs required for the study were kept in 3 different packets, labeled as 1 (oral montelukast 10 mg tablet), 2 (oral ozagrel 200 mg tablet), and 3 (placebo) before enrolling the first patient into the study. Patients randomized to Group 1 in addition to standard treatment received a tablet from packet &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; at enrollment and a placebo tablet after 12 h. Patients randomized to Group 2 received tablets from packet &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; &#x02212; one tablet at enrollment and one tablet after 12 h. Patients randomized to Group 3 received placebo tablets from packet &#x0201c;3&#x0201d; &#x02013; one at enrollment and one after 12 h. The investigational medications were continued till the patient got discharged from the hospital or developed any adverse effects to these drugs. Rescue medication (nebulized salbutamol) was given when indicated. Additional oxygen and methylxanthines were given when required.</p><p>PEFR values, rescue medication details, and vitals (pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and SpO<sub>2</sub> by pulse oximetry) were recorded at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h of drug or placebo administration and at discharge. These parameters were recorded on the morning after admission (8 a.m. &#x02013; 10 a.m.) as well.</p><p>The primary end-point was the mean PEFR at each measured time point following treatment.

The need for rescue medication was analyzed by Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test. The need for methylxanthine and oxygen was analyzed by Chi-square test. The number of hospital stay was analyzed with Mann&#x02013;Whitney test adjusted for Type 1 error for pairwise comparison and expressed as median and interquartile ranges.

Moreover, intravenous formulation of montelukast performed even better.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> in acute asthma, after administering intravenous montelukast, has been reported by various other studies as well.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Zhang <italic>et al</italic>. in a systematic review and meta-analysis found that montelukast administration led to significant improvement in peak expiratory flow percent in acute asthma (<italic>P</italic> = 0.008) and, in addition, there was reduction in systemic corticosteroid requirement (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005).[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Very few studies from India have assessed the role of leukotriene modifiers in acute asthma. One such randomized, placebo-controlled, three-arm study from a tertiary care teaching hospital in Karnataka has reported that addition of zileuton to the standard treatment of acute asthma was associated with significant improvement in PEFR compared to placebo. Montelukast, however, failed to demonstrate such an effect. The montelukast arm had lowest baseline values of PEFR at the start of this study and, hence, this could have affected the results pertaining to this arm of the study. It is noteworthy that montelukast and zileuton both significantly reduced the need for rescue medication.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Similar effect of montelukast on requirement of inhaled short-acting beta-agonist has been reported in a three-arm study &#x02212; oral montelukast plus intravenous steroid, intravenous steroid alone and placebo &#x02013; which, in addition, noted a trend toward better improvement in PEFR in the montelukast arm, though not statistically significant.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, in the present study, montelukast arm did not show any significant effect on PEFR. Although the requirement for rescue medication was the lowest in the montelukast arm, it did not reach statistical significance. Similar results were obtained by Zubairi <italic>et al</italic>. in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in which the investigators evaluated the efficacy of oral montelukast in hospitalized patients with acute asthma. In this study from the Indian subcontinent, 100 patients were randomized into montelukast and placebo group, and the standard treatment for acute asthma was given to all the patients in both groups. The investigators found no statistically significant difference in PEFR over the course of stay in the hospital (<italic>P</italic> = 0.20 at day 2 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.47 at day 3) and at discharge (<italic>P</italic> = 0.15) when compared to placebo group.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>. have reported in a study, done on twenty patients from Portugal, that there was no significant differences between montelukast and placebo, so far as the improvement in PEFR and length of stay in emergency room was considered. However, montelukast group did have lesser need for aminophylline or steroids (<italic>P</italic> = 0.03). In our study, the need for additional methylxanthines, even though lesser in the montelukast group, failed to show any statistical significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.518).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Even the utility of intravenous montelukast &#x02212; which has offered some promise as shown by the studies mentioned above &#x02212; is mired in this maze of conflicting results; and this is highlighted by a study done on asthmatic children in the United States. In this study, it was observed than intravenous montelukast was not better that placebo in terms of improvement in symptoms, FEV<sub>1</sub> values, or clinical course during hospitalization.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Thus, the question mark on the utility of montelukast in acute asthma persists in view of these contradictory results thrown up by various studies. Whether these contrasting results are a reflection of the differences in study populations, study designs or drug characteristics itself needs to be looked into. At present, oral leukotriene modifiers are not recommended for use in acute asthma, but to ascertain the role of intravenous formulations of montelukast, in such a clinical setting, more research is needed.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Thromboxane A2, metabolite of arachidonic acid along the cyclooxygenase pathway, causes acute bronchoconstriction in response to allergen exposure among asthma patients; and the drugs that inhibit its production, i.e., thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitors (e.g., ozagrel), have demonstrated beneficial effects, such as reduction in bronchial hyperresponsiveness, in Asian population.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Studies from Japan have reported that thromboxane modulators may have role as an add-on therapy to inhaled corticosteroids in the event of poor response to corticosteroids, in the setting of chronic asthma.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, to the best of our knowledge, this group of drugs does not appear to have been tested in acute asthma setting. In our study, ozagrel did not demonstrate any benefit over and above the standard treatment of acute asthma. On the contrary, there was trend toward increased need for the rescue medication in ozagrel arm, though it was not statistically significant. Notwithstanding these results, the search for more therapeutic options for the management of acute asthma must continue as this clinical situation is associated with a high morbidity.</p><p>The limitation of the present study was the use of PEFR and not FEV<sub>1</sub> as indicator of airflow obstruction. FEV<sub>1</sub> is a better indicator and has been used in various similar studies. Assessment of subjective measures of clinical improvement such as the BORG dyspnea score could have improved the study design. The absence of well laid out criteria for discharge of patients may have affected the results so far as the duration of hospital stay is concerned. Moreover, our study was only a single-center study in a geographically localized population in south India.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Montelukast or ozagrel when added to the standard treatment of acute asthma does not result in any additional beneficial effect: improvement in lung functions, decrease in requirement of rescue medication, or decrease in the need for methylxanthine and oxygen.</p><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-9" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ramsay</surname><given-names>CF</given-names></name><name><surname>Pearson</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Mildenhall</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wilson</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral montelukast in acute asthma exacerbations: A randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial</article-title><source>Thorax</source><year>2011</year><volume>66</volume><fpage>7</fpage><lpage>11</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20956393</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rowe</surname><given-names>BH</given-names></name><name><surname>Spooner</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Ducharme</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>Bretzlaff</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Bota</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Early emergency department treatment of acute asthma with systemic corticosteroids</article-title><source>Cochrane Database Syst Rev</source><year>2000</year><fpage>CD002178</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10796685</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Salvi</surname><given-names>SS</given-names></name><name><surname>Krishna</surname><given-names>MT</given-names></name><name><surname>Sampson</surname><given-names>AP</given-names></name><name><surname>Holgate</surname><given-names>ST</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The anti-inflammatory effects of leukotriene-modifying drugs and their use in asthma</article-title><source>Chest</source><year>2001</year><volume>119</volume><fpage>1533</fpage><lpage>46</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11348965</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Myou</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujimura</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Leff</surname><given-names>AR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Additive effect of cysteinyl leukotriene or thromboxane modifiers to inhaled corticosteroids in asthmatic patients</article-title><source>Allergol Int</source><year>2004</year><volume>53</volume><fpage>211</fpage><lpage>7</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>British Thoracic Society.
