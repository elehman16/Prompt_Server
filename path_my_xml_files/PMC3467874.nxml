The primary objective of endodontic therapy is to achieve a clean, optimal environment in root canals to avoid unsuccessful treatment outcomes. The complexities of the root canal system necessitate the use of irrigating solutions which act on radicular dentin surface, modifying it. The action of irrigants can be beneficial, and yet at the same time, as they modify the surface structure of dentin, they can have an adverse impact on the properties of dentin. The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of various irrigants on the dentinal surface using an SEM.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>Forty-five roots were randomly divided into nine groups (<italic>n</italic>=5) and prepared by sectioning at the level of cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) and 10 mm from the CEJ and split longitudinally. The dentin surface was prepared and the cemental surfaces were coated with double layer of varnish. The irrigants tested were normal saline, de-ionized water, 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), 5% NaOCl with ultrasonic agitation, 3% hydrogen peroxide, 2% chlorhexidine (CHX), MTAD, and MTAD with ultrasonic agitation.

Teeth devoid of caries, restorations, and endodontic treatment were separated. They were then observed for cracks and such teeth were excluded. Teeth with mature and intact root apices were selected for the purpose of the study. The selected teeth were then analyzed using digital radiography to ensure that they had a single patent canal and the root lengths were a minimum of 15 mm [measured from the tip of the root to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ)]. The selected teeth were then stored in distilled water at 4&#x000b0;C until use. A total of 45 teeth were selected for the purpose of the study.</p><p>The selected teeth were then sectioned with a diamond disk under water spray at the level of the CEJ and 10 mm from the CEJ and standardized. They were further split longitudinally in a bucco-lingual plane into two halves with a chisel after grooving, taking sufficient care not to damage the dentin. The surface of the dentin was prepared to remove the surface debris, pulpal remnants, etc. The cemental surface was then coated with a double layer of varnish. The samples were then randomly divided into nine experimental groups (<italic>n</italic>=5) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].

Each group was processed and stored separately. The coded samples of each group were mounted onto aluminum stubs with carbon tape (Royal tapes Pvt.

Before the effects of irrigant protocols on root canal surfaces can be evaluated, the condition of the presenting dentinal surfaces must be appreciated.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] As root canal therapy may be done in young or old, teeth which are vital or non-vital, with or without apical periodontitis, a diverse range of conditions may present in the canal, which affect the surface dentinal structure. A regular dentine surface with patent dentinal tubules is therefore often taken to mean a clean dentine surface. Teeth subjected to various microbial insults (through caries, tooth surface loss, periodontal disease) or restorative stimuli may demonstrate various degrees of dystrophic calcification.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>]</p><p>The root canal dentine surface presents with an unmineralized front with a hardness value that is lowest for dentine (30 kg/ mm<sup>2</sup>). In some areas of the root canal dentin, particularly in older teeth, the higher levels of mineralization may raise hardness to 60-70 kg/mm<sup>2</sup>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] The dentinal surface is porous owing to the patency of dentinal tubules, although they may sometimes be sclerosed. The presence, density, and diameter of the dentinal tubules vary with the corono-apical site in the tooth as well as with age and insult.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] Where present, the dentinal tubules are irregular in density and direction in the apical region of roots.</p><p>Biomechanical preparation of the root canal produces a layer of organic and inorganic material that also contains microorganisms and their byproducts. Much of the material is made up of small particles of mineralized collagen matrix and is spread over the entire surface of the cut dentinal surface to form what is called as the smear layer. At an ultrastructural level, debris is evident as irregular, disorganized sludge-like material covering and masking the openings of dentinal tubules and any depressions in the canal wall.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p><p>The presence of the smear layer has been postulated to be an avenue for leakage and a source of substrate for bacterial growth and ingress. When canals were obturated, the frequency of bacterial penetration in the presence of the smear layer was shown to be significantly higher than with smear layer removal.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] Also, the smear layer may interfere with the penetration of gutta-percha into the tubules and the adhesion and penetration of root canal sealers into dentinal tubules, leading to microleakage.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] Irrigating solutions were used for the removal of tissue debris and microorganisms and prevent formation of dentine mud that can block the root canal, produced during instrumentation. They also remove smear layer and increase cutting efficiency by decreasing the chance for fracture of the instruments. An ideal root canal irrigant should be biologically compatible, chemically able to remove both organic and inorganic substrates, be antibacterial, demonstrate good surface wetting, have no adverse effects on remaining tooth structure, and be easy to use and effective within clinical parameters. No single agent appears to meet all of these criteria.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]</p><p>A number of irrigants have been introduced over the years with specific actions of chelation, dissolution capacity, antibacterial action, and substantivity, and more recent formulations include combinations of detergent, acid, and antibiotic, and also focus on reducing the surface tension to achieve better penetration into the tubules.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, normal saline and de-ionized water (groups I and II) did not significantly alter the dentinal surface and could be used for their flushing and lubricant action. 17% EDTA (group III) was most efficient at cleaning the dentinal surface, and in some areas, erosion was observed with loss of intertubular and peritubular dentin. MTAD, when used alone, did not remove the entire smear layer, but with ultrasonic agitation produced a clean dentinal surface free of smear layer though dentinal plugs could be observed in some areas. 5% NaOCl (group V) and 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (group IV) were efficient at removal of debris, but did not remove the smear layer. 2% CHX was not efficient at smear and debris removal and can be used for its antimicrobial action and substantivity. In order to achieve an ideal dentinal surface preparation, irrigants can be used in sequence with importance given to the irrigation volume, exposure time, and mode of delivery.</p><p>During biomechanical preparation, the proportion of root canal dentine surface planed by instruments has been quantified recently using high-resolution computed tomography and it was found that 35-53% of the root canal surface remained uninstrumented.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>] In addition to its flushing action, the principal role of the irrigant solution is debridement of the uninstrumented canal walls. This can be achieved by an irrigant capable of dissolving organic tissue and using a method suitable for its delivery to the uninstrumented surfaces.</p><p>Evaluating the effect of irrigants on the mechanical properties of dentine is of utmost importance as the understanding of the mechanical properties of dentine is the first step toward predicting the behavior of the dentine-restoration interface. The changes in mechanical properties of dentine as a result of root canal irrigants and dressings are almost certainly because of the alteration of chemical and structural composition of radicular dentinal surface, thereby changing its permeability and solubility characteristics, and hence affecting the adhesion of materials to dentin surfaces.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>] Optimum adhesion requires intimate contact between the adhesive material and the substrate to facilitate molecular attraction and allow either chemical adhesion or penetration for micromechanical surface interlocking. Adhesion is an important property which helps the root canal sealers effectively seal the canal and prevent microleakage at the dentin-sealer interface and the interface with the obturating material. Recently, adhesive technology has been introduced to the field of endodontics, with a specific focus on achieving a monobloc in which the core material, sealer, and the root canal dentin form a single cohesive unit. The role of the irrigant is important as it plays a vital role in the ideal preparation of the dentinal surface for bonding.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] The use of some disinfectant solutions or medications during root canal preparation may have an adverse effect on the bond strength of posts to root canal dentin. The search is on for the one ideal irrigant solution which can satisfy all the criteria for an ideal irrigant solution and further studies in a clinical setting are recommended.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, it could be concluded that root canal irrigants definitely alter the surface characteristics of dentin and none of the irrigants were able to achieve a totally clean dentinal surface. Ultrasonic activation of the irrigant improved the irrigant action on the dentinal surface. The pattern of alteration of the dentinal surface is different for each irrigant solution and these surface alterations may have a negative or positive impact on bonding characteristics of radicular dentinal surface.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abbott</surname><given-names>PV</given-names></name><name><surname>Heijkoop</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><name><surname>Cardaci</surname><given-names>SC</given-names></name><name><surname>Hume</surname><given-names>WR</given-names></name><name><surname>Heithersay</surname><given-names>GS</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An SEM study of the effects of different irrigations sequences and ultrasonic</article-title><source>Int Endod J</source><year>1991</year><volume>24</volume><fpage>308</fpage><lpage>16</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1820364</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ardizzoni</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Blasi</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Rimoldi</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Giardino</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ambu</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Righi</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>An Invitro and ex-vivo study on two antibiotic based endodontic irrigants.
