jump height (VJH) in female university students with functional leg length inequality
(FLLI). [Subjects] Thirty female university students with FLLI were divided into a pelvic
adjustment group (n = 15) and a stretching (control) group (n = 15). [Methods] VJH was
measured using an OptoGait. [Results] After the intervention, jump height improved
significantly compared with the pre-intervention height only in the pelvic adjustment
group, while FLLI showed statistically significant improvement in both groups.
[Conclusion] Pelvic adjustment as per the Gonstead method can be applied as a method of
reducing FLLI and increasing VJH.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Pelvic adjustment</kwd><kwd>Functional leg length inequality</kwd><kwd>Vertical jump height</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The pelvis, a structure located between the hip joint and the lumbosacral spine and
attached to several muscles, regulates the movement of the hip joint and lumbosacral spine.
The position of the pelvis is the most critical factor determining the sagittal alignment
and posture of the human body<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Only when
the pelvis is in the neutral position can be in the right posture, move the upper and lower
body in the dynamic posture, and improve daily movements and ambulatory ability<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Functional leg length inequality (FLLI) worsens due to pelvic tilt in the medial plane and
pelvic rotation in the sagittal plane<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Therefore, FLLI might be improved by pelvic adjustment. High-velocity and low-amplitude
(HVLA) adjustment has been widely utilized as a general chiropractic adjustment method<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Many studies have indicated that leg length
inequality (LLI) causes posture alteration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, limiting exercise and causing tension of the muscles and other soft
tissues<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. LLI is accompanied by several
clinical symptoms<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup> such as lumbar
pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup> and hip pain<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Correcting leg length inequality reportedly reduces pain,
increases mobility, and improves posture<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Vertical jumping is practiced to enhance the muscular strength and endurance of the leg and
serves as a barometer of muscular strength<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. There have been studies in which plyometric training was
undertaken to improve leg muscle strength<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, dynamic stretching was applied after jogging for 5 minutes to
improve vertical jump height (VJH)<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, or
HVLA manipulation was performed for talocrural joint dysfunction<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there has been no study in which FLLI was
corrected and VJH was measured as a barometer for leg muscle strength. Many studies have
assessed the effect of pelvic adjustment on FLLI<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, posture<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>,
pressure on the foot, and balance<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, no study has investigated the changes in FLLI and VJH resulting from just a single
adjustment. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the immediate effects of a single pelvic
adjustment on FLLI and VJH in female university students with FLLI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 30 female university students with an FLLI of more than 10&#x02005;mm between the left
and right legs were selected and randomly assigned to one of two groups: the pelvic
adjustment group (adjustment group, n = 15) and control group (stretching group, n = 15).
The exclusion criteria were as follows: anatomical LLI; degenerative osteoarthritis; muscle,
bone, or nervous system problems; ankle joint, knee joint, hip joint, or lumbar pain;
limited range of motion due to burn or postsurgical scarring; and regular leg exercise. This
study was approved by Korea Nazarene University&#x02019;s Institutional Review Board, and the safety
of all subjects was protected during all parts of the experiment. All subjects understood
the purpose of this study and provided written informed consent prior to participation in
accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>The age, height, and weight of the subjects in the adjustment group were 23.5&#x000b1;4.7&#x02005;years,
163.0&#x000b1;5&#x02005;cm, and 54.1&#x000b1;5&#x02005;kg, while those in the stretching group were 22.2&#x000b1;6.3&#x02005;years,
162.7&#x000b1;6&#x02005;cm, and 53.1&#x000b1;6&#x02005;kg, respectively. Gender was analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test,
while age, height, and weight were analyzed using the independent t-test. As these analyses
detected no statistically significant differences (p&#x0003e;0.05), the two groups were deemed
identical.</p><p>The pelvic adjustment performed in the adjustment group consisted of an HVLA technique
administered in the prone posture in accordance with Gonstead&#x02019;s theory. Subjects were
instructed to lie prone, their pelvic height was checked, and the posterior-inferior
innominate bone was given an anterior-superior impact while the anterior-superior pelvis was
given a posterior-inferior impact. When making these impacts, the therapist put one of his
hands on top of the other, placed them on the posterior-superior iliac spine or the ischial
spine, and then gave the impact using his own weight, gravity, and acceleration<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. This adjustment was performed 3&#x02013;5 times
by one skilled physical therapist with more than 10&#x02005;years of clinical experience. The
control group stretched the backbone erector, rectus abdominis, iliac muscle, psoas major,
quadriceps muscle, leg adductor, and quadratus lumborum adjacent to the pelvis in order to
resolve muscular imbalance that could further the pelvic imbalance. In the process, the
therapist assisted the subjects in performing additional height training for each muscle and
maintaining each posture at the maximum height for 10&#x02013;15 seconds. The subjects then resumed
the initial posture, rested for 5 seconds, and repeated the stretching one more time.
Stretching was done three times per posture for a total of 15 minutes<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For leg length measurement, subjects lay straight on a bed, and the tape measure method
(TMM) was used to measure the leg from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) to the
medial malleolus. Beattie et al. reported that LLI as measured by the TMM did not show a
significant difference from radiological findings. We were therefore confident in the
reliability of using the TMM for measuring leg length<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. The measurement started from the ASIS so that pelvic bone-related
problems such as pelvic tilt and pelvic asymmetry could be included.</p><p>We used an OptoGait (Microgate Srl, Bolzano, Italy), a system for optical detection, to
analyze ambulation and measure VJH. On its signal-sending bar, there are 96 LEDs that
communicate via an infrared frequency. The signal-receiving bar has an identical number of
LEDs. We installed the signal-sending and signal-receiving bars of the OptoGait one meter
apart on a flat surface. When a subject performs a vertical jump between the bars, the bars
calculate the time at which the subject touches the floor or stays in the air and
communicates this information by sending and receiving 1,000 signals per second, generating
accurate data. Based on this basic data, the OptoGait software calculates the precise
VJH.</p><p>Leg length and VJH were measured before and after the intervention. The measured data were
analyzed using the statistics program SPSS 12.0 KO (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA), and the
collected data are presented as averages and standard deviations. The significance of pre-
and post-intervention differences was tested using the paired t-test, and the significance
of between-group differences was tested using the independent t-test. The p-value &#x003b1; was set
at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In the pre- and post-intervention comparison, VJH improved significantly only in the

transferring weight from the spine to the legs when a person stands up, maintaining a
straight posture and enabling smooth arm movements<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Due to their erect ambulation, human beings are exposed to gravity
and can thus be subject to a malalignment of the pelvis and legs affecting posture,
ambulatory pattern, and balance. LLI is easily observed clinically and causes functional
disturbance of normal biomechanics<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Winter and Pinto reported that pelvic obliquity is caused by LLI<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>, and Mccaw and Bates explained the relation between
biomechanics and spinal deformity due to LLI<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Defrin et al. reported that when a shoe insert was used in 22
chronic back pain patients with LLI of 10&#x02005;mm and less, pain intensity and muscular weakening
were reduced<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, which appears to be due
to reduced pain and muscular weakening attributed to decreased pelvic tilt resulting from
LLI adjustment. On the basis of previous studies on pelvic adjustment, Alcantara et al.
reported that following adjustments using fast and slow speed amplitudes in patients with
sacroiliac joint obliquity, pain was reduced, and patients could resume daily life and
work<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Park et al. reported that
balance in 20 elderly men was improved through pelvic adjustment according to the Gonstead
method<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, FLLI was
reduced after pelvic adjustment, a finding similar to a previous study in which pelvic
adjustment helped reduce FLLI and the pressure difference between soles<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, stretching was not associated with increased VJH, while pelvic adjustment
was. In a previous study by Ryan et al. in which subjects jogged for 5 minutes in order to
improve VJH, a barometer for leg strength, and then performed dynamic stretching, VJH was
increased as compared with a control group that only jogged for 5 minutes<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, it is suspected
that VJH did not increase because only static stretching was applied. Hedlund et al.
reported that VJH showed a statistically significant increase following 3 weeks of
chiropractic HVLA manipulation in 22 female handball players with talocrural joint
dysfunction, which is similar to the findings of the present study<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pelvic adjustment balances the left and right pelvic height and left and right anterior and
posterior rotation of the hip bones, which, in turn, leads to FLLI improvement. It also
balances the left and right muscle lengths of the rectus femoris and sartorius, which are
involved in the hip bone&#x02019;s anterior rotation, and the hamstring and gluteus maximus, which
are involved in posterior rotation. This seems to explain the improvement in vertical jump
ability. We recommend that pelvic adjustment be applied for decreasing FLLI and increasing
VJH, a barometer for leg muscle strength, in the future.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This research was supported by Korea Nazarene University Research Grants in 2014.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Vaz</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Roussouly</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Berthonnaud</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Sagittal morphology and equilibrium of pelvis and
