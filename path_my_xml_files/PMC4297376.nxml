Pakistan&#x02019;s Lady Health Workers Programme (LHW-P) covers about 60% of the population but has had little impact in reducing morbidity and mortality related to these major childhood killers. An external evaluation of the LHW-P suggests that lack of supportive supervision of LHWs by lady health supervisors (LHSs) is a key determinant of this problem. Project NIGRAAN aims to improve knowledge and skills of LHWs and community caregivers through supervisory strategies employed by LHSs. Ultimately, community case management (CCM) of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea will improve.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>NIGRAAN is a cluster-randomised trial in District Badin, Pakistan. There are approximately 1100 LHWs supervised by 36 LHSs in Badin. For this study, each LHS serves as a cluster. All LHSs working permanently in Badin who regularly conduct and report field visits are eligible. Thirty-four LHSs have been allocated to either intervention or control arms in a ratio of 1:1 through computer-generated simple randomisation technique. Five LHWs from each LHSs are also randomly picked. All 34 LHSs and 170 LHWs will be actively monitored. The intervention consists of training to build LHS knowledge and skills, clinical mentorship and written feedback to LHWs. Pre- and post-intervention assessments of LHSs, LHWs and community caregivers will be conducted via focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, knowledge assessment questionnaires, skill assessment scorecards and household surveys.</p><p>Primary outcome is improvement in CCM practices of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia and will be assessed at the cluster level.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>NIGRAAN takes a novel approach to implementation research and explores whether training of LHSs in supervisory skills results in improving the CCM practices of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia. No significant harm to participants is anticipated. The enablers and barriers towards improved CCM would provide recommendations to policymakers for scale up of this intervention nationally and regionally.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>NIGRAAN is registered with the &#x02018;Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry&#x02019;.

Together, these two early childhood illnesses account for one-fifth of the total number of deaths around the globe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the major proportion of which occur in the resource poor settings, most notably in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>By 2015, the United Nations Millennium Development Goal (UN MDG) 4 aims to reduce under 5 mortality by two-thirds. Pakistan is also a signatory to the UN MDGs and is among those nations who are far behind in achieving this target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In Pakistan, around quarter of the children under 5 suffer from diarrhoea each year and one in six children experiences at least one episode of pneumonia annually [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. These figures translate into around 0.7 million episodes of diarrhoea and more than 0.35 million episodes of pneumonia each year. Ironically, the coverage of proven lifesaving interventions like oral rehydration salt (ORS) for diarrhoea and antibiotics for pneumonia remains quite low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In Pakistan, only 38% of the children receive ORS for diarrhoea and approximately 41% receive antibiotics for suspected pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>A &#x02018;National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Healthcare&#x02019; commonly referred to as &#x02018;Lady Health Workers Programme (LHW-P)&#x02019;, was instituted in 1993&#x02013;1994 in Pakistan. The programme aimed to provide maternal and child health services to the 60% underserved rural and remote population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Under this programme, the women from the local community that met the specified eligibility criteria in terms of education and residence were recruited and trained as &#x02018;lady health workers&#x02019; (LHWs) to serve as a &#x02018;focal point of care&#x02019; for their respective communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. On an average, an LHW usually serves around 100&#x02013;150 households [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] translating into a population of approximately 1,000 individuals in her catchment area. The LHW-P also inducted &#x02018;lady health supervisors&#x02019; (LHSs) to regularly monitor and supervise the LHWs. Each LHS usually supervises 20&#x02013;25 LHWs. The LHS conducts random supervisory visits and collects monthly reports from the LHWs which provide information on type of cases encountered and relevant services provided. However, even after two decades, the overall impact on the health status at the population level has been very minimal especially in reducing early childhood disease burden and mortality attributable to diarrhoea and pneumonia.</p><p>The &#x02018;Fourth External Evaluation of National Programme for Family Planning and Primary Health Care&#x02019; (FENP) conducted in 2008 provides insight into the causes and determinants of this stagnant mortality rate. Firstly, the LHWs lack skills and are not well prepared in managing cases of pneumonia and diarrhoea in the community. Only 8% LHWs are sensitised to the idea of looking for danger signs in the sick child and merely four out of five can correctly diagnose pneumonia. Secondly, the LHSs too have inadequate supervisory and clinical mentorship skills. Only 40% of LHWs receive the required feedback by their LHS and 59% of LHS pay a supervisory visit to their LHWs catchment area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

FGDs will be conducted regularly to assess the feasibility of continuing the intervention. If self-reported work pressure is noted and some LHSs feel overburdened and stressed out as a result of &#x02018;a new way of doing the same things&#x02019; i.e. written instead of a verbal feedback and more stringent clinical mentoring of LHWs by LHS for the management of pneumonia and diarrhoea, stress-mitigating steps such as counselling and supportive consultation efforts will be taken in those clusters where such a stress is experienced.

It is different from other randomised trials using top-down approaches to deliver interventions as it works within the current structure of LHW-P in Pakistan. NIGRAAN has actually tried to bridge the know-do gap in the current LHW-P of Pakistan by trying to address one of the structural gaps i.e. lack of supportive supervision by LHSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>There is evidence from other studies that increased supervisory competence and supportive supervision improves knowledge, skills and overall performance of junior staff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Adequate supportive supervision of community health workers has also been reported to be a crucial factor for ensuring effectiveness of weak health systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Moreover, evidence from low- and middle-income countries suggests that for CCM to be successful, health workers need to be adequately supervised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p>Joint statements from WHO and UNICEF also recommend that countries should support strategies aimed at adequately supervising community health workers&#x02019; pneumonia case management activities and develop suitable strategies to educate health workers at all levels about case management of diarrhoea using ORS and zinc supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Regarding study limitations, there is a possibility that being observed during field duties may cause a slight variation in LHW performance leading to an underestimation or overestimation of performance.</p><p>The LHW-P in Badin is quite representative of the programme at the provincial and national level in terms of infrastructure and functionality. Therefore, results could be useful for programme implementers and workers across the country.</p><p>Findings from NIGRAAN would therefore be of significance in exploring whether training of LHSs in supervisory skills results in improving the CCM practices of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia. The enablers and barriers towards the uptake of this supervisory intervention would provide recommendations to policymakers for further scale up nationally and regionally.</p><p>NIGRAAN is funded by the World Health Organization, Geneva, Department of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health. The trial is registered with the &#x02018;Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry&#x02019;.
