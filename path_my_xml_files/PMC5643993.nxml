To improve their utility, the hybridization of bioceramics and biodegradable polymers has been widely adopted to reform the mechanical properties of bone grafts. One such biodegradable polymer is POC (Poly 1,8 octanediol). Secondly, citric acid is considered as the key material in bone mineralization, which is related to the overall stability, strength and fracture resistance of bone. Hence citric acid is incorporated in a polymer and Nano hydroxyapatite to form a composite graft, for periodontal bone regeneration. This study attempts to evaluate the efficacy of citric acid based Nano-hydroxyapatite composite graft for the treatment of intrabony defects in chronic periodontitis patients over 12 months.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>A split mouth study, which consists of 10 systemically healthy patients, were randomly treated with Citric acid based Nano hydroxyapatite composite graft (test sites, n=18) or with Nano hydroxyapatite alone (control sites, n=15). Plaque index, gingival index, gingival bleeding index, probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bone probing depth (BPD) and hard tissue parameters such as amount of defect fill, percentage of defect fill, and changes in alveolar crest were assessed over a period of 12 months. Statistical analysis used was student's <italic>t</italic>-test and One-Way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>Both test and control sites demonstrated statistically significant reduction of PD, BPD, gain in CAL and radiographic bone fill.

The pathological hallmark of periodontitis is the destruction of the supporting structure of the teeth involved. Although clinical bleeding on probing (BOP), erythema, edema, and suppuration may be clinical signs and symptoms of periodontal disease, the diagnosis of periodontitis is made by identifying the loss of attachment with periodontal probing and intraoral radiographs.</p><p>Scaling and root planing or open flap debridement are the conventional and gold standard methods for the treatment of periodontal disease. Conventional surgical procedures have only limited potential in the regeneration of periodontal tissues, hence various types of bone grafts have been widely used to promote bone formation as well as periodontal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Autologous bone grafts are the gold standard for bone grafting procedures in a variety of fields including orthopedics, neurosurgery, and dentistry due to their superior osteogenic potential. In dentistry, it is associated with various disadvantages such as additional surgical site, another potential location for postoperative pain, and complications. It is also contraindicated in osteoporotic patients due to a significant reduction in bone quality and quantity. Thus, the development of a synthetic, readily available, and osteogenic bone substitute as an adjunct to autologous tissue graft is required and considered a great need in the clinical field.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>A variety of synthetic bone graft materials are used to mimic the native composition of bone. Some of these materials are hydroxyapatite (HA) and beta tricalcium phosphate (TCP). Although these materials are biomimetic and osteoconductive, their application is severely limited due to inherent brittleness and slow degradation. Thus, in the quest for searching a material to overcome these limitations, Sun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Tran <italic>et al</italic>. in 2014[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] developed a citric acid-based HA composite scaffold with two different polymers and checked regeneration in rat calvarias.</p><p>Citrate, a naturally occurring Krebs's cycle product, is highly conserved in native bone. Recent research has suggested that citrate plays significant roles in bone anatomy, physiology, and orthopedic biomaterial development.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The source of citrate formation is unidentified, but it is found that citrate comprises ~1.6% of the bone content, and about 80% of the total body citrate is present in the bone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The bound citrate covers about 1/6<sup>th</sup> of the available apatite surface area in bone and accounts for 5.5 wt% of the organic matter in bone.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] &#x0201c;Osteoblast citration&#x0201d; is one of the newer concepts in bone formation. It has been suggested that citrate has a role in mineralization of osteoblast in bone formation; it now becomes evident that &#x0201c;citration&#x0201d; must be included in the process of mineralization. Mineralization without &#x0201c;citration&#x0201d; will not result in the formation of normal bone, i.e., bone that exhibits its important properties such as stability, strength, and resistance to fracture. A previous research by Hu <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and Davies <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] has shown that citrate molecules are strongly studded to the apatite nanocrystal surface and form bridges between mineral platelets regulating bone mineral crystallinity, which is highly related to the overall strength of bone tissue.</p><p>Thus, considering these properties of citrate in bone regeneration, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of citric acid-based nano HA (NHA) composite graft in comparison to NHA bone graft alone in surgical management of intrabony defects, in patients with chronic periodontitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study population</title><p>The participants of the study were enrolled from the outpatient department of our institution over a period of 6 months from May 2015 to November 2015.

Thus, ten systemically healthy patients were chosen with bilateral defects for this 12-month study. Hence, twenty sites were selected. However, after flap reflection, we found 33 graftable sites, of which 15 were taken as control sites and 18 as test sites. The patients were selected on the following criteria: patients who were ready to sign the informed consent, systemically healthy patients, both males and females in the age range of 30&#x02013;55 years having chronic generalized periodontitis, contralateral intrabony pockets measuring &#x02265;6 mm, radiographic evidence of vertical/angular bone loss, consenting patients who were co-operative and able to come for regular follow-up, and patients with &#x02265;20 remaining teeth.</p><p>The criteria for exclusion of the patients were as follows: pregnant/lactating women, individuals allergic to citric acid, patients who received antibiotic therapy in the previous 6 months, patients undertaken any periodontal therapy in the past 6 months, smokers, and patients medically compromised or under therapeutic regimen that may alter the probability of soft tissue and bone healing.</p><p>The sites were randomly assigned using the computer software-generated randomization method to test and control groups.

Using the apical margin of the customized acrylic stent as the fixed reference point (FRP), the clinical measurements were made at the proximal line angle of the tooth with the associated bony defect at both test and control sites.

The mean gain in the CAL was found to be 3.06 &#x000b1; 0.293 mm in test sites and 1.4 &#x000b1; 0.039 mm in control sites. The mean reduction in BPD was found to be 3.67 &#x000b1; 0.284 mm in test sites and 1.67 &#x000b1; 0.023 mm in control sites. On intergroup comparison, the test sites showed statistically significant improvement in all the above-mentioned parameters as compared to the control sites (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>The radiographic parameters showed the following results at 12 months: the ADF was 2.00 &#x000b1; 0.686 mm at test sites and 1.20 &#x000b1; 0.775 mm at control sites. The PDF was 65.74 &#x000b1; 27.602% at test sites and 39.89 &#x000b1; 24.432% at control sites. The increase in the ACL was 1.17 &#x000b1; 0.857 mm in test sites and 0.60 &#x000b1; 0.632 mm at control sites. The ADF, PDF, and ACL showed statistically significant improvement in test sites as compared to the control sites (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.004, <italic>P</italic> = 0.008, and <italic>P</italic> = 0.042, respectively).</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, no clinical study is published using citric acid NHA as a bone graft material in chronic periodontitis patients. No comparison of the efficacy of citric acid-based NHA and commercially available NHA is available. So far, only animal studies are available in orthopedics.</p><p>One such animal study was conducted by Sun <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] which compared the efficacy of two different citric acid-based polymer HA composites; the first one being poly(1,8-octanediol citrate)-HA (POC-HA) and the second was cross-linked urethane-doped polyester-HA (CUPE-HA), as an alternative to autologous tissue grafts in the repair of skeletal defects. Radiological and histological data showed a significant enhancement of osteogenesis in defects in both the polymer groups as compared to the control groups at 1, 3, and 6 months posttrauma. These results show the potential of CUPE-HA and POC-HA bare implants as biocompatible, osteogenic, and off-the-shelf-available options in the repair of orthopedic defects. Based on this study, we have used POC-NHA composite graft in our study.</p><p>Guo <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] conducted a study to evaluate the effect of biomimetic citrate-based POC-click-HA (POC-Click-HA) scaffolds in large segmental defects of bone. The results showed that all POC-Click-HA scaffolds exhibited good biocompatibility and extensive osteointegration with host bone tissue. Thus, it confirms the ability of scaffold to restore bone tissue and physiological functions in the early stages of recovery and the potential of citrate-based biomaterials in orthopedic applications.</p><p>Xie <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] conducted a study to evaluate a novel injectable citrate-based mussel-inspired bioadhesive HA (iCMBA/HA) bone substitute for the treatment of comminuted bone fracture (CBF). <italic>In vivo</italic> evaluation of iCMBA/HA in a rabbit comminuted radial fracture model showed significantly increased bone formation, with markedly enhanced bending strength compared to the negative control. Neovascularization and bone ingrowth, as well as highly organized bone formation, were also observed, showing the potential of iCMBA/HA in treating CBF.</p><p>Tran <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of citrate-based biodegradable composite in a rabbit lateral femoral condyle defect model and found that citrate-based polymer blend HA composite elicited minimal fibrous tissue encapsulation and was well integrated with the surrounding bone tissue.</p><p>Thus, the development of citrate-based biomaterials and their preliminary studies reveals the effects of free exogenous citrate on osteoblasts and shows the potential of citrate biomaterials to bridge the gap in HA crystals, thus proving the role of citrate molecules in regeneration, which has been previously overlooked.</p><p>NHA is one of the materials, which is used in bone regeneration, as it is a synthetic and osteoconductive material. The following studies show regenerative properties of NHA group.</p><p>Kasaj <italic>et al</italic>. in 2008[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] evaluated the efficacy of NHA paste in the treatment of intrabony defect in comparison with open flap debridement at 6-month follow-up and they found that the treatment of intrabony periodontal defects with NHA paste significantly improved clinical outcomes compared to open flap debridement. Jain <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] conducted a 6-month split-mouth study and compared the nano-sized HA and &#x003b2;-TCP in the treatment of human intrabony defects. They concluded that NHA leads to significant improvement in early clinical and radiographical outcome as compared to &#x003b2;-TCP. Kasaj <italic>et al</italic>. in 2008[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] concluded the ability of NHA paste to promote human periodontal ligament cell proliferation and found that NHA paste was mechanically linked to activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and downstream targets ERK1/2 and Akt, thus acting as a stimulator of cell proliferation of periodontal tissue regeneration.</p><p>According to Kim <italic>et al</italic>. in May 2000[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] who evaluated the limitations in measuring the clinical parameters in periodontal regenerative studies, it was shown that probing bone level most closely represented the actual bone level. They concluded that it might be a good clinical method for assessing the bone level following regenerative therapy in any site. We have measured the BPD and this could be considered the positive point for the study.</p><p>A limitation of clinical regeneration studies, such as the present one, is the inability to assess the histologic characteristics of the repaired tissues. Studies to examine the histologic nature of the interface of a treated bony defect and the root surface are difficult to conduct for ethical reasons.</p><p>The increase in the radiodensity in the defect, and hence a decrease in the defect size, signifies that the use of HA graft results in resolution of the intrabony defect. However, the nature of the regeneration, whether the graft acted as a filler material or allowed for ingrowth of the bone, cannot be inferred from the clinical and radiographic observations of the present study. Evaluation of the true nature of attachment requires histological investigation.</p><p>In addition, the present study has been concerned with clinical and radiographic observations using two different graft materials and has been restricted to linear method of radiographic evaluation of defect fill. Future studies should incorporate precise radiographic evaluation using the advanced digital imaging facilities available.</p><p>Within the limitation of this study, the citric acid-based NHA composite graft showed a significant improvement in the clinical as well as the radiographic parameters over a period of 12 months. Thus, this graft can be considered a promising periodontal regenerative material.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>To conclude, at 12 months, CA-NHA group showed statistically significant improvement in the clinical and radiographical parameters as compared to the NHA group. Thus, CA-NHA can be considered one of the newer materials in periodontal regeneration. A further study, which incorporates advanced digital imaging facilities and histological analysis, should be considered.</p><p>Clinical trial registration of India Registration number is CTRI/2016/11/007447.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>This research was carried out with the research grant awarded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Resource, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi, for thesis research (Ref No. 3/2/October. 2015/PG-THESIS-HRD [24]).
