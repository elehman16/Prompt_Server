Low iron intake, low iron bioavailability, and the presence of infectious diseases are the main causes of iron deficiency.</p><p>Strategies to prevent and control iron deficiency include decreasing poverty, improving of health systems and food security, reducing iron losses, improving iron's bioavailability in foods, and increasing iron intake (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Supplementation, fortification, and biofortification are strategies that have been implemented worldwide to increase iron intake. However, iron deficiency is still highly prevalent suggesting more strategies are needed to decrease iron deficiency. Because plants are the main source of iron for most people in the developing world, the generation of iron-fortified crops should increase iron intake and have a significant impact on human health.</p><p>Banana is a staple food in many countries in the world, specifically Latin America, Asia, and Africa, where the prevalence of iron deficiency is high. In Uganda, for example, 49% of women of reproductive age and 73% of children aged &#x0003c;59 months are anemic; in addition, 88% of women have iron deficiency with or without anemia (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). In Mexico, prevalence of iron deficiency in children &#x0003c;5 years of age is approximately 26% (<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Banana consumption per capita in Uganda is very high: 0.48 kg/day for cooked banana and 0.15 kg/day for raw banana (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Intake varies markedly depending on the region, with the highest banana consumers in the highlands. Banana intake in Mexico is one of the highest in Latin America (16 kg/year) (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Thus, in countries where large quantities of bananas are consumed and where iron deficiency is a major health concern, bananas are a potential vehicle for iron fortification.</p><p>Iron content in bananas is low, approximately 0.4 mg/100 g of fresh weight. There is a strategy of developing modified lines of bananas to increase their iron content; the target is a 3- to 6-fold increase. To evaluate iron absorption from bananas, both cooked and raw bananas will provide very useful information that could help to predict how the banana matrix affects iron absorption and its potential use to improve iron status. No studies have been made estimating the effect cooking has on iron absorption or how much iron is absorbed from bananas. This information will be useful for countries where iron deficiency is a major health concern and where large quantities of bananas are consumed.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate iron absorption from raw and cooked banana using stable isotopes in women living in rural M&#x000e9;xico.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="S0002-S20001"><title>Subjects and place of study</title><p>Women between ages 18 and 45 from the rural community of Fuentezuelas, Quer&#x000e9;taro, were invited to participate in the study. Subjects received oral and written information before signing a letter accepting voluntarily their participation in the study. The Bioethics Committee from the School of Natural Sciences at the Universidad Aut&#x000f3;noma de Quer&#x000e9;taro (UAQ) approved the study protocol and the procedures followed were in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.</p><p>Women were included in the study if they consumed bananas frequently (at least 3 times per week). Exclusion criteria for the participants included obesity [body mass index (BMI)&#x0003e;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>], any chronic disease such as hypertension or diabetes, any gastrointestinal disease, anemia (Hb&#x0003c;12 g/dL), infection (CRP&#x0003e;3 mg/L), chronic intake of medications, if they had consumed micronutrient supplements that included iron for the past 3 months, pregnant or lactating, and if they had iron deficiency (ferritin&#x0003c;12 &#x000b5;g/L).</p><p>Sample size was calculated to detect a biological difference in fractional absorption of iron of 0.1, a standard deviation of 0.08, with an alpha error of 0.05, a power of 90%; also a potential loss of subjects of 10% was included. With these assumptions we needed to include 15 women in each group.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20002"><title>Study design</title><p>Thirty women (34.9&#x000b1;6.6 years) who met the inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to one of two groups:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>480 g of raw banana per day for 6 consecutive days (<italic>N=</italic>15).</p></list-item><list-item><p>500 g of cooked banana per day for 4 consecutive days (<italic>N=</italic>15).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>One day before the study started, the women were asked to attend the health clinic after an overnight fast, their weight and height were measured and a baseline venous blood sample was taken. A food frequency questionnaire was also applied at this time. The next day each group consumed bananas for breakfast and women were asked not to eat anything prior to the study. Also, the participants were not allowed to consume any food and were asked to stay in the community house for 3 h after consuming the bananas. A reference dose was given on two separate days. In both studies, after 14 days of consuming the reference dose, a final blood sample was taken for the analysis of iron absorption.</p><p>The amount of raw and cooked bananas was determined according to the daily consumption in countries where banana is a staple food, such as Uganda (approximately 500 g/day of cooked bananas and 480 g/day of raw bananas) (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The duration of each study varied according to the amount of iron the subject had to consume daily from the bananas and the iron stable isotope (<sup>58</sup>Fe) that was distributed equally every day in proportion to the intrinsic iron content of raw or cooked bananas.</p><p>Iron absorption from the meals was measured with <sup>58</sup>Fe and <sup>57</sup>Fe isotopes, respectively, as described by Abrams (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Bananas were extrinsically labeled with 2 mg of <sup>58</sup>Fe distributed in the days they received the bananas. The isotopes were given to the subjects in vacuum-sealed glass vials, and women had to consume the isotopes half way through the intake of the bananas. The glass vials had to be rinsed three times with water, and the women had to drink the water also. A reference dose of 6.0 mg of <sup>57</sup>Fe with 25 mg of ascorbic acid as orange juice was given in the morning for 2 consecutive days (3 mg per day) to subjects in both groups (8 mg of total isotope), without any food.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20003"><title>Banana preparation</title><p>In the two absorption studies, Cavendish bananas obtained from the general market in Quer&#x000e9;taro, M&#x000e9;xico, on the same day of the studies were used. This type of banana was selected because studies are being made to develop genetically modified lines to increase iron absorption in the same type at the Centre for Tropical Crops and Biocommodities, Queensland University of Technology, Australia.</p><p>The cooked banana was prepared based on the Ugandan traditional dish known as <italic>matooke</italic>. Following the traditional recipe, green bananas were peeled, chopped, and then wrapped in banana leaves and steamed for 45 min until soft enough to mash and serve. The cooked bananas were prepared daily in the morning and were served warm, with no sauce or spice added. The raw bananas were served ripe, which was determined by their yellow peel.</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20004"><title>Anthropometry and body composition</title><p>Weight, height, and waist and hip circumferences were measured in duplicate by trained personnel following standard procedures (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).

Blood analysis included hemoglobin, ferritin, and C-reactive protein (CRP). All laboratory analyses were performed in duplicate at the Human Nutrition Laboratory of UAQ.</p><p>Hemoglobin and complete blood count were determined using Cell-Dyn (Cell-Dyn 1400, Abbott, EUA) and the corresponding standards. Ferritin was determined with a commercial kit (Ferritin, Biosystem, Barcelona, Spain) and CRP was quantified in serum using a commercial high sensitivity kit (Spinreact, Sant Esteve de Bas, Spain). Both ferritin and CRP were analyzed by spectrophotometry (Genesis 20, Thermo Electron Corp, Wisconsin, USA).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S20007"><title>Iron isotope preparation</title><p>Iron isotopes of <sup>57</sup>Fe (95.6%) and <sup>58</sup>Fe enriched (93.13%) were purchased in the elemental form (Trace Sciences International Corp, Ontario, Canada) and prepared at the Human Nutrition Laboratory at UAQ. Both forms of metal iron were converted to ferrous sulfate. The <sup>58</sup>Fe isotope was dissolved at room temperature in 5 mL of 7 mol/L HNO<sub>3</sub> and 21 mL of 0.5 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and dried uncovered at 120&#x000b0;C in a muffle furnace for 1 h followed by drying at 230&#x000b0;C for 30 min and 500&#x000b0;C for 30 min.

The ferrous sulfate solution obtained was brought to a final volume of 335 mL and 0.5 mg/mL concentration, which was checked by atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk CT). Finally, ferrous sulfate solution obtained was filtered through with Millex FH-13 filter (Millipore, New Bedford, MA). The <sup>57</sup>Fe isotope was dissolved in 13 mL of 7 mol/L HNO<sub>3</sub> and 54 mL of 0.5 mol/L H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and dried uncovered at 120&#x000b0;C in a muffle furnace for 1 h followed by drying at 230&#x000b0;C for 30 min and 500&#x000b0;C for 30 min.

General characteristics and baseline ferritin and hemoglobin concentrations of subjects were compared between experimental groups with Student's t-test. To compare the percentage of absorption and amount absorbed between groups, a Student's t-test for independent groups was performed. An additional ANOVA test to compare absorption between groups was performed adjusting for ferritin concentration to evaluate the effect of baseline ferritin concentration on iron absorption. To evaluate the relationship between iron absorption and the percent absorption of the reference dose with baseline ferritin concentration, Pearson correlations were performed.

In the present study, total amount of iron absorbed from raw and cooked bananas was similar.</p><p>In the population studied, a difference in iron status was observed between groups. However, the adjusted analysis for ferritin concentration shows that the differences between groups did not affect iron absorption. In addition, iron absorption from the bananas and the reference dose were unrelated to ferritin levels. This is probably due to the fact that none of the subjects had iron deficiency. Thus, differences in iron status are not affecting iron absorption in any of the study groups. Also, in the present study iron absorption was not affected by phytate content. The phytate:iron molar ratio was similar between groups and well below the ratio known to affect iron absorption (phytate:iron&#x0003e;1) (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>The composition of bananas and its changes due to ripening and cooking may have an important influence on iron absorption. Bananas are a good source of starches and its content changes depending on the degree of ripening and cooking. Ripening and softening of raw bananas is mainly due to an efficient degradation of insoluble starches and accumulation of more soluble and smaller carbohydrates (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Studies have shown that the accumulation of soluble carbohydrates is significant after approximately 4 days after harvest (DAH) (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Shiga et al. (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) showed that bananas with an initial amount of starch of 220 g/kg resulted in an increase of 180 g/kg of more simple carbohydrates at 17 DAH. Animal models have shown that iron is bound to some insoluble starches and limit its absorption in the intestinal mucosa (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). When starch is degraded in high amounts of soluble carbohydrates due to ripening, iron solubility increases. Our results show that iron absorption from raw bananas is high probably due to this significant increase of soluble carbohydrates that increase iron solubility. Approximately 50% of the iron that was consumed in the raw bananas was absorbed. Thus, even though raw bananas have a low iron content, absorption is high.</p><p>Raw banana starch is resistant to degradation in the small bowel during digestion, and may limit iron absorption. Green bananas have a high content of resistant starch (4.7 g/one medium banana) (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Green bananas account for 80% of banana intake in Uganda (F.F. De Moura, Harvest Plus, unpublished results). Cooking the bananas modifies its matrix, allowing for an iron absorption of approximately 30%. Cooking has been shown to increase solubility of starch at high temperatures (70&#x02013;90&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), but to a lesser extent than ripening (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). As mentioned before, when the amount of soluble carbohydrates increase, solubility of iron improves and the amount of iron available for absorption increases. Cooking also increases the amount of resistant starch in bananas (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Few studies have looked at the effect of resistant starch on iron absorption and results are not consistent. The effect of starch on iron absorption was first studied in the 1960s, where iron absorption in rats was not affected by adding starch to the meals (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Orzel et al. observed similar results where iron absorption was not affected when adding modified resistant starch to the diet of rats (<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In animal studies, an increase in iron absorption has been observed when fed a high resistant starch diet compared to diets with high soluble starches (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Morais et al., for example, found that iron absorption doubled when adding 16.4% of resistant starch to the diet of piglets (<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). In addition, it has been observed that rats consuming resistant starch significantly decreased the inhibitory effect of phytic acid on iron absorption and iron balance was restored to the control values (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). One possible mechanism that explains why resistant starch improves iron absorption has to do with the solubility of iron. It has been suggested that resistant starch decreases the pH of the intestine, which in turn improves the solubility of iron, and thus, increases its absorption (<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In contrast, iron absorption was reduced in a rat model when starches were added to their diets as a source of carbohydrates and cooking reduced more iron absorption compared to uncooked starches (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). In humans, using the ileostomy model, resistant starch 2 (RS2) from raw green banana flour did not interfere with the absorption of iron in the small intestine, and was not different than cooked green bananas (<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It has also been suggested that iron status may influence the effect resistant starch has on iron absorption. Iron-deficient rats absorbed less iron when fed starch compared with iron-deficient rats fed sucrose (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Absorption was not affected by starch in rats with adequate iron status. More studies are needed to determine the effect of resistant starch on iron absorption from different food sources including bananas.</p><p>One major limitation of the study is the amount of iron consumed per group. The group consuming cooked bananas consumed approximately 1 mg more of iron during the study than the group consuming the raw bananas. However, at the end of the study both groups had similar total iron absorption since absorption of the raw bananas was significantly higher.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To sum up, total iron absorption is similar in both cooked and raw bananas. The banana matrix does not affect iron absorption and is a potential effective target for genetic modification for iron biofortification. Further research is necessary to describe the mechanism by which cooking modifies the banana matrix and how this affects iron absorption.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the participants, the nutritionists Ana P&#x000e9;rez and Karla Flores, and the field personnel who helped during fieldwork.</p></ack><sec id="S0006"><title>Conflict of interest and funding</title><p>The authors declare no conflict of interest.
