Cutaneous warts are caused by a small group of specific types of human papillomaviruses. &#x0201c;Common warts&#x0201d; are the most frequent clinical presentation of the cutaneous warts (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Plunkett et al., 1999</xref>) with an overall prevalence of 20% in school children and a decline thereafter with patients&#x02019; increasing age (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Massing and Epstein, 1963</xref>).</p><p id="p0010">No specific antiviral therapy is available to cure warts. Although spontaneous recovery often occurs, it usually takes a long time, even years, for warts to resolve (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Kirnbauer et al., 2008</xref>). There are several therapies for warts, but none that is uniformly effective in the elimination of the lesions and all have different adverse effects (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Micali et al., 2004</xref>). Existing modalities focus primarily on the destruction or removal of visible lesions or induction of the immune system against infected cells. Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is one of the most effective treatments and destroys the warts by freezing the infected tissues. Treatment that is repeated every 3 weeks gives a 30% to 70% cure rate after 3 months for warts on the hands (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Bourke et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p id="p0015">Zinc is a trace element with a proven effect on the immune system and a deficiency causes reduced immune capacity and lymphopenia (<xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Fraker, 1987</xref>). Zinc is considered an immunomodulator and has been used successfully to treat patients with skin diseases who have an altered immune response such as cutaneous leishmaniasis (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Sharquie et al., 2001</xref>), erythema nodosum leprosum (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Mahajan et al., 1994</xref>), alopecia areata (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Lutz and Kreysel, 1990</xref>), and perifolliculitis capitis (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Bern et al., 1985</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">The role of oral zinc in the treatment of patients with cutaneous warts is controversial. A number of previous clinical reports have suggested that oral zinc sulfate can successfully treat cutaneous warts (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Al-Gurairi et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mun et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Yaghoobi et al., 2009</xref>).

In this study, we used a combination of zinc sulfate and cryotherapy to evaluate any additive effect of zinc in the treatment and recurrence rate of common warts.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><title>Methods</title><p id="p0025">This study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial that was performed at Razi Hospital in Tehran, Iran from September 2011 to November 2012. Eighty-three patients were enrolled in the study.</p><p id="p0030">The inclusion criteria for the study were patient age &#x0003e;&#x000a0;7 years, more than two common warts, no history of systemic or iatrogenic immunosuppression, no use of medication or procedures for the treatment of warts within 6 months of the study, and not pregnant or currently breastfeeding. Patients were assigned to either the treatment or placebo group by simple randomization. All patients included in the study were informed of the treatment protocol and asked to sign an informed consent form. In the case of patients who were not of legal age, parents provided the consent on their behalf. The treatment was blinded to the patients, investigators, and pharmacist. Both products were similar in color, shape, and smell. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p id="p0035">Full patient history including age, sex, past medical and family history of disease, time since the warts first appeared, any previous treatment and/or systemic illnesses, sites and distribution of the warts, and any signs of zinc deficiency were recorded for each patient with a questionnaire.</p><p id="p0040">Serum zinc was measured in all patients both at the beginning of the trial (baseline) and after discontinuation of the treatment (final) using the atomic absorption spectrophotometer assay method (Hitachi 902, Seoul, South Korea).</p><p id="p0045">Patients in the treatment group received oral zinc sulfate in the form of 220 mg capsules (Al-havi, Tehran, Iran) in a dose of 10 mg/kg per day in three divided doses up to 600 mg/day. Patients in the placebo (control) group were given capsules of similar appearance that were filled with starch.</p><p id="p0050">In both groups, liquid nitrogen cryotherapy was administered with a saturated, cotton-tipped applicator until an ice-ball formation had spread from the center to a margin of 2 mm around each wart with a double freeze-thaw cycle. Cryotherapy was repeated at intervals of 3 weeks for up 2 months. Cryotherapy and clinical assessments were performed by the same physician for all patients.</p><p id="p0055">Due to the common digestive adverse effects of zinc sulfate, patients were recommended to take the drug with food and one glass of water or juice. If any drug adverse effect occurred, patients were recommended to stop the drug intake for 2 to 3 days. If the patient showed an adequate drug tolerance afterward, they were advised to keep taking the medication. Otherwise, they were told to discontinue the drug and excluded from the study.</p><p id="p0060">The treatment trial lasted for 2 months and the follow-up period was up to 6 months. A cure was defined as the total elimination of all lesions and the appearance of any new warts in any location was considered a recurrence. With a statistically significant level of 0.05 and a statistical power of 80%, 40 patients in each group were needed.</p><p id="p0065">The data analysis was performed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) Version 19.

Cryotherapy is one of the most effective treatments for warts but it is a painful procedure and has some adverse effects such as scarring and dyspigmentation (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Micali et al., 2004</xref>). Zinc sulfate has many confirmed effects on immune response and infectious disease treatment, for example in toxoplasma retinochoroiditis (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Avunduk et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p id="p0100">Impairment of the immune system during zinc deficiency has been observed in previous studies. The main mechanism of immune dysfunctions that are caused by zinc deficiency is the decrease in gene expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-2 receptor a (IL-2Ra) due to the decreased activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) in T helper cells. Decreased gene expression and generation of tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-&#x003b1;), IL-1&#x000df; and IL-8, reduced T-cell numbers, decreased ratio of type 1 to 2 T-helper cells with a reduced production of T-helper type 1 cytokines such as interferon-gamma are other mechanisms. Zinc is also an antioxidant and has antiinflammatory qualities (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Avunduk et al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">H&#x000f6;nscheid et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Kaltenberg et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Prasad, 2008</xref>).</p><p id="p0105">In addition, polyclonal activation of the lymphocytes has been yielded by the addition of zinc to culture media. According to these data, the enforcement of the immune system of individuals with low levels of zinc and those with marginal or normal levels of zinc are possible (<xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Wirth et al., 1989</xref>). Zinc is considered an immunomodulator and has been used successfully in the treatment of patients with skin diseases who have an altered immune system function (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Fraker, 1986</xref>). Zinc is non-toxic and non-cumulative (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Prasada, 1979</xref>).</p><p id="p0110">There are controversial reports about the effectiveness of zinc sulfate in the treatment of patients with viral warts. <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Al-Gurairi et al. (2002)</xref> treated recalcitrant warts with oral zinc sulfate versus placebo with 86.9% clearance after 2 months. Another similar study was performed in Iran by <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Yaghoobi et al. (2009)</xref> and found similar results. In an open-label study in Korea, the effectiveness of oral zinc sulfate 10 mg/kg for 2 months in the treatment of patients with nongenital viral warts was assessed and 50% of patients showed a complete resolution (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mun et al., 2011</xref>). <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Sharma et al.

In addition, some evidence showed that a combination therapy of oral zinc sulfate with conventional treatments of vulvar warts appeared to reduce the relapse rate of genital warts (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Akhavan et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, the results of a study in Mexico showed that zinc supplement was not superior to placebo in the treatment of patients with viral warts (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p id="p0115">Our study did not show any difference in the complete resolution of the warts between patients who were treated with cryotherapy and zinc sulfate and those who were treated with cryotherapy and placebo (68.4% vs 63.9% cure rate; <italic>p</italic> = .68). This finding supports the study by <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">L&#x000f3;pez-Garc&#x000ed;a et al.

A larger sample size may change this finding.</p><p id="p0130">Interestingly, our findings showed a significant relation between the duration of disease (<italic>p</italic> = .03; odds ratio [OR] = 1.05) and mean number of warts (<italic>p</italic> = .048; OR = 1.12) with response rate. Patients with a shorter disease duration and fewer lesions may have a better response so the duration and number of warts can be prognostic factors in response to the cryotherapy. A similar finding was seen in a study by <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Khaled et al. (2009)</xref>. These findings can be somehow logical because wart is basically a self-limiting disease and long-standing lesions have less possibility to heal spontaneously. Also, patients with fewer warts may have a better immune reaction.</p><p id="p0135">Some points are worth mentioning with regard to our study. Considering the different target population in our study compared with previous studies (i.e., common warts versus recalcitrant warts), it is possible that zinc may have some additional effects but only on recalcitrant warts (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Al-Gurairi et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mun et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Yaghoobi et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, zinc deficiency was reported in a significant percentage of patients with a good response to oral zinc sulfate in previous studies (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Al-Gurairi et al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Mun et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Yaghoobi et al., 2009</xref>). However, zinc deficiency was not a common finding in our patients. Therefore, different results in our study could be due to differences in population and nutritional status.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0140">The addition of oral zinc sulfate to the treatment of warts as a routine modality may not be justified for all patients because of a lack of proven efficacy, considerable gastrointestinal adverse effects, and long periods of treatment (i.e., 1 to 2 months). Zinc sulfate can be recommended for patients with recalcitrant warts or low or marginal levels of serum zinc.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bi0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akhavan</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mohammadi</surname><given-names>S.R.</given-names></name><name><surname>Modarres Gillani</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mousavi</surname><given-names>A.S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Shirazi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Efficacy of combination therapy of oral zinc sulfate with imiquimod, podophyllin or cryotherapy in the treatment of vulvar warts</article-title><source>J Obstet Gynaecol Res</source><volume>40</volume><year>2014</year><fpage>2110</fpage><lpage>2113</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25132143</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0010"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0010"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Al-Gurairi</surname><given-names>F.T.</given-names></name><name><surname>Al-Waiz</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sharquie</surname><given-names>K.E.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Oral zinc sulphate in the treatment of recalcitrant viral warts: Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial</article-title><source>Br J Dermatol</source><volume>146</volume><year>2002</year><fpage>423</fpage><lpage>431</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11952542</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0015"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0015"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Avunduk</surname><given-names>A.M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Avunduk</surname><given-names>M.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baltaci</surname><given-names>A.K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Moqulkoc</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of melatonin and zinc on the immune response in experimental Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis</article-title><source>Ophthalmologica</source><volume>221</volume><year>2007</year><fpage>421</fpage><lpage>425</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17947831</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bb0020"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="rf0020"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bern</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Venge</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ohman</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Perifolliculitis capitis abscendens et suffodiens (Hoffman).
