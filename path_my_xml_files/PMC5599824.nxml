degenerative, oncotic, metabolic, and organic pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, changes to body alignment and continuous movement are
acknowledged as general risks of lower back pain<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Changes to muscle flexibility directly affect epidemiologically
connected functions of other joints, and decreases of the range of joint movement cause
epidemiologic changes that result in disorders of joint functions<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. When muscle changes and posture are imbalanced, forward
pelvic tilting frequently occurs during the transposition of the pelvis due to the weakened
or slack hamstring muscle<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. The increase
of lumbar curvature while the body bends forward raises the shearing force on the front part
of the spine and increases the risk of spinal injury. Decreases of flexibility in hamstring
muscles raise the risk of injury because of the epidemiological stress put on the spine
during the bending posture<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Since the
occurrence of lower back pain increases when lower spine muscles and hamstring muscles
contract<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>, hamstring flexibility
exercises are good treatment options to alleviate lower back pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Neuromuscular status is sensitive to any damage of the vertebral column, and it can
especially cause damage to the neck bone or thoracic vertebrae<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The first option of treatment for most patients with lower back
pain is typically physical therapy. Rest, medical treatment, injections, nerve blocks,
traction therapy, execution of Williams exercise, focused abdominal training, and muscle
stretching lead to the alleviation of such pain<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Major causes of pressure on the spine are herniated discs, facet
joints, uncovertebral joint osteophytes, and contraction of the spinal nerve hall, which
delays blood circulation of neural muscles<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, pain occurs as a result of microvascular change, which
is caused by the positive feedback of inflammation in response to pressure<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Acute or sub-acute neuromuscular pressure
increases neural conduction block, edema in nerves, epidemiologic sensitivity, and sodium
channel density<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, Bertolini et
al. explained that nerve mobilization decreased adhesion between the edema and the nerve
with recovery of neuroepidemiologic sensitivity in their experiments on animals<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Clinical viewpoint, nerve mobilization is effective for various musculoskeletal diseases,
such as carpal tunnel syndrome, brachial nerve pain in the neck, and lateral
epicondylitis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>; it is therefore being
actively researched. In the research of Kim et al., median NM of upper limbs improved the
fatigue and pain threshold of biceps<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Also, Ha et al. explained that the application of median nerve mobilization of the arms by a
therapist led to greater increases in nerve conduction velocity than nerve mobilization that
was performed by the patient<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, Cha et al. illustrated that nerve mobilization of the lower limbs in stroke
patients was more effective for improving lower leg functions than other forms of
non-operative physical therapy<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Nerve mobilization utilizes methods of imposing tension and utilizing slipping to treat
lower back pain<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>, and this therapy
alleviates and disperses the tension on the nerve<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, few studies have been conducted on its effects in
treating radicular lower back pain. Therefore, in this paper, hamstring stretching and nerve
mobilization are conducted on patients with radicular lower back pain, and changes to pain
levels, pressure thresholds, angles of knee joint extension, and disorder levels of lower
back pain were studied.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This research targeted outpatients who were diagnosed with radicular lower back pain at
K-Hospital located in Andong-si of Gyeongsangbuk-do under the agreement of their
participation in the experiment. Selection criteria was patients between the ages of 20 and
50 who had sought treatment for pain or paresthesia of the lower limbs or pelvis due to a
diagnosis of radicular lower back pain. Patients who had surgery or therapy for lower back
pain with an active period of pain over three months, as well as patients with other
musculoskeletal disorders causing pain, injury, or neurological symptoms, were excluded. A
total of 22 subjects participated in the research, and they were randomly assigned to two
subject groups. One group conducted hamstring stretches and was comprised of 6 male and 5
female subjects, and the other group received nerve mobilization treatment and was comprised
of 5 male and 6 female subjects. Both groups executed basic physical therapy, which included
superficial thermal treatment for 20 minutes and interference wave treatment for 15 minutes,
before the intervention. All subjects were informed of the purpose and methods of the study,
and their consent was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Daegu University
(1040621-201702-HR-012-02).</p><p>Subjects in the hamstring stretching group bent the hip joint to its maximum range in the
lying position and fixed it with a belt; the knee joint was then straightened to as far as
the shortened muscle allowed; they maintained these positions for 10 seconds each. The
muscle was then stretched to its maximum range for 10 seconds, the subjects were ordered to
move into the direction of the stretch, and antagonist muscle stimulation was conducted for
10 seconds. The sets took a total of 40 seconds each and five sets were executed for a
subject. After a set, a break of 20 seconds was given, and another set was then
executed<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Subjects in the nerve mobilization group used the slider method, in which they fixed a side
of the head using the sling device while lying on their side. In the starting posture, the
neck joint was bent in its normal range without pain, and the hip and ankle joints were then
bent. After then the knee and neck joints were straightened generously, the whole process
was repeated. The bending was executed in a range that did not cause pain; the patients
instead felt a slight pulling. A single rep was set to be 2 seconds, and 20 reps for 40
seconds was defined as a set. After the execution of a set, a break of 20 seconds was given,
and 5 sets were executed in total<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. In
addition, the nerve mobilization technique was performed by two physiotherapists qualified
with MT or more who were trained in the kaltenborn-evjenth concept. These interventions were
conducted three times a week for three weeks for both groups.</p><p>To evaluate the effect of the therapy in each group, the visual analogue scale, digital
sense, angle of straightened knee, and the index of backache disorder were compared before
and after therapy. To measure the level of pain, the visual analogue scale was been applied.
On the level of pain for each subject, a painless status was defined as &#x02018;0,&#x02019; while
unbearable pain was defined as &#x02019;10.&#x02019; These pain levels were marked by the patients
themselves<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. The change in pain level
was reviewed by comparing the pain status before and after executing three weeks of
interventions.</p><p>The experimental pressure threshold on the gluteus medius caused by radicular lower back
pain was measured by the digital algometer in the unit of N/cm<sup>2</sup> (JTECH medical
Industries Inc., UT, USA). When the pressure was indicated on the screen of the digital
algometer, it was numerically marked. The measurement index was 1&#x02005;cm<sup>2</sup>, and it was
applied on the pressure spot of the gluteus medius. The subjects were lying face down in a
relaxed position, and they said &#x0201c;Ah,&#x0201d; when they felt pain during the experiment. The
pressure at which subjects felt pain was measured three times, and an interval of a minute
was given. The spot was marked to ensure consistency for the next measurement, and the
result was concealed to subjects. The measurement reliability of the digital algometer using
the interclass correlation coefficient in subject groups was 0.90<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The angle of the extension knee, which was influenced by radicular lower back pain, was
measured by the goniometer on the spot right above the ankle while subjects lied on their
back, maintained the thigh perpendicularly to the ground, and extension the knee<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. When the lower leg was perpendicular to
the ground, the degree of the angle of the bent knee was perpendicular in the beginning
posture. As the knee was straightened, the angle increased, and the angle at which subjects
could not straighten any more was measured three times. The average value of the
measurements was used.</p><p>To measure the functional disorder level, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) was used. The
ODI is composed of 10 items that gauge the pain caused by backache, lifting, sitting,
sleeping, social life, personal management, walking, standing, sexual life, and traveling.
The painless status is defined as the &#x02018;0&#x02019; point, and the worst status of pain is marked by
&#x02018;5&#x02019; points. Lower points can be analyzed as less influential, and the higher point mean that
the pain is more disruptive to daily life. According to the research, the test-retest
reliability of the ODI is 0.99, which is very reliable<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Before and after the intervention during the three weeks, a break
of 30 minutes was given before the measurement to minimize the influence of fatigue.</p><p>The collected data of this research was analyzed by the statistics program SPSS Version
18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The differences between before and after
intervention were compared with Wicoxon signed-rank tests and differences within a group
before and baseline score, change score of dependent variable of were tested using the
Mann-Whitney U test. A p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to indicate significance for all
analyses.</p><p>The significance level (&#x003b1;) was set to be 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p><xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>The general characteristics of the subjects</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HSG (n=11)</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">NMG (n=11)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (yrs)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.6 &#x000b1; 4.4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">36.8 &#x000b1; 5.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Height (cm)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">166.2 &#x000b1; 9.3</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">167.6 &#x000b1; 8.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Weight (kg)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">63.4 &#x000b1; 11.1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">065.5 &#x000b1; 15.1</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Mean &#x000b1; SD.

pain was a decrease in lower subluxation, which is the angle of knee straightening caused by
pain in the pelvis or leg. The original purpose of this research was to compare the
influence of hamstring stretching that is generally applied in clinics to the influence of
nerve mobilization, which is being newly implemented. Also, the research intended to review
the influence of two treatments and the degrees of change in pain levels, knee stretching
angle, and disorder index of lower back pain.</p><p>Clinically, the measurement of hamstring muscle length is used to measure lower back
pain<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup>, and the correlation between
lower back pain and hamstring muscle length has been explained by the report&#x02014;patients with
lower back pain had significantly decreased hamstring muscle length<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this experiment, the diagnosis of radicular pain
significantly decreased in both groups after therapy was performed. In the case of hamstring
stretching, the intervention increased the degraded flexibility of patients with lower back
pain to finally alleviate the pain<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
nerve mobilization group showed greater effects from therapy than the hamstring stretching
group, which suggests that nerve mobilization decreases the nerve adhesion of patients with
radicular lower back pain, blocks the diffusion of harmful substances, and expands the nerve
blood vessels<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Pressure threshold define as the minimum (force) required to cause pain. pressure threshold
measurements are usually performed over areas of muscle tenderness (sometimes referred to as
trigger points) Trigger points, fibrositis, myalgic spots, activity of arthritis as well as
assessment of sensitivity to pain can be diagnosed by pressure threshold<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup>. In previous research on pressure
threshold&#x02019;s role as an indication of the measurement index of pain, nerve mobilization that
was conducted on a patient with lateral epicondylitis led to a significant increase in
pressure threshold<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this research,
the hamstring stretching group also significantly increased their pressure thresholds, which
also increased in the nerve mobilization group after the intervention. However, there was no
significant difference between the groups in pressure thresholds. The application of nerve
mobilization to patients with lower back pain decreases the pressure on the peripheral nerve
and increases the flexibility, which increases blood flow and nerve conduction velocity<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><sup>)</sup>. Alleviating muscle fatigue also lessens
the pain of the patient<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the knee extension angle, the subjects without lower back pain were more flexible than
others with lower back pain<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both
maintaining positions and relaxing, as well as static stretching methods, were effective for
improving the flexibility of the hamstring muscle<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this research, the flexibility of the hamstring muscle improved
after the intervention of the stretching. This suggests that static stretching of the
hamstring muscle contributed to the viscoelasticity of the muscle and increased the
tolerance to stretching; thus, flexibility was improved<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><sup>)</sup>. Also, applying the nerve slip and tension methods of nerve
mobilization, the same effect of improvements to the knee extension angle was observed<xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><sup>)</sup>. Both Bulter&#x02019;s nerve mobilization and
Mulligan&#x02019;s bent leg raise methods for lower back pain show significant improvement in the
range of leg lifts, as this research showed. Also, this study showed significant differences
before and after the intervention of nerve mobilization treatment. This is because nerve
mobilization can alleviate the tension and pressure in neighbor muscles, which improves
movement<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, there was no
significant difference between the two groups.</p><p>For the disorder index of lower back pain, the short period of hamstring stretches for
patients with lower back pain significantly decreased the index<xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><sup>)</sup>. The self-execution of nerve mobilization for patients
with lower back pain promoted the recovery of nervous tissue by stimulating soft tissues,
which increased the adaptability of nerves and decreased the sensitivity, thus alleviating
the symptom<xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this study, both the
hamstring stretching group and nerve mobilization group showed improvement after the
intervention. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups.</p><p>In this research, 22 patients with lower back pain into hamstring stretching and nerve
mobilization groups. Therapy was conducted three times a week for three weeks, and the pain
level, pressure threshold, knee extension angle, and disorder index of lower back pain were
compared before and after intervention. According to the results, patients with lower back
pain showed significant differences in pain level, pressure threshold, knee extension angle,
and disorder index of lower back pain for both the hamstring stretching group and nerve
mobilization group after the treatment. Comparing the two groups, the nerve mobilization
group showed more significant changes in pain level. Hamstring stretches and nerve
mobilization are effective interventions for patients with lower back pain, and nerve
mobilization is superior to hamstring stretching in alleviating lower back pain of patients.
Therefore, both hamstring stretching and nerve mobilization can be usefully applied for the
therapy of patients with lower back pain.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Maheswari</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group>: Fracture healing essential orthopaedics.
