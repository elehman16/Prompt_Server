Patients and partners felt positive about participating in a peer group and with their partner. Among participants no significant changes were found in psychological distress.

Lung cancer patients are mostly older, male and in general have a poor prognosis. In previous studies, MBSR was mainly offered after physical treatments to help patients recover and handle daily life with their families and jobs. Also, very little is known about MBSR in partners.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Because the median survival time of lung cancer patients is short, mindfulness might be particularly relevant in terms of acceptance and improving quality of life. This might apply to both patients and their partners.

(2) Is MBSR effective in reducing psychological distress in lung cancer patients and their partners?</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section8-0269216315572720"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section9-0269216315572720"><title>Design and setting</title><p>To explore the feasibility and effectiveness of MBSR in lung cancer patients and partners, a mixed methods pilot study was conducted, following the Good Reporting of a Mixed Method Study (GRAMMS) guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> The study was conducted in a tertiary care academic medical centre from January 2010 to December 2011.

By participating in the MBSR training, participants allowed themselves to stand still and to take time for themselves. For most participants, practising mindfulness led to inner rest and relaxation.</p></sec><sec id="section29-0269216315572720"><title>Being aware</title><p>Throughout the MBSR, patients noticed aspects they had not been aware of before. They described a greater awareness of their thoughts, emotions and physical sensations of the present moment. Participants were better able to allow their feelings and thoughts. However, some participants found it difficult to be confronted with their own negative emotions or thoughts, or those of their partners.</p></sec><sec id="section30-0269216315572720"><title>Insight in feelings</title><p>In a substantial number of participants, this increased awareness resulted in a greater insight in their thoughts, emotions and physical sensations. They started to recognize how they were related to one another and also how they tended to react to them. They began to become more aware of patterns in their behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="section31-0269216315572720"><title>Letting go</title><p>Some reactions started to change by letting go of thoughts and feelings rather than remaining stuck in them. By directing their attention to the present moment, they were better able to let go of worries about the future or sad ruminations about the past.</p><p>Some participants, however, were so caught up in their thoughts and feelings that it was difficult to let go. One patient blamed herself for having lung cancer and was angry with herself because of smoking cigarettes when she was younger. One partner was so focussed on the symptoms of her husband that she could not stop worrying about them.</p></sec><sec id="section32-0269216315572720"><title>Changing behaviour</title><p>With the newly gained insight into their habitual patterns, some participants were able to change their behaviour. Several started to make choices and set priorities which were more in line with their values. Patients and partners started to take better care of themselves. Another patient started to communicate more openly about the cancer with his wife and children.</p><p>A few participants could not change their behaviour. One patient explained how she could and would not change her behaviour, because she felt too old to change.</p></sec><sec id="section33-0269216315572720"><title>Acceptance</title><p>By letting go of their worrying thoughts and feelings, and changing their behaviour, some patients started to get to terms with the fact that they were ill and that their physical condition was worsening.</p><p>Other participants, however, were not able or did not want to accept their situation. They became frustrated every time they felt sick or ignored their symptoms.</p><p>In the evaluation of the training, patients and partners were positive about the increased awareness of the body, thoughts and feelings without judging. &#x02018;Now I realize I am not the lung cancer disease itself, but the same woman now having a serious disease&#x02019;. Some patients mentioned relief during a panic attack: &#x02018;I discovered nothing serious happened and the feelings of anxiety diminished spontaneously&#x02019;. Others mentioned more possibilities to become calm and take time for themselves.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section34-0269216315572720"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study showed that participating in MBSR was feasible for lung cancer patients and partners, despite the anti-cancer treatment and the advanced disease. The majority completed the MBSR, which is similar to a mean drop-out of 23% in former studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Although no differences were found in psychological distress in patients and partners, the pressure of informal care experienced in partners decreased significantly after the MBSR. The qualitative analysis showed that the training seemed to instigate a process of change in patients and partners, in which they became more aware of and gained more insight into their thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations. This might be helpful in coping with this fatal disease.</p><p>A limitation of the study was the small sample size, which limits the power of the analyses. This means that the chance of a type II error occurring is heightened and the estimates of effect size are less reliable. Moreover, as a consequence of the small sample size, in the qualitative analysis, data saturation was not reached. Despite the small group of participants, the sample seemed to be representative of the global lung cancer population according to global cancer statistics, because the majority of patients were male and in the palliative stage of the disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup></p><p>This study also had a number of strengths. Only a few studies have examined the feasibility and effectiveness of psychosocial interventions in lung cancer patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Moreover, this is the first study also including partners of lung cancer patients in a psychosocial intervention study. This is quite surprising regarding the high rates of distress reported by both lung cancer patients and their partners.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="bibr8-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr9-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr10-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The few studies that did examine psychosocial interventions in lung cancer patients are promising. Temel et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> showed that early palliative care with a focus on psychosocial aspects can lead to improvement of quality of life and even life expectancy. Besides, the only study that examined the effectiveness of MBSR in both cancer patients and their partners showed that partners also benefit from participation.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup></p><p>Additionally, we went beyond existing research by using both quantitative and qualitative methods to assess feasibility and effectiveness of MBSR in lung cancer patients and their partners.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> By adding the qualitative research to the quantitative data, insight was gained into the facilitators and barriers of participation, which helped us adapt the MBSR training for future use in a randomized controlled trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> For instance, additional attention is paid to physical limitations of patients during the gentle yoga exercises. Furthermore, at the start of the training, the trainer explicitly addresses the possibility of experiencing barriers (e.g. tendency of partners to worry about the patient and experiencing the stories of other participants as burdensome), which enables participants to become aware of these barriers and they are able to cope with them in an adaptive way. For the majority of the participants in our study, participating with the partner and a peer group functioned as facilitators of the training. These findings are in line with former research in breast cancer patients, describing the importance of peer support in MBSR.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Therefore, we consider MBSR to be offered to both lung cancer patients and partners in a peer group setting.</p><p>This study shows the importance of studying lung cancer patients in psychosocial interventions. The majority of studies on mindfulness-based interventions have been conducted in female patients with breast cancer in the curative stage of the disease.<sup><xref rid="bibr16-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Although lung cancer patients are difficult to study due to a poor prognosis and anti-cancer treatment, there is a need for tailored interventions.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> Moreover, our study also emphasizes the significance of including partners in psychosocial interventions for lung cancer. Not only because they often fulfil the role of family caregiver but also because they are exposed to the stressors of the lung cancer diagnosis, which can have a major impact on their physical and psychological well-being.</p><p>By showing that MBSR is a feasible intervention for lung cancer patients and partners, future research should set up a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of MBSR in lung cancer patients and their partners.<sup><xref rid="bibr33-0269216315572720" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Based on the process of change we identified, it may very well be that an MBSR training could not only reduce psychological distress but it can also support acknowledgement and acceptance of the disease and forthcoming death. It may even benefit the sharing between partners and the process of (anticipated) grief.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Dr F Warmenhoven and J Mutsaerts for assistance in the MBSR and J Vercoulen, PhD, for assistance with the materials and methods.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-0269216315572720"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
