The current Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines describe the level of asthma symptom control as well-controlled, partly controlled and uncontrolled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The Gaining Optimal Asthma controL (GOAL) study was the first large study to examine whether guideline-defined asthma control can be achieved in patients who were uncontrolled on either short-acting &#x003b2;2-agonist (SABA) alone or low- to medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. GOAL was a 1-year, randomised, multinational trial which included 3,421 patients from 44 countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The study evaluated fluticasone propionate (FP) in combination with salmeterol (SAL) (FP/SAL) compared with FP alone, and demonstrated that guideline-defined asthma control could be achieved in the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The large size and multinational nature of GOAL allows for analysis of population subgroups, for example, by ethnicity. The relatively few clinical trials evaluating asthma control in Asian patients have demonstrated that effective control can be achieved with usual therapies of ICS alone or a combination of ICS/long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonist (LABA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, two large, population-based surveys in Asia have shown that good asthma control is not always achieved in this geographic area, despite the availability of effective treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In the Asthma Insights and Reality in Asia-Pacific (AIRIAP) survey, a high proportion of patients had poorly-controlled asthma according to GINA criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Approximately half of patients surveyed had experienced daytime or night-time asthma symptoms over the past month, and a similar proportion had required emergency care over the past year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The REcognise Asthma and LInk to Symptoms and Experience (REALISE) Asia study reported uncontrolled asthma in half the patients surveyed and only partial control in a further one-third [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Two out of three patients missed work because of asthma, and even patients reported as having controlled asthma had experienced acute exacerbations during the previous year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The underlying reasons for poor control in patients with asthma are unknown. Several studies have demonstrated that lung function measures in Asian populations are lower than those in Caucasian populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. How this difference may impact on the level of asthma control that can be achieved with treatment in Asian patients is unknown. To help answer this question, we conducted a post hoc subgroup analysis of Asian patients in the GOAL study, using the composite asthma control criteria used in the original global population. The primary objective of this post hoc analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of FP/SAL compared with FP alone in achieving guideline-defined asthma control in Asian patients. Additionally, data from the non-Asian population are presented to provide a descriptive comparison with the results from the Asian population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a post hoc subgroup analysis of the randomised, double-blind, parallel-group GOAL study (GSK identifier: SAM40027). The design and methodology of the GOAL study have been published in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Patients were recruited between December 2000 and December 2001 and stratified according to their medication use in the 6 months prior to screening. Stratum 1 included patients who were ICS-na&#x000ef;ve, stratum 2 included patients who received low-dose ICS treatment (&#x02264;500 &#x003bc;g daily of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent), and stratum 3 included patients who received medium-dose ICS treatment (&#x0003e;500&#x02013;&#x02009;&#x02264;1000 &#x003bc;g daily of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent).</p><p>Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either FP/SAL or FP, stratified by baseline therapy. The starting doses (taken twice daily) were FP/SAL 100/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 100 &#x003bc;g (patients in stratum 1 and stratum 2) or FP/SAL 250/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 250 &#x003bc;g (patients in stratum 3). The study was divided into two phases. In Phase I, doses were &#x0201c;stepped-up&#x0201d; every 12 weeks until either Total Control (as defined by the GINA and National Institutes of Health [NIH] Guidelines at the time of the original study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1) was achieved or the maximum dose (FP/SAL 500/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 500 &#x003bc;g) was reached. Patients in stratum 1 and stratum 2 had up to three treatment steps (step 1: FP/SAL 100/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 100 &#x003bc;g; step 2: FP/SAL 250/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 250 &#x003bc;g; step 3: FP/SAL 500/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 500 &#x003bc;g) while patients in stratum 3 had up to two steps (step 1: FP/SAL 250/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 250 &#x003bc;g; step 2: FP/SAL 500/50 &#x003bc;g or FP 500 &#x003bc;g). In Phase II (reached either after achieving Total Control in Phase I or after 12 weeks on the maximum dose), patients remained on the dose that achieved Total Control or the maximum dose until the end of the 1-year double-blind study period. Patients who failed to achieve Total Control by the end of Phase II entered a 4-week, open-label phase during which they received oral prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg up to 60 mg per day for 10 days) and FP/SAL 500/50 &#x003bc;g twice daily.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study population</title><p>Only patients who did not demonstrate Well-Controlled asthma for at least 2 weeks of the 4-week run-in period were eligible for inclusion in GOAL (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1). For this post hoc subgroup analysis, the Asian population was defined as patients of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Malay or Filipino origin living in South East Asia (China, Japan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand) during the study. The non-Asian population included all patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population who were not in the Asian subgroup (full inclusion criteria of the GOAL study can be found in the Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint of the GOAL study and of this post hoc subgroup analysis was the proportion of patients achieving Well-Controlled asthma with FP/SAL compared with FP alone during Phase I. The proportion of patients achieving Total Control of asthma was also evaluated. Asthma control was defined according to composite measures based on the GINA/NIH criteria developed for the GOAL study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], as shown in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Table S1. Well-Controlled asthma and Total Control of asthma were achieved if the patient recorded 7 out of 8 consecutive assessment weeks with Well-Controlled asthma or Total Control of asthma, respectively. Additional endpoints included: the ICS dose at which Well-Controlled asthma and Total Control of asthma was achieved; the cumulative probabilities from analysis of time to achieve the first week of Well-Controlled asthma and Total Control of asthma; the maintenance of Well-Controlled asthma and Total Control of asthma status from Phase I until the end of Phase II; the stability of weekly control during Phase II; rate of exacerbations (requiring oral corticosteroids, hospitalisations or emergency visits); and morning predose clinic forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and asthma quality of life (QoL) as assessed using the Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].

The analysis of the ICS dose at which Well-Controlled asthma and Total Control of asthma was first achieved was performed using proportional odds logistic regression on dose with the same covariates. The effects of treatment on exacerbation rates were determined using Poisson regression with generalised estimating equations with the same covariates (treatment differences were expressed as the ratio of FP/SAL over FP, with treatment ratios greater than 1 in favour of FP/SAL). Time to achieve Well-Controlled asthma and Total Control of asthma was assessed using inverse Kaplan&#x02013;Meier plots with Log-Rank tests. The statistical analysis of mean change in clinic FEV<sub>1</sub> (L) was performed using analysis of covariance with covariates for baseline FEV<sub>1</sub>, sex, age and treatment group (treatment differences were expressed as a difference of FP/SAL from placebo in FEV<sub>1</sub> [L], with positive treatment differences in favour of FP/SAL).</p><p>Analyses were completed using SAS 9.3 (Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 5,068 patients were screened and 3,421 qualified for inclusion in the primary study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].

More patients in the strata previously receiving a low or medium dose of ICS (stratum 2&#x02009;+&#x02009;stratum 3) achieved control with FP/SAL compared with FP alone, and did so more quickly and with a lower dose of ICS. For the stratum of patients who were uncontrolled on SABA-only treatment at study entry (stratum 1), there was no difference between the treatments for the primary endpoint of Well-Controlled asthma during the dose-escalation phase. However, there was an advantage for FP/SAL compared with FP alone for Total Control of asthma. This difference could be because Well-Controlled asthma is easier to achieve than Total Control, so treatment differences between FP and FP/SAL are more clearly visible when examining achievement of Total Control; however, the Asian population, although sizeable in this analysis, was too small to examine this observation further. Despite this, a high proportion of patients receiving SABA-only at entry did achieve control. This was accompanied by a noticeable improvement in lung function (0.22 L), as measured by FEV<sub>1</sub>, over the 52 weeks.</p><p>During the maintenance phase, additional patients in the Asian population achieved control for both study measures of control compared with the dose-escalation phase. Furthermore, control during the maintenance phase was relatively stable. This benefit of sustained treatment was larger for Total Control than for Well-Controlled asthma across all strata and may reflect additional time required to improve airway inflammation in patients with asthma. Sustained treatment has previously been shown to improve airway hyper-responsiveness over 3 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and it is established that airway hyper-responsiveness is associated with inflammatory markers, such as eosinophilia, in symptomatic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>As was observed in the total GOAL study population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], maintaining treatment also had a clear benefit on health status in both the Asian and non-Asian populations studied in this analysis. Insufficient patients in each stratum of the Asian population completed the AQLQ to allow a by-stratum analysis, therefore, the AQLQ data were analysed across in the entire dataset (244 Asian patients in total). The analysis showed that Asian patients experienced a substantial improvement in health status such that the AQLQ score approached or exceeded the value of 6, suggesting that asthma no longer had a significant impact on QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The incidence of exacerbations in the Asian patients was low and in keeping with the total study population as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There was a significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> for stratum 1 and stratum 3 (0.22 and 0.15 L, respectively), values very similar to those seen in the non-Asian population. The treatment difference for patients in stratum 2 was only 0.07 L.</p><p>The findings of the current analysis are in agreement with other studies exploring the efficacy of ICS/LABA combinations in improving asthma control in Asian patients. Although the multinational COSMOS study (1-year, randomised, parallel-group study investigating budesonide/formoterol vs FP/SAL) was conducted in a population that differed from the GOAL population (it included patients with a history of asthma exacerbations in the year prior to entry), a post hoc analysis of the COSMOS Asian population also demonstrated improved asthma control over a 1-year period with two ICS/LABA combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Compared with baseline, both combinations provided clinically relevant improvements in asthma control (assessed using the five-item version of the Asthma Control Questionnaire [ACQ]), QoL (assessed using the AQLQ) and FEV<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It should be noted, however, that the ACQ measured asthma control over a recall period of only 7 days, whereas control in the GOAL study was measured over 8-week periods. In another study, the efficacy of a different ICS/LABA combination (fluticasone furoate/vilanterol) was compared with that of FP alone in Asian patients in a 12-week, randomised trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This ICS/LABA combination provided significantly greater improvements in peak expiratory flow (PEF) compared with FP alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In a study in Korean patients treated with FP/SAL, the number of patients with Well-Controlled asthma, assessed by the AQLQ and the Asthma Control Test, increased from baseline and was accompanied by a clinically relevant improvement in QoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Although this is a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of patients from the original, much larger, population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], it is reassuring to see that existing and well-established treatments are as effective in Asian patients as in a wider group of patients at achieving and maintaining comprehensive control of asthma, and that this is accompanied by additional outcome benefits.</p><p>Safety findings from the present analysis were also similar with the findings from the other studies, with the most common AEs reported with ICS/LABA combinations or ICS alone being upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and nasopharyngitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A substantial difference was noted between Asian and non-Asian patients in the incidence of these AEs: ~30% of Asian patients experienced URTI compared with only 9% of non-Asian patients, whilst fewer Asian patients (8%) experienced nasopharyngitis than non-Asian patients (14%). Differences in patterns of antibiotic prescription in Asian and non-Asian countries may explain the difference in the incidence of URTI between the two populations, but could not account for the discrepancy in nasopharyngitis. An alternative explanation may simply be that different terms are used in the different countries included within the populations to describe the same symptoms.</p><p>This analysis suggests that, in Asian patients, baseline lung function may not be an accurate predictor of future asthma control. While asthma severity is related to FEV<sub>1</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and ethnic differences in lung function (including FEV<sub>1</sub>) have also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], it is unclear how these different factors are linked. Lung function also varies with gender and age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], and so further research into the factors determining severity and differences in baseline physiology in Asians compared with non-Asians is required.</p><p>Strengths of this study included the large number of Asian patients within the analyses and the use of the guideline-defined composite endpoints of asthma control. A number of limitations should be taken into account when considering these findings. This was a post hoc subgroup analysis and was not designed to analyse treatment differences in asthma control within and between the Asian and non-Asian populations. The Asian subgroup population was also much smaller (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;652) than the non-Asian subgroup population (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;2,764), and, therefore, within and between subgroup comparisons must be interpreted with caution. This difference in sample size may have impacted some of the results. For example, in Asian patients who were ICS-na&#x000ef;ve at baseline, there was no difference between FP/SAL and FP alone with regard to the proportion achieving Well-Controlled asthma, but a benefit of FP/SAL over FP alone was observed in this group for Total Control of asthma. In the corresponding group of non-Asian patients, a benefit for FP/SAL was seen for both endpoints. Patient numbers were too small to enable analyses by stratum for some outcomes (i.e. AQLQ); only pooled data were presented for these parameters. Although this Asian subgroup is one of the largest populations studied with regard to a composite score of asthma control, it was not large enough to conduct a by-stratum analysis of exacerbations, an important outcome for patients with asthma. Finally, the Asian patient population included in this analysis was heterogeneous as it included patients from several countries. This may limit generalisability to more homogeneous, single country populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of the GOAL study in Asian patients reflected those seen in the overall population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In addition, the present analysis demonstrated similar trends in Asian compared with non-Asian patients. The post hoc subgroup analyses showed that guideline-defined asthma control, measured by a composite of clinically relevant endpoints, can be achieved and maintained with the combination of FP/SAL in a substantial proportion of Asian patients. Overall, FP/SAL was more effective at a lower dose of ICS than FP alone in achieving control and achieved control more quickly than FP alone.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
