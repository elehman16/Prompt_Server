Mixed dyslipidemia is typically linked with an increase of small, dense LDL particles, and an elevated apolipoprotein B. All these changes predispose to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Mixed dyslipidemia is the most frequent lipid disorder found in patients with type 2 diabetes.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Initial treatment options for mixed dyslipidemia include lifestyle modification and statin therapy. Nevertheless, statin monotherapy is often insufficient to normalize multiple lipid parameters.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The HDL-C and TG levels are strong predictor of cardiovascular risk even in patients treated with a statin and has achieved an optimum LDL-C levels.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The addition of fibrates to statin therapy offers the prospective for overall lipid control in patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Several results of short-term studies in various patient populations support this hypothesis.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Fenofibrate, which belongs to the class of fibrates, has a comparatively low potential for pharmacokinetic interaction as well as lower rates of rhabdomyolysis with statins when compared to gemfibrozil.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Choline fenofibrate is a newly developed choline salt of fenofibric acid and is more hydrophilic than fenofibrate. It does not require first pass hepatic metabolism to become active, as it dissociates to free fenofibric acid within the gastrointestinal tract and rapidly absorbed throughout the gastrointestinal tract.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Of the various fenofibrate formulations available, choline fenofibrate is the only formulation of fenofibrate which is approved by the US FDA for co-administration with statins.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, there is no Indian data available for efficacy and safety of choline fenofibrate in patients of mixed dyslipidemia. Hence, this study was planned to evaluate the efficacy and safety of choline fenofibrate in comparison to micronized fenofibrate among Indian patients of mixed dyslipidemia stabilized on statin therapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patients and study sites</title><p>Patients with mixed dyslipidemia of either gender, aged 18&#x02013;70 years having serum TG levels between 150 and 500 mg/dl who were prescribed statin in stable dose for the preceding 8 weeks were enrolled in the study.

The study was conducted according to the protocol and in accordance with the ethical guidelines by Indian Council of Medical Research.

Enrolled patients were provided allocated study medications for 3 months, and they were evaluated during the study period at the end of 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks for safety and efficacy evaluation. Lipid profile and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) were repeated at the end of 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. Laboratory investigations, performed at the time of screening were repeated at the end of the study.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Primary and secondary end points</title><p>The primary endpoint was percentage change in serum TG levels at the end of treatment (12 weeks) from baseline between two arms. The secondary efficacy endpoint was percentage change in serum HDL-C levels at the end of treatment from baseline. Change in other lipid parameters was also assessed. The following safety parameters were also evaluated: Any adverse events that were reported voluntarily observed and enquired during the study; any clinically significant change in the value of laboratory results, vital signs, and physical examination during the study compared to baseline.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Sample size determination and statistical methods</title><p>Considering the standard deviation of 78 with a power of 80%, approximately 100 patients per group were required to detect a difference of around 31.

Novel fenofibrate formulations were developed with different approaches to overcome the challenges with solubility.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Initially, micronized formulations that increased solubility by reducing particle size, and increasing surface area were introduced.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] A formulation of the active metabolite (fenofibric acid) with a choline salt form was developed resulting in a hydrophilic compound with the greatest bioavailability of the available formulations.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The results of our study indicated that there was a significant reduction in the serum TG levels observed with 12 weeks treatment of fenofibrate (34.24% in choline fenofibrate group vs. 38.13% in micronized fenofibrate group). There was also a significant increase in the serum HDL-C levels observed with 12 weeks treatment of fenofibrate (8.6% in choline fenofibrate group vs. 10.56% in micronized fenofibrate group). Results of our study were similar to the pooled subgroup analysis of three randomized controlled phase III clinical trials of choline fenofibrate was.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In the pooled analysis, the addition of fibrates to moderate dose of statin yielded approximately 43% reduction in serum TG levels and 16% increase in HDL-C levels over a period of 12 weeks.</p><p>For patients with type 2 diabetes, statin monotherapy is recommended to achieve their LDL-C goal. However, statin alone often does not normalize other lipid parameters in patients having mixed dyslipidemia. Recent retrospective analyses showed that in majority of patients with mixed dyslipidemia on statin monotherapy have suboptimal serum levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In type 2 diabetes patients with dyslipidemia, a considerable residual risk persists even after statin therapy. In patients not achieving the target goals for lipid parameters, one of the options is to increase statin dose, but increasing statin dose increases the risk of side effects like myopathy. In such group of patients with below normal HDL-C and TG levels, addition of fibrates has been shown to provide additional benefit.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Other lipid parameters were also improved with use of both the drugs in the patients. Serum total cholesterol and very LDL-C levels were also reduced with use of both the drugs during the study period. The result of our clinical study was comparable with previously reported results available in the literature.</p><p>Adverse effects involving skeletal muscle are associated with use of statins. Concomitant use of statins and fibrates is believed to further increase the incidence of myalgia and muscle damage.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] However, in our study concomitant use of fibrate with statin was found to be safe, and no increased incidence of muscle damage was reported. A meta-analysis which included six clinical trials and 1628 subjects reported no cases of myopathy or muscle damage but showed a significant increase in elevation of liver enzymes in statin-fibrate combination therapy when compared to statin monotherapy. The study concluded that statin-fibrate combination therapy was well tolerated.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>All the reported adverse events were mild in nature. No hepatotoxicity was reported in any of the patients treated. Except in a single case who complained of myalgia in micronized fenofibrate group, all others tolerated it very well. In none of the patients, clinically significant elevation of liver enzymes or CPK was observed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Overall, results of the current study concluded that 135 mg of choline fenofibrate is as safe and effective as 160 mg of micronized fenofibrate in Indian patients with mixed dyslipidemia.
