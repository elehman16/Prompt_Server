It was approved by hospital ethical review committee. The sample size included 56 eyes of 56 patients with advanced diabetic eye disease. Patients having either gender, aging between 45-65 years with non-resolving vitreous hemorrhage for three months even after treatment secondary to diabetes were included in the study however those with previous vitrectomy, any major surgery with in past 3 months, uncontrolled hypertension, known coagulation abnormalities &#x00026; current use of anticoagulant medications were excluded. Patients who met the benchmark for inclusion were selected through diabetic retina clinic, department of Ophthalmology, Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre. Informed and written consent for inclusion into study and about the procedure was taken. Data was entered in data sheets. Two groups of patients were made and after all aseptic measures Group-A patients were given intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg in 0.05 ml Avastin (Bevacizumab) 3.5 mm from the limbus seven days before surgery in the operation theatre. After seven days these patients underwent 23 gauge 3 ports pars plana vitrectomy by experienced surgeon using the Dorc Associate vitrectomy machine. Group-B patients underwent 23 gauge 3 ports pars plana vitrectomy without preoperative intravitreal injection of Avastin using Dorc Associate vitrectomy machine. The same experienced ophthalmic surgeon performed all the surgeries. The amount of intraoperative bleeding was monitored by researcher and was graded as no, mild or severe. No bleeding, if no intraoperative bleeding occurred during surgery, mild if bleeding was stopped by increasing the infusion pressure and severe, if endodiathermy was required to stop the bleeding. Comparison was done between Groups A and B regarding the amount of intraoperative bleeding. No to mild bleeding was taken as success. Data was collected in specially designed data sheets. Since the study was conducted by Government run hospital so the funding was borne by government.</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed with computer software package SPSS version 17. Clinical characteristics were summarized in terms of frequency / percentage for qualitative variables i.e. gender, type of diabetes, intraoperative bleeding, retinal tear and success (intraoperative no bleeding/mild bleeding) rate, whereas mean &#x000b1; S.D for quantitative variables i.e. age, duration of disease, surgical time. Statistical comparison in between study groups were performed by using Chi-square/fisher exact test (for qualitative variables) and Students t-test (for quantitative variables). The level of significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Fifty six patients were inducted into the study, 28 patients in each Groups A and B. Patients in Group-A received intravitreal injection of Avastin (Bevacizumab) seven days before vitrectomy surgery; patients in Group-B underwent vitrectomy surgery without intravitreal injection of Avastin (Bevacizumab).

In this study intraoperative Avastin (Bevacizumab) was injected in an effort to quiet down the fibrovascular proliferation before vitrectomy making surgery easier. In this study, there was marked reduction of intraoperative bleeding in Group-A which was reflected in minimal need to use the endodiathermy.</p><p>In our study mean age in Group-A was 58.1 years (range 47-65) and in Group-B it was 57.2 years (range 47-65). The maximum numbers of patients were in their fifth decade. However, in a similar study conducted by Rizzo et al, ages of the 22 patients ranged from 24 to 63 mean age 52 years<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In another study conducted by El-Batarny, the mean ages of the patients were 46 with a range of 24-65 and 44 with a range of 23-57 in Groups 1 and 2 respectively.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Yeoh et al., in a study reported mean age of 46 years with a range of 28-61 years.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The similar studies on diabetic patients showed slight variation in the age groups affected in different geographical settings. Since our study was done in a government hospital, larger numbers of our patients were from poor financial background.</p><p>The mean duration of diabetes in our study was 6.4 years in Group-A and 7.4 years in Group-B. Mean duration in a study conducted by Avery et al., was 15 years<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> longer the duration of diabetes, the higher the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy and later on advanced diabetic eye disease. In third world countries like Pakistan shorter duration of diabetes is associated with advanced diabetic eye disease, this may be attributed to multiple reasons like poor literacy rate, patients go to the doctors late due to poor financial conditions, poor compliances with medicines and inappropriate dietary habits. All above mentioned factors lead to rapid progression of diabetic retinopathy.</p><p>In severe cases of diabetic retinopathy like advanced diabetic eye disease with thick and multiple layers of proliferative tissues, repeated bleeding from multiple sites may make the operation lengthy and tedious. Also extensive cautery may incite postoperative inflammation. Prolonged elevation of intraocular pressure to stop bleeding may cause corneal edema impairing surgical visualization. Therefore, any agent that can induce regression of neovascularization like intravitreal anti VEGF few days prior to surgery may lead to decrease intraoperative bleeding, facilitate vitrectomy surgery and fibrovascular membrane peeling and reduce the time of surgery. Some studies have reported that it also reduces the incidence of post-operative vitreous hemorrhage.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>-<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>In our study the intraoperative reduction in bleeding was statistically significant between two groups. In Group-A that received Avastin before vitrectomy no bleeding was observed in 60.7%, mild was observed in 21.4% and severe requiring diathermy to stop bleeding in only 17.9% of cases. In Group-B that underwent surgery without Avastin no bleeding was observed in only 7.1% and severe in 71.4%. In a similar study conducted by Rizzo et al., in a Group that received Avastin no bleeding was observed in 54% of cases, mild in 27% and severe in 18% and in a group that didn't receive Avastin no bleeding was observed in 18% only and severe in 81.8%.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In another study conducted by El-Batarny, 15 patients were placed in each group. In non Avastin group severe bleeding requiring diathermy to stop bleeding was encountered in nearly all 15 cases whereas, in a group with preoperative Avastin no bleeding was seen in 13.3%, mild was encountered in 60% and severe bleeding was observed in only 26.6%.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a study conducted in India by Nagpal M et al., no bleeding was observed in 56.6% of cases, mild and severe was encountered in 21.8% each in a group of patients with preoperative Avastin whereas, no bleeding was observed in only 18%, mild in 27% and severe requiring diathermy was encountered in almost 55% of cases.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p><p>Reduction in surgical time was obvious between two groups. In our study mean surgical time in Group-A with preoperative Avastin was 64 minutesS.D&#x000b1;10.35 and in Group-B that is without preoperative Avastin it was 80.5 minutes S.D&#x000b1;10.22 minutes. In a similar study by Rizzo et al., reduction in surgical time in Avastin Group-was also significant. Mean surgical time in Avastin group was 57 minutes and in non Avastin group it was 83 minutes.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Mean surgical time in another study conducted by El-Batarny in non Avastin group was 93.3 S.D&#x000b1;11.6 minutes and in preoperative Avastin group it was 61.6S.D&#x000b1;14.5 minutes.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Reduction in surgical time is due to lesser bleeding in group with preoperative Avastin. In our study Group-A patient required less number of total diathermy applications and also there was minimal blurring of the surgeon's operating field suggesting facilitation of the surgery, on the other hand, higher range of diathermy applications in Group-B suggests greater intraocular bleeding making the surgery difficult and time consuming. Moreover the shorter duration of surgery decreased the probability of intraoperative damage.</p><p>Greater bleeding during surgery obscures the operating field of the surgeon leading to higher incidence of iatrogenic tears in retina of the patients. In our study incidence of iatrogenic tears during surgery in Group-A with preoperative Avastin was 7.1% and in Group-B it was 18.6%. In a study by Rizzo et al, there was on intraoperative retinal tear in a group with Avastin out of 11 cases and in other group without preoperative Avastin incidence of retinal tears were 36.3%.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In a similar study done by El-Batarny intraoperative retinal tears were reported in 40% in Group-1 without Avastin and in 20% in Group-2 with Avastin given preoperatively.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>This study provides objective proof that the intravitreal injection of Avastin (bevacizumab) before vitrectomy for vitreous hemorrhage and tractional retinal detachment facilitates the surgery by reducing the surgical time, decrease the intraoperative bleeding and need for hemoststic measures and reduces the incidence of iatrogenic retinal tears. Therefore, we recommend intravitreal injection of Avastin especially before vitrectomies in diabetic patients having vitreous hemorrhage and/or tractional retinal detachment.</p><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Author`s Contribution</title><p><bold>SMF:</bold> Conceived the study and managed acquisition of data and gave intravitreal injections.</p><p><bold>MAT:</bold> Drafting the article and critical review.</p><p><bold>AC:</bold> Supervised the study and performed surgeries.</p><p><bold>MIA:</bold> Contributed in literature search, analysis and interpretation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold><italic>Grants and Financial disclosures</italic>:</bold> None.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Buch</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Vinding</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Cour</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Appleyard</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>GB</given-names></name><name><surname>Nielsen</surname><given-names>NV</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence and Causes of Visual Impairment and Blindness among 9980 Scandinavian Adults: The Copenhagen City Eye Study</article-title><source>Ophthalmology</source><year>2003</year><volume>111</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>53</fpage><lpage>61</lpage><comment>doi:10.1016/j.ophtha.2003.05.010</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mahar</surname><given-names>PS</given-names></name><name><surname>Awan</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Manzar</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Memon</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of type-2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy: the Gaddap study</article-title><source>J Coll Physicians Surg Pak</source><year>2010</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>528</fpage><lpage>532</lpage><comment>doi:08.2010/JCPSP.528532</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20688018</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Shaikh</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaikh</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Shaikh</surname><given-names>ZA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmed</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Prevalence of Diabetic Retinopathy and influence factors among newly diagnosed Diabetics in Rural and Urban Areas of Pakistan: Data analysis from the Pakistan National Blindness &#x00026;
