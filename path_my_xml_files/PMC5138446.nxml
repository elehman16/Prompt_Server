Women were more influenced by advertisements that emphasized the health effects of smoking. We also found that appearing at the top right of the page (HR 2.1, SE 0.07) or at the bottom rather than the top of a list (HR 1.1, SE 0.02) can improve smoking cessation advertisements&#x02019; effectiveness in prompting future searches related to smoking cessation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Advertising should be targeted to different demographic groups in ways that are not always intuitive.

For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#x02019;s Tips From Former Smokers campaign, which ran in 2013, cost roughly US $48 million [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, it is difficult to know which advertisements are effective and which are not. Research into the effectiveness of advertisements often relies on weaker scientific evaluation methods, such as before-and-after designs [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] or designs that measure very long-term population-level effects.</p><p>As public health advertisements move onto the Web, however, it has become possible to conduct randomized controlled trials (RCTs)&#x02014;the gold standard in research design&#x02014;of smoking advertisement content and characteristics. This can be done by exposing users to advertisements, and then following these users on the Web to measure the influence of these advertisements on the users&#x02019; health risk behaviors as observed in their searches [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For example, investigators can measure subsequent searches, key words used in online posts or emails, shopping behavior [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], or exercise behavior (eg, as measured by global positioning systems), providing a robust picture of the outcomes associated with Web-based advertisements. This can be done quickly and at a fraction of the cost of a real-world trial.</p><p>The private sector has long used such inexpensive experiments to test products [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. For instance, Google and Microsoft often test the impact of website design or user interfaces by randomly exposing participants to different design concepts and then observing participants&#x02019; responses. For example, the <italic>New York Times</italic> tested the effects of various font types on readers&#x02019; perceptions of the validity of the same block of text by randomly changing the font and then surveying the readers about their perceptions of the text [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Likewise, researchers have experimentally manipulated the number of positive or negative posts that users saw on Facebook, and then examined the emotional content of users&#x02019; subsequent posts [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Search engine queries are known to reflect real-world behaviors [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. As such, researchers have used search engine queries to infer behaviors in the real world, both health related and otherwise [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and their effect on future health outcomes. The use of Web-based advertising to measure health outcomes was pioneered by Eysenbach [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Web-based advertisements have also been used to measure sentiment to behaviors on the Internet [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and to increase consumer demand for smoking cessation interventions [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the use of Web-based advertising to induce a behavioral change and its measure through search engine queries has not, to our knowledge, been attempted thus far.</p><p>In theory, a mix of Web-based advertisements can be developed and targeted to specific populations. Users can then be randomly shown advertisements within this mix to determine whether they had the intended effect on the intended audience. Using these data, it should be possible to continuously refine advertisements such that they can have ever-increasing effectiveness in changing individual behavior.</p><p>Therefore, the goal of this study was to take the first step toward proving this concept by developing a methodology for testing Web-based advertisements to promote smoking cessation. We conducted an RCT showing how 10 advertisements developed by a public health practitioner could influence the likelihood that Internet search engine users would subsequently conduct searches related to smoking cessation. We then asked whether some advertisements are more effective than others, and explored variation by demographic group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>We conducted an RCT using the Bing Ads system (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) to randomly display 10 different advertisements, and then followed exposed or unexposed participants to explore whether they were more likely to subsequently search for ways to quit smoking. The control intervention was &#x0201c;usual care,&#x0201d; meaning users were served whatever advertisements the Bing Ads system would have otherwise served.</p><p>We asked a public health professional to design textual advertisements. These advertisements conformed to basic public health communications campaign theory. They were designed without the assistance of an advertising firm to better reflect real-life public health advertisements, which are usually not designed with such expertise. We then categorized the advertisements into 1 or more of 3 categories according to whether the text (1) empowered participants to quit (&#x0201c;empowering&#x0201d;), (2) suggested ways to quit (&#x0201c;helping&#x0201d;), or (3) discussed the effects of smoking on one&#x02019;s health (&#x0201c;effects&#x0201d;). We then linked these advertisements to the most commonly visited smoking cessation websites (as determined by Microsoft&#x02019;s search engine, Bing). These antismoking sites were operated by a government body, a nongovernmental organization, or a private entity, and thus were chosen because of the perceived difference in authority of each organization type.</p></sec><sec><title>Advertisements</title><p>The advertisements contained text and took the form of a title, a body, and a link to a URL (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We used a full factorial design such that we tested all combinations of title/body and URL. The advertisements were only shown to people who searched from computers located in the United States, and who performed searches on the Bing search engine (Microsoft Corporation). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> shows a sample advertisement. We note that the market share of Bing in the United States is around 19%, according to recent estimates [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The correlation between the number of Bing users per county in the United States and the number of people in that county according to the 2010 US Census is <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>=.83 (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;.001). Thus, it is estimated that Bing users are a representative sample of the US population.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Smoking cessation advertisement title and subtitle text and classification.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="635" cellpadding="7" cellspacing="0" border="1"><col width="182" span="1"/><col width="315" span="1"/><col width="95" span="1"/><thead><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Title</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subtitle text</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Classification</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr valign="top"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Stop It!</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Smoking lowers quality of life and causes illness and death.

These specific terms were identified by finding the 10 most common queries submitted during November 2014 to the Bing search engine that contained the phrase &#x0201c;from smoking.&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box1">Textbox 1</xref> shows the list of terms.</p><p>The advertisements were randomly shown either directly underneath the search text (&#x0201c;top of the page&#x0201d;) or to the right of the search results (&#x0201c;right of the page&#x0201d;). The advertising system sometimes presented our advertisements in addition to other advertisements paid for by sponsors. In those cases, a placement at &#x0201c;location 1&#x0201d; meant that the advertisement was shown as the first advertisement in the list, and lower locations implied a lower order within the set of advertisements shown.</p><p>The Bing Ads system chose which of the 10 advertisements to show randomly using a random number generator. Each of the 10 advertisements had the same probability of being displayed. While it is likely that most users saw the advertisements, only some users actually clicked on it. Upon clicking, they were led to antismoking sites that we had preselected from government websites, nongovernmental organization websites, or commercial websites. We selected these websites according to their search rankings. Importantly, the sites did not contain detailed smoking cessation information. Therefore, we used future searches to test the effect of the advertisements on seeking cessation information, as detailed below.</p><p>The advertisements were shown between June 10, 2015 and September 10, 2015.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>We extracted all searches conducted on Bing by people who were shown 1 or more of the advertisements we presented from 1 month before the beginning of the advertisement campaign (ie, May 10, 2015) and until 1 month after its completion (October 10, 2015). This was done to obtain a sense of the baseline number of searches and the advertisement types that these searches generated. This way, we could more easily detect a media event (eg, a celebrity death attributable to smoking) in the middle of a campaign and account for variations from baseline that could have occurred as a result.</p><p>Searches comprised the text of searches, date and time, and an anonymous user identifier. Where users had a Microsoft account and were signed in, their age and gender, as well as the zip code location of users, were also recorded.</p><p>We categorized searches according to their text into a 3-level scale: we assigned a score of 0 to searches that only mentioned &#x0201c;smoking&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;cigarettes,&#x0201d; without additional context. We gave a score of 1 to searches that mentioned symptoms associated with smoking, such as &#x0201c;wrinkles from smoking.&#x0201d; We gave searches a score of 2 if they mentioned specific diseases associated with smoking, such as &#x0201c;cancer from smoking.&#x0201d; We refer to this scale as the query damage scale.</p><p>Our primary outcome of interest was whether the user conducted at least one query, filtered to include only those queries indicative of an intention to quit smoking search (IQSS). Such queries were those that included 1 or more of the following terms: (1) direct reference: quit, cessation, stop smoking, smoking withdrawal; (2) smoking cessation medications: nicotine, bupropion, carenicline, Chantix, Buproban, Aplenzin, Wellbutrin, Budeprion, Zyban, clonidine, Catapres, Kapvay, Nexiclon, Clophelin, Nicoderm, Nicorette; (3) electronic cigarettes: e-cigarettes, electronic cigarette, vaporizer, vape, smokeless, vapor; and (4) support: support group, Smokefree, smoke free, American Cancer Society, American Lung Association.</p><p>We constructed a Cox proportional hazards model to assess the relation between the likelihood of conducting subsequent IQSS and the independent attributes shown in <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="box2">Textbox 2</xref>.</p><boxed-text id="box2" position="float"><caption><title>Independent attributes.</title></caption><p>1.

Additionally, advertisements placed below those that did not have smoking cessation content were more effective than those placed at the top of a list (HR 1.13, SE 0.020 relative to the bottom of a list). Participants were only 1% more likely to subsequently conduct IQSS for each time that they were exposed to an advertisement (HR 1.01, SE 0.001).

To do this, we built a linear regression model with interactions, estimating its performance as measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using 5-fold cross-validation [<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].

Our results show that men were more likely to subsequently conduct smoking cessation searches when exposed to advertisements containing empowering content, but women were more influenced by advertisements that emphasized the health effects of smoking. We also found that women and older people were generally more likely to be influenced by antismoking advertisements, and that placement of smoking cessation advertisements in the middle of a list of unrelated advertisements can improve their effectiveness in prompting future searches related to smoking cessation.</p><p>Thus, our results indicate a good deal of variation in the likelihood of future smoking cessation searches that is explained by the characteristics of the advertisements, the characteristics of the participants, and the type of entity that produced the website. Foremost, we found that smoking cessation advertisements that empowered individuals to quit were more effective among men, whereas those that suggested ways to quit were more effective among women. Further, we found that the landing page had implications for users&#x02019; likelihoods of subsequent smoking cessation searches.</p><p>Overall, our findings suggest that targeting Web-based advertising may improve the effectiveness of those advertisements. Therefore, it is possible that relatively simple alterations in ad-serving algorithms can improve public health. Likewise, the landing page can also differ depending on the characteristics of the user. Based on our results, we would want to rely more on government websites as landing pages when the searcher is young, for instance. That women are more susceptible to Web-based advertisements (irrespective of their placement or content) is encouraging, as this is the group for which mortality has been on an unprecedented rise due to smoking [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>There were some important limitations to this work. Mainly, our study was limited by a lack of comprehensive data. First, it is unclear that subsequent searches actually translated into changes in smoking behavior&#x02014;and without such data, our understanding of the health consequences of advertising is limited. Second, our demographic targeting was less specific than we would have liked. In the ideal, it would be possible to use information stored on users&#x02019; computers to devise Bayesian prediction algorithms. Such algorithms can be used to devise typologies for individual users (not just age and gender), and then to design much more targeted advertisements for such users.</p><p>However, there remains a clear challenge in understanding the influence of Web-based advertising on public health. Although private corporations conduct tens of thousands of such experiments each year, academics are required to obtain the consent of all participants in human subjects research. Even with informed consent, the privacy challenges associated with working with potentially identifiable data are daunting. For these reasons, academics who would be naturally positioned to better understand the public health consequences of Web-based advertising targeting cannot directly engage in such research. In this way, institutional review standards that have not pivoted to accommodate the volume and availability of data in the Internet age limit the role of those trained and experienced in public health research.</p><p>Our findings&#x02014;that the characteristics of the advertisement&#x02019;s content, the placement of the advertisements, and the entity producing the advertisement should vary by the demographic characteristics of the searcher&#x02014;are an important first step in demonstrating the power of Web-based advertising. Future research should seek to refine advertisements based on demographic data, as well as to improve their design and delivery with the support of advertising professionals. Ultimately, this work has the potential to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of public health advertising to promote healthy behavior and mitigate chronic disease.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>All funding for this research was provided by Microsoft Research.
