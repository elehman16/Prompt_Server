Teriflunomide patients continued their assigned dose, and placebo patients were re-allocated to teriflunomide, 7 mg/day or 14 mg/day.

Of 147 patients, 62 (42.2%) discontinued (19% due to treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)). The most common TEAEs were mild infections, fatigue, sensory disturbances and diarrhoea. No serious opportunistic infections occurred, with no discontinuations due to infection. Asymptomatic alanine aminotransferase increases (&#x02264;3&#x000d7; upper limit of normal (ULN)) were common (7 mg, 64.2%; 14 mg, 62.1%); increases &#x0003e;3&#x000d7;ULN were similar across groups (7 mg, 12.3%; 14 mg, 12.1%). Mild decreases in neutrophil counts occurred; none led to discontinuation. The incidence of malignancies was comparable to that of the general population, and cases were not reminiscent of those observed in immunocompromised patients. Annualised relapse rates remained low, minimal disability progression was observed, with a dose-dependent benefit with teriflunomide 14 mg for several MRI parameters.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1352458512436594"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Teriflunomide had a favourable safety profile for up to 8.5 years.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>teriflunomide</kwd><kwd>oral therapy</kwd><kwd>long-term treatment</kwd><kwd>clinical trials</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="section5-1352458512436594"><title>Introduction</title><p>Teriflunomide is a novel oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) being investigated for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr1-1352458512436594">1</xref></sup> Teriflunomide selectively and reversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, required for de novo pyrimidine synthesis.

Analyses of ARR, the proportion of relapse-free patients and the time to first relapse were performed from the beginning of the extension. An increase in disability was defined as an increase in EDSS score of &#x02265;1.0 in patients with a baseline EDSS score of &#x02264;5.5 or an increase in EDSS score of &#x02265;0.5 in patients with a baseline score of &#x02265;5.5. MRI scans were performed every 48 weeks from the beginning of the extension and sent to the central reading centre (the MS/MRI Research Group at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) for analysis. MRI scans were analysed for T2 lesion volume (or burden of disease (BOD), mm<sup>3</sup>) and cerebral volume as the predefined study endpoints. Cerebral volume was assessed using the brain parenchymal ratio (derived by subtracting the cerebrospinal fluid volume from the intradural volume and normalising to the whole intradural volume). Analyses of new and newly enlarging T2 lesions, gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing T1 lesions and newly active lesions (sum of Gd-enhancing T1 and non-enhancing new and newly enlarging T2 lesions to avoid double counting active lesions) were also performed. Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQoL-54) and Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) instruments were performed every 24 weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section14-1352458512436594"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Results are based on an interim analysis with an arbitrary cut-off of January 8 2010.

Therefore, underlying disease conditions and concomitant medications may have been contributory.</p></sec><sec id="section20-1352458512436594"><title>Number of TEAE episodes per patient</title><p>The number of episodes of any TEAE reported per patient over the study period was similar in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512436594">Table 2</xref>). Generally, for each individual TEAE, the number of episodes per patient was low and similar across teriflunomide groups (&#x02264;2.5 per patient). One exception was the number of episodes relating to infection (6.0 and 7.5 per patient for the 7-mg and 14-mg groups, respectively). Infections that occurred &#x02265;2.5 times per patient included: nasopharyngitis, cystitis, urinary tract infection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512436594">Table 2</xref>) and oral herpes; there was a higher frequency per patient of oral herpes in the 14-mg group (2.8) than the 7-mg group (1.0). Other TEAEs that occurred &#x02265;2.5 times per patient included: fall (1.4 and 2.7, for the 7-mg and 14-mg groups, respectively), muscular weakness (2.6 and 2.2), pain in extremity (2.2 and 2.5) and dizziness (2.0 and 2.5) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512436594">Table 2</xref>). A small number of TEAEs occurred &#x02265;3.0 times per patient during the study, including headache (3.6 and 2.5, for the 7-mg and 14-mg groups, respectively), migraine (2.2 and 3.7), neutrophil count decrease (3.0 and 1.7) and white blood cell count decrease (5.0 and 1.6); all except migraine occurred less frequently in the 14-mg group.</p><p>The number of episodes of all types of SAE was low (&#x02264;1.5 per patient) and similar across both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512436594">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section21-1352458512436594"><title>Infections</title><p>Infections were mainly of upper respiratory tract origin, including nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection.

The incidence of ALT increase &#x0003e;3&#x000d7;ULN was 12.3% and 12.1%, for 7 mg and 14 mg, respectively. The maximum ALT increase was &#x0003c;10&#x000d7;ULN. For those patients with significant increases, normalisation occurred for most cases within 2 months of treatment discontinuation. None of the ALT increases were symptomatic and no ALT &#x0003e;3&#x000d7;ULN was associated with total bilirubin &#x0003e;2&#x000d7;ULN. ALT &#x0003e;2&#x000d7;ULN could be reported as an AE by the investigator, resulting in a high frequency of TEAEs related to increased ALT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512436594">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section23-1352458512436594"><title>Gastrointestinal disorders</title><p>A higher proportion of patients reported diarrhoea in the 14-mg group compared with 7-mg group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-1352458512436594">Table 2</xref>). However, nausea, which was also commonly reported but was not associated with vomiting in the majority of cases, did not appear to have a dose-dependent effect. None of these TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation.</p><p>The proportion of patients with TEAEs potentially related to pancreatic disorders was 7.4% and 13.6% in the 7-mg and 14-mg groups, respectively.

Most TEAEs reported were mild to moderate, with only isolated cases of SAEs. TEAEs observed during this long-term study were similar in nature to those reported in the shorter-term teriflunomide phase 2 and phase 3 (TEMSO) placebo-controlled clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512436594">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512436594">10</xref></sup></p><p>No serious opportunistic infections or hypersensitivity reactions were reported and there were only isolated reports of WBC decreases, none of which led to treatment discontinuation.</p><p>The incidence rate of malignancies in the study population, which comprised mostly Canadian patients, was within the range expected for the Canadian population at large.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr12-1352458512436594">12</xref></sup> The cases reported were not organ-specific, there was no apparent dose-effect, and a variety of different types of cancers were reported, with no pattern reminiscent of that observed in immunocompromised patients or in patients with Epstein-Barr virus-related lymphomas, human herpesvirus-8-related Kaposi&#x02019;s sarcoma, HPV-related ano-genital cancers, or Merkel cell polyomavirus-related cancers. Furthermore, there were no haematological, lymphoproliferative, liver cancers, or lymphomas reported.</p><p>Two patients who became pregnant during the study decided to continue with their pregnancy; they permanently discontinued treatment and underwent a rapid drug elimination procedure with cholestyramine. Both patients gave birth to healthy babies, and no structural defects or functional problems have been reported to date. Since teriflunomide has a long elimination half-life, the option of a procedure to rapidly eliminate teriflunomide from the body is reassuring, particularly for patients who are or are planning to become pregnant, and in situations of possible overdose.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr11-1352458512436594">11</xref></sup></p><p>Disability progression, ARRs and MRI activity remained low throughout the course of the extension, providing evidence that the previously reported beneficial effects of teriflunomide on clinical and MRI endpoints are maintained over the long-term, for up to 8.5 years. There was a trend towards a dose-dependent benefit with teriflunomide 14 mg on several MRI parameters (including T2 BOD, cerebral volume, new and newly enlarging T2 lesions and newly active lesions), which is also consistent with that observed in previous teriflunomide clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr9-1352458512436594">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr10-1352458512436594">10</xref></sup> Patient-reported fatigue and mental health-related quality of life (HRQoL) remained stable over the course of the long-term extension study, and the physical decrease in HRQoL paralleled the benefits observed on EDSS scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bibr13-1352458512436594">13</xref></sup></p><p>Although findings are limited by the relatively small number of patients who remained on treatment at the interim cut-off date (85/179 patients), this study provides useful data which will help clinicians understand the safety profile of teriflunomide over the long-term. To the best of our knowledge, this study of teriflunomide in RMS provides the longest exposure data of any oral DMT to date.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Editorial support was provided by Lucy Reiman at Fishawack Communications Ltd., funded by sanofi-aventis.
