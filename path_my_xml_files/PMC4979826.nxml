Pain was subdivided into 3 components: superficial wound pain, deep abdominal pain, and referred shoulder pain, which were evaluated with a numeric rating scale (from 0 to 10) at baseline (time of awakening) and at 1, 6, 9, and 24&#x0200a;hours postoperatively.

In this technique, the largest port site, which accommodates a 12-mm camera, is located in the midline of the lower abdomen (T12 or L1). In CLC, usually the largest port is located at the inferior aspect of the umbilicus, and the other 2 or 3 smaller ports are placed in the upper abdomen. RCNP with one 12-mm and two 8-mm-diameter trocar sites in the lower abdomen is presumed to produce less severe postoperative wound pain<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup> and to produce pain with different characteristics compared with CLC. Nonetheless, in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), we noticed that the degree of pain from the camera port was severe enough to require analgesia in most patients who underwent RCNP, whereas the postoperative wound pains associated with the other 2 ports were negligible. Although Kim at al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> reported that all patients were satisfied with the degree of postoperative pain after RCNP, no report has yet evaluated the characteristics of postoperative pain and its management in this novel version of robotic cholecystectomy (RC).</p><p>Several approaches using transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block for the management of peripheral postoperative pain after CLC<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> have been evaluated; however, the results have been somewhat contradictory.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Considering that the main source of pain after CLC is the umbilical trocar site,<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> bilateral rectus sheath block (RSB) may be applicable.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Bilateral RSB can provide postoperative analgesia for procedures involving a midline incision<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> with a slower absorption kinetics profile for local anesthetic than other compartment blocks.<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> Therefore, in the present study, we focused on RSB. It is also a technically simple procedure that has been reported to be effective.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> To our knowledge, RSB performed in the lower abdomen below the arcuate line has not previously been described.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the characteristics of postoperative pain during the first 24&#x0200a;hours after RCNP and the analgesic effect of the split injection technique for RSB (sRSB) performed at the T12 or L1 dermatome of the main trocar site on superficial postoperative pain, and ultimately to investigate the effectiveness of bilateral ultrasound-guided (USG) sRSB as a postoperative analgesic modality for RCNP.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective, randomized, observer-blinded, controlled trial was performed at Ajou University Hospital, Suwon, Republic of Korea, and was approved by our institutional ethics committee (AJIRB-MED-SUR-14&#x02013;351). After obtaining written informed consent, we enrolled 40 female patients who were scheduled for RC under general anesthesia (American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II and aged 20&#x02013;60 years). The exclusion criteria were a previous history of abdominal surgery, coagulation disorders, known allergies to local anesthetics, body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;27&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and evidence of infection around the proposed area of the RSB.

Anesthesia was induced with intravenous propofol (1&#x02013;2&#x0200a;mg/kg) and rocuronium (0.6&#x0200a;mg/kg), and was maintained with desflurane 6 to 7 vol% in 50% oxygen.</p><p>The RCNP was performed with the 4-arm da Vinci robot system (Intuitive Surgical, CA) using a 3-port technique as described by Kim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> with some modifications.

A designated anesthesiologist placed a 22-gauge spinal needle using an in-plane technique under ultrasound guidance. All blocks were performed by 1 expert investigator (JSK). First, the needle was inserted 2 to 3&#x0200a;cm lateral to the 12-mm trocar incision site in the mediolateral direction into the space between the medial side of the inferior epigastric vessels (IEVs) and the transversalis fascia (TF). Five milliliters of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected, and if separation of IEVs from the TF by the injectate was depicted by ultrasound, the needle was considered to be in the correct position (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A). Afterwards, the needle was repositioned into the space between the lateral side of the IEVs and the TF in the same manner and 5&#x0200a;mL of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B).

Shoulder pain was not significant during the first 24&#x0200a;hours after RCNP. USG sRSB resulted in lower incisional pain scores and higher patient satisfaction only during the first postoperative hour, and the difference in pain score was not associated with a decrease in total fentanyl consumption.</p><p>It is well-known that CLC causes considerable pain despite being minimally invasive,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> and pain control after CLC is challenging. In fact, the causes of postlaparoscopy pain are multifactorial and complex; they include visceral origins, rapid development of pneumoperitoneum, incisional pain related to variable numbers and sizes of trocar sites, different analgesic regimens, and individual factors.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup> Pneumoperitoneum can also produce deep parietal pain by sudden distention of the peritoneum associated with tearing of blood vessels, traumatic traction of the nerves, and release of inflammatory mediators,<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> and this type of parietal abdominal pain is difficult for patients to differentiate from true visceral pain. In this respect, an accurate assessment of postoperative pain components after laparoscopic surgery may not be easy. In 1 previous study<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> which investigated the characteristics of pain after CLC by dividing postoperative pain into parietal and visceral pain, visceral pain was shown to predominate over parietal pain during the first 24&#x0200a;hours. On the contrary, several studies have reported that incisional pain predominates on the first postoperative day.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup></p><p>Robotic cholecystectomy was first introduced in 1988 and has now evolved to single-incision RC, which may provide additional benefits in further reducing the already minimal pain of classic 4-port cholecystectomy. However, single-incision RC and CLC produced similar levels of postoperative pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> In the meantime, Kim et al<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> introduced a new version of RC involving 3 ports in the lower abdomen, a technique which was originally designed for better aesthetic outcomes. Generally, lower abdominal incisions produce less postoperative pain<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>; therefore, we presumed that RCNP with 3 ports in the lower abdomen would show different pain characteristics compared with CLC. Accordingly, we investigated the characteristics of postoperative pain after RCNP for the first time, and, as a result, we noticed that the superficial wound pain from the main trocar site in the T12-L1 dermatome predominated over deep intra-abdominal and referred shoulder pain during the immediate postoperative period, but the difference decreased rapidly to an insignificant level in 6&#x0200a;hours. Also, deep pain did not predominate at any time during the first 24&#x0200a;hours in the control group. Nonetheless, initial superficial wound pain after RCNP was severe enough to require pain therapy.</p><p>We performed bilateral USG sRSB for superficial wound pain only when using the 12-mm camera port in the T12 or L1 dermatome because most RCNP patients do not complain of wound pain from the smaller ports. Theoretically, subcostal TAP block may be an appropriate technique covering all trocar sites. However, after TAP block, a satisfactory block for midline incisions may not be completely achieved,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</sup> and the onset of the sensory block is relatively slow.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> As in the present study, to increase the success rate and block quality of RSB, we conducted RSB with some modifications. The rectus abdominis muscle is innervated by segment T6-L1, with a constant branch from L1, and in the branching pattern and course of thoracic intercostal nerves that innervate the anterior abdominal wall, communications seem to occur at the multiple locations in the rectus sheath.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> After approaching the posterior surface of the rectus muscle near the arcuate line, these nerves communicate with a longitudinal band of nerves that run cranio-caudally and form a plexus with branches of the inferior epigastric artery. Therefore, in the case of single shot RSB in this area, laterally deposited local anesthetic in the posterior surface of the rectus muscle may not reach the longitudinal band of nerves that descend cranio-caudally and form the plexus. Accordingly, for complete blockade of the skin and deep area of the abdomen, we injected local anesthetics separately into the medial and lateral areas from the IEVs on both sides. As mentioned previously, IEVs form a plexus with the thoracic intercostal nerves in the ventral part of the posterior surface of the rectus muscle, and they can easily be visualized on an ultrasound. Puncture of these vessels must be avoided; therefore, we used the IEVs as landmarks for the RSB. To our knowledge, this is the first report of bilateral USG RSB targeting the mid-abdominal area of the T12 or L1 dermatomes using the split injection technique in bilateral IEVs for laparoscopic surgery.</p><p>Despite the finding of lower superficial incisional pain scores and greater satisfaction in the RSB group soon after surgery, no statistically significant difference was found in consumption of fentanyl between the 2 groups. This may imply that postoperative pain after RCNP is not severe and does not last long enough to be managed by aggressive analgesic modalities such as nerve blocks. In this respect, this new version of RC has definite advantages of not only better aesthetic outcomes but also less need for aggressive postoperative analgesic modalities compared with CLC or single incision RC. Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be associated with higher pain scores than CLC because of longer incision or local ischemia induced by the placement of a single larger port.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]</sup> Interestingly, referred shoulder pain was not significant after RC in the present study.</p><p>In the present study, we did not measure pain scores at time points between 1 and 6&#x0200a;hours after the completion of RC; therefore, the effective duration of sRSB may have been underestimated.</p><p>In conclusion, after RCNP, superficial wound pain is more severe than deep abdominal pain only in the early postoperative period, and the level of both types of pain are insignificant after 6&#x0200a;hours, whereas shoulder pain was not significant at any time during the first 24&#x0200a;hours after RCNP. Although sRSB showed an analgesic effect and increased patient satisfaction during the early postoperative period after RCNP, considering the short-lived superficial incisional pain after RCNP, RSB may not be a useful analgesic option to treat postoperative pain after RCNP in view of risk/benefit analysis; therefore, pharmacological treatment is recommended.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: BMI = body mass index, CLC = classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy, IEVs = inferior epigastric vessels, PACU = postanesthesia care unit, PCA = patient-controlled analgesia, RC = robotic cholecystectomy, RCNP = robotic cholecystectomy using new port sites, RSB = rectus sheath block, sRSB = split injection technique for RSB, TAP = transversus abdominis plane, TF = transversalis fascia, USG = ultrasound-guided, VRS = verbal rating scale.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>JSK and JBC have contributed equally to the study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bisgaard</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Schulze</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Christian Hjortso</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><etal/></person-group>
