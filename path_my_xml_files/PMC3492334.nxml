Praise, a social reward, is thought to boost motor skill learning by increasing motivation, which leads to increased practice. However, the effect of praise on consolidation is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that praise following motor training directly facilitates skill consolidation. Forty-eight healthy participants were trained on a sequential finger-tapping task. Immediately after training, participants were divided into three groups according to whether they received praise for their own training performance, praise for another participant's performance, or no praise. Participants who received praise for their own performance showed a significantly higher rate of offline improvement relative to other participants when performing a surprise recall test of the learned sequence. On the other hand, the average performance of the novel sequence and randomly-ordered tapping did not differ between the three experimental groups. These results are the first to indicate that praise-related improvements in motor skill memory are not due to a feedback-incentive mechanism, but instead involve direct effects on the offline consolidation process.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research S21220005 to N.S. and S24680061 to S.T. from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science and CREST to K.W. from the Japan Science and Technology Agency.

In motor skill learning, for example, praise is hypothesized to provide feedback about the level of participant competence <xref rid="pone.0048174-Catano1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, which serves as an incentive to enhance practice efforts <xref rid="pone.0048174-Steers1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.

There have been no investigations into the effects of praise on skill consolidation. Here, we hypothesize that praise influences the skill consolidation process directly, as opposed to indirectly through motivating further practice.</p><p>In the present study we tested this hypothesis through a behavioral experiment designed to manipulate both the timing of the praise given and the participants' expectation of a future test. First, to examine the effects of praise on offline rather than online performance improvements during training, participants were praised only after training was completed. Second, after a 24-h retention interval, all participants performed a &#x0201c;surprise&#x0201d; retest of the trained sequence. This minimized the possibility that the participants either physically or mentally practiced the trained sequence prior to the retest. These special considerations allowed us to investigate the direct benefits of praise on skill consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Performance of the trained sequence</title><p>Forty-eight right-handed participants came to the laboratory on two subsequent days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0048174-g001">

Furthermore, our data indicated that praise following motor training enhances consolidation of the learned sequence since the rate of offline improvement was significantly greater in the Self group than in the Other or No-praise groups. As the evaluation video clips viewed by the Self and Other groups were identical except for the instructions indicating to whom the praise was directed, it is unlikely that any physical components in the video clips induced the observed group differences. In addition, other potential factors such as alertness, concentration, fatigue, and quality and duration of sleep did not differ between the groups, so cannot explain the improved consolidation in the Self group.</p><p>An alternative explanation of the present result is that praise induces a positive mood or increases the motivation to perform the motor task <xref rid="pone.0048174-Blumenfeld1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048174-Madsen1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048174-Henderlong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, resulting in the greater improvement in performance from day 1 to day 2 performance. If this were the case, however, it would be expected that the uneven performance between the three groups would occur not only for the trained sequence but also on the other tasks. However, the present results showed no significant group differences in these tasks, suggesting that the effects of praise following training were specific to the trained sequence rather than a more general effect on experimental task performance.</p><p>Praise is regarded as a reward <xref rid="pone.0048174-Izuma1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, because praise has two essential components of reward, that is, hedonic and motivational <xref rid="pone.0048174-Schultz1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>.

Rewards are associated with increased dopaminergic activity in the midbrain and striatum, in which dopamine-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) <xref rid="pone.0048174-Hosp1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0048174-Willuhn1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> has an important role in memory consolidation. The cortico-striatal system plays a critical role in the automatization of the type of motor sequence learning used in the present study <xref rid="pone.0048174-Debas1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048174-Doyon1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048174-Penhune1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. Synaptic plasticity represented by LTP at cortico-striatal synapses strongly depends on the activation of dopamine circuits <xref rid="pone.0048174-Calabresi1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. As the ventral striatum is the part of the reward system driven by dopamine <xref rid="pone.0048174-Zald1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, rewards are expected to affect motor skill consolidation. Taken together, present findings suggest that praise functions as &#x0201c;social reward&#x0201d; that induces the dopamine transmission in the striatum, resulting in an enhancement of the motor skill consolidation.</p><p>Sleep is another possible contributing factor. There is mounting evidence that sleep is necessary for the offline improvement in the sequential finger-tapping task used in the present investigation <xref rid="pone.0048174-Walker1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0048174-Walker3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. Although this study was not designed to determine whether sleep is necessary for the praise-related enhancement of skill consolidation, it is reasonable to expect that this enhancement selectively occurs during sleep. Consolidation of a new motor sequence during sleep appears to rely on the covert re-activation of the brain regions that were initially involved in learning the motor skill <xref rid="pone.0048174-Maquet1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Recent human neuroimaging studies have shown that several brain areas that were activated during the execution of a memory task are significantly re-activated during sleep <xref rid="pone.0048174-Maquet1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0048174-Diekelmann1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, and that such re-activation facilitates memory consolidation <xref rid="pone.0048174-Maquet1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048174-Rasch1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Furthermore, a previous animal study revealed that sleep-dependent re-activation of firing patterns in the ventral striatum took place after reward-related learning <xref rid="pone.0048174-Pennartz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. In line with these findings, it is conceivable that the cortico-striatal loop that is modified by praise after the training is then re-activated during sleep, which in turn contributes to the praise-related enhancement of offline, overnight consolidation. This working hypothesis will be the focus of future experimental investigations.</p><p>In summary, the present study demonstrated that social rewards directly enhance skill consolidation in humans, and suggests that they have a novel functional effect on the human motor memory system. Further understanding of the effects of social rewards on skill consolidation could help to develop protocols to improve motor skills in educational and rehabilitative contexts.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Participants</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all participants before participation in the experiment and the study conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. If participant was a minor (i.e., 18 or 19 year-old), two different experimenters ensured their ability to make decision and obtained their written informed consent to the participation of this experiment, which were approved by the internal review board of Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology, The University of Tokyo. Fifty-eight healthy volunteers (39 male and 19 females, mean [M] &#x000b1; standard deviation [SD]&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22.6&#x000b1;4.67 years) participated in this study. None of the participants had a history of neurological, psychiatric, or sleep disorders, and none had had previous training in playing the piano. Based on interviews after the experiments, five participants were excluded from the analyses because they physically or mentally practiced the trained motor sequence after the end of training on day 1. Another five participants were excluded because they noticed or suspected that the evaluation movies that they watched were predetermined. Thus, data from 48 participants (35 males and 13 females; M &#x000b1; SD&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;22.8&#x000b1;5.17 years) were used for analysis (Self group, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;17; Other group, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15; No-praise group, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Experimental Procedure</title><p>Participants came to the laboratory on two subsequent days.

The participants were told that evaluators in another room were monitoring their performance through a web camera above the computer monitor, and would comment on their performance after training. However, in reality, their performance was not monitored. After training, all participants received visual feedback about their performance (for example, their learning curve). The participants were then divided into three groups to systematically manipulate the praise that they experienced: 1) participants who watched a movie in which evaluators praised their training performance (Self group); 2) participants who watched the same movie as the Self group, but who were told that it reflected the evaluation of another participant's performance (Other group); and 3) participants who did not watch the movie and who received no praise (No-praise group).</p><p>Unbeknownst to the participants, the contents of the movie were predetermined and prerecorded, with actors and actresses portraying the evaluators. At the end of the experiment on day 1, participants were told that they would perform a different task on the next day. On the following day, however, all participants performed a &#x0201c;surprise&#x0201d; retest of the trained sequence; this was intended to minimize the possibility that the participants either physically or mentally practiced the trained sequence prior to the retest, or that those in the Self group, in particular, were more motivated to perform the tasks on day 2. We then examined the effect of the manipulation of praise on the retest performance of the trained sequence.</p><p>After the retest, the participants also performed a non-trained sequence, a randomly-ordered tapping task and completed a working memory task. These additional tasks were included to investigate whether the effects of praise were specific to the offline improvement in the trained sequence or induced a more general feeling of happiness that increased motivation to perform well on day 2. If praise enhanced general motivation in the Self group, performance on all additional tasks on day 2 should be better in the Self group than in the Other and No-praise groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Sequential Finger Tapping Task</title><p>The sequential finger tapping task required participants to press four numeric keys on a standard computer keyboard repeatedly with the fingers of their non-dominant (left) hand as quickly and as accurately as possible for 30-s periods (for details, see <xref rid="pone.0048174-Walker2" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0048174-Walker3" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>).

Both tasks consisted of five 30-s trials with a 30-s rest period between trials. Performance for the non-trained sequence (NEW) and the randomly-ordered (RAN) tapping was calculated based on the mean number of correctly tapped sequences (NEW) or correctly pressed buttons (RAN) during the five trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Manipulation of Praise</title><p>After the training on day 1, participants in the Self and Other groups watched a movie in which evaluators praised the training performance. We adopted a movie instead of live praise because predetermined movie can totally control out the variability of evaluators' comments and non-verbal information such as facial expression and intonation. Participants in the Self group were told that the movie represented the evaluation of their own performance during training. The movie consisted of three components: one introduction clip, 12 evaluation clips, and happiness ratings for each clip. In the introduction clip, a man greeted the participant by name to make the evaluation appear more believable and meaningful. Each movie clip was pre-recorded using six actors and six actresses. Ten movie clips contained positive feedback, and two neutral movie clips were included to maintain the attention of participants by making the evaluation less predictable.</p><p>In the evaluation movies, praise was directed at the participant's training performance, their attitude during training, or their social ranking relative to other participants (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0048174-t001">
<bold>Table 1</bold>
</xref> for examples of evaluators' comments used in this experiment). To rule out the possibility that simply watching the movie might influence the offline improvement in motor skill, we included the Other group, in which participants watched the same movie clips but were told that they represented the evaluation of another participant's training performance. In the introduction clip seen by the Other group, a man used another participant's name. In both the Self and Other groups, regardless of the target of praise, the participants were asked to rate how happy they felt upon watching each movie clip using a seven-point scale (1&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;very unhappy, 4&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;neutral, and 7&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;very happy; the responses for one participant were not collected due to technical difficulties). The order of the evaluation clips was fixed across participants.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0048174-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0048174.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Examples of the comments from evaluation clips.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0048174-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0048174.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Valence of comment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Direction of evaluation</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Content</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Positive</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Performance, Social Ranking</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Hi, I observed your performance and attitude during the motor task.
