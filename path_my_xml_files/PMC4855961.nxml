Group 1 and 2 were further analyzed together as Group 1K (1000 IU daily and 30,000 IU monthly), and Group 3 and 4 as Group 2K (2000 IU daily and 60,000 IU monthly).

Breastfed infants born to Vitamin D deficient mothers are at risk of developing Vitamin D deficiency and its metabolic sequels.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Despite abundant sunlight, majority of apparently healthy individuals in Kashmir valley in the Northern Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir are Vitamin D deficient. Pregnant Kashmiri women being a vulnerable group due to limited exposure to sunlight because of peculiar cultural issues are even more Vitamin D deficient.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Because pregnancy and birth provoke important modifications of mineral homeostasis, the newborn must adapt rapidly to ensure the positive calcium balance necessary for normal skeletal growth and development. Maternal 25(OH)D is believed to cross the placenta, and the fetus is entirely dependent on the mother for its supply. The fetus is affected by the Vitamin D deficiency during pregnancy resulting in decreased birth weight of newborn, impaired bone mineralization and frequent neonatal hypocalcemia.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The need, safety and effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy is contentious as there is limited data available on the subject, especially from the Indian subcontinent. Whereas, there is a clear need of Vitamin D supplementation in Kashmiri pregnant women, there is no data on safety and effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in our population. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to study the safety and effectiveness of Vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy in our population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was an open-label, parallel group, prospective, and randomized controlled trial. The trial was registered with National trial registry India (No. 005967). The study was conducted according to the guidelines in the World Medical Association (2000) declaration of Helsinki: Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, with notes of clarification of 2002 and 2004 and all procedures involving human subjects/patients were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Institute. A written informed consent was obtained from all subjects participating in the study. Subjects were mainly recruited from the out-patient department (OPD) of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, SKIMS, during summer of 2013, and some subjects from maternity hospital (Lal Ded, Srinagar) were also included.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size calculation and enrollment of subjects</title><p>An online calculator provided by the Massachusetts General Hospital Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center was used to calculate sample size. For 90% power of study and 5% margin of error (&#x003b1; = 0.05), a minimum of 22 patients per group were required to detect a statistically significant increase in 25(OH)D by 10 ng/ml between two groups. This calculation assumed that standard deviation of 25(OH)D measurements at a single time point was approximately 10 and that there would be a low correlation between the baseline and final measurements. Finally, 100 subjects were enrolled for the study, considering that a substantial proportion of participants may be lost during follow-up because of either withdrawal from participation or termination of care. Enrollment was done from the first trimester to starting of the second trimester, depending upon when the pregnancy was confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Initial study visits</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Completion of questionnaires</title><p>At the first visit, a detailed proforma was recorded which included subject's sociodemographic profile, medical history, obstetric history, exposure to sunlight, and dietary intake.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Anthropometric measurements</title><p>Prepregnancy height and weight were recorded at first OPD visit.

The subjects were also analyzed as Group 1K and Group 2K irrespective of the daily or monthly supplementation regime. Group 1K included both 1000 IU daily, and 30,000 IU monthly subjects whereas Group 2K included 2000 IU daily and 60,000 IU monthly subjects.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Flowchart showing recruitment and follow-up of study subjects</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-20-337-g001"/></fig><p>Vitamin D supplementation was started after 16 weeks; it was ensured that none of the subjects received Vitamin D before the 16<sup>th</sup> week of pregnancy.

Levels were measured by a radioimmunoassay (RIA) technique using the commercially available kit as per the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. The DiaSorin 25(OH)D assay consists of a two-step procedure. The first procedure involves a rapid extraction of 25(OH) D and other hydroxylated metabolites from serum or plasma with acetonitrile. Following extraction, the treated sample is then assayed using an equilibrium RIA procedure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 11.0, for Windows software (SPSS Inc.). Results are reported as means &#x000b1; standard deviations unless stated otherwise. Categorical variables were compared by group using the Chi-square test whereas differences between groups on continuous variables were assessed by using the independent-samples <italic>t</italic>-test and where the data were normally distributed, Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test was used. Effects of Vitamin D supplement on 25(OH)D levels in the study subjects and the neonates were examined without adjustment for potential confounders by using repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Associations between variables were evaluated by using Pearson's correlation analysis.

These 100 study subjects were randomly assigned into four treatment groups: (i) Group 1 (<italic>n</italic> = 26), 1000 IU of Vitamin D daily, (ii) Group 2 (<italic>n</italic> = 21), 30,000 IU of Vitamin D monthly, (iii) Group 3 (<italic>n</italic> = 27), 2000 IU of Vitamin D daily, and (iv) Group 4 (<italic>n</italic> = 26), 60,000 IU Vitamin D monthly. Mean age for cases was 27.7 years ranging from 20 to 30 years. Complete age distribution and demographic characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>. Majority of our subjects were unemployed homemakers with limited exposure to sunlight. Exposure to sunlight was observed in cases belonging to urban dwelling though the comparison was nonsignificant. It is important to mention here that most of the recruitment was done in the summer months of May&#x02013;July. The mean 25(OH)D level at baseline was 24.2 &#x000b1; 15.1 ng/ml. Only 33% women were Vitamin D sufficient if a criteria of 25(OH)D of 30 ng/ml or more is followed, but 56% were Vitamin D sufficient with criteria of 25(OH)D of 20 ng/ml or more. Postsupplementation, Vitamin D levels increased to 40.2 &#x000b1; 12.2 ng/ml. There was a quite variable effect on circulating levels of Vitamin D, postsupplementation as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. Postsupplementation, the overall status of vitamin sufficiency was better in Group 3 (2000 IU/day) irrespective of the regimen used monthly or daily. Vitamin D level significantly increased in all four groups with mean increment of 12.7 &#x000b1; 23.9 ng/ml with 1000 IU/day, 17.1 &#x000b1; 21.0 ng/ml with 2000 IU/day, 16.0 &#x000b1; 14.6 ng/ml with 30,000 IU monthly, and 23.8 &#x000b1; 18.1 ng/ml with 60,000 IU monthly. Though there was a significant increase in 25(OH)D levels in all the treatment groups, compared to baseline, there was no significant difference in the postsupplementation 25(OH)D levels in between the four groups by ANOVA.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Baseline and demographic characteristics of study subjects</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-20-337-g002"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Vitamin D levels of the study population pre- and post-supplementation, and the increment in levels with respect to supplementation regimen</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-20-337-g003"/></table-wrap><p>On analysis, no statistical difference was observed in the postsupplementation 25(OH)D levels between the groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>] except between Group 2 and 4. The comparison showed that Group 4 (60,000 IU/month) subjects had significantly higher levels than those of Group 2 (30,000 IU/month) subjects. One of the primary objectives of the study was to find the difference in the postsupplementation levels of 25(OH)D between Group 1K and 2K regimen. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, there was a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023) between these two groups with Group 2K showing higher levels. With respect to the safety of Vitamin D supplementation, overall there were few adverse outcomes in the study population; however the difference in pregnancy outcomes between various study groups did not reach statistical significance. Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and 25(OH)D levels in the mother showed no significant association between baseline Vitamin D or postsupplementation levels at term, yet subjects with PIH had statistically low Vitamin D in newborns. There was no statistically significant difference in maternal and neonatal levels of 25(OH)D between subjects with or without other adverse outcomes such as gestational diabetes mellitus, postpartum hemorrhage, rate of lower segment cesarean section.</p><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Comparison of postsupplementation 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in relation to study group, dose, and mode of administration</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="IJEM-20-337-g004"/></table-wrap></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>The present study was carried out in a Tertiary Care Hospital in the Northern Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir to assess the effectiveness and safety of various supplementation doses of Vitamin D in correcting Vitamin D deficiency and its effect on pregnancy outcome. Considering 25(OH)D level of 30 ng/ml or more as criteria of Vitamin D sufficiency, we found about two-third of pregnant Kashmiri women Vitamin D insufficient or deficient. This is not surprising as Vitamin D deficiency is very common here. Previously we have reported the prevalence of vitamin deficiency in as many as 80% of healthy Kashmiri individuals,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and 82% of pregnant Kashmiri women (unpublished data). Many studies among pregnant women from south and north India have reported high Vitamin D deficiency levels ranging from 67% to 96%. Our entire cohort was recruited from summer 2013, and this could be responsible for the slightly lower percentage of Vitamin D deficiency in our study. The study by Sahu <italic>et al</italic>. showed a significant effect of season on Vitamin D deficiency, recording 54% in the period from May to October and in 93% from November to April.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Marwaha <italic>et al</italic>. also recorded significantly lower values of 25(OH)D in winter as compared to summer.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>There was a quite variable effect on circulating levels of Vitamin D, postsupplementation. Vitamin D level significantly increased in all four groups with mean increment of 12.7 &#x000b1; 23.9 ng/ml with 1000 IU/day, 17.1 &#x000b1; 21.0 ng/ml with 2000 IU/day, 16.0 &#x000b1; 14.6 ng/ml with 30,000 IU monthly, and 23.8 &#x000b1; 18.1 ng/ml with 60,000 IU monthly. Whereas there was a significant increase in 25(OH)D levels in all the treatment groups, compared to baseline, there was no significant difference in the postsupplementation 25(OH)D levels in between the four groups by ANOVA. On comparing the dose of 1K versus 2K irrespective of regimen used (daily or monthly), a significant difference (<italic>P</italic> = 0.023) was observed although there was no statistical association in the postsupplementation 25(OH)D levels between Group 1 (1000 IU/day) and Group 3 (2000 IU/day). The significant association between 1K and 2K regimen can be attributed to supplementation availability.</p><p>Our study demonstrates that daily or monthly doses are equally effective in correcting Vitamin D level at term. This improvement in Vitamin D status was achieved without any evidence of hypervitaminosis D or an increase in adverse events during pregnancy and with optimization of 25(OH) D. Similar to our analysis Hollis <italic>et al</italic>. found a dose of 2000 IU Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> corrected around two-third of patients, and Vitamin D raised from 34 to 46 ng/ml.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] We found minor differences between pregnant participants receiving the daily or monthly bolus dose. Although monthly bolus dose proved to be better than daily dose, the difference was insignificant. Based on the present analysis, we could conclude slightly better 25(OH)D response to a monthly dose of Vitamin D than daily dose which may be related to better compliance. Delvin <italic>et al</italic>. reported that a daily dose of 1000 IU Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> administered to 15 French women during the third trimester modestly raised mean maternal serum (25[OH]D) from 55 nmol/l to 65 nmol/l.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A unique aspect of our study was the comparing daily dose with monthly equivalent dose, and our data showed a statistically insignificant association between daily dose or their monthly equivalent nevertheless monthly dose proved to be better than the daily dose at the end of the term. Although the study may have been too small to detect minor inter-dose fluctuations in (25[OH]D), the data supported the appropriateness of administering monthly doses of 30,000 IU or 60,000 IU instead of daily administration 1000 IU or 2000 IU.</p><p>One recent study on Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy from India reported a high prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency, used intermittently very large doses of 120,000 IU Vitamin D in the fifth and seventh months.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Other recent study by Dawodu <italic>et al</italic>. supplemented pregnant women with 2000 IU and 4000 IU of Vitamin D in the second and third trimester of pregnancy.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations at delivery and in cord blood were significantly higher in 2000 and 4000 IU than in 400 IU/day group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and was highest in the 4000 IU/day group. Kalra <italic>et al</italic>. in the study of Vitamin D (D<sub>3</sub>) supplementation during pregnancy randomized subjects in the second trimester were divided into three groups.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Group 1 received one oral dose of 1500 &#x003bc;g Vitamin D<sub>3</sub>; Group 2 received doses of 3000 &#x003bc;g Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> each in the second and third trimesters. Median maternal 25(OH) D at term was higher in Group 2 - 23.48 ng/ml than in Group 1-10.48 ng/ml.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Only 34% of the subjects in the study Sahu <italic>et al</italic>., compared with 80.5% of subjects on 2000 IU/day in our study achieved serum 25(OH)D of &#x0003e;30 ng/ml at delivery.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Recent observational studies indicated that serum 25(OH)D concentrations &#x0003e;30 ng/ml (75 nmol/l) is associated with a reduced risk of nonskeletal health disorders, such as preeclampsia[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and gestational diabetes.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Furthermore, serum 25(OH)D &#x0003e;30 ng/mL in the cord blood has been associated with an improved newborn innate immune response.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] We found no differences in birth weight and gestational diabetes, PIH between 1000 IU and 2000 IU groups that may be related to small sample size of our cohort.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>Starting at 16 weeks of gestation, Vitamin D supplementation of 2000 IU daily or the monthly equivalent dose is more effective in achieving higher Vitamin D levels throughout pregnancy without increased risk of toxicity in the mother or the neonate.
