Patient-centred services have been advocated widely, but such approaches have received little attention in Africa. A cluster randomized trial is evaluating population-level outcomes of an intervention with multiple components, including &#x02018;patient-centred services.&#x02019; A process evaluation was designed within this trial to articulate and evaluate the implementation and programme theories of the intervention. This article evaluates one hypothesized mechanism of change within the programme theory: the impact of the Patient Centred Services component on health-worker communication. The theory-driven approach extended to evaluation of the outcome measures. The study found that the proximal outcome of patient-centred communication was rated 10 percent higher (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.008) by care seekers consulting with the health workers who were at the intervention health centres compared with those at control health centres. This finding will strengthen interpretation of more distal trial outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Africa</kwd><kwd>complex intervention</kwd><kwd>patient centred communication</kwd><kwd>quality of health care</kwd><kwd>theory-driven evaluation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1356389014551484"><title>Introduction</title><p>The quality of health care provided to patients in low-resource settings such as many African health centres is frequently reported to be poor (<xref rid="bibr61-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organisation, 2005</xref>). This has negative effects on uptake of services by community members (<xref rid="bibr13-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">D&#x02019;Ambruoso et al., 2005</xref>) and has been reported to result in failure to earn a population&#x02019;s trust, leading clients to seek alternative sources of care (<xref rid="bibr7-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Brown et al., 1993</xref>), or to discontinue care (<xref rid="bibr25-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Hall et al., 1993</xref>). By contrast, perceptions and experiences of good quality services, including inter-personal attributes, have been found to increase access to care (<xref rid="bibr38-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Mbaruku and Bergstrom, 1995</xref>) and demand for services (<xref rid="bibr17-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">El Arifeen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bibr39-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">McPake, 1993</xref>; <xref rid="bibr62-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Wouters, 1991</xref>). Satisfied patients may be more likely to adhere to treatment and to maintain a continuing relationship with the health worker (<xref rid="bibr15-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Deyo and Inui, 1980</xref>), and loyalty to a clinic (<xref rid="bibr55-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Vera, 1993</xref>), resulting in a better medical prognosis, presuming good technical quality of care (<xref rid="bibr59-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Williams, 1994</xref>). Meeting a population&#x02019;s expectations for provider services is now seen as central to health system performance (<xref rid="bibr60-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organisation, 2000</xref>), and improved performance central to improving health, especially for maternal and child health outcomes (<xref rid="bibr53-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">United Nations, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In western settings, a &#x02018;patient-centred&#x02019; approach to health care has been increasingly advocated for, as a means to provide high-quality care that addresses patient needs more broadly than &#x02018;disease centred&#x02019; or &#x02018;doctor centred&#x02019; approaches (<xref rid="bibr1-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Balint, 1963</xref>; <xref rid="bibr40-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Mead and Bower, 2000</xref>). A core focus of the patient-centred approach has been on communication, with interventions to improve interactions stemming from a patient-centred philosophy now common within pre-service and in-service curricula across a range of health care providers (<xref rid="bibr50-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Stewart, 2001</xref>). However, evidence for the best methods to achieve patient-centred communication remains weak. A systematic review has suggested that training in patient centredness can have a positive impact on communication quality and on patient satisfaction, although the nature of training was heterogeneous and impact on healthcare use and health outcomes could not be established (<xref rid="bibr35-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Lewin et al., 2001</xref>). Interventions that incorporate &#x02018;mindfulness&#x02019; or self-reflection may also be effective in improving communication and health-worker attitudes (<xref rid="bibr20-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Fonn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bibr31-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Krasner et al., 2009</xref>) although evidence of the most effective strategies for teaching and learning reflection remains weak (<xref rid="bibr37-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Mann et al., 2009</xref>). The need for more rigorous evaluations of patient-centred interventions has been identified, with calls for randomized trial designs and assessment of outcomes that are meaningful to patients (<xref rid="bibr35-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Lewin et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The potential for patient-centred approaches to improve quality of health care in Africa has received little attention. It cannot be assumed that this philosophy can be simply transferred from the context in which it was developed, in countries with very different histories and structures of biomedicine, to African health system contexts (<xref rid="bibr2-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Blaise and Kegels, 2004</xref>). However, research into patient expectations, preferences and satisfaction with care suggests that interpersonal interactions with health care providers are of central importance across different cultural settings including in Africa (<xref rid="bibr28-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Kizito et al., 2012</xref>) and research in Uganda has identified patient-centredness as an aspiration for both health workers and community members for public health facilities (<xref rid="bibr9-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Chandler et al., 2013a</xref>). A Patient Centred Services (PCS) component was developed as part of a wider intervention (&#x02018;PRIME&#x02019;) that aims to improve the quality of health care at public health facilities in rural Uganda. The PCS package is based on patient-centred philosophies adapted to the local setting, and consists of a series of five half-day interactive workshops supported by five take-home self-reflection tasks. The other components of the PRIME intervention were workshops in fever case management (FCM) and in health centre management (HCM), as well as support for supplies of diagnostic tests and drugs for malaria.</p><p>Theory-driven evaluations aim to explicate theories or models of given interventions and use this to guide and strengthen evaluation questions and analysis (<xref rid="bibr12-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Coryn et al., 2011</xref>). Evaluation practitioners have identified the need to articulate and evaluate the &#x02018;implementation theory&#x02019; or &#x02018;action model&#x02019; of the intervention itself (<xref rid="bibr11-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr57-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 1998</xref>) as well as the &#x02018;programme theory&#x02019; or &#x02018;change model&#x02019; (<xref rid="bibr11-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Chen, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bibr57-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Weiss, 1998</xref>) of the intended pathway between the intervention and measured outcomes. The documentation of the former, particularly in terms of fidelity and dose received, has become more commonplace. The drawing of logic models is recommended to depict the latter and to guide evaluation activities (<xref rid="bibr3-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Blamey et al., 2013</xref>). Methods for the evaluation of intended pathways of change, however, remain diverse. The testing of pre-specified hypotheses is proposed to improve assessment of plausibility that outcomes are attributable to interventions, particularly when composed of multiple components (<xref rid="bibr4-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Bonell et al., 2012</xref>), rather than to other factors or a different mechanism triggered by the intervention (<xref rid="bibr24-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Habicht et al., 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bibr56-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al., 2010</xref>). We propose that testing pre-specified hypotheses within an intended pathway of change will enable consideration that broader outcomes are attributable to particular aspects of an intervention.</p><p>This article presents an evaluation of the impact of the PCS component of the PRIME intervention on the patient centredness of communication of health workers with care seekers, compared with standard care facilities which did not receive any aspect of the PRIME intervention. Here we aim to establish the plausibility of the proposed mechanism of effect of the PCS component of the intervention on a proximal outcome measure &#x02013; communication &#x02013; prior to further analyses of the wider impact of the PRIME intervention on malaria management, patient attendance and population-level health outcomes through the main cluster randomized trial.</p></sec><sec id="section2-1356389014551484"><title>Study setting</title><p>We carried out this intervention trial at 20 health facilities in Tororo district, Eastern Uganda. Our baseline census showed the study area to be poor, with the mortality rate in children under five years estimated at 11 percent, or 110 deaths per 1000 live births. Fifteen of the health centres serving the area are small, with no in-patient facilities or laboratories, and are typically run by 1&#x02212;2 nurses or nursing assistants, serving approximately 40 patients per day. Five of the health facilities are larger, with small wards and semi-functioning laboratories and 5&#x02212;10 health workers serving approximately 50 patients per day. Recently, local public health facilities have been plagued by shortages in drugs and equipment, with low levels of staff motivation. Our formative research suggested community members perceived quality of care to vary depending upon supplies and health-worker attitudes. Both health workers and care seekers aspired to better quality of services, including &#x02018;patient centredness of services&#x02019; &#x02013; the quality of the way services are provided to patients, including interpersonal interactions, particularly with patients from different backgrounds. The formative research suggested that individual health-worker priorities, situated within the challenges of strong hierarchies with other health workers and politicians plus the opportunities presented by their status in relation to patients, appeared to undermine motivation to show respect for patients and provide quality services (<xref rid="bibr9-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Chandler et al., 2013a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="section3-1356389014551484"><title>Intervention</title><p>Following reporting recommendations of the WIDER group (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.interventiondesign.co.uk">www.interventiondesign.co.uk</ext-link>) and others (<xref rid="bibr21-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Glasziou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr41-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Michie et al., 2009</xref>), we present a detailed description of the intervention and its theoretical rationale. We explicate the implementation theory underlying the intervention and the programme theory as a series of hypotheses in the pathway of change to the desired outcomes of the intervention.

The changes at the health facility, including more patient-centred services, should attract patients who previously may have been afraid or reluctant to attend, thereby increasing access to prompt, effective treatment, particularly for malaria, the highest burden disease in the area. In turn, this is hypothesized to have an impact on health indicators in the local population, particularly for young children (for a visual representation see Supplementary Figure). These latter outcomes are being assessed in the main PRIME cluster randomized trial.</p><fig id="fig2-1356389014551484" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Patient-centred services programme theory of change.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389014551484-fig2"/></fig></sec><sec id="section6-1356389014551484"><title>Intervention delivery</title><p>The PRIME intervention workshops took place from May to July 2011. The five PCS modules were carried out through weekly face-to-face afternoon sessions in small groups of between seven and 14 participants at a local hall. Two sessions of PCS workshops were held to encourage participation of all health workers. Participants were provided with transport refunds for their attendance in addition to refreshments. The PCS workshops were facilitated by three members of the PRIME research team with backgrounds as medical doctors and limited experience in interactive training methods, following a precedent of other Ministry of Health endorsed health-worker training in Uganda (<xref rid="bibr47-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Ssekabira et al., 2008</xref>). Two facilitators attended a two-day workshop on experience-based learning methods (led by AH) in Kenya, where a health communication training project was ongoing. All facilitators completed a series of self-reflection tasks (developed by AH) in line with those to be conducted in the PCS intervention. In addition, all facilitators attended a one-day orientation on the PRIME training approach (led by CIRC), in line with an &#x02018;introduction for trainers&#x02019; manual (available from the authors). Facilitators also helped to pilot each module and received feedback for each of the workshops. A trainer manual was designed for each module to guide the format and activities of workshops, and participants also received a manual for each workshop to follow activities and to take home. Manuals are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.actconsortium.org/publications.php/12/prime-trainer-and-learner-manuals">http://www.actconsortium.org/publications.php/12/prime-trainer-and-learner-manuals</ext-link>. Overall contact time for health workers attending PCS workshops was approximately 19 hours.</p><p>Participants were encouraged to carry out self-reflection to support their learning in the PCS workshops. They were given &#x02018;tasks&#x02019; to complete each week, for example to observe how they listened to their patients, and were encouraged to feed back and discuss their reflections with colleagues at the next workshop. Each task was expected to take around one hour over the duration of the week. Standard care facilities received no PCS workshops or self-reflection tasks or other components of the PRIME intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="section7-1356389014551484"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section8-1356389014551484"><title>Objectives</title><p>The objective of the analysis presented in this article is to test whether the PCS component of the PRIME intervention had an immediate impact on patient centredness of health-worker communication.

We undertook two different methods of assessment in our evaluation: interviews with care seekers on exit, to gain an insight into their assessment of the health worker&#x02019;s quality of communication, and audio recordings of interactions between health workers and care seekers. A rating scheme was used to assign a quantitative score of health-worker communication for each method.</p><p>We based the rating schemes for both methods on the primary components of patient-centred communication identified by the Patient&#x02013;Doctor Communication Group in Canada (<xref rid="bibr51-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et al., 1995</xref>), and widely used in western settings: Component I &#x02018;exploring both the disease and the illness experience,&#x02019; represents the physician&#x02019;s exploration not only of the disease process, through history taking and physical examination but also their active engagement with the patient&#x02019;s world, to understand their unique illness experience&#x02019;; Component II, &#x02018;understanding the whole person&#x02019;, represents the way the physician integrates these concepts of disease and illness with an understanding of the whole person, including an awareness of the patient&#x02019;s position in the life cycle and context within which they live, such as family, work and culture; Component III &#x02018;finding common ground,&#x02019; Consists of the physician defining the problem together with the patient, establishing goals of treatment or management and identifying the roles to be assumed by each.

This involves a detailed protocol whereby coders categorize statements from the patient that are pertinent to the patient-centred method and assess the physician&#x02019;s response. An overall score is generated as a composite of the responses given to the relevant utterances of patients. Due to the complexity of this rating system, we chose not to adapt it, but rather sought to assess its application in this setting. Two members of the team (SN and CN) coded each interaction. Any differences in ratings were reviewed by both raters together and a score agreed or taken to a third party (LT or CIRC) for a final decision.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1356389014551484"><title>Study sample</title><p>We aimed to include at least one health worker from all 10 intervention and 10 standard care health facilities, and to recruit the same health worker at baseline and follow-up where possible for increased comparability given anticipated between-health-worker variation. The most senior health worker working at the time of recruitment was invited to participate on the basis that they would see the most patients in this context. A communication score was calculated from exit interviews and audio-recorded interactions for each of between three and five care seekers per health worker, the minimum usually required within a cluster for a multi-level analysis. Eligibility criteria for care seekers were those seeking care for a child under five years with a fever but no sign of severe disease. The target sample size for each time point was 20 health-worker and 100 care-seeker exit interviews and audio-recorded interactions across both study arms. We aimed to include the same health workers at each time point, but assumed care seekers would be different between time points.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1356389014551484"><title>Data collection</title><p>We assessed the patient centredness of health-worker communication at baseline and following completion of the workshops.

Written informed consent was sought from care seekers who were eligible and agreed to participate, and demographic information about the patients was documented. When the care seekers entered the consulting room, a digital audio recorder was switched on and the researcher left the room.

Two-thirds were originally from the area, and 73 percent reported speaking Japhadhola, Swahili and another local language. Characteristics were similar between the two arms, although we were able to include more in-charges (with responsibility for health centres) from the standard care facilities in the assessments. Almost all care seekers were women, and two-thirds were under 30 years of age. Over half (58%) of the care seekers had attended primary school, but a further 25 percent had had no education. The majority (85%) reported their primary activity as a farmer. Nearly all (93%) had been to the health centre before. Patients were all children under five years, with most under 18 months.

Few care-seeker characteristics were associated with communication scores but care-seeker communication scores were statistically significantly higher when the care seeker was originally from the area.

All health workers in the intervention arm had attended some of the intervention training: only three of 14 in the intervention arm had attended all nine workshops, and only six had attended all PCS sessions. Univariate analysis suggested communication scores were not statistically significantly higher amongst those who received some or all of the health centre management training or fever case management training compared with those who had attended no or fewer sessions. However, scores were significantly higher for those who had attended all of the PCS workshops. A plausibility analysis based on the dose received, replacing the intention to treat intervention variable with a binary variable of attendance at all PCS workshops, suggests that this component of the intervention played a large role in the higher communication scores in the intervention arm (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4-1356389014551484">Table 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table4-1356389014551484" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><p>Dose response model of care-seeker communication scores for health workers attending all PCS workshops.</p></caption><alternatives><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/><col align="char" char="." span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Difference in scores (95% Confidence interval)</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>p</italic>-value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Care-seeker communication score</italic><sup><bold><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table-fn8-1356389014551484">a</xref></bold></sup></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">58.4 (11.1, 74.3)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">All 5 PCS workshops attended</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.5 (0.3, 16.7)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.042</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Care seeker from the area</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.7 (2.5, 17.0)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.009</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Health facility mean score at baseline</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.9 (&#x02013;21.4, 55.2)</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.098</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intra-class correlation coefficient</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.31</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr></tbody></table><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_1356389014551484-table4"/></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table-fn7-1356389014551484"><p><italic>Note</italic>: model adjusts for clustering at health-worker level and mean health facility scores at baseline.</p></fn><fn id="table-fn8-1356389014551484"><label>a</label><p>Mean score in baseline category of each variable (i.e. no PCS attended, care seeker not from the area and no difference in health facility mean score compared with baseline).</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section25-1356389014551484"><title>Discussion</title><p>This evaluation showed patient-centred communication was rated 10 percent higher (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.008) by care seekers consulting with health workers who had recently participated in the PRIME intervention compared with those in the standard care arm. Analysis of the dose received suggests this increase may be plausibly attributed to the PCS component of the intervention. The sustainability of this effect, and any impact on patient attendance and population level outcomes will be assessed with data from the main PRIME trial, which is ongoing.</p><p>Interventions to improve quality of services in Africa have often focused on commodities and technical skills training, often with limited impacts on practice (<xref rid="bibr44-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Rowe et al., 2005</xref>). Our results suggest that interventions that take a self-reflective approach, with repeated facilitated interactions with communities of practice over time, may have a positive impact on improving interpersonal aspects of care. Our PCS intervention package is clearly described in trainer and learner manuals and could be adapted and/or tested for use in other settings to establish the generalizability of our findings.</p><p>Scores of patient-centredness between the two methods tested were markedly different, with the audio recording scores very low overall, with zero ratings in several of the domains. By contrast, questions posed to care seekers relating to the same domains showed that often health workers were perceived to perform well. This contrast may be interpreted as a true difference or measurement error. Patients are often thought to overstate quality of care in exit interviews (<xref rid="bibr46-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Sitzia, 1999</xref>), which might account for higher overall scores, and suggest that &#x02018;objective&#x02019; rating should be weighted more highly. However, the range in care-seeker scores and differences between arms suggests they were sensitive to and willing to rate based on differences in health-worker performance, and therefore relative differences should still be of value even if not the absolute scores. We are more inclined to interpret measurement error on the part of the audio recording method, which is subject to analysis based on what is said, rather than what is heard or interpreted (<xref rid="bibr19-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Epstein et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, scoring systems of interactions are culturally specific, based on the expected patterns of speech, for example in &#x02018;finding common ground&#x02019;. Our interpretation is that such rating systems do not travel well cross-culturally and that locally specific modes of assessing interactions would be required, and that direct observations would be most effective in capturing non-verbal communication in context.</p><p>We adopted a theory-driven evaluation approach to this nested process evaluation within a wider cluster randomized trial. Such evaluations have been recommended but are uncommon in the literature (<xref rid="bibr4-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Bonell et al., 2012</xref>). The wider trial provided an opportunity to test hypotheses explicated as underlying the programme theory using a probability approach. This fitted well with the overall evaluation approach of an RCT, allowing for main trial outcomes to be interpreted and attributed in part to this component of the intervention whilst sharing common language and assumptions. However, this approach of attaining a quantitative measure of patient-centredness, and &#x02018;adjusting&#x02019; for differences between people and contexts through randomization, also bracketed-out the breadth and depth of the realities of health-worker&#x02013;care-seeker relationships, which vary a lot and are context dependent. Alternative approaches to evaluation might include a case-study approach whereby these brackets are removed and variation is explored not through statistics but through a meaning-based interpretation of how patient-centredness may or may not play out in practice. Such approaches are, however, often critiqued as &#x02018;biased&#x02019; and the necessarily subjective approach viewed as a problem by those seeking to distill social worlds to measurable variables (<xref rid="bibr14-1356389014551484" ref-type="bibr">Denzin and Lincon, 2005</xref>). Thus, the theory of change based approach to understanding interventions presents a compromise between outcomes-based and process-based perspectives by offering a way to articulate and interrogate often implicit hypotheses of change. But, this compromise takes &#x02018;theory&#x02019; into a positivist epistemology, focusing on reducing and testing, and is hard to connect with and allow emergence of perspectives that recognize values such as &#x02018;patient centredness&#x02019; as socially constructed and therefore differing in meaning for different actors. For evaluation to progress beyond identifying relatively small differences observable through measurable phenomena, our ways of knowing, or epistemological stance, needs to be open to challenge.</p></sec><sec id="section26-1356389014551484"><title>Limitations to interpretation</title><p>We recognize limitations in several aspects of this study, including in the measurement methods as mentioned above, sample size, plausibility analysis and replicability of results. We had a relatively small sample size per health worker, with up to five audio-recordings and exit interviews for each health worker at each time point. This could introduce the potential for observer bias, meaning that the absolute values attributed to health-worker performance may be higher than if they were not being observed. This effect should be evenly distributed across the two arms, although it is possible that those who participated in the intervention were familiar with values of the project in terms of communication and performed accordingly. However, health workers were not informed about the measurement method in advance and this was not discussed during the workshops.</p><p>While our analysis of dose-received strengthens the plausibility that the PCS package was influential in changing provider practices, we recognize that there is the potential for selection bias amongst the sample of health workers who chose to attend more PCS workshops, perhaps due to higher motivation to perform well, &#x02018;incentives&#x02019; perceived, or for the rare opportunity to attend a workshop as a lower cadre staff member. Scale up of such a programme should also expect varying degrees of interest on the part of those invited to such workshops, with the potential for a diluted effect amongst the wider health-worker population.</p><p>Finally, as with any intervention delivered on a small scale, the replicability of the intervention, and consequently its impact, is limited by the way it was delivered. The trial fell between an efficacy and effectiveness study: while we attempted to control the content and mode of delivery through standardized manuals and training of trainers, health workers were not obliged to participate in any or all workshops. Delivery of learning-based interventions are highly dependent on the characteristics of those delivering the training as well as the dynamics generated by the participants in particular workshops. While our use of medical doctors as trainers mimics the typical situation in Uganda of trainers having some medical background, it is likely that the status of our trainers was elevated from their medical degree and position in a research organization. Any scale-up of this programme would require careful selection and training of trainers in methods and attention to the role this may play in reproducibility of results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section27-1356389014551484"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A theory-driven evaluation approach enabled the explication and testing of programme theory for one of several components of a complex intervention. The PCS intervention, inspired by patient-centred philosophies and tailored to the context of health facilities in rural Uganda, appeared to increase care-seeker ratings of health-worker communication by 10 percent compared with those visiting health workers in the standard care arm. Interpersonal qualities in health care may be improved by such interventions based on self-reflection and facilitated workshops with small groups of peers. The sustainability of this effect, and any impact on patient attendance and population level health outcomes remain to be assessed with data from the ongoing trial. The finding of this proximal level outcome will strengthen interpretation of more distal trial outcomes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_File_1._Care_seeker_interview_components_questions_and_scores.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1284" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_File_2._Tables_of_participant_characteristics_and_univariate_analyses.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1292" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="Supplementary_File_3._Figure.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1300" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Miriam Kayendeke, Nicholas Wendo, Michael Oketcho and Paul Olowo for their work in the field, to Florence Nankya, Cathy Maiteki and Lucas Othieno for their work as workshop facilitators, to Levi Mugenyi for his work constructing the coding database and to Bonnie Cundill for consultation on statistical methods.
