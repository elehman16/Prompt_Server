of oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in obese elderly women, who are at
increased risk of heart disease morbidity. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty participants were
assigned into either a control (<italic>n</italic> = 10) or a supervised exercise program
(<italic>n</italic> = 10) group. The 12-week exercise intervention was performed 3 days
per week and involved combined aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and traditional
Korean dance. [Results] Two-factor analysis of variance revealed significant group &#x000d7; time
interactions for body mass, diastolic blood pressure, appendicular muscle mass. For
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and
the ratio of oxidized low-/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, two-factor analysis of
variance revealed significant interactions (group &#x000d7; time), indicating responses differed
significantly between the control and exercise groups after 12 weeks. [Conclusion] A
12-week low- to moderate-intensity exercise program appears to be beneficial for obese
elderly women by improving risk factors for cardiovascular disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Exercise</kwd><kwd>Obesity</kwd><kwd>Oxidized LDL</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Macrophage uptake of oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) induces the
migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells, resulting in foam cell formation, which
develops into the fatty streaks characteristic of cardiovascular disease<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, oxidized LDL is associated
with increased incidences of metabolic syndrome<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup> and obesity<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, and is considered a risk factor for
cardiovascular disease<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. Likewise,
oxidized LDL is closely involved in the pathogeneses of ischemic heart disease,
atherogenesis, and other chronic diseases and also plays a key role in the aging
process<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>A recent study reports a strong association between plasma oxidized LDL concentrations and
habitual physical activity in older populations<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Some recent cross-sectional and longitudinal studies recently
report that plasma concentrations of circulating oxidized LDL are directly associated with
body mass index (BMI), waist circumstance, obesity, weight loss, and physical fitness<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Obesity has important functional
implications in elderly persons because it exacerbates the age-related decline in physical
function, which can lead to frailty and loss of independence<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Meanwhile, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is an independent predictor of
atherosclerotic diseases including coronary artery disease as well as cardiovascular events;
it also increases with age in sedentary adults. Lakatta et al. report CIMT increases two- to
three-fold between the ages of 20 and 90&#x02005;years, even in healthy sedentary adults<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. This increase in CIMT with aging may
increase the risks of pathophysiological disease mechanisms interacting, eventually leading
to peripheral occlusive vascular disease<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Even though these results suggest good cardiovascular and muscular fitness alter this
association by improving plasma oxidized LDL concentrations and/or CIMT, it remains unclear
whether regular exercise in elderly adults positively affects circulating oxidized LDL
levels or modulates CIMT. Identifying effective strategies for behavioral change to prevent
the oxidative modification of LDL and cardiovascular disease in older adults may reduce
cardiovascular disease risk, making this a key public health issue. In addition, exercise
training is a necessary component of lifestyle modification in obese postmenopausal
women<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, no studies have
examined the effects of exercise on plasma level of oxidized LDL in obese elderly women even
though they have increased risks of heart disease and arteriosclerosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Participants were arbitrary recruited from the general population of local communities.
They were asked to complete questionnaires about their current lifestyle, including habitual
physical activity, current medication, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking, before
the intervention. Ten participants were excluded from data analysis because they were taking
lipid and/or glucose-lowering medications (<italic>n</italic> = 4), could not start exercise
programs due to their condition levels (<italic>n</italic> = 3), had a history of
cardiovascular disease, a regular exercise habit, and a high body fat percentage &#x0003c; 30%
(<italic>n</italic> = 3). As a result, 20 participants were assigned to the control
(<italic>n</italic> = 10) or supervised exercise program (<italic>n</italic> = 10) group.

informed consent was obtained from all participants after they were provided a detailed
description of the experiment. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethics review boards
of our universities.</p><p>Physical and anthropometric variables were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks in both
groups. Body weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1&#x02005;kg and 0.1&#x02005;cm, respectively,
using a Venus 5.5 body composition analyzer (Jawon Medical, Gyeongsan, Korea). BMI was
calculated as weight (kg) divided by height squared (m<sup>2</sup>).</p><p>Arterial blood pressure was measured by a mercury sphygmomanometer after the participants
had been seated at rest for 10 minutes. Two measurements were taken at each time point, and
the mean was calculated and used for analysis.</p><p>Leg and arm skeletal muscle mass represents the sum of both right and left extremities.
Total limb appendicular muscle mass was calculated as the sum of arm and leg lean tissue
mass. Appendicular muscle mass was determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar
DPX, GE Healthcare Technologies Lunar, USA).</p><p>CIMT was measured by B-mode ultrasound and a 10-MHz probe (LOGIQ 3, GE Healthcare, WI,
USA). The participants were examined in the supine position with the neck extended and the
probe in the anterolateral position. All CIMT measurements were taken in the longitudinal
plane at the artery proximal to the adventitia&#x02013;media junction. After freezing the image,
measurements were made by electronic calipers. The maximum thickness of the intima-media
width was measured three times, and the mean value was used for statistical analysis<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>At baseline and after 12 weeks, venous blood samples were collected from both groups from
an antecubital vein the morning (0800 to 0900 h) after an overnight fast (10&#x02013;12 h). To
measure triacylglycerol as well as total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels, samples were
collected into tubes containing clotting activators to isolate serum. Thereafter, samples
were allowed to clot for 45 minutes at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged at
3,000&#x02005;rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. After separation, serum was dispensed into plain
microtubes and stored at &#x02212;80&#x02005;&#x000b0;C for later analysis. To measure plasma oxidized LDL, venous
blood samples were collected into tubes containing disodium salt-fluoride-EDTA. Thereafter,
samples were immediately centrifuged and treated as described above.</p><p>The plasma concentration of oxidized LDL (Mercodia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) was determined by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercially available kits. The concentrations of
serum triacylglycerol and total, HDL, and LDL cholesterol were determined by standard
laboratory methods.</p><p>The 12-week exercise program intervention consisted of 3 days per week (i.e., Monday,
Wednesday and Friday) of combined aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and traditional
Korean dance; this program is modified version of a program in previous study on obese
elderly women<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Each exercise was
performed for 15 minutes for a total 45 minutes plus 10 minutes each of warm-up and
cool-down. Aerobic exercise consisted of walking and arms raise; jump and swing arms; side
walking; leg raise to forward back and side; jump and knee up; walking and leg raise;
walking and jump. Resistance exercise consisted of arm folding and spreading; arm raises to
the front and side shoulder turning; waist bending; waist bending to the side; trunk
twisting; knee-ups; and stretching legs and raises to the back and side. Finally,
traditional Korean dance consisted movements of the arms, legs, trunk, and whole body,
including jumping up and to the side as well as balance exercises (e.g., one-legged standing
and one-legged jumping)<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Participants
performed each exercise for 15 minutes at 50&#x02013;60% of the HRR from weeks 1&#x02013;6. After week 6,
emphasis was placed on reaching and maintaining an exercise intensity of approximately
60&#x02013;70% of the HRR for 15 minutes (Polar Heart Monitor; RS400, Finland).</p><p>Data were analyzed by PASW version 18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). The
Student&#x02019;s t-test was used to assess differences in baseline variables. The Shapiro-Wilk test
was used to check for the normality of distribution. After controlling for age and weight,
partial correlation analyses were performed to determine the correlations between muscle
mass and plasma oxidized LDL and CIMT and in all subjects. Two-factor analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to determine interaction (i.e., group &#x000d7; time) effects for all outcome
variables. When significant group &#x000d7; time interactions were identified, post hoc paired
t-tests were performed to detect differences between time points. The level of significance
was set at p &#x0003c; 0.05.

concentrations and CIMT in obese elderly women. The main findings of this study are that the
12-week of exercise program attenuated plasma oxidized LDL and the ratio of oxidized LDL to
HDL cholesterol in obese elderly women. In addition, the program improved CIMT and increased
appendicular muscle mass. Our findings may suggest physical activity has a protective role
against the process leading to cardiovascular disease.</p><p>Several studies show plasma oxidized LDL concentrations are reduced in older men and women
following a high-intensity exercise intervention<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, aerobic exercise training has been reported to
decrease oxidized LDL concentrations in middle-aged individuals with coronary artery
disease<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study, plasma
oxidized LDL decreased in obese elderly women after a 12-week exercise program that included
traditional Korean dance as well as aerobic moves and resistance exercise. These results may
imply that even moderate-intensity exercise programs are effective for reducing resting
oxidized LDL in obese elderly women. The ratio of oxidized LDL to HDL cholesterol is a
useful marker of cardiovascular disease risk factors and is a better biomarker than standard
lipid measurements for differentiating between patients with coronary artery disease and
normal subjects<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the present study,
the ratio of oxidized LDL to HDL cholesterol decreased significantly after the 12-week
exercise program. The negative relationship between oxidized LDL and HDL concentrations is
concordant with evidence suggesting HDL molecules are atheroprotective in part because they
inhibit LDL oxidation<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. Moreover, a
previous study corroborates the present finding that plasma oxidized LDL concentration is
inversely correlated with HDL cholesterol level<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>; a low-volume walking program (90 minutes per week) reduced the
ratio of oxidized LDL to HDL cholesterol in older adults. Thus, a small change in the ratio
of oxidized LDL to HDL cholesterol induced by exercise could have important public health
implications from the perspective of reducing the risk factor of cardiovascular disease.</p><p>After adjusting for age and body weight, changes in skeletal muscle mass of elderly people
negatively correlated with changes in CIMT and oxidized LDL. In the present study, the
relative changes in upper- and lower-limb muscle mass were differed significantly between
groups after the intervention period, and muscle strength improved significantly in the
exercise group. Muscle/joint complaints could affect physical functioning independent of
vascular disease. Previous studies<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>
demonstrate that sarcopenia is associated with an age-related reduction in physical
activity, especially a lack of muscle overload. Therefore, older adults are encouraged to
regularly engage in specific muscle strengthening exercises and/or higher-impact
weight-bearing activities to maintain and importantly to restore muscle health.
Alternatively, moderate to intense aerobic activity such as brisk walking may provide
sufficient muscular exercise to retard the loss of muscle mass or it may serve to indicate
which individuals are performing sufficient resistance activity to conserve their muscle
mass. Accordingly, Park et al.<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup> and
Shephard et al.<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup> report that the
appendicular muscle mass of older adults measured by electrical impedance is associated with
regular habitual physical activity and more closely with moderate-intensity exercise than
volume. To our knowledge, the present study is the first intervention study to examine the
relationships between exercise and measures of muscle mass of the limbs in obese elderly
women. This study also reconfirmed the results of previous studies which found that the
effect of exercise on cardiovascular risk factors in this population<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>This study had some limitations. Time spent performing outdoor activities was not measured,
which could have potentially affected the results. In addition, differences in diet might be
another confounding factor. Indeed, we did not control diets in either group throughout the
study. Finally, the sample size was small, which limits our ability to determine the
significance of the results. Therefore, additional studies with larger sample sizes are
required to determine the effectiveness of regular physical activity.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrates that a 12-week exercise program improves the plasma
oxidized LDL concentrations as well as other cardiovascular risk factor such as CIMT and
appendicular muscle mass measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in elderly obese
women. The beneficial effects of low- to moderate-intensity exercise on outcomes in elderly
obese adults appear to be related to sustained improvement in risk factors for
cardiovascular disease that becomes evident after 12 weeks of exercise. Therefore, low- to
moderate-intensity physical activity should be recommended in conjunction with
pharmacological therapy for elderly patients with chronic heart failure and
arteriosclerosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Dong-A University Research fund.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Mertens</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Holvoet</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Oxidized LDL and HDL: antagonists in
