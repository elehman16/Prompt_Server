This subanalysis of the recently published CRUCIAL trial compared the treatment-related reductions in calculated CHD and stroke risk among Pacific Asian (PA) patients using a variety of region-specific risk assessment models. As a result, greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed in the proactive multifactorial intervention (PMI) arm compared with the usual care arm at Week 52 for PA patients. The relative percentage change in 10-yr CHD risk between baseline and Week 52 in the PMI versus usual care arms was greatest using the NIPPON DATA80 fatal CHD model (LS [least square] mean difference -42.6%), and similar in the SCORE fatal CHD and Framingham total CHD models (LS mean difference -29.4% and -30.8%, respectively). The single-pill based PMI approach is consistently effective in reducing cardiovascular disease risk, evaluated using a variety of risk assessment models.

The combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin was chosen because these drugs have outcomes data from previous clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The CRUCIAL trial demonstrated among patients with hypertension and additional CV risk factors that a greater reduction in calculated Framingham CHD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) could be achieved using a PMI strategy versus UC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>Overall, 31% of patients recruited in the CRUCIAL trial resided in the Pacific Asian (PA) region. In contrast with most Western countries, the prevalence of stroke is higher than CHD in both China and Japan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). The nature of stroke also tends to be different among some PA populations, where strokes are more often hemorrhagic than ischemic, compared with Caucasian populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the strength of the association between some CV risk factors (e.g. hypertension) and CV outcomes may differ among Asian populations compared with Western populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>In spite of these differences, many worldwide hypertension management guidelines recommend use of the Framingham CHD risk equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) to guide treatment decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). The Framingham equation was developed from a 12-yr follow-up of 5,345 middle-class Caucasian men and women participating in the United States Framingham cohort study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The characteristics of the population from which the Framingham CHD risk model was derived has led to concerns about the accuracy of risk prediction among populations with differing risk factor prevalence and CV disease (CVD) event rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Therefore, recalibration of the original equation may be required for accurate risk prediction in some ethnic groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Indeed, the observed variations in CV risk profiles among different populations has led to different CV risk assessment tools being developed from specific geographic and ethnic cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Accurate risk prediction is particularly important among PA populations as, in 2005, over half of the cases of CVD worldwide occurred in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), and this is predicted to rise further as parts of the region continue to undergo rapid urbanization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>To confirm the applicability of the CRUCIAL trial results among patients residing in the PA region, it is important to determine if the reported treatment-related reductions in calculated Framingham CHD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) are consistent when risk is calculated using region-specific risk assessment tools. In this CRUCIAL trial subanalysis, we compare the treatment-related reductions in calculated CHD and stroke risk observed in the CRUCIAL trial using the National Integrated Project for Prospective Observation of Non-communicable Disease And its Trends in the Aged, 1980 (NIPPON DATA80) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) for low-risk countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and the Framingham total CHD risk equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) among PA patients enrolled in the CRUCIAL trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design and patients</title><p>This CRUCIAL trial subanalysis utilized baseline and endpoint data from 448 patients residing in the PA region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The CRUCIAL trial design and principal results have previously been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). In brief, the CRUCIAL trial was a 12-month, prospective, multinational, open-label, parallel-design, cluster-randomized trial. Eligible patients were men and women aged between 35 and 79 yrs at baseline with hypertension (untreated: systolic BP [SBP] &#x02265; 160 mmHg and/or diastolic BP [DBP] &#x02265; 100 mmHg; treated: SBP &#x02265; 140 mmHg and/or DBP &#x02265; 90 mmHg; diabetes SBP &#x0003e; 130 mmHg and/or DBP &#x0003e; 80 mmHg), 3 or more additional CV risk factors, no history of CHD, total cholesterol (TC) &#x02264; 6.5 mM/L, and not receiving statin therapy. Two treatment strategies were compared: a PMI strategy, based on SPAA, and UC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison of CV risk assessment tools</title><p>In this subanalysis, baseline and endpoint CHD and stroke risks were calculated using the following risk assessment tools: 1) NIPPON DATA80 10-yr probability of death due to CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>); 2) NIPPON DATA80 10-yr probability of death due to stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>); 3) SCORE 10-yr risk of fatal CHD for low-risk countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>); 4) SCORE 10-yr risk of fatal non-CHD CVD for low-risk countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>); and 5) Framingham 10-yr risk of combined fatal and nonfatal CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The Framingham total CHD risk equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) was the primary endpoint in the CRUCIAL trial. Although the Framingham stroke model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) was evaluated as a secondary endpoint in the CRUCIAL trial, it has not been evaluated in this subanalysis because it calculates the combined risk of fatal and nonfatal stroke, so is not directly comparable with the NIPPON DATA80 fatal stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) or SCORE fatal non-CHD CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) models.</p><sec><title>The NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) risk-assessment chart</title><p>Death from stroke and CHD during follow-up was determined from the National Vital Statistics register (coded using the 9th and 10th International Classification of Disease [ICD]).

Patients were slightly younger in the PMI arm compared with the UC arm: 61.5 vs 63.6 yr, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). Overall, the baseline mean CV risk scores were comparable between the 2 treatment arms when calculated using the NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), SCORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and Framingham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) risk equations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>At baseline, using the NIPPON DATA80 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) there was a 2-fold increase in the risk of fatal stroke compared with the risk of fatal CHD in both the PMI arm (3.0% vs 1.3%) and UC arm (2.9% vs 1.4%).

The absolute difference between the PMI and UC arms between baseline and Week 52, as calculated by the Framingham equation for total CHD events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), was -6.3% (95% CI -7.76, -4.85).</p><p>The relative percentage change in 10-yr CHD risk between baseline and Week 52 in the PMI versus UC arms was greatest using the NIPPON DATA80 fatal CHD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) (LS mean difference -42.6%), and similar in the SCORE fatal CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and Framingham total CHD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) (LS mean difference -29.4% and -30.8%, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This could be driven by the fact that there was almost no change in NIPPON DATA80 fatal CHD risk in the UC arm at Week 52 (absolute change -0.1% and relative percentage change +5.8%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), while there were small reductions in risk from baseline in the UC arm as calculated by the other 2 risk scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>The relative percentage change in 10-yr fatal non-CHD risk between baseline and Week 52 in the PMI versus UC arms was statistically significant when assessed by the SCORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) fatal non-CHD CVD model (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), but not when assessed by the NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) fatal stroke model (<italic>P</italic> = 0.283) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>BP and lipid parameters</title><p>Greater reductions in SBP, DBP, LDL-C, and TC were observed in the PMI arm compared with the UC arm at Week 52 for PA patients.

During the last 30 yr, hypertension treatment has improved dramatically, contributing to a decrease in the incidence of mortality due to stroke and CHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). However, the majority of patients' BPs remain uncontrolled in all societies, and the decline in CVD, particularly stroke, has slowed in some countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Dyslipidemia is among the top 5 major risk factors leading to CVD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Its treatment has been shown to improve prognosis: morbidity and mortality is substantially reduced in successfully treated compared with nontreated dyslipidemic controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). However, in daily clinical practice the treatment and control of dyslipidemia remains suboptimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this subanalysis of the CRUCIAL trial was to compare, among a PA population, the treatment-related reductions in calculated CHD and non-CHD risk using region-specific risk scoring methods, driven by reductions in BP and cholesterol, rather than to compare the predictive capacity of each risk model. All 5 risk models showed a treatment-related reduction in CHD and stroke risk at Week 52 in the PMI arm compared with the UC arm. It is beyond the scope of this analysis to look at the actual predictive capacity of these models, as outcomes data on stroke and CHD events were not collected during the CRUCIAL trial.</p><p>In our analysis, there were differences in the baseline risk scores calculated by the NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), SCORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), and Framingham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) models. At baseline, compared with the SCORE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), the NIPPON DATA80 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) gave lower risk scores for fatal CHD risk and higher risk scores for fatal stroke in both the PMI and UC arms. In the NIPPON DATA80 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), the risk of fatal stroke was higher than the risk of fatal CHD in both the PMI and UC arms; the reverse was seen when risks were calculated using the SCORE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This may reflect differences in the event-rates seen in the populations from which the risk scores were developed (Japanese versus European).</p><p>It is also important to note when comparing these tools that the definition of the predicted outcome varies according to the risk model used. The NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and SCORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) models calculate the risk of fatal CHD defined by ICD codes 9 and 10, whereas the Framingham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) model calculates fatal and nonfatal CHD based on outcome data collected during patient visits and hospital records. This may partly explain the higher baseline risk seen in the Framingham equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) vs NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and SCORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) in both the PMI (22.0%, 1.3%, 3.3%, respectively) and UC arms (21.3%, 1.4%, 3.1%, respectively). Furthermore, NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) calculates the probability of death due to stroke whereas SCORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) calculates the probability of death due to non-CHD CVD.</p><p>Other plausible explanations for observed differences in calculated risk are that they are dependent on the prevalence of risk factors and associated events in the population from which they are derived. The NIPPON DATA80 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) was developed from a Japanese population, the SCORE model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) from a European population, and the Framingham model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) from a predominately Caucasian middle-class population in the United States. The Singapore Cardiovascular Cohort Study suggested that hypertension may have a greater relative effect on CHD in Asians compared with Caucasians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The Study of Health Assessment and Risk in Ethnic Groups demonstrated that there may be greater potential for plaque rupture and thrombotic events among South Asians compared with the populations of Europe or China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The INTERHEART China study found stronger associations between myocardial infarction and certain CV risk factors, such as diabetes and stress, in Chinese populations compared with other regions of the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Several studies have found that the Framingham CHD risk model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>) overestimated CHD risk in the Chinese population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Indeed, when the Framingham investigators tested their score among different ethnic groups, they found that the original equations required recalibrating for populations with different CV event rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>There are also differences in the risk factors included in the models and how the risk factors were defined. The Framingham total CHD model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), where diabetes was included as a risk factor (rather than a CHD risk equivalent), was chosen by the CRUCIAL trial investigators to reflect their study's inclusion criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Diabetes is also included as a risk factor in both NIPPON DATA80 models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), but not in either of the SCORE models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). This may be an important factor in predicting CV risk among PA patients who had a high incidence of diabetes (59%) in the CRUCIAL trial population. Diabetes was defined as treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, casual blood glucose level of &#x0003e; 150 mg/dL at 2 clinic visits, or fasting glucose level of &#x0003e; 140 mg/dL in the Framingham model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), whereas diabetes was defined as a casual glucose level of &#x02265; 200 mg/dL in the NIPPON DATA80 model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). TC is not used in the NIPPON DATA80 stroke model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), and HDL-C and DBP are not used in either the NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) or SCORE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) models.</p><p>The routine use of the PMI strategy for the treatment of hypertension is more effective in reducing CV risk, by controlling SBP, TC, and LDL-C, than the UC arm, in which taking of a lipid-lowering agent depended on the clinician's decision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>). Hence, the risk of CVD, especially of CHD assessed using the NIPPON DATA80, SCORE, and Framingham systems was consistently and significantly reduced by the PMI strategy compared with the UC arm. However, the risk reduction of non-CHD using the PMI strategy was not outstanding compared with the UC arm when assessed by NIPPON DATA80 because the patients' lipid profile was not included in the NIPPON DATA80 10-yr fatal stroke risk system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). This means that the advantages of the lipid-lowering effects of the PMI arm were not taken into account by the NIPPON DATA80 10-yr fatal stroke risk system. The relative change in 10-yr fatal non-CHD risk from baseline to Week 52 in the PMI treatment arm among PA patients was -12.2% as calculated by NIPPON DATA80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). Therefore, these results suggest that the PMI strategy is effective in reducing the risk of fatal stroke in the PA region.</p><p>The CRUCIAL trial was designed as a relatively short-term intervention (52 weeks) for patients at moderate CV risk, and data on actual CV outcomes were not collected. Calculated CHD and stroke risks were evaluated as a surrogate index for CV outcomes. We believe that comparing the reduction in CV risk after treatment with a PMI strategy (based on the inclusion of SPAA in the patient's treatment regimen) using different region-specific risk assessment tools is clinically important. In the UC arm, physicians made a voluntary decision about whether or not to prescribe statins and which statin to use, based on their best clinical judgment. In daily practice, physicians prescribe a range of drugs to manage individual patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. In the CRUCIAL trial, both BP and lipid parameters were reduced to a greater extent in the PMI arm (SPAA-based treatment) compared with the UC arm. This led to a greater reduction in calculated CHD and CVD risk in the PMI arm using each of the risk-scoring methods evaluated in this subanalysis.</p><p>Limitations of this post hoc subgroup analysis include the small sample size: only 448 individuals in the CRUCIAL trial resided in the PA region, which will give less precise estimates. An additional limitation is that country of residence was used as a proxy for ethnicity in this analysis, so some misclassification bias may have arisen. Moreover, since multiple comparisons have been made without controlling for overall family-wise error rate, caution should be made when interpreting these results. However, despite these limitations, this study has shown that, among PA patients with hypertension and additional CV risk factors, the PMI treatment strategy is an effective approach to reducing calculated CHD risk using a range of region-specific risk assessment tools.</p><p>In conclusion, the PMI approach based on simultaneously targeting BP and cholesterol with an SPAA-based regimen, is more effective than UC in reducing CHD and stroke risk (calculated using a variety of region-specific risk assessment models) for physicians treating PA patients with hypertension and additional CV risk factors in their daily practice. Differences exist in the risk scores calculated using the different region-specific risk assessment tools. It remains to be seen whether an overall risk score tool can be developed that is more adaptable and applicable to different populations and ethnicities with varying risk factors and patterns of CVD.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This study was sponsored by Pfizer Inc.
