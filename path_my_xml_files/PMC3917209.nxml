It is defined as &#x0201c;the displacement of soft tissue margin apical to cemento&#x02013;enamel junction with exposure of root surface.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Gingival recession is well documented in populations having a good standard of oral hygiene and also in those with a high plaque index (PI).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] A host of factors lead to gingival recession, e.g., alveolar bone dehiscence, gingival quality and quantity, high muscle attachment and frenal pull, iatrogenic factors, localized inflammatory processes, hard tooth brushes, traumatizing tooth brushing and tooth malposition.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>The possible consequences of gingival recession are: Compromised aesthetics, dentinal hypersensitivity, cervical abrasions, plaque retention and gingival bleeding, risk of root caries and, also, fear of losing teeth.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Various techniques have been introduced to the field of Cosmetic Periodontology since Grupe and Warren first described the &#x0201c;lateral positioned flap.&#x0201d;[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Subsequently, a number of surgical techniques have been proposed such as pedicle grafts, regenerative techniques and bilaminar procedures.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Of these, the bilaminar technique using subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) seems to be the most promising for root coverage, with a 65-98 mean percentage of root coverage.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>In spite of its promising results, SCTG has its own limitations, such as lack of graft availability, need for a second surgical site, proximity to palatine neurovascular complex and unaesthetic tissue contour at the recipient site.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] To overcome some of these drawbacks and to accomplish optimum root coverage, an alternate technique using platelet concentrate graft (PCG) has been developed.</p><p>PCG is an enhanced concentration of platelets processed from platelet-rich plasma and incorporated into two layers of properly trimmed collagen sponge. Because the platelet concentrate has a higher number of platelets per millimeter, it is expected that it contains a higher concentration of growth factors to accelerate/enhance regeneration.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Moreover, as donor site graft procurement is avoided, there is less post-surgical discomfort involved as well as a relatively unlimited source of graft material availability with this procedure.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hence, PCG can be a viable alternative to SCTG for the treatment of gingival recession.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Twelve patients, fulfilling the selection criteria, were selected for the study from the Outpatient Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology of our institution.

</p><p>The surgical procedure and possible alternatives were discussed and informed consent was obtained from the patients.

Baseline measurements were taken immediately before the procedure. Any measurement falling in the 1-mm interval was considered as 0.5 mm. The following clinical parameters were assessed: PI (Silness and Loe 1964), Gingival index (GI) (Loe and Silness 1963), Pocket depth (PD), Vertical recession depth (VRD) and Clinical attachment level (CAL).</p><p>A visual analogue scale (0-5) form, with &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; indicating negligible discomfort and &#x0201c;5&#x0201d; indicating unbearable pain, was completed by the patients.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>All the pre-operative measurements were performed using a UNC 15 probe by the same examiner who also performed all the surgeries. A second examiner who was masked to the surgical procedure evaluated the clinical sites post-operatively. This evaluation included color match, tissue texture and contour of the surgical area in comparison with the adjacent tissue.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The scoring was from 1 (most favorable) to 4 (least favorable).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Surgical procedure</title><p>After the baseline measurements were recorded, the surgical procedure was initiated. Contralateral sites were assigned at random to one of the surgical techniques (SCTG or PCG) by the flip of a coin.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] After the extraoral skin preparation was done with 5% povidone&#x02013;iodine solution, the patient was asked to rinse his/her mouth with 10 mL of 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate solution for 1 min.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Recipient site preparation</title><p>Following local infiltration with 2% lidocaine, an intrasulcular incision was given on the buccal aspect of the involved tooth. A horizontal right angle incision was then made into the adjacent interdental papilla at or slightly coronal to the level of the cemento&#x02013;enamel junction (CEJ) of the tooth presenting the defect. Two divergent vertical incisions were given starting at least 0.5 mm from the gingival margin of the adjacent teeth and extending into the alveolar mucosa. The intrasulcular, horizontal right angle incision and the vertical incisions were connected and a trapezoidal full-thickness flap was raised 3-4 mm apical to the bone dehiscence; from there, a partial-thickness dissection was then performed apically to allow for coronal positioning of the flap [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">d</xref>].[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Recession depth; (b) Recession width; (c) Crevicular horizontal and vertical incisions given; (d) Full-thickness flap elevation done</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-771-g001"/></fig><p>The preparation of the recipient site included the de-epithelization of the papillae adjacent to the defect. The exposed, affected root surface was scaled and planed and subsequently root biomodification was done with a fresh tetracycline solution (125 mg tetracycline hydochloride/1 mL of saline) for 1 min.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Donor site preparation</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>SCTG</title><p>The Edel trap door (1974) approach was adopted for harvesting a connective tissue graft of 1.5-2.0 mm from the palate using a no. 15 scalpel blade. The graft was placed over the recipient site such that its coronal margin was located at the CEJ and its apical margin at least 3.0 mm apically beyond the base of the defect. Coronal advancement of the partial-thickness flap was done so as to completely cover the graft without tension. The coronally positioned flap was secured in position by independent sling sutures using 5-0 vicryl sutures. Independent interrupted sutures were placed along the vertical incision line for close approximation [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">b</xref>].[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>(a) Liu's Class III type A incision design (Trap door); (b) Split-thickness flap elevation done</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JISP-17-771-g002"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>PCG</title><p>A laboratory centrifuge having a maximum speed of 3500 rpm was used. The blood collection tubes were blue top 10 mL vaccutainers containing 1.5 mL, 3.2% sodium citrate solution.</p><p>8.5 mL of venous blood was drawn and transferred to two 10 mL blue top vaccutainers. These vaccutainers were then placed into the centrifuge and subjected to a 1<sup>st</sup> spin for 10 min at 1300 rpm, which led to the separation of whole blood into the lower RBC region and an upper straw-colored plasma region. The straw-colored plasma was drawn into a syringe, moving the needle from above downwards up to the RBC layer or into the first 1-2 mm of that layer. The contents of the 10 mL syringe were then expressed into red top vaccutainers and were subjected to a second spin for 10 min at 2000 rpm (Gonshor technique for PRP preparation). The contents of each tube consisted of an upper portion of clear yellow supernatant serum, containing fibrinogen and a very low concentration of platelets, the bottom layer, often red tinged, consisting of highly concentrated platelet-rich plasma (cPRP). Two layers of collagen sponge were used as carrier of the platelet concentrate gel. The cPRP-soaked collagen sponge was trimmed to the size of the measured defect. Once the collagen sponge was soaked with cPRP, 10% CaCl<sub>2</sub> was added to cPRP in the ratio of 1:20 along with whole blood. This completed the preparation of PCG.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The PCG of desired dimension was transferred to the recipient site using a similar technique as described for SCTG [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">c</xref>].

Chambrone, Sukakava, Aruajo, Pustiglioni, Chambrone under the Cochrane Collaboration in 2009, ascertained the superiority of SCTGs over the other periodontal plastic surgical approaches for root coverage.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In spite of its promising results, SCTG has some limitations. To overcome some of the drawbacks, PCG has been considered.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrated that both techniques, the autogenous SCTG or the PCG, covered by a coronally positioned flap, were effective in the treatment of shallow gingival recession defects (&#x02265;2 mm) with significant root coverage (87% and 80% for SCTG and PCG, respectively) and clinical attachment gain (2.42 &#x000b1; 0.21 mm for the SCTG group and 1.92 &#x000b1; 0.16 mm for the PCG group) at 12 months post-operatively. The difference between the two procedures in terms of recession reduction and attachment gain are not statistically significant. The SCTG procedure resulted in a statistically significant gain in width of keratinized gingiva when compared with the PCG group, while the PCG procedure resulted in less post-surgical discomfort and superior aesthetic outcomes.</p><p>The mean percentage root coverage with SCTG in the present study was 87%, which is in agreement with the results of the studies of Wang,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Jahanke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and Cheung <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The significant amount of root coverage achieved is attributed to tensionless flap closure and adopting the suturing technique proposed by Zuchelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Optimal gingival thickness at the recession site, optimal donor tissue thickness and stringent post-surgical care were ensured.</p><p>In the present study, preparation of PRP was according to the &#x0201c;GONSHOR&#x0201d; proposed guidelines. It is documented that platelets begin to release their growth factors immediately, with almost 70% of the stored growth factors released within 10 min and 100% within the first hour of their activation. Hence, PCG is applied to the exposed root surface within this time.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] This could have accelerated the formation of an insoluble fibrin network, providing a scaffold for cell migration, proliferation and upregulation of collagen synthesis in extracellular matrix as per the healing model proposed by Wilderman and Wentz,[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] thereby presenting a consistent probing depth throughout the study.</p><p>In the present study, a statistically significant increase in width of keratinized gingiva in the SCTG group (1.50 &#x000b1; 0.56 mm to 4.13 &#x000b1; 0.86 mm) was seen, as with the other studies in which an effort to fully cover the graft were made. A shortcoming with PCG was the quick dissolution of the carrier and shrinkage of the graft, which in turn failed to support and stabilize the overlying flap. This problem was compensated by stabilizing the flap margin 1-2 mm coronal to the CEJ.</p><p>Although the present study obtained significant root coverage in both the groups, in agreement with the results of the studies of Cheung <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] the mean recession depth of these defects fall into the shallow recession category, which can contribute to the absence of a significant difference between the experimental groups. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no other study published where deeper recession defects have been treated with PCG. This could be one of the drawbacks of our study; hence, further studies need to be carried out.</p><p>The PSDL values were recorded by asking the patients to rate their PSDL on a visual analogue scale according to their subjective feelings. The difference in PSDL was judged to be statistically significant for the SCTG group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) at 1 week follow-up, which can be attributed to the second surgical site in the SCTG group. An aesthetic evaluation was performed in the treated sites at 12 months of follow-up, where the PCG group presented superior aesthetics, especially in terms of contour and texture, when compared with the SCTG group, which might be attributed to accelerated early wound healing. In addition, thickness of tissue after surgery was more compatible with the adjacent tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limits of the study, both the PCG and the SCTG techniques resulted in a significant amount of root coverage. The PCG technique required less time and was less invasive, resulting in better aesthetic outcomes with lower PSDL values.
