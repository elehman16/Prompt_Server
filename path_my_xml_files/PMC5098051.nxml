Background</title><p>The function of all organs and health status are dependent on the body water and electrolyte balance (<xref rid="A33125R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="A33125R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Water facilitates biochemical reactions within cells and tissues and is critical for maintaining the blood volume (<xref rid="A33125R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Body water compartments contain electrolytes, which are essential for moving fluid between extracellular and intracellular space and for producing cell membrane potentials (<xref rid="A33125R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). One hour of moderate physical activity produces 0.5 to 1.5 L of sweat and considerable water loss occurs during several hours of vigorous exercise in a hot environment (<xref rid="A33125R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), which can lead to the loss of electrolytes such as sodium (<xref rid="A33125R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="A33125R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The loss of body fluid impairs thermoregulation, circulatory system and athletic performance (<xref rid="A33125R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="A33125R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Soccer is the most popular sport among the Iranian high school students. Hundreds of high school students in Iran participate in soccer training programs during summer holidays which last for three months. Soccer is a combination of aerobic and anaerobic activities, leading to high rates of metabolic heat production and may cause dehydration during hot summer days (<xref rid="A33125R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). We are unaware of any studies about dehydration in the Iranian young soccer players, but a recent study by Da Silva et al showed that mean sweat losses were approximately 2.5 L in young soccer players during a match played in the heat (31.0 &#x000b1; 2.0&#x000b0;C) and the players replaced less than 50% of their sweat loss (<xref rid="A33125R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Recent data indicated significant water deficit in young soccer players, when water or sport drinks were available, an indication of involuntary dehydration (<xref rid="A33125R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It is well documented that dehydration reduces plasma volume (<xref rid="A33125R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) which in turn will lead to active muscles blood flow restrictions and core temperature rising, both of which compromise athletic performance and thermal regulation during physical activity under hot conditions (<xref rid="A33125R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In general, water and electrolytes replenishment before, during and after exercise and precooling are approaches which have been used to prevent the athletic performance impairment and heat related injuries in a high ambient temperature. Water-immersion, cool water showering, the wearing of ice-cooling garments and cold air exposure are different methods of pre-cooling. Reduction of body temperature prior to a subsequent exercise bout under high temperature condition is the underlying rationale for all the methods.</p><p>In a study conducted by Cotter et al. it was shown that an ice vest with and without thigh cooling + cold air can increase endurance performance during 35 minutes cycling under warm conditions (33&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="A33125R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Booth et al. reported increased distance ran in 30 minutes by 304 m (+ 4%) in a warm humid environment (31.6&#x000b0;C, 60% rh) after water immersion (24&#x000b0;C) (<xref rid="A33125R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Gonzalez-Alonso et al. demonstrated that, compared to the exercise capacity in the control trial, exercise capacity could be enhanced (~ 37%) by pre-cooling to an esophageal temperature of 35.9 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C and reduced (39%) by warming to a temperature of 38.2 &#x000b1; 0.1&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="A33125R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In another study, Schmidt and Bruck using an exhaustive cycling test found that precooling (cold air exposure) improved the exhaustion time (<xref rid="A33125R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Generally, a number of studies have shown precooling to increase time to exhaustion and improve performance in running or cycling.</p><p>To date no studies have assessed the effects of precooling in Iranian young soccer players.</p></sec><sec id="sec210406"><title>2.

Booth et al. and Marino et al. reported endurance performance ( distance run or cycle) improvement after water immersion (<xref rid="A33125R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="A33125R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Cold air exposure (as a precooling maneuver) was found to increase the work output during an exhaustive or endurance type test (<xref rid="A33125R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). The authors interpreted the results in light of reduced thermoregulatory strain (<xref rid="A33125R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), decreased reliance on anaerobic energy production (<xref rid="A33125R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and attenuated plasma volume reduction (<xref rid="A33125R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) in precooled condition. Greater heat storage rate has been reported in precooling trail than in control trail (<xref rid="A33125R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), which allows greater margin for metabolic heat production. Booth et al observed deep body temperature increment immediately after precooling which significantly decreased at the commencement of the exercise (<xref rid="A33125R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). We found no significant change in the oral temperature immediately after precooling, and there was no significant between group difference in mid test oral temperature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl53062">Table 2</xref>). Based on these results, it can be said that the lack of significant difference in exhaustive performance between precooling and control trails might be due to the fact that precooling did not create any heat storage capacity prior to the exhaustive test. Ten minutes of water immersion was conducted in this study, compared with the 60 minutes in the other studies (<xref rid="A33125R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It seems that the immersing duration was not high enough to create thermal gradient for heat dissipation.</p><p>In the present study, precooling attenuated the plasma volume decrement during exhaustive test in the heat condition. At the same time, non precooling group showed reduction in plasma volume, which lead to the significant between group differences following exhaustive test (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl53062">Table 2</xref>). Given this result, it can be said that the amount of fluid loss as sweat was higher in the non-precooling than that of in the precooling. Reduced plasma volume in the non- precooling group following exercise in hot condition, that is characterized as hypovolemia (decrease in the volume of blood plasma) (<xref rid="A33125R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>), is in line with similar other studies which found a decrease in plasma volume (<xref rid="A33125R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="A33125R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). During exercise in the heat, active muscles&#x02019; blood flow must be maintained at a high level to supply oxygen and substrates, On the other hand, high blood flow to the skin must also be maintained to convert heat to the body surface, but hypovolumia can restrict these tissues blood flow (<xref rid="A33125R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="A33125R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is well established that acute anemia induces increased lactate concentrations in animals during exercise (<xref rid="A33125R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), and there is strong evidence that the hypovolumia is responsible for the increase in heat storage and a decrease in heat loss during exercise (<xref rid="A33125R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). These effects can limit the exercise performance in the heat (<xref rid="A33125R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Compared with the non-precooling trail, our precooling maneuver attenuated the plasma volume reduction, but could not induce any positive effects on plasma lactate and exhaustive performance, since no significant differences were found in the post test plasma lactate and exhaustive performance between the two groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl53062">Table 2</xref>). In an earlier study, blood lactate was decreased despite an increase in endurance performance following precooling (<xref rid="A33125R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). It was speculated that decreased blood lactate following precooling might in part be associated with altered muscle metabolism due to the marked reduction in tissue temperature (<xref rid="A33125R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). We did not find any difference in the oral temperature between two groups following precooling. Oral cavity temperature is considered as a reliable index of core temperature when the thermometer is placed into the sublingual pocket, because the sublingual pocket is close to the sublingual artery and tracks changes in core body temperature (<xref rid="A33125R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). In this study, oral temperatures were recorded in the sublingual pocket. Therefore, we can probably say that the similar exhaustion time in two study groups was because of the fact that cold water immersing did not affect the core body temperature to induce positive metabolic change.</p><p>Significant difference in the plasma volume but similar body temperature and exhaustion time in the two study groups seems somewhat paradoxical. It is well documented that a body water deficit of greater than 2% of body weight marks the level of dehydration that can adversely affect thermoregulation and performance (<xref rid="A33125R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). Non-precooling group showed a body water loss of about 1% of body weight (data not presented) immediately after exhaustive test. It seems that the level of dehydration was not high enough to cause an adverse effect on exhaustive performance in the non-precooling group.</p><p>Compared to the non-precooling trail, the exhaustion time was not significantly but considerably higher in the precooling group (40.87 &#x000b1; 12.9 minutes vs. 34.87 &#x000b1; 5.9 minutes). Precooling elicited the similar thermoregulatory and metabolic responses as the non-precooling during exhaustive test. The limitation of this study was the fact that this research was not conducted with crossover design, therefore several confounders, as heat tolerance, heat acclimatization and running economy, independent of precooling could affect exhaustive performance.</p><p>Cold water immersion before an exhaustive test attenuates plasma volume decrement and cannot induce any ergogenic effect on exhaustive performance in the hot condition. The findings need to be verified in a crossover study using a soccer specific test and monitoring the true core temperature.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Paper extracted from the thesis entitled: The
