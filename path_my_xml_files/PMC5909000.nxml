place and chair rising daily exercise on activities of daily living and functional
mobility (ability to quickly rise from a chair and walk) in frail older adults. [Subjects
and Methods] Thirty-one participants were divided into exercise (n=18, age=77.6 &#x000b1;
7.2&#x02005;years; 11 males, 7 females) and non-exercise (n=13, age=79.6 &#x000b1; 7.7&#x02005;years; 7 males, 6
females) groups. The exercise group performed 12 weeks of training, 7 days per week, and
20 minutes per session. The exercise program consisted of low to moderate intensity
marching in place and chair rising movements. The speed of movements was gradually
increased over time. The Barthel index, mean power during chair stand, and time to
complete a 10-m walk were assessed before and after the intervention. [Results]
Significant improvements were noted in the exercise group compared to the non-exercise
group for the Barthel Index (11.6%), mean power (33%), and 10-M walk (14.6%) with a medium
effect size, and relative mean power (power/body mass) (32.9%) with a large effect size.
[Conclusion] The progressive marching in place and chair rising exercise intervention
appears to be effective in improving activities of daily living and functional mobility
among frail older adults.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Muscular power</kwd><kwd>Frail older adults</kwd><kwd>Activities of Daily Living</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Aging is associated with declines in activities of daily living (ADL) and physical function
that can lead to physical impairment, disability, and loss of independence<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, resistance exercise in older
adults has been shown to counter the declines in muscle mass, strength, and power that are
associated with aging and an inactive lifestyle<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. Nursing home residents are often
sedentary and it has been reported that frail older women residing in a nursing home
experience significant progressive loss of muscle mass<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, performance of muscular strength exercise is encouraged
not only for healthy older adults but also for frail people. Although strength deficits are
prevalent in older adults, age-associated declines in muscle power start even earlier.
Oftentimes, these occur in the third or fourth decades of life and it has been shown that
the rate of muscle power decline is faster than that of muscular strength<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Muscular power is clearly an important factor in maintaining independence in aged people as
well as to prevent falls<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. Recent studies have
reported that muscular power might predict mobility and the ability to perform ADL,
particularly when there are deficits in muscular power that limit the ability to quickly
rise from a chair and walk<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. From a systematic review<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, it would appear quite likely that power training has greater
potential to improve functional performance in older adults than strength training. Most of
the power training researches used either regular free-weight or machine-based exercises.
Some of the studies used weight vests, air driven pneumatic equipment and elastic band.
However, there are many older adults who have limited ability to perform active exercises
especially weight-bearing exercises, due to orthopedic conditions, chronic musculoskeletal
conditions, excess adiposity, poor balance, or simply due to age-associated sarcopenia<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Power is defined as the product of force and velocity. Fujita et al.<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup> showed that a normalized relative value (%EMGmax) during
squat exercise for the frail elderly persons was about 75%. Rice and Keogh<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> have previously established that this
would equate to a relative-intensity level of light to moderate. Our hypothesis for the
current study was that by increasing the speed of one&#x02019;s body mass-based squat exercise, the
power of the performed exercise could be increased in frail older adults.</p><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a 12-week intervention consisting
of daily low to moderate intensity marching in place and chair rising exercise on ADL and
functional mobility (ability to quickly rise from a chair and walk) in frail older
adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-one older volunteers who had not previously participated in an exercise program were
divided into an exercise group (11 males and 7 females; average age 77.6 &#x000b1; 7.2&#x02005;years) and a
non-exercise group (7 males and 6 females; average age 79.6 &#x000b1; 7.7&#x02005;years). Considering the
small size of the facility, it was impossible to recruit the exercise group and non-exercise
group from the same facility. For this reason, a similar non-exercise group was recruited
from another facility.</p><p>Initially, 58 volunteers consented to participate into the study. However, five of them
were excluded from the study as they could not be evaluated completely at pre-training test
level. Twenty two participants out of the remaining 53 participants were excluded from the
post-training testing due to reasons such as stopped coming to the selected nursing homes or
because of suffering from illness at the time of post-testing. Thus the data of 18
participants in exercise group and of 13 participants in non-exercise group was used for
statistical analysis.</p><p>The exercise group participants were invited via flyers distributed in a nursing home
(Yasugi City, Shimane Prefecture, Japan) and the non-exercise group participants were
recruited via flyers from a similar but different care center (Nagoya City, Aichi
Prefecture, Japan). The average length of nursing home residence for all participants were
5.6&#x02005;years that ranged from 1&#x02005;year to 13&#x02005;years. The non-exercise group attended the day
service facility at their respective nursing home three times a week. The service consisted
mainly of bathing and feeding. An exercise for 20 minutes a day, twice a week was instructed
by the physical therapist to the chair-based group. However, this group exercise program
mainly focused on relaxation therapy. Additionally, joint mobilization and
facilitation-based physical therapy was provided to any participant when it was demanded or
needed. This joint mobilization and facilitation-based physical therapy was provided to
exercise group participants too when it was demanded or needed.</p><p>The nursing homes involved in this study provided assistance with only instrumental ADL to
their residents and all participants of the current study were able to walk indoors
independently. Assistance was not required for basic ADL such as eating, dressing, or taking
a bath. However, assistance was needed to prepare food, readying the bathtub or shower, etc.
None of the participants were suffering from uncontrolled hypertension, congestive heart
failure, untreated ischemic heart disease, or untreated arrhythmia. No restrictions were
placed upon them by their attending physician in regards to their participation in the
exercise program. The ethical committee of Nagoya City University approved the study
(Approval No. 23). All participants received written and oral instructions for the study and
each gave their written informed consent before participation.</p><p>Exercise training was conducted at the nursing home over a 12-week period on 7 days per
week for 25 minutes per day. Each session consisted of 5 minutes of stretching and
calisthenics and 15 minutes of low to moderate intensity main exercises followed by 5
minutes of cool down and relaxation. Each session was led by trained instructors and was
supervised by the research staff. Exercise session consisted of marching in place (MP) and
chair rising (CR) exercises. Without using any exercise equipment, the speed of the
performed movements was increased gradually over time following real time oral instructions
from the exercise instructor.

Co., Tokyo, Japan). Body mass index was calculated as body mass (kg) divided by the square
of height (m). A version of the Barthel index (BI) adapted by Shah et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> that includes 10 scored items using a
five-point scale was used to collect information about the need for assistance in performing
ADL and to establish a degree of independence in the participants.</p><p>Mean power during chair stand (CSMP) was determined using a linear displacement transducer.
The velocity during a single chair stand was measured using the Fitro Dyne device (Fitronic
S. R. O. Co, Slovakia). This device is a linear-displacement transducer consisting of an
optical sensor within a slotted disk attached to a nylon cord and a microcomputer. The disk
rotates when the cord is extended and electrical pulses corresponding to linear displacement
are generated. The optical sensor detects these pulses and determines the velocity of
movement. The cord was attached to a pelvic-level belt to measure the speed of postural
change during every millisecond (0.001 second) while going from a seated to a fully standing
position. Power (W) was calculated as the product of body mass and velocity during the chair
stand movement according to the power evaluation technique described by Kato et al<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The 10-meter walk (10M) test was used to evaluate the speed of walking a 6-meter
distance<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. A straight 10-meter walking
course on a level ground was demarcated on the floor and participants were instructed to
walk at their fastest voluntary speed. Participants started 2 meters behind the point where
the timing was initiated in order to allow them to accelerate to their fastest voluntary
speed before the timing started. Likewise, the ending point was marked two meters beyond the
timed 6-meter section so they would not decelerate before completing the timed section. The
duration in seconds needed to walk through the middle 6 meters of the course was used for
analysis. As this is a timed test, a lower score indicates better performance. All tests
were performed by all of the participants before and immediately after the training period
of 12 weeks.</p><p>Unpaired t-tests were used for the comparison of groups before the exercise intervention.
Gender ratio and length of nursing home residence of the groups was evaluated by performing
the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. The effects of the exercise intervention were evaluated with
repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Effect size (ES) was also calculated for
each test<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cohen&#x02019;s definition of small,
medium, and large ES (ES=0.2, 0.5, and 0.8, respectively) was used<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>.

and chair rising exercises on ADL and functional mobility in frail older men and women.
After the 12-week program, the BI, 10M, and CSMP (both absolute and relative values)
significantly improved with medium to large ES. Furthermore, improvements in CSMP were
greater than 30%.</p><p>One of our previous studies utilized receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to
identify a threshold of chair stand power that is necessary to independently perform ADL in
community-dwelling older women<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Results
of that study identified the threshold of chair stand power to be 214&#x02005;W with 82.1%
sensitivity and 81.2% specificity. In the current study, the CSMP of the exercise group at
baseline was much lower (183 &#x000b1; 88&#x02005;W) than the threshold of 214 W. However, CSMP
significantly improved to a level well above (241 &#x000b1; 131&#x02005;W) the threshold after training.</p><p>A recent study reported improvement in physical function following high-speed power
training with an average limb velocity of 0.88 m/sec in healthy older adults<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Others have found that even a progressive
heavy-resistance training program of short duration (i.e., 8 weeks) can produce dramatic
improvements in muscle strength as well as significant muscular hypertrophy in physically
active older women<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although the
participants of the current study were frail and not healthy like those of the two
afore-mentioned studies, it appears that frail older adults are capable of achieving
significant gains in function using a low to moderate intensity exercise program that
requires no equipment other than a chair.</p><p>Chair-based exercise programs are often provided for older adults with limited mobility
both in residential care and community settings<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. A systematic review of well-designed randomized controlled trials
has previously justified the effectiveness of chair-base exercise<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, the specific exercises used in the current
study, along with the progressive increase in the speed of performing these exercises, have
not been previously evaluated. The results of the current study indicate that this training
method is an effective but safe mode of improving functional mobility and this may, in turn,
lead to a reduction in the assistance needed as the aging process proceeds.</p><p>Previous research described the benefits of a dance-based aerobic exercise program that
included single-leg stance, squatting, marching, and heel touching performed for 60 minutes
per session, 3 days per week, for 12 weeks in older women<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><sup>)</sup>. The participants of the current study could not continue the
marching movement for much longer than what was achieved in the current study and therefore
could not participate in exercise at a level employed by many other researchers. However, it
is interesting that the progressive nature of the exercise program in this frail population
was able to result in large improvements with less time spent exercising each day. This may
be attributed to the high frequency of training in the current study. While many studies
require participants to engage in activity for 60 minutes a day, it is usually for only 3
days per week with a total of 180 minutes per week. In this case, participants engaged in 25
minutes of exercise per day for 7 days a week and a total of 175 minutes each week. Thus the
total time spent exercising each week in the current study was almost similar to that of the
previous studies.</p><p>While several robust techniques are available for the analysis of gait including
3-dimensional motion capture systems, force plates, and electromyography techniques, most of
these tools are only used for clinical research purposes<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><sup>)</sup>. In practice, walking analysis is often performed using the 10&#x02005;M
test, a simple method that requires only a stopwatch to assess gait speed over a distance of
6 meters<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><sup>)</sup>. Although commonly called the
10&#x02005;M test<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>, it is really a well-accepted
misnomer in that only 6 meters are actually measured as two meters are not timed at both the
beginning and end of the 10-meter course to allow for acceleration and deceleration. It is
worth noting that although the current study did not incorporate walking directly as part of
the exercise program, significant improvements in walking speed were observed. This may be
due to a synergistic effect between marching in place and chair rising exercise. During the
intervention, participants progressively increased the speed of movement and this appears to
have translated into a faster gait speed. More research is needed to determine if these
exercises can achieve similar results if performed separately or if it truly is a
synergistic effect.</p><p>The BI is a popular instrument for assessing ADL<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><sup>)</sup> and its reliability and validity have been justified in previous
studies either in its original form or in modified form<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. The original BI
assesses an individual&#x02019;s capacity to perform 10 daily tasks without assistance and provides
a summed, overall score that reflects the individual&#x02019;s level of independence<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><sup>)</sup>. Of the various modifications to the BI
scoring system that have been suggested, Shah et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> proposed a five-point scale to increase the ability to detect
changes in ADL and this version eventually became the preferred method.</p><p>A universally-accepted definition of frailty has yet to be developed. Fried et al.<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><sup>)</sup> have proposed an often-cited phenotypic
definition of frailty based on readily identifiable physical aspects. According to them,
three or more of the following characteristics support a diagnosis of frailty: unintended
weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slow gait speed, and low physical activity. Based on this
definition of frailty, not all of our participants may have been frail, however all of them
did need assistance to complete their ADL. It is also obvious that they had slower gait
speeds as indicated by their baseline 10-meter walk (12.5 &#x000b1; 3.4 sec) performance, reduced
ability to perform ADL as indicated by their baseline BI score, and they had muscular
weakness as indicated by their baseline CSMP (183 &#x000b1; 88&#x02005;W) level. Based on these measures, it
can be argued that the participants were indeed frail.</p><p>A limitation of the current study was that the non-exercise and the exercise groups did not
come from the same care giving facility. In addition, although the average body mass at
baseline was significantly different between the groups, no significant difference was noted
in the mean value of CSMP per&#x02005;kg of body mass. In the current study, it could not be
determined if this difference in average body mass influenced the outcomes. Future study is
needed to overcome this limitation.</p><p>In conclusion, the 12-week program of progressive marching in place and chair rising daily
exercise seems to be effective in improving ADL and functional mobility, or the ability to
quickly rise from a chair and walk, in frail older people.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>None.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge the participants for their voluntary involvement in this study.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><person-group><name><surname>Spirduso</surname><given-names>WW</given-names></name></person-group>: Physical dimensions of aging.
