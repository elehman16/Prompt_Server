The marketed product is formulated with DuraSite<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (InSite Vision Inc., Alameda, CA, USA), a mucoadhesive polymer delivery system designed to prolong the drug&#x02019;s residence time on the ocular surface, and facilitate long-acting topical antibacterial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Besifloxacin is an 8-chlorofluoroquinolone that has an R7-aminoazepinyl group with broad spectrum in vitro activity against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative ocular pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The mechanism of action of besifloxacin involves inhibition of bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, enzymes which are essential for the synthesis and replication of bacterial DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Unlike older fluoroquinolones, besifloxacin demonstrates relatively balanced activity against both DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV; this minimizes the likelihood of resistance, which would require concomitant mutations in both enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Three large clinical trials have established the safety and efficacy of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% compared with vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or active comparator (moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] when given three times a day for 5&#x000a0;days to treat acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The FDA approved labeling for besifloxacin, like most other topical ophthalmic antibacterials, recommends a 7-day treatment period for bacterial conjunctivitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Because besifloxacin exposure in the efficacy studies was limited to 5&#x000a0;days, the objective of this study was to compare safety outcomes associated with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;%, administered three times a day for 7&#x000a0;days, with those reported with the use of vehicle alone.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trial designed to evaluate the safety of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% compared to vehicle in patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis. The study involved 24 investigators at 24 sites across the United States. The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each facility, and written, informed consent was obtained for all subjects prior to enrollment. For all subjects younger than 18&#x000a0;years of age, signed consent was required of a legally authorized representative; subjects between the ages of 6 and 17&#x000a0;years also co-signed the consent forms.</p><p>The patient inclusion criteria were: age 1&#x000a0;year or greater; clinical diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis as evidenced by a minimum grade of 1 for both purulent conjunctival discharge (Scale: 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;absent; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mild; 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate; 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe) and bulbar conjunctival injection (Scale: 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;normal; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;mild; 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;moderate; 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;severe) in at least one eye; and pin-hole visual acuity (VA) equal to or better than 20/200 in both eyes (using age-appropriate VA testing). All subjects using contact lenses were instructed to discontinue contact lens wear for the entire study.</p><p>Patient exclusion criteria included: uncontrolled systemic and/or debilitating disease; known hypersensitivity to besifloxacin, fluoroquinolones, or any component of the study medication; current or expected treatment with systemic NSAIDs (exception: &#x02264;81&#x000a0;mg/day of acetylsalicylic acid), systemic corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, systemic antibacterial agents; current or anticipated ocular therapy (either eye) with any ophthalmic solutions (tear substitutes, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, decongestants, antibacterial agents, immunosuppressant agents); ocular surgery (including laser surgery), either eye, within 6&#x000a0;weeks prior to study entry; suspected viral or allergic conjunctivitis; suspected iritis; history of recurrent corneal erosion syndrome; active ulcerative keratitis; and compromised immunity.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Treatment and Follow-Up</title><p>The subjects were randomized to treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% or vehicle in a 2:1 ratio. The vehicle was identical to that used for the besifloxacin formulation without the active ingredient. Both treatments contained benzalkonium chloride 0.01&#x000a0;%.</p><p>Beginning at the first visit (Visit 1, Day 1), subjects instilled one drop of study treatment in the infected eye(s) three times daily at approximately 6-h intervals, continuing through Day 7. If patients with conjunctivitis in only one eye developed an infection in the other (fellow) eye during the study treatment period, the subject was instructed to begin using their study treatment in that eye as well. All study treatments were collected at visit 2 (Day 8). Subjects were asked to complete diary records of study treatment instillation, and medication bottles were also weighed to assess compliance. The investigators, subjects, and all other study personnel involved in the monitoring or conduct of the study were masked to the treatment received.</p><p>Cultures of the cul de sac of infected eyes were taken at each visit, before any treatment was instilled. Subjects were considered culture confirmed if the colony count (in CFU/mL) equaled or exceeded the threshold value on the Cagle list, as modified by Leibowitz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. On this list the threshold is high for species commonly found in healthy subjects&#x02019; eyes (e.g., &#x02265;1,000&#x000a0;CFU/mL for corynebacteria, &#x02265;100&#x000a0;CFU/mL for <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>), but low for species that are usually not encountered (e.g., &#x02265;1&#x000a0;CFU/mL for <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>), thereby reducing the likelihood of characterizing an infection as culture-confirmed due to the presence of commensal bacteria. Only one eye from each subject was designated as the study eye. Study eye determinations were made as follows: For subjects with exactly one treated eye having at least one pathogenic ocular bacterial species at or above threshold at baseline and the minimum required conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection at baseline, the study eye was defined as that eye. For subjects with both treated eyes having at least one accepted ocular bacterial pathogen at or above threshold at baseline and the required conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection at baseline, the study eye was defined as the treated eye with the highest combined severity of conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection at baseline. If that combined severity was the same for both eyes, the right eye was considered the study eye. For subjects whose treated eye(s) did not have at least one accepted ocular bacterial species at or above threshold at baseline, the study eye was defined as the eye with the highest severity of conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection at baseline, out of the treated eyes with the required conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival injection at baseline. If the severity was the same for both eyes, the right eye was considered the study eye.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Outcomes</title><p>Study outcomes were assessed on Day 8 (or +1&#x000a0;day; Visit 2) and Day 11 (&#x000b1;1&#x000a0;day; Visit 3).</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Safety</title><p>The safety population included all subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and had at least one post-treatment safety assessment. The primary safety variable was the incidence of ocular and nonocular treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). The incidence and type of TEAEs reported by the subject or observed by the investigator at each study visit were collected until study exit. For each TEAE, the investigator assessed the severity and causality with respect to treatment. Ocular TEAEs observed in baseline-designated study eyes were of primary interest and are reported here. Because treatment in fellow eyes may not have consisted of a full 7&#x000a0;days of exposure, those data are not included in the primary analysis. Other safety assessments included changes in visual acuity (VA) and biomicroscopy and ophthalmoscopy findings.</p><p>Age-appropriate VA testing was performed at each visit. VA was measured through a pin-hole habitual (unaided) or historical correction using a Snellen chart. For children for whom Snellen chart testing was inappropriate, the Lea Symbols or Visual Behavior (fix and follow, wince, and no wince) was used; VA measurements were attempted in all children. For any given subject, the same VA testing method was used at every study visit.</p><p>Biomicroscopy was performed at each visit to evaluate the following: hyperemia and swelling of the lids, chemosis of the conjunctiva, staining/erosion, edema, and infiltrate of the cornea, cells and flare in the anterior chamber, lens opacity, and vitreous pathology all were assessed using a 4-point scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;None, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Mild, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Moderate, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Severe). Direct ophthalmoscopy was performed on Visits 1 and 3 to assess fundus pathology on a four-point scale (0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;None, 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Mild, 2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Moderate, 3&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;Severe).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Efficacy</title><p>Bacterial eradication, an objective indicator of efficacy, was evaluated in the modified Intent-to-Treat (mITT) population which included all randomized subjects from whom baseline cultures indicated bacteria levels at or above threshold for any accepted ocular bacterial pathogen. Bacterial eradication, assessed at Visits 2 and 3, was defined as the absence of all ocular bacterial species present at or above threshold at baseline. Bacterial eradication rates were determined for the mITT population overall and for the subgroup of subjects in the mITT population with baseline infections with Gram-positive species, Gram-negative species, and by most prevalent species.</p><p>In the species-specific analysis of bacterial eradication by most prevalent pathogens, fellow eyes with conjunctivitis severity meeting the study inclusion criteria that yielded baseline cultures at or above threshold for a species not present in the study eye were included.</p><p>Bacterial eradication rates were reported as observed; missing or discontinued subjects were not imputed. All microbial testing was performed at a central laboratory (Covance Central Laboratory Services, Indianapolis, IN, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data Analysis</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Sample Size Determination</title><p>Sample size calculations determined that at least 324 subjects were needed in the besifloxacin group to provide a &#x0003e;95&#x000a0;% probability of detecting TEAEs that occur at a rate of 1&#x000a0;%, and 162 subjects were needed in the vehicle group to provide an 80&#x000a0;% probability of detecting TEAEs that occur at a rate of 1&#x000a0;%. Assuming a 10&#x000a0;% drop-out rate, it was planned to enroll 540 subjects to yield the minimum required total of 486 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The primary objective was to determine how the rate of TEAEs (ocular and nonocular) reported with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% used three times daily for 7&#x000a0;days compared with the rate reported with vehicle alone. Exact 95&#x000a0;% confidence intervals were constructed around the proportion of subjects and eyes with each TEAE, and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used to test for differences between treatment groups. A similar approach was used to summarize treatment-related AEs.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Study Populations</title><p>The safety population included 514 subjects: 344 subjects treated with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% and 170 subjects treated with vehicle.

The incidences of nonocular TEAEs and study eye ocular TEAEs were low and occurred at similar rates for besifloxacin-treated and vehicle-treated subjects. Ocular events considered at least possibly related to treatment were reported by only 1.2&#x000a0;% of besifloxacin-treated subjects and 2.9&#x000a0;% of vehicle-treated subjects; almost all ocular events were mild or moderate and self-limited. There were no serious adverse events, and other safety outcomes (visual acuity, biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy) were unremarkable.</p><p>While topical administration of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension produces high and prolonged ocular surface drug concentrations, a previous study found that the average systemic concentration of besifloxacin after repeated three times daily dosing was less than 0.5&#x000a0;ng/mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].

The treatment effect (difference between active and vehicle) with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% noted at Day 8 in this study was within the range reported in other studies of topical antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis, or 15&#x02013;39&#x000a0;% at Day 6&#x02013;10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>In previous studies of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% administered TID for 5&#x000a0;days in the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis, eradication rates were already very high at Day 4/5 (91.5&#x000a0;% for besifloxacin vs. 59.7&#x000a0;% for vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; 93.3&#x000a0;% for besifloxacin vs. 91.1&#x000a0;% for moxifloxacin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]; and 90.0&#x000a0;% for besifloxacin vs. 46.6&#x000a0;% for vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], demonstrating the rapid effect of besifloxacin treatment; these bacterial eradication rates were also associated with rapid improvements in the clinical signs and symptoms of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. It follows that although the earliest time point of bacterial eradication assessment in this study was Day 8, it is likely that high bacterial eradication rates were achieved much earlier.</p><p>In the present study, similar bacterial eradication rates were seen at Days 8 and 11 for Gram-positive (82.8 and 84.3&#x000a0;%, respectively) and Gram-negative species (91.1 and 89.6&#x000a0;%, respectively) in besifloxacin-treated eyes. Bacterial eradication rates with vehicle were lower on Days 8 and 11 for both Gram-positive (38.3 and 54.8&#x000a0;%, respectively) and Gram-negative species (71.4 and 75.9&#x000a0;%). The most common bacterial species isolated at baseline in order of prevalence were <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and <italic>S. mitis</italic> group. As expected, bacterial eradication rates for these species also appeared better with besifloxacin treatment compared with vehicle treatment.</p><p>It deserves mention that the besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% formulation contains the preservative benzalkonium chloride (BAK) at a concentration of 0.01&#x000a0;%. The presence of BAK in topical ophthalmic formulations has been shown to have dose-dependent conjunctival and corneal epithelial cell toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], although the clinical relevance of this phenomenon in routine clinical practice, especially with short-term usage, is not yet clear. The very low rate of adverse effects noted in the current study does not suggest any toxicity risk with the concentration of BAK present in the besifloxacin suspension formulation. BAK has also been shown to possess inherent bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; thus, it is possible that BAK contributed to the bacterial eradication rate observed in both the besifloxacin treatment group and vehicle group in the present study, as both treatments contained BAK at a concentration of 0.01&#x000a0;%. Since the present study did not include an additional control group without BAK, any possible confounding of bacterial eradication rates from the inclusion of BAK cannot be fully evaluated.</p><p>In conclusion, the results of this analysis expand upon those previously identified using besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% for 5&#x000a0;days. These new data indicate that besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6&#x000a0;% is safe for use in patients aged 1&#x000a0;year and older with bacterial conjunctivitis when used TID for 7&#x000a0;days, while providing high bacterial eradication rates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was sponsored by Bausch&#x000a0;&#x00026;&#x000a0;Lomb Incorporated (Rochester, NY, USA).
