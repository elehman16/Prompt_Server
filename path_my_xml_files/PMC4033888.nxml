They were randomly allocated to Amoxicillin, Doxycycline, and control groups. Surgical procedures were carried out with complete asepsis as per the protocol. Postoperative assessment of patient variables like swelling, pain, temperature, infection, ulceration, necrosis, and trismus was performed at intervals of 24 h, 48 h, 1 week, and 3 months.

Environmental, acquired, and genetic risk factors modify the expression of disease and may therefore affect the onset or progression of periodontitis.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The hallmarks of periodontal disease are destruction of connective tissue and bone loss which, if left untreated, may eventually lead to tooth loss.</p><p>Moderate to severe cases of chronic periodontitis may warrant periodontal surgical procedures.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Of the various factors that affect the outcome of periodontal surgical procedures, the most important aspect is prevention of infection during and following surgery. Sources of infection during surgery in oral cavity include: instruments, hands of surgeon and assistant, air of the operatory, and patient's perioral skin, nostrils, and saliva.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>As postoperative infection can have a significant effect on the surgical outcome, preventive measures like strict aseptic protocol, anti-infective measures like proper sterilization, disinfection, barrier techniques, and other measures should be taken. If such measures are taken, there is a very low rate of postoperative infection following periodontal surgery,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] thereby obviating the need for using antibiotics as a prophylactic measure. However, in actual clinical practice, it has been observed that different types of antimicrobials are routinely prescribed following periodontal surgery.</p><p>Few studies support the concept of rapid healing and less discomfort when antibiotics are used.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] On the other hand, many well-conducted studies have not supported the routine use of antibiotics after periodontal surgery and concluded that antibiotics should be used only when there is a medical indication or when the infection has already set in.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In India, dentists have been known to prescribe antibiotics more than any other medical personnel, which is based totally on empiricism without any protocol or rationale.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Indiscriminate use of antibiotics carry the risk of development of gastrointestinal tract problem, colonization of resistant or fungal strains, cross-reaction with other drugs, allergies, and increased cost of treatment.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Presently, guidelines for the selection and administration of antibiotics as prophylaxis following surgery are lacking.

Though in actual practice, only a minority of surgical procedures performed in the oral cavity result in any significant post-surgical infection, they could result in needless complications, discomfort to the patient, delay in healing, and can influence the final outcome as well. Hence, majority of the surgeons throughout the world believe in the dictum &#x0201c;to err on the side of safety&#x0201d; and routinely prescribe antimicrobials as prophylaxis to prevent post-surgical infections. Periodontists are no exception to this.</p><p>However, there are neither guidelines nor incontrovertible evidence to support this practice; also, there is no uniform system prevailing in different parts of the world to guide periodontists regarding the type of drug, its dosage, duration, etc. Literature support for routine antibiotic prescription is lacking and few studies carried out to address this matter have provided different conclusions. Hence, as of now, prescribing antimicrobial therapy as prophylaxis to prevent infection during routine periodontal surgery can only be called as empirical and is not based on solid evidence.</p><p>This study, therefore, envisaged to evaluate the effects of antimicrobial prophylaxis on all the parameters of healing following periodontal surgery as compared to no drug therapy, besides attempting to find out the actual incidence of post-surgical infections. The patients recruited were all systemically healthy, belonged to a comparable age range, and were compliant. Oral hygiene maintenance was periodically reinforced and assessed by clinical parameters from baseline to 1 month prior to the surgery. Patients who did not maintain adequate oral hygiene and who were noncompliant were not included in the study as literature reviews have shown that noncompliant subjects had the highest risk of recurrent periodontitis, even if they had completed the treatment plan. The surgical technique and the type of periodontal defects were also standardized.</p><p>Results of the study clearly showed that properly performed periodontal surgery does not result in post-surgical infection or any complications. This was amply substantiated by lack of any undesirable outcome such as persistent excessive pain, severe swelling, abscess formation, ulceration, and necrosis in any of the patients. None of the patients had any noticeable systemic effect following surgery. These results correspond with the reported results of the studies done earlier,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] but literature review has supported the potential beneficial effects of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with systemic involvement.</p><p>Amoxicillin and Doxycycline were chosen for the two experimental groups, mainly because most of the dental practitioners prefer Amoxicillin whereas majority of the periodontists prefer Doxycycline for its effect against periodontal pathogens due to convenience of its usage, which thereby improves patient compliance. Metronidazole was not considered, as patient compliance has been found to be poor due to its side effects.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Different patient variables (ulceration or necrosis, signs of delayed healing, adverse systemic effects such as fever, malaise, lassitude, etc.) indicated that there was no difference between any of the groups. These findings are in agreement with those of earlier studies.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The role of antimicrobials in improving periodontal variables following surgery is controversial.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Studies in which randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted reported that selective antimicrobial agents when used as adjunctive to periodontal surgical procedures improved the periodontal parameters,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] whereas meta-analysis studies reported that adjunctively used systemic antimicrobials did not show statistically significant results.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] However, in this study, there was no difference in the periodontal parameters such as plaque index, gingival inflammation, pocket depth reduction, or CAL among the different groups.</p><p>Hence, this study has clearly demonstrated that routine periodontal surgery when properly performed does not result in post-surgical infection and produces beneficial outcome regardless of whether prophylactic antimicrobials have been prescribed or not.</p><p>In this era where antimicrobials are being prescribed without any basis, it often leads to abuse and misuse of them. The development of various resistant strains of microorganisms has frequently resulted in serious unmanageable infections.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Hence, the outcome of this study is very significant, particularly in a country like India where there is no antibiotic policy prescribed by the regulatory bodies.</p><p>But it should be understood that this study was carried out in a hospital setting with a strong surgical protocol. Whether the same result can be obtained in an ordinary clinical setting, especially in a dental clinic setup, is questionable. Further studies are required to be done in less than ideal settings before it can be unequivocally recommended to discontinue the use of prophylactic antimicrobial drug following periodontal surgical procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this study revealed that periodontal surgery done under strict surgical protocol did not result in postoperative infection, irrespective of whether antibiotics were prescribed or not. Hence, it is concluded that prophylactic medication of patients with antibiotics who are otherwise healthy following routinely properly performed periodontal surgery is unnecessary and has no demonstrable additional benefits.</p><p>Further studies need to be conducted in different clinical settings before recommending changes in the antibiotic policy for surgical procedures.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
