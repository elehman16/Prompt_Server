It is the regional anesthetic technique of choice for postoperative analgesia following male pediatric circumcision [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Despite the widespread use of sub pubic DPNB, a significant proportion of these patients require rescue opioid analgesia per operatively [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. As all circumcisions are performed in day care procedures and the administration of a strong opioid may delay patients discharge, enhancing the analgesic potency of the block seems to be very useful. The aim of our study was to improve the DPNB analgesic effect by the adjunction of clonidine as an adjuvant to bupivacaine 0.5% in this block.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Methods</title><p>The local ethics committee of Hedi Chaker university hospital approved this study, and parental consent was obtained for each case. Forty ASA I (American society of anesthesiologists) unpremedicated children, aged from 1 to 5 years (&#x000b5;g20 kg) and undergoing day-case male circumcision, were enrolled in this prospective, randomized, and double-blind study. Exclusion criteria were allergy to local anesthetic, genital malformation, past history of penile surgery, preoperative incident and additional surgical procedure other than circumcision. Each patient was randomly assigned to one of the two groups by drawing from a sealed envelope. Dorsal penile nerve block was performed in the operation room, with standard monitoring, under general anesthesia. General anesthesia was induced with Sevoflurane 6% and maintained with sevoflurane 3% in oxygen /air gas flow. The block was performed using the standard anatomical landmark technique. The penis was retracted gently in a caudate direction and the needle was inserted on either side of the midline just distal to the inferior ramus of the pubic bone. The needle was then advanced slowly, in a slightly medial and caudal direction, until a &#x02018;pop&#x02019; was felt as it passed through Scarpa's fascia, and local anesthetic was deposited. We used pre-prepared syringes labeled &#x0201c;DPNB Study&#x0201d; Patients were randomized into 2 groups: <bold>Group 1 (G1):</bold> received 0.1 ml/Kg of bupivacaine 0.5% with 1&#x000b5;g/kg of clonidine in each side. <bold>Group 2 (G2):</bold> received 0.1 ml/kg of bupivacaine 0.5% with placebo in each side. The incision was performed at least 10 min after the block was completed. If, at the time of incision or during surgery, there was a rise in the heart rate or respiratory rate of &#x0003e;25% from baseline, an intravenous bolus of Alfentanyl (20 &#x000b5;g/kg) was given by an anesthetist, blinded to the injected solution in the block. As multimodal analgesia is the standard of care for postoperative pain in our department, supplemental analgesia of paracetamol IV perfusion (15 mg/kg) was provided systematically at the end of surgery. After surgery, patients were observed in PACU (Post Anesthesia Care Unit) for 6 hours by a nurse blinded to the study. In PACU, supplemental analgesia of intravenous nalbuphine increments of 0.2 &#x000b5;g/Kg was provided if the CHEOPS pain score was &#x0003e;7. Patients were discharged to home 6 hours after the admission in PACU if the Chung score was superior to 9. Pain score was assessed by parents and data were collected by phone after patients discharge. We should mention that on the day of the pre-anaesthetic visit, parents were taught to perform their role in the study and the use of CHEOPS score after discharge. At home, patients received oral paracetamol at the dose of 15mg/kg systematically and Ibuprophene was given if CHEOPS (Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale) was superior to 7. Demographic data were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test (age, body weight, size, anesthesia ans surgery duration). The numbers of patients requiring alfentanyl were compared using Yates continuity-corrected Chi-squared test. Pain scores and time to perform block were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U-test. A P value &#x0003c; 0.05 was taken as significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Consort diagram describing the inclusion and randomization process</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="PAMJ-23-213-g001"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="S0003"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 40 patients were enrolled in this study (20 patients in each group).

Consequently, any intervention that would enhance the care of these patients would have a substantial impact. In our study we tried to improve and to prolong the analgesic effect of this technique by the adjunction of clonidine to the bupivacaine 0.5%. In our study we used the landmark technique and we noted no case of penile block failure. However, in recent years, the use of ultrasound has become popular in the performance of regional anesthesia, and several studies have shown the benefit of ultrasound over &#x02018;blind'or &#x02018;landmark&#x02019; techniques [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, others showed no difference between the two techniques for the DPNB [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, our choice of local anesthetic was bupivicaine, compared with the choice of ropivicaine in other studies [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] reflecting differences in practice between institutions. Some studies [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] recommended depositing a subcutaneous bleb of local anesthetic at the ventral base of penis as part of their technique of DPNB. Although this is not strictly part of the DPNB, previous studies [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] have demonstrated that it is an essential part of providing complete local anesthesia to the penile tip. In our study, we performed the DPNB alone in both groups to avoid bias and we showed that it was sufficient to provide per and post operative analgesia. It is known that bupivacaine may be associated with adjuvant such as fentanyl or clonidine [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] to provide longer analgesia [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but few trials studied its effect in DPNB for pediatric patients. A recent study [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] made in children hospital in Tunis including 36 patients undergoing penile surgery showed that the adjunction of clonidine to bupivacaine in DPNB improve post operative analgesia from H1 to H24 and reduce the need for opioids. These results are suitable with ours but it is not yet published.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="S0005"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we showed the utility of the dorsal penile nerve bloc in male circumcision as it allowed us to avoid per operative opioid injections and as a consequence the early discharge of the patient. We also showed that the addition of clonidine to bupivacaine in the dorsal penile nerve block can provide better and longer postoperative analgesia. It can reduce the supply for additional analgesia.</p><sec id="S20006"><title>What is known about this topic</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Penile nerve block can reduce post circumcision pain.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="S20007"><title>What this study adds</title><p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Penile nerve block with clonidine improves and prolongs post circumcision analgesia.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="S0008"><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare no competing interests.</p></sec><sec id="S0009"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>All authors contributed to the elaboration of this study protocol.
