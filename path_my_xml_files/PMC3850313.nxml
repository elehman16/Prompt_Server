ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive technologies
(ART). One of the most severe complications
of ovarian stimulation is ovarian hyper stimulation
syndrome (OHSS), which occurs in 1-10%
of <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF). cycles. Polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients are at high risk
of developing OHSS (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In this particular group
of patients it is important to use an ovarian stimulation
agent which is safe and effective enough to
obtain optimum clinical outcomes during IVF cycles.</p><p>PCOS is the most common disorder that causes
chronic anovulation in the infertile population
with persistently elevated estrogen and luteinising
hormone (LH) levels (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The role of LH in
folliculogenesis is more complex and somewhat
divergent. During folliculogenesis, while follicle
stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the recruitment
and growth of the preantral-small antral follicles,
LH supports the selection and growth of dominant follicles and atresia of cohorts of small
follicles stimulated by FSH (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This physiologic
atretic effect of LH may exploit the monofollicular
growth in PCOS patients. Preliminary data in
PCOS patients that have been treated with recombinant
FSH (rFSH) for non-ART ovulation induction
suggest that rLH can hasten small ovarian follicle
demise and allow for selective achievement
of monofolliculogenesis (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). This could lead to a
reduction in the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation.</p><p>The use of gonadotropin during controlled ovarian
hyperstimulation of PCOS patients is a major
challenge. There have been some controversies regarding
the use of preparations with LH activity in
PCOS women. The use of FSH-only products rather
than human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) in
PCOS, where endogenous LH is already elevated,
is expected to have theoretical advantage and has
been advocated in this group of women (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). To the
best of our knowledge, there are no studies in the
literature which compare the use of hMG and rFSH
for patients with PCOS in IVF treatment.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare
urinary hMG with rFSH in PCOS patients for clinical
outcomes and OHSS rates in IVF treatment
cycles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized controlled trial was
conducted between January 2008-December 2008
in Zekai Tahir Burak Women&#x02019;s Health Education
and Research Hospital. The study was approved
by the hospital Ethics Committee. The protocol
was explained to the patients before they entered
the study and informed consent was obtained from
each couple. PCOS was diagnosed according to the
revised Rotterdam criteria by the European Society
for Human Reproduction/American Society of
Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) as the presence
of oligo-and/or anovulation and sonographically
confirmed polycstic ovaries (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Exclusion criteria
were as follows: females older than 39 years or
serum FSH levels &#x0003e;12mIU/mL, history of ovarian
surgery and/or the presence of severe male infertility
that required testicular sperm extraction. All
patients were treated with oral contraceptive pills
(Yasmin, Scherring, Germany) during the cycle
preceding ovulation induction. Leuprolide acetate
(Lucrin Daily, Abbott Cedex, Istanbul, Turkey)
therapy was started in the mid-luteal phase at an
initiation dose of 1.0 mg subcutaneous (SC) daily
until pituitary down-regulation was established.
After gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH)
analogue suppression was achieved with an endometrial
thickness &#x0003c;5 mm and serum estradiol
(E2) level &#x0003c;45 pg/mL, the leuprolide acetate dose
was reduced to 0.5 mg daily. For ovarian stimulation,
we randomized patients to one of the following
treatments: hMG (Menogon, Ferring Pharmaceuticals,
Istanbul, Turkey) or rFSH (Gonal-F,
Serono, Istanbul, Turkey) with an initial 150 IU
daily dose. Gonadotropin stimulation treatment
assigned to each patient was determined according
to a computer-generated randomization list.
Gonadotropin dosage was adjusted accordingly by
serum E2 levels and sonographic findings. Human
chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Pregnyl, Organon,
the Netherlands) at a dose of 5.000 IU intramuscular
(IM) was administrated when at least three
follicles reached a mean diameter of 18 mm. The
criteria for coasting in our institute were the presence
of at least 20 follicles, each measuring &#x02265;10
mm in diameter , of which &#x02265;20% of these follicles
had diameters &#x02265;15 mm and serum E2 levels &#x0003e;3600
pg/mL. During the coasting period, gonadotropin
was withheld and leuprolide acetate was continued
at 0.5 mg/d. Blood samples were taken daily
until serum E<sub>2</sub> levels decreased to &#x02264;4000 pg/mL
when hCG was administered. Transvaginal oocyte
retrieval was scheduled 36 hours after the hCG injection.
Intracytoplasmic sperm injection was performed
for all metaphase II (MII) oocytes per our
clinical policy. Fertilization was assessed at 20 &#x000b1;
1 hour and embryo quality was assessed at 28, 44
and 68 hours (&#x000b1;1 hour) after oocyte retrieval. We
defined a top-quality embryo as one that had four
cells on day 2 and eight cells on day 3, with no
multinucleation and fragmentation. A maximum of
four embryos were transferred at two or three days
after oocyte retrieval. This study was conducted
before the new legislation that limited the number
of embryos to be transferred in our country. Therefore,
multiple embryos were transferred during
this study period.</p><p>For luteal support, vaginal progesterone gel
(Crinone 8%, Merk Serono, Germany) at a dose of
90 mg/day was given from the time of oocyte retrieval
until clinical pregnancy (9-10 weeks of gestation) or negative serum &#x003b2;-hCG test (13-15 days after
embryo transfer). Clinical pregnancy was defined
as the presence of a gestational sac with accompanying
fetal heart beat as observed by ultrasound.
OHSS was diagnosed and classified as described by
the Practice Committee of the ASRM (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>For patients, we determined the cycle characteristics
of serum peak E2 levels; endometrial thickness
on the day of hCG injection; duration of stimulation;
total dose of gonadotropins used; number
of follicles &#x02265;14 mm and 10-14 mm; number of retrieved,
MII and fertilized oocytes; number of top
quality and transferred embryos; as well as clinical
pregnancy and take home baby rates per cycle, the
need for coasting, and the incidence of OHSS.</p><p>Statistical analysis of the data was performed
using SPSS for Windows v. 11.5 statistical package
program (SPSS, Chicago, IL). The Shapiro-
Wilk test was used to test for normal distribution
of continuous data. If the normality assumption
for the comparison of means between two
groups was satisfied, we used the student&#x02019;s t-test
for the comparisons of means. Alternatively, if
there was evidence of non-normality, the Mann-
Whitney test was used. Comparisons between
proportions were performed with Pearson&#x02019;s chisquare
or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. All reported p-values
were two-tailed and statistical significance
was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We included 84 women with PCOS treated in the
IVF unit of a tertiary referral hospital in this study,
of which four women were lost to follow-up. Thus,

OHSS in the hMG group, but this was not significant
(p=0.14). All hyperstimulation cases were mild.
Moderate or severe OHSS was not observed in either
group. The clinical pregnancy and take home baby
rates were similar in both groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The occurrence of small-sized preovulatory
ovarian follicles is directly related to FSH stimulation
and leads to ovulation induction complications.
The small/medium-sized follicles are mostly
responsible for high serum E2 concentrations and
vasoactive compounds leading to OHSS (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The
possibility of selectively inducing atresia in this
follicle population without altering the delicate
equilibrium with larger, mature follicles is the key
step in coasting and prevention of OHSS. As a
consequence, this results in reductions in serum E2
levels, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
and other vasoactive mediators; however oocyte
yield and cycle outcome will not be affected. The
demise of a cohort of smaller follicles with the use
of LH during folliculogenesis creates avenues for
new therapeutic possibilities. The atretic effect of
LH in small/medium follicles will induce developmental
arrest while driving the final stages of
folliculogenesis in pre-ovulatory follicles, as has
been shown recently (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>).</p><p>Platteau et al. (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) have reported that stimulation
with highly purified-hMG (HP-hMG) in anovulatory
women in non-IVF cycles is associated with
ovulation rates at least as good as rFSH and a lower
incidence of OHSS. They suggest that LH activity
modifies follicular development and decreases
the number of intermediate sized follicles, which
could result in a safer, more controlled stimulation
cycle. Similar results have been reported in
a study by Smitz et al. (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). According to their
findings, the presence of LH activity in the HPhMG
preparation results in a more selective follicle
recruitment process than the FSH-only gonadotropin.
Loumaye et al. (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) have also assessed
the impact of LH on follicular growth during the
late follicular phase in anovulatory patients. They
stated that rLH alone can trigger follicular growth
arrest, which suggested the existence of an &#x0201c;LH
ceiling&#x0201d; during late follicular maturation and have
hypothesized that there might be a potential benefit
of the usage of LH in ovarian stimulation regimens
to promote mono-ovulation. Another report
on the consequences of LH activity on folliculogenesis
has been reported by Hugues et al. (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
In their study, in patients who over-responded to
FSH during ovulation induction, administration
of rLH in the late follicular phase appeared to increase
the proportion of patients who developed a
single dominant follicle. Thus, according to these
researchers, the use of LH-containing preparations
such as hMG in ovulation induction might
be advantageous in the protection from OHSS.
Our findings have confirmed these earlier studies.
We found that patients who used hMG had significantly
lower serum estradiol levels and fewer intermediate
sized follicles, which might explain the
reduced incidence of OHSS and coasting requirements
compared to the rFSH group in PCOS patients.
We observed no OHSS in the hMG group,
but the difference between the groups did not reach
the level of significance (p=0.14), which was probably
due to the small number of OHSS cases. Furthermore,
ovarian stimulation with hMG and rFSH provided similar clinical pregnancy rates.</p><p>Although the number of oocytes retrieved and
the number of MII oocytes were lower in the hMG
group, the percentage of MII oocytes, fertilization
rate, number of top quality embryos and number
of embryos transferred were comparable between
the two groups in our study. It has been considered
that quality is more important than quantity;
the success criterion has changed from obtaining
many oocytes to obtaining an adequate cohort of
top-quality embryos. In a study by Andersen et al.
(<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), more oocytes were obtained with rFSH than
with HP-hMG, but they stated that this increased
number of oocytes was not accompanied by a
higher number of top-quality embryos. Actually,
the proportion of top-quality embryos was significantly
higher in the HP-hMG group.</p><p>In recent years, rFSH has increasingly been
used in ovulation induction and IVF treatments. A
number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness
of rFSH and hMG in IVF cycles (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>-<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). A Cochrane
review reported the clinically relevant outcomes
of ongoing pregnancies or live births (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
Recently, a meta-analysis of compromising true
randomized controlled trials showed an equivalent
clinical efficacy of these two preparations (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). In
the results of the current systematic review, hMG
has been demonstrated to be superior to r FSH with
regard to clinical outcomes, without increasing the
changes of ovarian hyperstimulation (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Likewise,
in a systematic review of randomized trials,
Coomarasamy et al. (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) showed a significant increase
of 4% in live birth rate with the use of hMG
compared with rFSH following a long down-regulation
protocol in IVF- intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (ICSI) treatment cycles. However, in all
of these studies PCOS patients were excluded and
the only main outcome measures were live birth
and ongoing pregnancy rates. In a recent study by
Torabizadeh (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), the outcomes of IVF treatment
in PCOS patients with different ovulation methods
such as FSH, hMG or their combination were
compared. With regard to fertility outcome there
were no differences observed, however this study
did not investigate the OHSS rate.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first prospective
design study evaluating PCOS patients in
IVF treatment with the outcome measures of pregnancy
and OHSS rates.
The main limitation of our study is its size. Ovulation
induction with rFSH is common in PCOS
women. Since women with PCOS already have elevated
endogen LH levels, the use of hMG is not
preferred in our clinics as with other IVF centers.
For this reason, this study has been conducted with
a restricted patient population. As no data on this
issue are currently available, this study may be
considered a feasibility study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on the current study, ovarian stimulation
performed with hMG in PCOS patients treated
with a long GnRH agonist protocol results in
the same clinical pregnancy and take baby home
rates compared to ovarian stimulation with rFSH.
However, for the consideration of other important
factors such as the need of coasting and safety in
particular, hMG has major advantages over rFSH.
This results warrant further evaluation in a larger
prospective series.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was not financially supported by any
