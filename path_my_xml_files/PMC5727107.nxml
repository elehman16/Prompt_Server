Similar to first-person experience, observational experience affects the effectiveness of subsequent treatments. Yet, it is still undetermined whether the influence of social observation on placebo and nocebo effects to subsequent treatments remains even if related experience occurred a few days ago.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Eighty-two participants were recruited and each of them was randomly assigned to one of the four experimental groups acquiring first-person or observational experience, which was either effective or ineffective. For the first-person groups, participants were presented with pain cues paired with pain stimuli in person. In the effective condition, low pain cues were paired with low pain stimuli, and high pain cues were paired with high pain stimuli. In contrast, the associations between cues and pain stimuli were not established in the ineffective condition. Similarly, for the observational groups, participants received effective/ineffective treatment through observation. Five or six days later, all participants underwent a conditioning phase followed by a test phase composed of two tests, where participants were asked to report their perceived pain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Placebo and nocebo responses to subsequent treatments can be affected by prior experience gained several days ago regardless of acquisition ways, and both placebo and nocebo responses in the effective condition were significantly larger than those in the ineffective condition. Furthermore, once placebo and nocebo effects were elicited, the latter was more persistent, while the former was more likely to diminish.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>First-person and observational experience obtained a few days ago could affect the following treatments, which advance our understanding of the crucial and sustained influence of social observation on placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia, and provide insights into clinical applications.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>social observation</kwd><kwd>prior experience</kwd><kwd>placebo analgesia</kwd><kwd>nocebo hyperalgesia</kwd><kwd>conditioning</kwd><kwd>expectancy</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Learning plays an important role in the induction of placebo/nocebo responses via first-person experience and social observation,<xref rid="b1-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> two main acquisition ways that shape prior experience thereby altering our perceived effectiveness of treatments.<xref rid="b3-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Numerous clinical observations have demonstrated the pivotal role of prior first-person experience in placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia,<xref rid="b4-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> that is, robust placebo/nocebo responses can be induced after repeated exposure to positive/negative treatments in person.<xref rid="b4-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Similar situations can be observed in laboratory settings, where prior first-person experience of positive treatments induces strong placebo responses; negative treatments, on the other hand, may reduce placebo responses and even lead to nocebo responses.<xref rid="b8-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b12-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Similar to first-person experience, social observation can also generate strong placebo analgesia and nocebo hyperalgesia.<xref rid="b14-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, it is still unclear whether the placebo/nocebo responses generated by social observation are comparable to those generated by first-person experience, in terms of their sustainability. If the effect of social observation can sustain, it would be of great significance in clinical applications, as patients could obtain long-term benefits for their rehabilitation from acquiring positive experience and avoiding negative experience through social observation.</p><p>In addition to the sustainability of the influence of prior experience on placebo/nocebo responses to subsequent treatments, there is less attention to the persistence of placebo/nocebo responses. Previous studies based on first-person experience showed that 1) the persistence of placebo and nocebo responses can be influenced by the strength of learning (ie, the number of conditioning trials),<xref rid="b19-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and 2) placebo analgesia established under continuous reinforcement rather than partial reinforcement can be extinguished during the test phase,<xref rid="b20-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> whereas nocebo hyperalgesia, once established, seems difficult to disappear irrespective of the conditioning schedules (continuous reinforcement and partial reinforcement).<xref rid="b21-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In contrast, the persistence of placebo and nocebo responses induced by social observation has not been well examined.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed at examining the sustained effect of prior experience induced by social observation on placebo/nocebo responses to subsequent treatments. Based on previous studies,<xref rid="b3-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> we hypothesized that, as the prior experience in person, the experience induced by social observation would have sustained influence on placebo/nocebo responses. In other words, the placebo/nocebo responses in an effective prior experience condition would be larger than those in an ineffective prior experience condition. Furthermore, compared with nocebo hyperalgesia, placebo analgesia would be more likely to be extinguished. To test these hypotheses, we first investigated the sustainability of the effect of either effective or ineffective prior experience, acquired a period of time ago through first-person experience or social observation, on placebo and nocebo responses to subsequent treatments. Second, we included two successive tests to explore the difference between nocebo and placebo responses generated by the two experience acquisition ways, in terms of their persistence.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>To rule out the possible confounding factors of handedness and gender on pain perception and placebo/nocebo effects,<xref rid="b17-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b22-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> only right-handed healthy female volunteers were recruited in this study (N=82; mean age 20.73&#x000b1;1.56 years). According to self-reports, none had history of major medical or psychiatric illness, or alcohol or drug abuse. All volunteers were informed that the aim of the present study was to investigate &#x0201c;the individual difference in pain perception and its psychological mechanism,&#x0201d; while the true purpose of the study was not revealed until the end of the experiment. The study was approved by Ethics Committee of Southwest University, and informed consent forms were signed by participants before the experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Nociceptive stimuli</title><p>The electrical nociceptive stimuli were delivered using a constant-current stimulator (model DS7A, Digitimer, UK), with three stainless-steel concentric bipolar needle electrodes. Each electrode consisted of a needle cathode (length: 0.1 mm, &#x000d8;: 0.2 mm) surrounded by a cylindrical anode (&#x000d8;: 1.4 mm), which has been proved to preferentially activate A&#x003b4; nociceptive fibers in the superficial skin layers.<xref rid="b23-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> All three electrodes were pasted on the inner side of participants&#x02019; left forearm according to an equilateral triangle shape. Each stimulus consisted of several (ranging from 1 to 20, varied within subjects to elicit graded intensity of pain perception) rapidly succeeding constant-current, square-wave pulses (0.5-ms duration for each pulse), which were presented at 50 Hz, with an intensity ranging from 0.8 to 3.0 mA (varied between subjects to account for the individual difference of pain sensitivity).</p><p>The method of limits (an ascending series of stimuli in steps of 1 mA were delivered starting from subtactile threshold until pain sensation was induced<xref rid="b25-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) was applied to identify the stimulus intensity and the number of pulses for each participant that would elicit a low pain sensation at ~2 rating, moderate pain sensation at ~5 rating, and high pain sensation at ~8 rating on a self-report 11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (0=no sensation, 10=unbearable pain).<xref rid="b26-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Participants were familiarized with the electrical stimuli before the treatment phase and the conditioning phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental procedure</title><p>A random, single-blinded, between-subject experimental design was adopted in the present study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-10-2769">Figure 1</xref>, the experiment consisted of three phases (ie, treatment phase, conditioning phase, and test phase) on two separate days. All participants were tested by a female experimenter, who wore a white coat and had received systematic training about the experimental procedure before the formal experiment.</p><sec><title>Treatment phase</title><p>According to the acquisition way (experience in person vs through observation) and effectiveness (effective vs ineffective) of different prior experience, participants were randomly assigned to four experimental groups (Group 1: effective first-person experience group; Group 2: effective observation experience group; Group 3: ineffective first-person experience group; Group 4: ineffective observation experience group); (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-10-2769">Table 1</xref>) during the treatment phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-10-2769">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Participants in each group undertook a total of 36 trials, which started with a 1-s white fixation cross centered on the monitor with black background in the front of participants at a distance of ~50 cm, followed by a visual cue (either a red or green dot) lasting for 1 s. For half of the participants, the red dot matched with high pain stimuli (ie, high pain cue), and the green dot matched with low pain stimuli (ie, low pain cue), and vice versa for the other half of the participants, to rule out the possible confounding factor of the color of the visual cue.<xref rid="b16-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b27-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> After a 4-s blank, a nociceptive stimulus was delivered to participants&#x02019; left volar forearm. After another 4-s blank, participants were required to verbally rate the pain intensity on the 11-point NRS. The inter-trial interval (ITI) varied randomly between 12 and 16 s. The whole session lasted for ~20 min.</p><p>More specifically, participants in Group 1 received an effective placebo treatment in person, where half of the trials presented high pain stimuli (~8 rating on an 11-point self-report NRS) following the high pain cue, and the remaining half delivered low pain stimuli (~2 rating on an 11-point self-report NRS) following the low pain cue. A metal ring (a sham device) served as the placebo and was attached to the thumb of participants&#x02019; left hands. Participants were informed that the intensity of nociceptive stimuli was constant. The low pain cues would trigger the device to deliver a sub-threshold stimulus that induced an analgesic effect, whereas the high pain cues would trigger the device to induce a hyperalgesia effect. As a matter of fact, however, the stimulus intensities associated to the low pain cues were surreptitiously decreased, and the stimulus intensities paired with the high pain cues were surreptitiously increased. Therefore, after receiving the effective placebo treatment, participants would perceive an analgesic effect of the device (the metal ring), when the low pain cues appear, and a hyperalgesia effect of the device, when the high pain cues appear.</p><p>In Group 2, participants were asked to watch a self-made video where a 24-year-old male demonstrator was receiving an effective placebo treatment. The video was recorded in the same room, in which the experiment took place. The demonstrator was carefully trained to simulate the response to an effective placebo treatment prior to the video recording. The video showed that the demonstrator was sitting in front of a computer screen, with an electrode applied to the left volar forearm and a metal ring attached to the left thumb. The demonstrator received a sequence of pain stimuli following visual cues identical to Group 1 and was required to rate the stimulus intensity. Notably, all ratings of pain stimuli were predefined, that is, the average ratings to the stimuli following low pain cues and high pain cues were 2 and 8 on the NRS, respectively. To ensure the participants focused on the video, they were required to memorize the number of visual cues paired with a rating of &#x0003e;5 and that of &#x0003c;5, respectively.<xref rid="b15-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> After the observation, participants were told that they would undergo an experimental session similar to the demonstrator&#x02019;s experience 5&#x02013;6 days later.</p><p>For Group 3, to ensure that the participants experienced an ineffective treatment (ie, the associations between cues and pain stimuli cannot be established, that is, participants would not perceive an analgesic effect or a hyperalgesic effect of the device) in person, the high pain cues were followed by 9 high pain stimuli and 9 low pain stimuli, while the low pain cues matched with another 9 high pain stimuli and 9 low pain stimuli. All stimuli were delivered to participants in a pseudorandom sequence. Participants wore the sham device and got instructions identical to those in Group 1.</p><p>Participants in Group 4 were asked to watch a different self-made video, in which the demonstrator received the same ineffective placebo treatment as Group 3. Notably, all ratings of pain stimuli were also predefined, that is, the average ratings to the low pain stimuli and high pain stimuli were 2 and 8 on NRS, respectively. In contrast, the average ratings to the low pain cues and high pain cues were identical. The rest procedure was identical to that in Group 2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conditioning phase</title><p>After 5&#x02013;6 days, all participants wearing the sham device underwent the same experimental procedure during conditioning phase. Specifically, half of the trials presented high pain stimuli following high pain cues, and the other half delivered low pain stimuli following low pain cues. The rest procedure of this phase was the same as Group 1 in treatment phase. This whole phase lasted for about 20 min. With this phase, we could assess the influence of prior experience, either induced by social observation or in person, on the newly established placebo and nocebo effects to subsequent treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Test phase</title><p>To verify the persistence of the analgesia and hyperalgesia effects, the test phase was composed of two identical tests (ie, test 1 and test 2), with a 5-min interval. In addition to 12 low pain cues and 12 high pain cues, 12 control cues (ie, white dot) were included in each test, and all visual cues were followed by moderate pain stimuli with a ~5 rating on the NRS. All trials were administered in a pseudorandom sequence. Participants were informed that low pain cues anticipated an analgesic effect and high pain cues anticipated a hyperalgesia effect of the device. In addition, when control cues appeared, participants were informed that the device would be turned off and there was no modulational effect on the perceived pain intensity. The test phase lasted for ~45 min.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>All participants were required to complete three questionnaires before conditioning phase, which included the Chinese versions of the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS),<xref rid="b28-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI),<xref rid="b29-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI).<xref rid="b30-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></p><p>The PCS is a 13-item measure of catastrophizing thoughts that includes three subscales: Rumination (the inability to stop thoughts concerning pain), Magnification (the tendency to exaggerate the threat value of pain stimuli), and Helplessness (the feeling of inability to deal with pain).

Similar to the first-person experience, experience obtained by social observation can increase or decrease expectancies on analgesia and hyperalgesia effects,<xref rid="b12-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> depending on what has been observed.

In contrast, ineffective prior experience could not enhance the level of expectancy, therefore generating comparatively weak placebo and nocebo responses. Consistent with this theory, a previous neuroimaging study showed that a strong placebo induced better analgesic efficacy than a weak placebo, and the response in rostral anterior cingulate cortex was significantly higher to the strong placebo than to the weak placebo.<xref rid="b47-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> It indicated that the efficacy of placebo treatments depended on participants&#x02019; expectancy, which was, at least partly, shaped by previous experiences.

In addition, it may require an additional group with no prior experience as a &#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d; to reveal either prior exposure to an effective treatment enhanced the following conditioning effect, or prior exposure to an ineffective treatment muted it.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>Our observations have two important clinical implications. First, our study highlights that the influences of prior experience gained through social observation on the placebo/nocebo response are similar to those of prior experience obtained in person, and that the effective condition induced more pronounced placebo/nocebo responses than the ineffective condition. Therefore, it is important for clinical practice to increase positive prior experience generating placebo analgesia and to decrease negative prior experience producing nocebo hyperalgesia,<xref rid="b55-jpr-10-2769" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> through not only first-person experience, but also social observation. Enhanced placebo effect and/or reduced nocebo effect would promote patients&#x02019; rehabilitation by optimizing their treatment expectancy.</p><p>Second, it is worth noting that the nocebo response was more significant than the placebo response, and nocebo response is more likely to persist. Thus, the negative prior experience generating nocebo hyperalgesia should be emphasized in clinical applications, as it is likely to trigger a undesirable response to subsequent treatments, which would increase the severity of symptoms immediately and persistently.

design.</p><p><bold>Notes:</bold> The experimental procedure consisted of three phases on two separate days, including treatment phase, conditioning phase, and test phase (tests 1 and 2). (<bold>A</bold>) Treatment phase. First-person experience refers to receiving treatment in person, and observation experience refers to observing a treatment. For the effective condition, visual cues with different colors were paired with nociceptive stimuli with different intensities (low pain cues were paired with low pain stimuli, and high pain cues were paired with high pain stimuli). In contrast, for the ineffective condition, low pain cues were paired with low pain stimuli in one half of the trials, but paired with high pain stimuli in the other half of the trials (the same for high pain cues). In this phase, participants were randomly assigned to four experimental groups divided by &#x0201c;Acquisition Way&#x0201d; (first-person/observation experience) and &#x0201c;Effectiveness&#x0201d; (effective/ineffective). &#x0201c;Effective&#x0201d; means the associations between cues and pain stimuli were established. When the low pain cues appeared, participants perceived an analgesic effect of the device (the metal ring). When the high pain cues appeared, participants perceived a hyperalgesic effect of the device. &#x0201c;Ineffective&#x0201d; means the associations between cues and pain stimuli were not established, and participants could not perceive analgesic effect/hyperalgesic effect. Group 1: effective first-person experience group; Group 2: effective observation experience group; Group 3: ineffective first-person experience group; Group 4: ineffective observation experience group. (<bold>B</bold>) Conditioning phase. After 5&#x02013;6 days, all participants underwent the same conditioning procedure. Visual cues with different colors were paired with nociceptive stimuli with different intensities, that is, low pain cues were consistently paired with low pain stimuli, and high pain cues were consistently paired with high pain stimuli. (<bold>C</bold>) Test phase. The test phase was composed of two tests (tests 1 and 2), with a 5-min interval. All visual cues (low pain, control, and high pain) were followed by moderate pain stimuli.
