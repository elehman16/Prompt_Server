The sensitivity of C-reactive protein (CRP) as inflammatory marker irrespective of the cause is well-identified, with the query about the specificity. Procalcitonin (PCT) has been widely studied as a marker for bacterial infection. The utility of this marker in severe sepsis is now widely acknowledged. Limper <italic>et al</italic>. described it as a differentiating biomarker among infections from noninfectious fever.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Two or more of the following conditions characterize systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS): Temperature &#x0003e;38.5&#x000b0;C or &#x0003c;35.0&#x000b0;C, heart rate of &#x0003e;90 beats/min, respiratory rate of &#x0003e;20 breaths/min or PaCo<sub>2</sub> of &#x0003c;32 mm Hg, and white blood cell count of &#x0003e;12,000 cells/ml, &#x0003c;4000 cells/ml, or &#x0003e;10% immature (band) forms.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Sepsis and its sequelae are common causes of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), and delayed diagnosis and treatment are associated with increased mortality.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The clinical features of sepsis and noninfectious SIRS are very similar. The sensitivity and specificity of physiologic parameters such as criteria for SIRS is lacking. Microbiologic data are time consuming and may be nondiagnostic, as negative cultures do not exclude infection and the microbiologic diagnostic procedure requires at least 1-2 days for providing accurate quantitative results. Furthermore, viral infections are even more difficult to assess.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Therefore, a rapidly obtainable marker that is capable of discriminating sepsis from noninfectious SIRS would be clinically useful. An ideal marker of infection would be highly specific, highly sensitive, and easy to measure, rapid, inexpensive, and correlated with the severity and prognosis of infection. In critically ill patients, confined information usually could be retrieved from a CRP measurement due to a relatively long clinical half-life, misleading assay in reinfection, and delayed response.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] PCT plasma level increases in severe bacterial or fungal infections or sepsis and concentrations as high as 1000 ng/ml have been reported in sepsis and septic shock; however, localized bacterial infections, viral infections, and autoimmune and allergic disorders are not PCT inducers.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Procalcitonin tend to be increased in bacterial sepsis, which seems to be related to the degree of microbial invasion, was first mentioned by Assicot <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The exact origin of PCT production is not known, but the liver seems to be the major location of production. A large amount of PCT had been produced after stimulation of human hepatocytes with tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1; and interleukin 6 (IL-6).[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Under normal physiological conditions, the PCT serum level is extremely low, usually below 0.01 ng/ml, and in viral infection and inflammation concentrations is slightly increased, but rarely above 1 ng/ml.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, levels up to 500 ng/ml or more have been described in bacterial infections.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Critical care outcome predictors include clinical, diagnostic, and physiologic variables that are well-identified. The acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE-II) scoring system is commonly used in intensive care populations for outcome prognostication, and comparison of medical care acuity in different ICUs, it was created for assessing disease severity in adult patients admitted to ICUs.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>The relation between PCT concentrations and the severity of organ dysfunction indicated by a sepsis-related organ failure assessment (SOFA) score,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] in patients with multiorgan dysfunction (MOD) secondary to systemic inflammation of infectious or noninfectious origin needs to be studied. We hypothesize that PCT is a better stigma for sepsis than CRP and may have a predictive rule in early or late sepsis-related mortality.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aim of the work</title><p>The aim of the work is to compare the clinical informative value of PCT and CRP plasma concentration in the detection of infection/sepsis; to investigate the relation between both markers and the severity of organ dysfunction assessed by the SOFA score, and to study the mortality predictive power of PCT versus CRP.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>During the period of the month between March 1, 2011 and March 31, 2012, after approval of the Ethical Committee, where informed consent was obtained from the patient or next of kin to be enrolled in the study, which was prospective with purposive sampling conducted over a period of 1 year, all consecutive adult patients aged &#x02265;15 years admitted to the general ICU in tertiary health care institution in critical care medicine department with signs and symptoms of SIRS, sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock (according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine [ACCP/SCCM] definition),[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] were included in this prospective cohort study (138 patients total were included). The following patient categories were excluded: Age &#x0003c;15 years; chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh Class B or C); pancreatitis (serum lipase 3 times the upper limit); surgical patients (major thoracoabdominal surgery within 3 weeks); trauma patients; subjects with burns; and known immune suppressed state (corticosteroid causing immunosuppression, organ transplant recipient, leucopenia, or neutropenic and hematological malignancy).</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Clinical and functional investigations</title><p>The APACHE-II score was used to determine the initial severity of illness.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] PCT, CRP, and SOFA scores were determined daily for 7 days (from the time of admission).

Inter-assay and intra-assay variation at high and low concentrations is &#x0003c;8% and 7%, respectively. For PCT, the upper normal limit is 0.5 ng/ml. For CRP, the upper normal limit is 0.5 mg/dl. Retrospectively, after analysis of all diagnostic criteria, patients were categorized with the help of the criteria of the consensus conference of the ACCP/SCCM.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS statistical software (version 16.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Taking into account that data were nonnormally distributed, a Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare two independent samples.

A <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant. We used the Chi-square test to find PCT and CRP cut-off values for the different SIRS groups.

This was proven again by ROC curves in which the AUC for the CRP for Group II was 0.64 and for Group III was 0.59, while the AUC for the PCT for Group II was 0.77 and for Group III was 0.75.

In our study, we found a significantly higher PCT in nonsurvivors [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>], which was not the case in CRP. Acute-phase proteins are clinically the most widely used biomarkers. High levels of the acute-phase proteins CRP and PCT at the onset of sepsis have been described to be associated with a dismal outcome.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, substantial overlaps between survivors and nonsurvivors in the initial plasma levels of those inflammation markers have also been reported.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Tschaikowsky <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] prospectively evaluated PCT, IL-6, and CRP as a percentage of baseline (POB) to predict survival at day 28 after sepsis onset. In survivors, PCT and IL-6 significantly decreased from days 1 to 14, whereas CRP did not. However, no single cut-off value of PCT, IL-6, or CRP POB allowed survival prediction; moreover, they added that it might be used to guide duration of therapy in critically ill patients.</p><p>In our study, we found statistically significant positive correlation between CRP and SOFA scores from days 4 to 7 by using a Spearman correlation test [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>]. In their study Ferreira <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] they found a similar relationship and reported that an increase in CRP and SOFA scores during the first 48 h in the ICU predicts a mortality rate of at least 50%, while a decreasing SOFA score is associated with a decrease in mortality rates from 50% to 27%, respectively. On the other hand [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>], there was a statistically significant positive correlation between PCT and SOFA scores from days 1 to 7 when using a Spearman correlation test. The changes with PCT were earlier than CRP. Su <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] designed an elegant study that enrolled 144 ICUs. They found similar early changes in serum PCT that correlate with SOFA scores, and they added that the sepsis group had higher serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1, PCT, and CRP levels compared with the SIRS group, concluding that PCT concentrations are associated with the severity of MODs as assessed by the SOFA score.</p><p>We studied the correlation between PCT and CRP versus the APACHE-II score at day 1 [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Our results found a statistically significant positive correlation between PCT and APACHE-II scores by using a Spearman correlation test, and they failed to find a statistically significant correlation between CRP and APACHE-II score by using a Spearman correlation test. Our results are similar to a study done by Wilhelm <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who compared the prognostic value of APACHE-II and SOFA scores, and the biomarkers CRP, PCT, and IL-6 at the time of admission to stratify patients at risk for ICU treatment. They found that all scores and biomarkers showed significant AUC values of ROC curve analysis for death within 30 days: 0.801 for APACHE-II, 0.693 for CRP, and 0.651 for PCT. For treatment in an ICU and ventilatory support demand, significant AUC value parameters were found; however, only APACHE-II, SOFA, and PCT showed significant AUC values for renal replacement therapy.</p><p>The ROC curves comparing the kinetics of both PCT and CRP relative to inflammation severity (as assessed by SOFA score) showed that the AUC on day 1 was 0.77 versus 0.52 for PCT and CRP, respectively, while on day 5, the AUC was 0.71 versus only 0.58 for PCT and CRP, respectively [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>]. At the end of the study period, the median CRP remained significantly high (56.6 mg/L) while the PCT median level was approaching the normal value (0.53 ng/ml). This could be explained by improvement of infection with continuation of the inflammatory process. This observation was already described by several authors and thus is not focused on in this study. A study carried out by Silvestre <italic>et al</italic>., measuring the CRP in all patients at ICU discharge found that CR<italic>P</italic> values varied from 0.15 to 43.5 mg/L. Moreover, they concluded that serum CRP concentration was a poor indicator of post-ICU prognosis at discharge. Post-ICU death appears to be unrelated to the persistent inflammatory response.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Monneret <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] found that PCT was increased within 6 h after the initial stimulus, and CRP did not significantly increase before 12 h after the onset of induction. Furthermore, under clinical conditions, a speedy increase of PCT compared with CPR was described after the onset of severe inflammation. Moreover, the decline of PCT concentrations occurred more rapidly than that of CRP.</p><p>With increasing categories of the SOFA score, denoting the severity of MODs, higher PCT concentrations were monitored, and our results show that PCT concentrations are associated with the severity of MODs as assessed by the SOFA score as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>, where both CRP and PCT plasma levels increase with an increased SOFA score. However, the PCT level correlated better than the CRP level in assessing the severity of SOFA as shown by AUC, and the CRP level was elevated irrespective of the scores observed. Moreover, it has been shown that PCT levels correlate with the severity of sepsis and organ failure [Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>]. Castelli <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] hypothesized that PCT and CRP concentrations are different in patients with infection and no infection at a similar severity of organ dysfunction or systemic inflammatory response. Enrolling 138 adult ICU patients and observing them consecutively over a period of 10 days, then comparing PCT, CRP, and infectious parameters in the studied groups, Castelli <italic>et al</italic>., found that PCT and CRP concentrations were higher in patients in whom infection was diagnosed at comparable levels of organ dysfunction, although the correlation with the SOFA score was weak and the CRP levels were already near their maximum at lower SOFA scores, whereas the highest PCT concentrations correlated with higher score levels. They concluded that PCT and CRP levels are related to the severity of organ dysfunction, with infection related to higher values.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>We divided our patients according to sepsis syndrome into three groups [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T7">Table 7</xref>]. PCT has several advantages in severely ill patients compared with CRP. The most striking one, demonstrated in this study, is the enormous range of PCT reactivity resulting in a marked increase in PCT plasma levels, especially during severe stages of MODs and systemic inflammation. On the other hand, PCT concentrations are too low when only a mild organ dysfunction is present. Our results agreed with Miro <italic>et al</italic>., (2011), who retrospectively studied the predictive value of PCT for survival in 64 adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock treated in intensive care.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Highlighting the acuity of PCT blood levels can predict the severity of sepsis in peritonitis patients as measured by a SOFA score in the
