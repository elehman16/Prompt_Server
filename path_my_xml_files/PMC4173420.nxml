Specifically in the parturient inadequate postoperative pain control after cesarean section may interfere with ambulation, breast-feeding, and early maternal bonding with the infant. The effective pain management does not necessarily make the partu-rient totally insensible to the fact that cesarean section was performed, but rather, it allows adequate degree of comfort and promotes physical reco-very and a sense of well being.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Effective postoperative analgesia can be provided with systemic administration of opioids and/or nonopioid analgesics as well as with epidural and spinal techniques.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs lists morphine, fentanyl, and butorphanol as mater-nally administered opioids that are compatible with breast-feeding.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] This prospective randomized controlled study was designed to assess the analgesic efficacy and side effects of single dose epidural morphine versus intermittent epidural morphine with bupivacaine for postoperative analgesia in lower segment caesarean section cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This randomized control study was conducted in a hospital of UP. Approval for study was obtained from the institutional ethical committee and written informed consent from each patient was taken before the study. Postoperative visual analog scales (VAS score) was considered the primary end point in determination of the sample size. It was determined that a sample size of 36 patients in each group would have 80% power to detect 30% difference in VAS while limiting the type-I error less than 5%. Seventy two patients at term American Society of Anesthesiology Classification (ASA-I and ASA-II) scheduled for lower segment caesarean section under epidural anesthesia were selected for study and divided into two groups with the help of simple random sampling (sealed coded envelop). Patients with complicated pregnancy, acute fetal distress, history of hypersensitivity to opioids/local anesthetics were excluded. In the preanaesthetic visit, all the patients were made familiar with the study plan and visual analogue scales (VAS) to be used in the assessment by the investigators. Respiratory rate, arterial blood pressure, peripheral arterial saturation, and heart rate were monitored throughout the perioperative period. To avoid bias staff involved in anesthesia was not involved in pain assessment.</p><p>Epidural anesthesia (15 mL of 2% Inj lignocaine) was used for caesarean section in both groups. Intensity of postoperative pain during the first 24 h postoperatively was assessed at hourly interval using a visual analogue pain score (VAS).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] 0 denotes &#x0201c;no pain&#x0201d; while 10 denotes &#x0201c;worst pain imaginable.&#x0201d; When the patient was asleep, no VAS assessments were made and VAS of 0 was given. Group one received single dose of 1.20 mg epidural morphine along with 15 mL of 2% Inj lignocaine (which was used for epidural anesthesia) and subsequently Inj Paracetamole/Inj Diclofenac when the pain score was 4 or more, or if the patient requested analgesia (whichever occurred earlier). Total supplementary analgesics (Inj Paracetamole/Inj Diclofenac) required was recorded. Group two received 15 mL of 2% Inj lignocaine epidurally initially for caesarean section and 0.5 mg epidural morphine (dissolved in 10 mL of 0.125% Inj bupivacaine) after on hour with the help of epidural catheter and it was repeated after 12 h. If patient requested analgesia at interval less than 12 h Inj bupivacaine alone was given with the help of epidural catheter. Total supplementary analgesics (Inj morphine/ inj bupivacaine) for group two was also recorded.</p><p>The onset of analgesia was defined as the time from injection of the study medication to first reduction in pain intensity by at least 1 in VAS; and the duration of analgesia was defined as the time between the onset of analgesia and either a return to baseline VAS or the time when additional pain medication was requested, whichever occurred first. The occurrence of nausea and vomiting, pruritus, shivering and respiratory depression (respiratory rate &#x0003c;12/min), sedation, and hypotension was noted up to 24 h following administration of the study medication. The collected data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Science (version 10.0 for Windows, SPSS). Analysis of variance /Chi square test was used to compare the variables between groups. <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 72 patients were studied.

Even the smallest dose 1.25 mg, had a modest patient controlled analgesia that persisted through the 24-h study period. In their study little relation was found between dose and side effects (nausea, vomiting, itching, and pruritis) over the range studied. They observed for optimal analgesia, augmentation of epidural morphine with systemic analgesics, or other epidural medications may be necessary.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Our study indicates that the degree and duration of analgesia was better with 1.20 mg single dose epidural morphine in comparison to intermittent morphine and requirement of supplementary/rescue analgesic was significantly less in patients receiving single dose epidural morphine. In our study there was no significant difference in nausea, vomiting, itching and pruritis in two groups of patients. Craig <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported that side effects of epidural morphine were not dose related. Incidence of respiratory depression, sedation, and hypotension were nil in two groups of patients. It had been reported that epidural opioid offers several advantages to partu-rients recovering from cesarean section. These include excellent postoperative analgesia with a decrease in total dose of opioids required, a low level of sedation, minimal accumulation of the drug in breast milk, facilitation of early ambulation and early return of bowel function.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In our study also single dose of epidural morphine was found more convenient, less cumbersome and less costly to intermittent epidural morphine with bupivacaine for postcaesarean section analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, our study showed that the use of single-dose epidural morphine was associated with lower pain scores at rest and movement when compared to intermittent epidural morphine with bupivacaine in postcaesarean section analgesia. The use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) enhanced the efficacy of analgesia of single dose epidural morphine. We did not detect any severe side effects (e.g. respiratory depression and sedation) with the doses of single dose epidural morphine used. There was no significant difference in nausea, vomiting, itching, and pruritis in two groups of patient. Single dose epidural morphine was found more convenient, less cumbersome and less costly to intermittent epidural morphine for postcaesarean section analgesia.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kuczkowski</surname><given-names>KM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Obstetric anesthesia: past present and future</article-title><source>J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med</source><year>2009</year><volume>22</volume><fpage>819</fpage><lpage>22</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19488941</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Leung</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postoperative pain management in obstetric &#x02013; New challenges and solutions</article-title><source>J Clin Anesth</source><year>2004</year><volume>16</volume><fpage>57</fpage><lpage>65</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14984863</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vercauteren</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Vereecken</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>La Malfa</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Coppejans</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Adriaensen</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Cost-effectiveness of analgesia after Caesarean section.
