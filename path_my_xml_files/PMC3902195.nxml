The study was terminated on the grounds of futility. Several patients randomised to CPFA were subsequently found to be undertreated.

A subgroup analysis suggested that CPFA could reduce mortality, when a high volume of plasma is treated.

Subsequently, several Italian ICUs adopted CPFA in septic shock patients with promising results, and were willing to formally evaluate its efficacy. GiViTI, the Italian ICU network, thus launched a randomised multicentre clinical trial to assess the efficacy of CPFA in reducing mortality of critically ill patients with septic shock.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>Written consent was obtained from the patient when possible; otherwise physicians enroled patients according to the article 4.8.15 of the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting and participants</title><p>The study was performed in 18 adult ICUs who regularly used CPFA in the treatment of septic shock.

Once enroled, the patients were randomly allocated by the eCRF on a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 basis to either have CPFA added to the standard care, or not. A blocked randomisation schedule (randomly permuting blocks of four and six)<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> was implemented in the eCRF, with stratification according to the centre and the presence of septic shock on admission.

Thus, for patients transferred to another hospital, mortality was assessed at the discharge from the hospital in which the patients last stayed. To minimise the bias due to the decision to have the relative dying at home, patients discharged in a terminal condition (life expectancy &#x0003c;2&#x02005;weeks as estimated by the attending physician) were considered to have died at the time of hospital discharge. The primary analysis was by intention-to-treat; however, a per-protocol analysis was also planned to assess the impact of protocol violations, if any, on the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints were: mortality within 90&#x02005;days of randomisation; the proportion of patients who developed &#x02265;1 new organ failures during their ICU stay (defined by an organ SOFA score of 3 or 4<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and ICU-free days during the first 30&#x02005;days from randomisation.</p><p>Timing of intervention is considered extremely important in septic shock. Thus, two subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were pre-planned, namely the assessment of outcomes in patients with septic shock on ICU admission or who developed it during their ICU stay and patients starting CPFA within or later than 4&#x02005;h of randomisation.</p><p>The study was sized to have 80% power to detect an improvement in hospital mortality from an expected 63% in the controls to 47% with CPFA (25% relative improvement), with a two-tailed 5% type I error.

To reach the a priori determined goal of a 25% reduction in mortality, in the second part of the study, a 23% hospital mortality in the CPFA group would have been required, which was considered implausible.

Mortality within 90&#x02005;days of randomisation was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves with any differences investigated through logrank testing.</p><p>As a number of protocol violations in the CPFA arm were registered due to a lower than planned volume of plasma treated, we also performed a per-protocol analysis of the primary endpoint, as determined a priori.

Any association between tertiles and hospital mortality was tested with the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test and the Cochran-Armitage test for trend.

During this period, 386 patients with septic shock were excluded as being non-eligible (see online supplementary material). Central monitoring subsequently identified 14 enroled patients whose eligibility criteria were doubtful.

<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> GiViTI performed this randomised clinical trial to assess the efficacy of CPFA in reducing hospital mortality of patients affected by septic shock.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>The main findings</title><p>After randomising more than half the planned number of patients, we found no statistical difference with the use of CPFA in hospital mortality, the occurrence of new organ failures or the overall clinical evolution. To reverse these results, with the sample still to be randomised, implausible data should have been observed from then on. Furthermore, this study was powered from an anticipated 63% hospital mortality in the control group. Although such an estimation, coming from previous GiViTI data, was confirmed in the whole sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2013003536F2">figure 2</xref>), the eligibility criteria selected a subgroup where mortality was sensibly lower (47.3%), thereby reducing the power of the study. Thus, the EDSMC considered that continuing to spend money in a clinical trial that had a little chance of demonstrating efficacy was undesirable and asked for a premature termination on the grounds of futility, although the anticipated, non-binding Bayesian futility criteria for stopping the trial were not fulfilled.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>The dilemma of primary endpoint</title><p>The correct primary endpoint of clinical trials in septic shock is still debated.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Most of the studies have adopted 28-day mortality due to Food and Drug Administration stipulations. However, the mortality rate attributable to sepsis continues long after the initiation of the acute event<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>; indeed, 16.8% of our study patients were still in the ICU beyond 28&#x02005;days after randomisation. On the other hand, overextending the follow-up period has the disadvantage of diluting the phenomenon, with the inclusion of competing causes of death. We thus considered mortality at the time of discharge from the hospital into which they were last admitted following their septic shock episode. At that point, the patient no longer requires aggressive, specialised, interdisciplinary care, which means he or she had survived the septic shock episode. A 90-day mortality was anyway recorded and considered as secondary endpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>The problem of undertreatment</title><p>Nearly half of the patients randomised to CPFA were undertreated as per protocol stipulation. This poses two crucial questions: the true feasibility of the technique in the ICU and the possible relationship between the overall negative result and such undertreatment. The main reason for not reaching the prescribed volume of plasma treated was clotting of the circuit (48%). This problem was encountered by all centres.</p><p>Why did the training of the centres not have an effect? Many factors could have contributed. First, CPFA involves a complex circuit that includes a haemofilter, a plasma filter and an adsorbing cartridge, and requires an adequate balance of flows, dilutions and anticoagulation. We used heparin for anticoagulation (see online supplementary material), the most frequently used drug in this regard, because the machine used in the study did not support regional anticoagulation with citrate. Nevertheless, heparin is difficult to manage, particularly in the critically ill. Many centres may have been too conservative either with the heparin dosage and/or the blood flow rate through the circuit, or there may be an insufficient antithrombin substrate for the heparin to be effective.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Second, because of the high cost of the procedure (about &#x020ac;1.200 per treatment), in most of the cases, the physicians did not start a new course of CPFA on the same day, in case of clotting of the circuit. Third, the training may have been (partly) ineffective. On the one hand, it only reached a few people per ICU. It was often difficult to involve the nephrologists, who, in many centres, are in charge of the procedure. On the other hand, despite excellent feedbacks from the participants, we cannot <italic>a posteriori</italic> exclude it was qualitatively suboptimal.</p><p>At any rate, the feasibility problems we have encountered in the present clinical trial suggest that the procedure, as implemented in this study, is not practicable in everyday clinical practice. Interestingly, regional anticoagulation with citrate represents a valid alternative to heparin as its anticoagulatory effect is limited to the extracorporeal circuit, without any systemic effect, and can be safely applied in the ICU.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In a feasibility study carried out in 13 patients at high risk of bleeding, citrate regional anticoagulation was associated with a significantly lower number of clotted CPFA cartridges than with the heparin.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> The newer generation CPFA machine is able to apply citrate regional anticoagulation, and initial experiences in patients with septic shock demonstrate that a much higher volume of plasma can be safely treated.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Should these preliminary results be confirmed, the question whether the reason of our negative result was a problem of feasibility or efficacy would become essential, to avoid the risk of dismissing a potentially effective treatment for such a high mortality condition as septic shock.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>The per-protocol analysis and its limits</title><p>Of note, patients who had a larger volume of plasma treated seemed to have reduced hospital mortality. This cannot be taken as conclusive evidence of the efficacy of CPFA. Even though the per-protocol analysis was planned a priori with the expected direction of the effect being stated in advance, and a dose&#x02013;response relationship was found, a number of potential problems threaten the validity of this result. First, a subgroup definition for the per-protocol analysis (ie, tertiles of plasma treated) was based on characteristics measured after randomisation. Under such circumstances, the allocation to a subgroup may have been influenced by the intervention in relation to the severity of the patient, causing an important bias. This would be the case, for example, if the probability of circuit clotting was higher in the more severely ill patients. Actually, the characteristics of the three subgroups were somewhat unbalanced (see online supplementary material). We adjusted for possible confounders in the multivariate model to minimise this risk, but we were limited to prognostic factors collected in the database. Particularly, we have no data on the immunoinflammatory status of the patients to account for. Second, the subgroup allocation may have been influenced by the outcome. For example, early deaths could have prevented the treatment of high volume of plasma. Even if we standardised the treated volume to the duration in hours of CPFA, since the treatment started with a low filtration fraction to be gradually increased to the target value (see online supplementary material), the first hours were characterised by a certain degree of undertreatment by design. In this case, an early death could have prevented the patient from being included in the third tertile, but not in the others, nor in the controls, spuriously influencing the result. We performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding early deaths from all groups, knowing that such an analysis could have greatly disadvantaged CPFA, if the lower number of early deaths were due to the efficacy of the technique. Interestingly, we verified that the strength of association was unchanged, albeit losing statistical significance for a lack of power, thereby excluding the presence of a differential outcome-related selection bias. Finally, the statistical significance of our results is quite thin; indeed, just one more death in the highest tertile subgroup would have rendered the difference in hospital mortality non-significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Almost 60% of patients with septic shock did not meet the inclusion criteria. The main reason was life expectancy less than 2&#x02005;weeks. The mortality of these patients was in fact 98%. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude that the higher severity could have brought about a potentially greater possibility of response to intervention, at least for some patients. Future studies should consider this aspect.</p><p>One-third of the eligible patients were not randomised due to the very narrow window (6&#x02005;h) for the patient's recruitment and initiation of the treatment. This would have particularly hampered the generalisability of results had the findings been positive.</p><p>Finally, the study was terminated early for reasons of futility, after almost 60% of the originally planned patients had been recruited. This reduced the possibility of studying phenomena emerging from the analyses with a significant power, as in the case of the volume of plasma treated. In any event, any subgroup analysis, regardless of the involved sample size, could only have generated hypotheses. Our interpretation of the findings is in itself a hypothesis, which would have been only more robust with a larger sample.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>CPFA was not able to reduce mortality in patients with septic shock. This result strongly discourages the use of CPFA in the everyday clinical practice, as it was implemented in this study. Unfortunately, we were not able to discern whether the culprit of such a negative result was the lack of effectiveness (mainly due to widespread feasibility problems) rather than the lack of true efficacy. The subgroup analysis was suggestive of efficacy, if a high volume of plasma was treated. Although we have taken counter measures to minimise potential biases, these cannot be completely excluded. Hence, this result can only be viewed as hypothesis generating. Given the new availability of citrate regional anticoagulation, we have designed a confirmatory, adaptive trial whose first step will be to prove this new technique easily allows high volume of plasma treated with CPFA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e415" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003536.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e416" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2013-003536.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Collaborators:</bold> Armando Alborghetti (Ponte San Pietro-BG); Bruno Balicco (Zingonia-BG); Franco Bonello (Ivrea-TO); Francesco Casino (Matera-MT); Giacomo Castiglione (Catania-CT); Marco Cavana (Aosta-AO); Paolo Conti (Firenze-FI); Tiziana D'Amato (Imperia-IM); Carlo Donadio (Pisa-PI); Emilio Fabbri (Forl&#x000ec;-FC); Fiorenza Ferrari (Torino-TO); Bertilla Fiorese (Brescia-BS); Mario Gaggiotti (Brescia-BS); Marco Lorenz (Zingonia-BG); Mariella Maio (Torino-TO); Massimo Manes (Aosta-AO); Marco Manganaro (Alessandria-AL); Valerio Mangani (Firenze-FI); Antonio Mannarino (Firenze-FI); Gianmariano Marchesi (Bergamo-BG); Paolo Martinelli (Firenze-FI); Agnese Meterangelis (Ponte San Pietro-BG); Giulio Mingardi (Bergamo-BG); Giuseppe Nardi (Roma-RM); Antonella Peralta (Sanremo-IM); Marco Pozzato (Torino-TO); Marco Riggio (Lecco-LC); Francesco Massimo Romito (Matera-MT); Rosa Salcuni (Ivrea-TO); Silvano Scaioli (Forl&#x000ec;-FC); Silvia Scarrone (Alessandria-AL); Mario Tavola (Lecco-LC); Marina Terzitta (Forl&#x000ec;-FC); Ernesto Turello (Alessandria-AL); Bruno Viaggi (Pisa-PI); Loretta Zambianchi (Forl&#x000ec;-FC).</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> All the authors substantially contributed to the conception and design interpretation of data, critically revising it and approved the final version of the manuscript , GB and CR were involved in the analysis of the data and GB involved in the drafting the article.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This work was supported by the Bellco SpA.
