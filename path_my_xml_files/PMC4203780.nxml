After preliminary and familiarization trials, in a randomized, repeated-measures crossover design, ten amateur cyclists performed: 1) an exercise designed to reduce glycogen of type I muscle fibers, followed by a 4-km TT (EX-FIB I); 2) an exercise designed to reduce glycogen of type II muscle fibers, followed by a 4-km TT (EX-FIB II) and; 3) a 4-km TT, without the prior exercise (CONT). The muscle-glycogen-reducing exercise in both EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II was performed in the evening, &#x0223c;12 h before the 4-km TT. Performance time was increased and power output (PO) was reduced in EX-FIB I (432.8&#x000b1;8.3 s and 204.9&#x000b1;10.9 W) and EX-FIB II (428.7&#x000b1;6.7 s and 207.5&#x000b1;9.1 W) compared to CONT (420.8&#x000b1;6.4 s and 218.4&#x000b1;9.3 W; P&#x0003c;0.01), without a difference between EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II (P&#x0003e;0.05). The PO was lower in EX-FIB I than in CONT at the beginning and middle of the trial (P&#x0003c;0.05). The mean aerobic contribution during EX-FIB I was also significantly lower than in CONT (P&#x0003c;0.05), but there was no difference between CONT and EX-FIB II or between EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II (P&#x0003e;0.05). The integrated electromyography was unchanged between conditions (P&#x0003e;0.05). Performance may have been impaired in EX-FIB I due a more conservative pacing at the beginning and middle, which was associated with a reduced aerobic contribution. In turn, the PO profile adopted in EX-FIB II was also reduced throughout the trial, but the impairment in performance may be attributed to a reduced glycolytic contribution (i.e. reduced lactate accumulation).</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors have no support or funding to report.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>To date, the effects of reduced endogenous carbohydrate (CHO) stores on performance during a time trial (TT) has received limited attention <xref rid="pone.0110320-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110320-CorreiaOliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A study by Rauch et al. <xref rid="pone.0110320-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> reported that three days on a high-CHO diet resulted in an increase in the mean power output (PO) during a 60-min cycling TT compared to a control-CHO diet. This increase in PO occurred as early as the first minute of exercise. Despite significantly different starting muscle glycogen values and TT performances, it is interesting to note that the CHO-loaded condition enabled the participants to finish the trial with the same critical low muscle glycogen level as the control-CHO condition <xref rid="pone.0110320-Rauch1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Recently, a reduction in overall performance (&#x0223c;11%) was observed during a middle-distance cycling TT (200 kJ, &#x0223c;12 min) carried out after a validated protocol designed to lower muscle glycogen content, when compared to a control condition <xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This reduction in performance was accompanied by a shorter fast-start, followed by a less pronounced increase in PO during the last part of the trial. The authors attributed the impaired PO at the end to a reduced glycogenolytic activity. Indeed, the final sprint seems to occur as a result of the spared muscle glycogen and anaerobic capacity in the earlier stages of a TT, accompanied by a consequent increase in the anaerobic energy expenditure at the end of the trial <xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-Corbett1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Together, these results suggest that pacing during a cycling TT is affected by pre-exercise muscle glycogen availability.</p><p>While it seems clear that pre-exercise muscle glycogen availability affects the pacing strategy, it is not known if fiber-selective glycogen depletion will have different effects on pacing strategy. Due to the high-intensity at the beginning of a middle-distance cycling TT <xref rid="pone.0110320-Foster1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, type II fibers may have a greater contribution initially <xref rid="pone.0110320-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. However, since type II fibers are quickly fatigable, a decline in PO after a fast start may be associated with a reduced contribution from type II fibers <xref rid="pone.0110320-Pringle1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, preserving the limited anaerobic energy reserve of type II fibers to support the increase in PO in the last part of the trial <xref rid="pone.0110320-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. These specific changes in muscle fiber recruitment pattern during a typical middle-distance TT have not been investigated, probably due to limitations of the gold-standard muscle biopsy technique. Since this technique can increase variability and interfere directly with athletes&#x02019; pacing strategy and performance, the utilization of more practical and applied protocols has been recommended <xref rid="pone.0110320-Jeukendrup1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>An interesting and practical manner to test the effects of fiber-selective glycogen depletion on pacing strategy would be to use validated protocols to reduce selectively the muscle glycogen content of type I or II fibers <xref rid="pone.0110320-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, and to verify if this affects pacing strategy and performance during a cycling TT. It has been shown that prolonged exercise lasting &#x0223c;3 h predominantly reduces the muscle glycogen stores from type I fibers <xref rid="pone.0110320-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, while high-intensity, intermittent exercise reduces the muscle glycogen from type II fibers <xref rid="pone.0110320-Thomson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, the results would have important practical implications since many athletes participate in multi-stage races in which they perform a middle-distance TT a few hours after either prolonged or short cycling races.</p><p>Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the influence of prior selective muscle glycogen-lowering exercise, designed to predominantly reduce the muscle glycogen content of either type I or II fibers, on pacing strategy and performance during a 4-km cycling TT. We hypothesized that the exercise protocol designed to predominantly lower the muscle glycogen content of type I fibers would impair PO during the midpoint of the TT, while the exercise protocol designed to predominantly lower the muscle glycogen content of type II fibers would impair PO at the beginning and during the last part of the TT. In order to provide some insights about muscle recruitment <xref rid="pone.0110320-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, we also measured the muscle EMG signal throughout the TT.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Alagoas.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Ten amateur, competitive cyclists [age 33&#x000b1;2 years, mass 74.4&#x000b1;3.3 kg, height 173.7&#x000b1;2.4 m, body fat 12.3&#x000b1;1.6%, peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) 4.1&#x000b1;0.1 L&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (55.3&#x000b1;2.6 mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), peak PO (PPO) 253.5&#x000b1;8.6 W] took part in this study.

At the second visit, participants performed a 4-km cycling familiarization trial. The subsequent visits (visits 3 to 7) were performed in a randomized and repeated-measures crossover design. In the evening before the main trial (&#x0223c;7PM), participants performed either an exercise protocol designed to predominantly reduce muscle glycogen content in type I fibers (EX-FIB I) <xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, or type II fibers (EX-FIB II) <xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, or no exercise (CONT). Participants then followed a standardized diet and performed in the next morning (&#x0223c;7 AM) a 4-km TT. A 1-week interval was applied between the experimental sessions to wash out any residual effect of fatigue.

We had hypothesized that an exercise protocol designed to reduce muscle glycogen in type II fibers would impair PO at the beginning and last part of the TT, while an exercise protocol designed to reduce muscle glycogen of type I fibers would impair PO in the midpoint of the TT. The main findings of the present study were that both prior muscle-glycogen-reducing exercise protocols altered pacing strategy and energy system contributions during a 4-km cycling TT. As a consequence, overall performance was impaired after both exercise protocols. These results might be attributed to a more conservative PO distribution pattern adopted by the athletes in the reduced muscle glycogen conditions. A decrease in PO at the beginning and middle of the trial was observed in EX-FIB I, accompanied by a reduced P<sub>aer</sub> throughout the trial. On the other hand, PO mean and plasma [La] accumulation were decreased in EX-FIB II. The iEMG remained unchanged throughout the TT in all three conditions.</p><p>A lower mean PO and a longer time to completion of the TT was observed in EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II compared with CONT.

Using time-to-exhaustion tests, it has previously been reported that performance during high-intensity exercise (80&#x02013;90% of VO<sub>2peak</sub>; 10&#x02013;20 min) and supra VO<sub>2peak</sub> exercise (115% of VO<sub>2peak</sub>; &#x0223c;3 min) is impaired if athletes start the trial after a muscle-glycogen-lowering exercise protocol <xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva4" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Likewise, the results of the present study are also in accordance with earlier studies showing a reduction in performance when participants performed a cycling TT after an exercise protocol designed to reduce concomitantly the muscle glycogen content of both type I and II muscle fibers <xref rid="pone.0110320-Johnson1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110320-CorreiaOliveira1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate these effects during a TT carried out after validated exercise protocols designed to reduce selectively glycogen content in specific muscle fibers (type I or II fibers).</p><p>The PO-versus-distance curve in CONT showed a classic initial fast start, followed by a gradual decline in PO until completion of approximately 80% (3.2 km) of the TT, when the PO increased again in the last part, i.e. a U-shaped curve. This pacing model has previously been shown in studies investigating pacing during a TT of similar distance and duration <xref rid="pone.0110320-Abbiss1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. In contrast, participants adopted a more conservative pacing strategy at the beginning and during the middle of EX-FIB I. Previous studies demonstrated that pacing at the beginning and middle <xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> of a TT is affected negatively by the prior reduction in muscle glycogen stores. The results of the present study confirm our first hypothesis that an exercise protocol designed to predominantly lower muscle glycogen in type I muscle fibers impairs PO during the midpoint of a 4-km TT. On the other hand, our second hypothesis that previous depletion of the glycogen in the type II muscle fibers would impair PO at the beginning was not confirmed. In contrast, we found a reduction in PO at the beginning of the EX-FIB I trial when compared to CONT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110320-g001">figure 1</xref>). However, the aerobic contribution was systematically lower during EX-FIB I than CONT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110320-g002">figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that muscle glycogen depletion of type I fibers impaired aerobic metabolism from beginning of the exercise. It should be noted that a less aggressive start is accompanied by slower VO<sub>2</sub> on-kinetics and a reduced aerobic contribution <xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-Jones1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-Bishop1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. As any time lost during the first part of a time trial cannot be recovered later in the event <xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, it could be suggested that the impaired performance in the EX-FIB I may have been partially due to the adoption of a suboptimal starting pacing.</p><p>In the middle part of the trial, participants maintained a more conservative pace in both reduced muscle glycogen conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110320-g001">figure 1</xref>). The PO in EX-FIB I was significantly lower than in CONT from 2.2 to 3.0 km, except for the 2.4-km interval. On the other hand, there was a significant reduction in the mean PO during the entire EX-FIB II trial when compared to CONT. It is noteworthy that, although the PO was slightly impaired in the middle of the trial, these differences were no longer apparent when separated into P<sub>aer</sub> and P<sub>an</sub> for EX-FIB II, but P<sub>aer</sub> was systematically reduced during EX-FIB I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110320-g002">figures 2A and 2B</xref>).</p><p>The Post-TT [La] was significantly lower in EX-FIB II than in the CONT condition. An interaction effect indicates that the increase in [La] with exercise was less pronounced during EX-FIB II than during the CONT or EX-FIB I. A previous study has suggested that an exercise protocol designed to reduce glycogen from both type I and II muscle fibers reduces the anaerobic capacity by close to 20% during a single high-intensity (175 to 400 W) square-wave exercise <xref rid="pone.0110320-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. In the present study, a significant reduction in plasma [La] accumulation during EX-FIB II suggests that selective muscle glycogen depletion of type II muscle fibers may produce a slightly reduce glycolysis during the exercise. However, overall P<sub>an</sub> was not affected (&#x0223c;9% of reduction, not significant), suggesting that selective muscle glycogen depletion may not produce a reduction in the anaerobic metabolism of the same magnitude as when both types of fibers are depleted concomitantly <xref rid="pone.0110320-Miura1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>.</p><p>The iEMG of the vastus lateralis did not parallel the changes in PO throughout the trial. Specifically, iEMG remained unaltered throughout the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0110320-g003">figure 3</xref>). We <xref rid="pone.0110320-SilvaCavalcante1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-SantosRde1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref> and others <xref rid="pone.0110320-Hettinga2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> have observed a similar behavior during a 4-km cycling TT. Interestingly, we also did not find significant differences in iEMG between the conditions despite a gradual decline in PO in both EX-FIB I and EX-FIB II. While iEMG cannot provide a measure of the specific recruitment of type I and type II muscle fibers during nonstationary conditions such as a TT, the iEMG signal may indicate a general muscle fiber recruitment profile. Our results therefore indicate that the muscle fiber recruitment pattern may not have been altered with muscle glycogen depletion of either type I or type II muscle fibers. It should be mentioned, however, that interpretation of the iEMG signal during variable external PO as in a TT is difficult and not free of misinterpretation <xref rid="pone.0110320-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. The surface iEMG may not be sufficiently sensitive to measure small changes in muscle activation. In addition, the surface iEMG signal quantifies both motor unit recruitment (i.e. the number of motor units activated) and the firing rates of the activated motor units, reflecting together the muscle activation <xref rid="pone.0110320-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Currently, it is not possible to divide the signal to assess these two phenomena separately. Other concerns that may affect iEMG analysis include: 1) surface EMG amplitude cancellation; 2) the stability of neuromuscular propagation and; 3) fatigue related reflex inhibition (reflex effects in the spinal cord) <xref rid="pone.0110320-Weir1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Therefore, caution is warranted when interpreting iEMG data during a cycling TT.</p><p>Finally, we found that although the overall TT performance was impaired in both reduced muscle glycogen conditions, force production (i.e. maximal voluntary contraction) prior to the TT was similar between the three conditions. These results highlight the task-specific nature of fatigue and indicate that the mechanism(s) that dictate task failure during a TT may not necessarily be the same as those influencing pre-exercise maximal voluntary contraction performances. In other words, the specific mechanism responsible for performance reduction may be exercise task dependent <xref rid="pone.0110320-LimaSilva1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110320-Abbiss2" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>.</p><p>A possible limitation of the present study is that we did not use a gold-standard technique (e.g., muscle biopsy) to quantify the muscle glycogen content. However, the muscle biopsy technique is invasive and could have interfered directly with the athletes&#x02019; pacing and overall performance. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the selective muscle glycogen-lowering exercises used in this study is well established <xref rid="pone.0110320-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Gollnick et al. <xref rid="pone.0110320-Gollnick1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> found a reduced muscle glycogen content in almost all type I fibers after 3 hours of a constant-load exercise at 30% PPO. On the other hand, in the protocol (10 sets of 1 min at 120% PPO) used by Thomson et al. <xref rid="pone.0110320-Thomson1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, almost all type II fibers had their muscle glycogen content discernibly reduced. Later, Carter et al. <xref rid="pone.0110320-Carter1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> applied these two validated protocols in their study and found that approximately 94% of type I fibers had their muscle glycogen depleted after the prolonged-exercise protocol, whereas approximately 99% of type II fibers had their muscle glycogen depleted after the high-intensity protocol. An additional potential limitation is that the time for recovery of muscle glycogen stores in type I and type II muscle fibers may have been different. However, because we used a short recovery period between the glycogen-depleting protocol and the main TT (&#x0223c;12 h), and there were only two intervening meals, one of them two hours before the TT, a significant muscle glycogen replenishment is unlikely. Despite the total work during the glycogen-depleting task differing between the trials, no significant difference was found between pre-exercise maximal voluntary contractions, suggesting no influence of the muscle glycogen depletion protocol on pre-exercise neuromuscular fatigue. Taken together, although we did not directly measure muscle glycogen content, the results of these previous studies provide sufficient evidence for the validity of these protocols for use in applied research.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of the present study suggest that prior, prolonged, low-intensity exercise (designed to reduce glycogen of type I muscle fibers) was associated with impairment in PO at the beginning and middle of a 4-km TT, and this was accompanied by a reduction in the aerobic contribution. On the other hand, the prior, short, high-intensity exercise (designed to reduce glycogen of type II muscle fibers) impaired the PO and reduced the plasma [La] accumulation. Irrespective of the inclusion of either a prior prolonged, low-intensity exercise or short, high-intensity exercise, an impairment in overall performance of a middle-distance cycling TT was evident, but the pacing adopted, as well as energy system alterations, occurred in a specific way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the distribution of energy expenditure during a middle-distance cycling TT is dependent of the intensity and duration of the exercise carried out in the evening before.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Carlos Rafaell Correia-Oliveira Oliveira is grateful to Foundation of Aids to Scientific Research of the State of Alagoas (FAPEAL) for his Masters scholarship.
