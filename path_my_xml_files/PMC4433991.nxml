exercises (CERE) on chest expansion, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP), and maximal
expiratory pressure (MEP) in elderly people with inspiratory muscle weakness. [Subjects]
Thirty elderly people with inspiratory muscle weakness (MIP &#x0003c; 80% of the predicted
value) were randomly and equally assigned to a chest expansion resistance exercise (CERE)
group, core conditioning exercise (CCE) group, and control group. [Methods] The
intervention was applied to the CERE group and CCE group five times per week, 30 minutes
each time, for six weeks. A tapeline was used to measure upper and lower chest expansion.
MIP and MEP before and after the intervention were measured and compared. [Results] There
was significant improvement in upper and lower chest expansion and MIP after the
intervention in both the CERE group and the CCE group, whereas the control group did not
show any significant difference. MEP did not significantly change in any of the three
groups after the intervention. [Conclusion] The CERE group underwent greater changes than
the CCE group, which proves that the CERE is more effective for improving elderly people&#x02019;s
chest expansion capacity and MIP in elderly people. Therefore, application of the CERE by
therapists is recommended if the environment and conditions are appropriate for
enhancement of chest expansion capacity and MIP in elderly people.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Elderly</kwd><kwd>Respiration</kwd><kwd>PNF</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Average life expectancy increased dramatically from 50&#x02005;years old in the early 1900s to

with increased life expectancy, as humans age, their lung elasticity, diaphragm movement,

elderly people can improve and maintain their cardiopulmonary circulation and also increase
their oxygen intake through continuous physical training<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a society where aging is becoming a longer process due to
increased average life expectancy, research on interventions to improve respiratory function
in the elderly should be actively conducted. A recent study showed that PNF respiration

research in this area up to now. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the
effect of chest expansion exercises on chest expansion, maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP),

declined and to subsequently present an intervention method aimed at improving their
respiratory function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted in a nursing home located in Yongin City, Republic of Korea, from

Daejeon. Before participation, the procedures, risks, and benefits were explained to all the
participants, who gave their informed consent. The participants&#x02019; rights were protected
according to the guidelines of the University of Daejeon. The subjects were all aged 60 or
older, had inspiratory muscle weakness (MIP &#x0003c; 80% of the predicted value), and showed no
pulmonary disease in a radiological test and physical chest examination. Thirty subjects
were randomly and equally assigned to a chest expansion resistance exercise (CERE) group,
core conditioning exercise (CCE) group, and control group.</p><p>The CERE is an exercise based on a proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation breathing
exercise. A therapist palpated the anterior and posterior aspects of a side-lying subject
with the thoracic apex as the standard as if embracing the aspects on both sides. From the
time the patient started inspiration after expiration, the therapist provided resistance
toward the coccygeal vertebrae from the palpated areas. Resistance was applied to the
maximum extent possible without impeding the patient&#x02019;s inspiration. Just before the patient
exhaled, the therapist gave the oral command, &#x0201c;Please breathe out slowly&#x0201d;, and applied
continuous resistance, thereby allowing the patient to perform an active respiration
exercise<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. One set of exercises was
composed of 15 repetitions, and the subjects conducted 10 sets of exercises in total. A rest
period of 30 seconds was allowed after the warm-up exercise, the cooldown exercise, and each
set of the main exercise. For the CCE, a trunk muscle relaxation design was used in
combination with a stretch pole. All of the &#x0201c;seven basic&#x0201d; exercises listed below were
conducted in a lying position on a stretch pole. The subjects were instructed to perform all
these exercises, with an alarm set for three minutes per exercise using a stopwatch. The
subjects were allowed to take a rest of about one minute after each exercise, and the whole
session continued for approximately 30 minutes. The &#x0201c;seven basic&#x0201d; exercises were performed
as follows: 1) Draw a small circle on the floor using a hand. 2) With both arms stretched
upwards in parallel, induce abduction of the scapular and relax the adductor. 3) As if
slipping on the floor, conduct shoulder abduction and adduction. 4) With the knees slightly
flexed and the hips extended, externally and internally rotate the hips. 5) With the knees
slightly flexed and the hips externally rotated, abduct the hips. 6) Slide both sides of the
back on the stretch pole. 7) Breathe abdominally, which causes the abdomen to move during
inspiration and expiration<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. The
intervention was applied to each group five times per week, 30 minutes per each time, for
six weeks.</p><p>A tapeline was used to measure chest excursion, and all measurements were taken with the
patients adopting a straight posture while standing. Regarding chest expansion, the axillary
level was evaluated for upper thorax assessment, and the xyphoid level was evaluated for
lower thorax assessment. For the upper thorax, the third intercostal space at the
midclavicular line and the fifth thoracic spinous process were marked with a measuring pen.
The tapeline was placed parallel to the ground, and the degree of expansion was measured
during inspiration. For the lower thorax level, the tenth thoracic vertebra&#x02019;s spinous
process and xiphoid process were marked with a measuring pen. The tapeline was placed on the
ground parallel to the two marked points, and the expansion speed was measured during both
inspiration and expiration<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. MicroRPM
(Micro Medical Ltd., UK) was used to measure MIP and MEP. The measurements were taken while
the patients were sitting up straight. During inspiration, the mouth piece was adhered to
the mouth as tightly as possible, and loss of pressure was reduced to a minimum using a nose
grip. All measurements were taken using a blind examiner, and the average values from three
sets of measurements were used for statistical analysis.</p><p>The data collected in this study were statistically processed using PASW Statistics Version
18.0. The subjects&#x02019; general characteristics were expressed as averages and standard
deviations using descriptive statistics. A paired t-test was conducted in order to
facilitate the examination of differences before and after the intervention after deriving
each group&#x02019;s averages and standard deviations. In order to verify the differences between
the three groups&#x02019; average values, one-way analysis of variance was used, in addition to a
Scheffe post hoc test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was significant improvement in upper and lower chest expansion after the intervention

an individual reaches 60&#x02005;years of age, his/her physical exercise ability has decreased by
41%, and his/her maximum oxygen intake has decreased by about 5.5% per decade<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. As aging progresses, respiratory function
decreases, together with a reduction in physical exercise ability. Further research is
required on interventions to enhance respiratory function in elderly individuals.
Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the effects of the CERE and the CCE when used to
enhance the respiratory function of elderly people with declining capacity in terms of chest
expansion and MIP.</p><p>Muscle tension of the rib cage and mechanical properties caused by movement of the rib cage
are important factors in air flow during inspiration and expiration. In addition, the thorax
has an elastic structure that expands and contracts during breathing, and interaction
between the lung and the chest cavity is a crucial parameter representing the gas exchange
ability of the lung<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. Further, the
expansion and contraction of the lungs are affected by the capacity of the thorax, which is
determined by the mobility of the skeletal muscles, the elasticity of surrounding soft
tissues, and the intensity of the respiratory muscles<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research results have shown that tidal volume is more affected by
movement of the rib cage than abdominal motion<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the degree of chest expansion is considered to be
closely related to respiratory function and an important element in representing respiratory
function.</p><p>This study evaluated upper and lower chest expansion. According to the experimental
results, the control group did not experience significant changes in upper chest expansion
after the intervention, while the CERE group and the CCE group did, with similar results in
the two groups. However, in the lower chest expansion test, the CCE group showed significant
improvement, but this improvement was not significant relative to the control group.
Conversely, the CERE group showed significant improvement after the intervention compared
with the control group. This result is noteworthy because the CERE is an intervention that
uses a therapist&#x02019;s resistance, while the CCE is an intervention based on stretching. The
results indicate that the CCE group showed significant improvement compared with the control
group in upper chest expansion but did not show significant improvement relative to the
control group in lower chest expansion. This is similar to the results of a study that
examined the effects of the CCE on chest expansion in healthy elderly people. The fact that
the CERE group&#x02019;s improvement was greater than the CCE group&#x02019;s improvement is supported by
the findings indicating that respiratory muscle strength should be increased to improve
respiratory function and that resistance exercise is important<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>MIP and MEP are used when evaluating respiratory muscle function in the clinical field
because they show changes in the volume of each muscle and the respiratory system<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, the association between the
respiratory system and pressure-volume is based on the fact that achievement of a higher
maximum inspiratory pressure is determined by inspiration at the lowest residual volume;
therefore, strong respiratory muscles create a higher pulmonary volume<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>MIP significantly improved when the CERE and the CCE were compared before and after the
intervention, and both groups showed significant changes compared with the control group.
According to the post hoc test results, the CERE group&#x02019;s changes were statistically
significant relative to those of the CCE group. Although the subjects were different, a
similar study was conducted in which chest wall expansion exercises were applied to patients
with chronic obstructive lung disease, and an outcome of significant improvement in
pulmonary functions, dyspnea, and thorax expansion degree was obtained. That study is
considered to support the present study results<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In this study, the CCE&#x02019;s upper chest expansion and MIP significantly improved compared with
those of the control group. The present study results are the same as those of a study in
which exercises to stretch the respiratory muscles enhanced chest expansion capabilities and
pulmonary function<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, in all
evaluations, the CERE group underwent greater changes than the CCE group, which proves that
the CERE is more effective for improving chest expansion capacity and pulmonary function in
elderly people. A major limitation of this study is that it utilized a comparatively small
sample size.</p><p>In conclusion, application of the CERE by a therapist is recommended if the environment and
conditions are appropriate for enhancement of chest expansion capacity and respiratory
function in elderly people. However, if they are not, the CCE program is also considered to
be effective for improving these issues in elderly people.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Roger</surname><given-names>VL</given-names></name><name><surname>Go</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Lloyd-Jones</surname><given-names>DM</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Heart disease and stroke statistics-2013 update.
