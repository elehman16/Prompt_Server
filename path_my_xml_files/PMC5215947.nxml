The present study evaluated the overall antiviral response in woodchucks upon induction of immune response, first with SB 9200 followed by Entecavir (ETV) <italic>versus</italic> reduction of viral burden with ETV followed by SB 9200 immunomodulation. Woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) were treated orally with SB 9200 (30 mg/kg/day) and ETV (0.5 mg/kg/day). Group 1 received ETV for 4 weeks followed by SB 9200 for 12 weeks. Group 2 received SB 9200 for 12 weeks followed by ETV for 4 weeks. At the end of treatment in Group 2, average reductions of 6.4 log<sub>10</sub> in serum WHV DNA and 3.3 log<sub>10</sub> in WHV surface antigen were observed whereas in Group 1, average reductions of 4.2 log<sub>10</sub> and 1.1 log<sub>10</sub> in viremia and antigenemia were noted. Both groups demonstrated marked reductions in hepatic WHV nucleic acid levels which were more pronounced in Group 2. Following treatment cessation and the 8-week follow-up, recrudescence of viral replication was observed in Group 1 while viral relapse in Group 2 was significantly delayed. The antiviral effects observed in both groups were associated with temporally different induction of IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, and IFN-stimulated genes in blood and liver. These results suggest that the induction of host immune responses by pretreatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV resulted in antiviral efficacy that was superior to that obtained using the strategy of viral reduction with ETV followed by immunomodulation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Contract HHSN272201000011I, task order HHSN27200002 (D06)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6873-4084</contrib-id><name><surname>Menne</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI094469</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Iyer</surname><given-names>Radhakrishnan P.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This study was supported by Contract HHSN272201000011I, task order HHSN27200002 (D06) to the Department of Microbiology &#x00026; Immunology, Georgetown University Medical Center (SM) from the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).

It is estimated that more than 2 billion individuals have serological evidence of previous or current HBV infection, and that at least 248 million are chronic carriers of HBV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. HBV carriers are at a higher risk of developing chronic hepatitis, hepatic cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although safe and effective prophylactic vaccines exist, improvements in antiviral and/or immunotherapeutic strategies for the treatment of established chronic HBV infection are urgently needed. Current antiviral therapies for chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are limited to nucleos(t)ides and interferon-alpha (IFN-&#x003b1;) which require prolonged administration for reducing viral load and for improving the long-term outcome of CHB, but rarely lead to a cure [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Use of these antivirals is further limited due to the emergence of drug-resistant variants during treatment, the risk of relapse upon treatment discontinuation, and unwarranted side effects [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>CHB is associated with a deficient and/or an inadequate host immune response against HBV since viral proteins interfere with the functions of cellular viral sensors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) thereby disabling the innate and adaptive immune responses. For example, the HBV polymerase inhibits the activation of RIG-I in hepatocytes through interference with phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), thereby blocking the production of IFN, IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and antiviral cytokines. More recently, it has been reported that HBV markedly reduces IFN-&#x003b2; production and antiviral immunity mediated by the adapter protein, stimulator of IFN genes (STING), and to interfere with viral DNA-sensing pathways in cells [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The role of toll-like receptors in controlling HBV infection through innate and adaptive response has been well recognized (for a review see [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Thus, immunomodulatory agents that can induce innate immune responses, suppress viral replication, and additionally shape the adaptive immune response are wanted for treatment of CHB. The immunomodulatory agents, when combined with direct acting antivirals such as nucleos(t)ides can potentially result in a durable control of infection through development of neutralizing anti-HBV antibodies thereby leading to a &#x0201c;functional cure&#x0201d; of CHB within a defined duration of treatment.</p><p>SB 9200 is a small orally bioavailable prodrug of the dinucleotide SB 9000 with antiviral activity against HBV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], hepatitis C virus (HCV) [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and other RNA viruses [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The host immune stimulating activity of SB 9200 induces endogenous IFN <italic>via</italic> the activation of the viral sensor proteins, RIG-I and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (NOD2) [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Activation is believed to occur by binding of SB 9200/SB 9000 to RIG-I and NOD2 at their nucleotide binding domains. Both cytosolic proteins usually recognize signature patterns of foreign RNA such as the pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). Once PAMP is recognized, RIG-I and NOD2 become activated resulting in the induction of the IFN signaling pathway and subsequent production of type I and III IFNs, ISGs, pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral immune cells [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The direct antiviral activity of SB 9200/SB 9000 is thought to inhibit the synthesis of viral nucleic acids by steric blockage of the viral polymerase, similar to the mechanism recently described for HBV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The blockage, which is independent of the IFN signaling pathway, may be achieved by binding of SB 9200/SB 9000 with RIG-I and NOD2 that associate with viral RNA and that in turn prevents the polymerase from engaging with the pre-genomic (pg) RNA template for viral replication. In CHB, however, there is a need to understand whether treatment with immunomodulatory agents should be initiated in virally suppressed patients on therapy with nucleos(t)ides or in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients. With these objectives in mind, the preclinical study of SB 9200 in woodchucks was initiated to assist guiding the clinical trial design of SB 9200 in CHB patients.</p><p>The Eastern woodchuck (<italic>Marmota monax</italic>) is naturally infected with the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), a hepadnavirus which is genetically closely related to human HBV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Neonatal WHV infection parallels the main route of human (vertical) transmission for chronic HBV infection and displays a disease course similar to that in HBV-infected patients. Thus, chronic WHV infection in woodchucks is a fully immunocompetent model for studying CHB and HBV-induced HCC, and woodchucks have been extensively used to evaluate efficacy and safety of current and new HBV therapeutics [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We recently conducted a study of SB 9200 treatment in chronic WHV carrier woodchucks at two doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks. The study demonstrated potent, dose-dependent reductions in WHV DNA and antigens in serum and liver that were associated with (or were a result of) the induction of host antiviral immune responses [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In the present study, the overall antiviral response in woodchucks upon induction of innate immunity was evaluated by sequential treatment with SB 9200 followed by Entecavir (ETV) <italic>versus</italic> sequential treatment with ETV followed by SB 9200.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Investigational Drugs</title><p>SB 9200 was manufactured by Spring Bank Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Woodchucks were monitored twice daily by husbandry staff of the Animal Facilities at Georgetown University for water and food intake, in addition to daily monitoring by veterinarians and/or animal personnel for well-being and general health. Assessment of physical condition was supported by weekly measurements of body weight and body temperature. Since hepatic tumors and HCC develop as a consequence of chronic WHV infection, woodchucks underwent weekly ultrasound examination of the liver. Monthly blood collections were performed for determination of hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, including liver enzymes such as gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), which is an oncogenic biomarker in this animal model and indicative of existing/growing liver tumors [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Woodchucks were anesthetized by intramuscular injection of ketamine (50 mg/kg) and xylazine (5 mg/kg). Prior to euthanasia, woodchucks were anesthetized as described above and euthanized by an overdose of Beuthanasia-D solution (80&#x02013;100 mg/kg) administered by intracardiac injection, followed by bilateral intercostal thoracotomy.</p><p>Woodchucks used in this study were born in captivity and infected at 3 days of age with WHV. At the start of the study, woodchucks with chronic WHV infection were confirmed positive for serum WHV DNA and WHV surface antigen (WHsAg) and had undetectable antibodies to WHsAg (anti-WHs). Absence of liver tumors in animals with low GGT was confirmed by ultrasonography. Chronic WHV carrier woodchucks were assigned and stratified by gender, body weight, and by pretreatment serum markers (WHV DNA and WHsAg loads) and serum liver enzyme activities (GGT, sorbitol-dehydrogenase (SDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) serum levels) into two groups (n = 5 each) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p><fig id="pone.0169631.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0169631.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Study Design of Sequential Treatment with SB 9200 Followed by ETV or of Sequential Treatment with ETV Followed by SB 9200 in Chronic WHV Carrier Woodchucks.</title><p>Two groups of 5 woodchucks each were treated once daily, orally either with SB 9200 (30 mg/kg/day) or ETV (0.5 mg/kg/day).

Although the effect on WHsAg was not sustained, this apparent disconnection in the kinetics of viremia and antigenemia is unclear at the moment but could suggest an added overlapping treatment effect of SB 9200 on this viral antigen.

Considering that ETV treatment in Group 1 failed to induce marked expression of the above genes in blood, and that SB 9200 treatment in Group 2 was associated with suppression of WHV replication, these results suggest that the induction of host innate immunity plays a crucial role in the antiviral response mediated by SB 9200.

At the end of SB 9200 treatment in this group, transcript levels of immune response genes were reduced but increased expression of ISGs, including OAS1 that was not observed in the periphery, was noted during follow-up until the end of the study. Different to the expression of cytokines in blood which was observed during SB 9200 treatment in Group 2, IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2; and IL-6 in liver transiently increased at the end of ETV treatment, with a peak during follow-up and a decline at the end of the study. Comparable to the periphery, CXCL10 expression in Group 2 increased at the end of SB 9200 treatment, and even more so at the end of the 16-week treatment period and stayed elevated thereafter. Increased expression of ISG15 and OAS1 was also seen at the end of the study. Despite these deviations, hepatic gene expression was comparable between both treatment regimens (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003e;0.05). Since hepatic expression of innate immune response genes in Group 2 lasted beyond the end of treatment, and peak expression of most genes was observed between follow-up and the end of the study, these results suggest that the delayed recrudescence of viral replication after sequential treatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV was (in part) a consequence of the induced host innate immunity. As viral relapse was eventually observed, the results further indicate that additional antiviral immune mechanisms contributed to the overall treatment response to SB 9200 and ETV. As mentioned above, a longer duration of treatment with SB 9200 may have resulted in more sustained virological response.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Discussion</title><p>For evaluating the overall antiviral response against HBV, chronic WHV carrier woodchucks were first treated with SB 9200 for induction of innate immune response followed by treatment with ETV for additional reduction of viral burden. The efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamics associated with this treatment regimen were compared to treatment, first with ETV for initial rapid suppression of WHV replication followed by immune modulation with SB 9200. Induction of host immunity by pretreatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV resulted in multi-log reductions in serum viremia and antigenemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and in noticeable declines in hepatic WHV nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g003">Fig 3</xref>) and antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g004">Fig 4</xref>) as well as slowed liver disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g005">Fig 5</xref>) and delayed viral relapse following treatment discontinuation, all of which was considered superior to the antiviral response observed when using the strategy of viral reduction with ETV followed by immune modulation with SB 9200.</p><p>During infections, viral RNA is mainly sensed by pattern-recognition receptors such as RIG-1 and NOD2 [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Binding of these sensor proteins to PAMP within the viral RNA activates downstream signaling pathways leading to the induction of type I and type III IFNs and inflammatory cytokines [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, sensing of viral RNA is a crucial process to induce antiviral innate immune responses for limiting viral replication and for activation of adaptive immunity [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. SB 9200 has potent antiviral activity against wild-type and drug-resistant variants of HBV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and also against WHV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In analogy to the mechanism described for HBV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it appears that the direct antiviral property of SB 9200 may involve interference of the hepadnavirus polymerase to engage with the HBV or WHV pgRNA by SB 9200 activated RIG-I and NOD2. The assumption is consistent with the antiviral efficacy of SB 9200 in HBV transgenic mice, an inherently immunotolerant animal model of chronic HBV infection, in which monotherapy with SB 9200 resulted in significant reduction in liver HBV DNA that was comparable to that of Adefovir [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Furthermore, SB 9200 has additionally antiviral activity against RNA viruses, including, HCV, Norovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], consistent with the expectation that activation of viral sensors by this compound should be independent of the type of virus and genotypes. In woodchucks, monotherapy with SB 9200 for 12 weeks induced dose-dependent effects on WHV replication which were associated with the expression of IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2; and ISGs in blood and liver, indicating that the host immune stimulating property of SB 9200 apparently is an important contributor to the overall antiviral activity of this compound [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Since host innate immune responses in the previous study correlated with a prolonged activation of the RIG-I/NOD2 pathway, including upregulated expression of RIG-I, NOD2, STING, and IRF3, and presence of elevated RIG-I protein in liver, this suggested that SB 9200 induces endogenous type I IFNs <italic>via</italic> the activation of viral sensor proteins. As dose-dependent recrudescence of WHV replication following discontinuation of monotherapy with SB 9200 was observed [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the present study tested the antiviral effects of SB 9200 during sequential treatment with ETV. The applied treatment regimen to woodchucks, involving SB 9200 in combination with a nucleos(t)ide, is considered the most likely therapeutic option of this compound for future treatment of HBV in patients.</p><p>The overall antiviral response induced by sequential treatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV in the present study was in the range of those of nucleos(t)ides previously evaluated in woodchucks. The 6.4 log<sub>10</sub> magnitude of viral load reduction in serum observed in Group 2 after 16 weeks of sequential treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g002">Fig 2</xref>) was superior to monotherapy with Lamivudine, Emtricitabine, Tenofovir, and Adefovir after administration for 12 to 16 weeks [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] but comparable to ETV and Clevudine given for a similar duration [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. As SB 9200 has immune stimulating activity, in addition to its direct antiviral property, the maximum reduction in serum viremia was also in the range obtained with immunomodulators recently tested in woodchucks, including recombinant woodchuck IFN-&#x003b1;5 (only in 3 of 7 (43%) woodchucks responding to treatment), GS-9620 (a toll-like receptor 7 agonist), and ETV in combination with an antibody to programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. In contrast to monotherapy with Lamivudine, Emtricitabine, Tenofovir, and Adefovir but comparable to Clevudine, ETV alone or in combination with anti-PD-L1, and IFN-&#x003b1;5 in responder woodchucks, sequential treatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV resulted in marked WHsAg reduction of 3.3 log<sub>10</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Common for treatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV and for most other compounds and treatment regimens described above, except for GS-9620, ETV plus anti-PD-L1, and responder woodchucks to IFN-&#x003b1;5 treatment, was the viral rebound following treatment discontinuation. Furthermore, and comparable to most other compounds and combination treatment strategies (but not for GS-9620 and ETV plus anti-PD-L1), seroconversion was not observed as SB 9200 followed by ETV did not produce (sustained) loss of WHsAg.</p><p>Comparable to sequential treatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g006">Fig 6</xref>), the above compounds and treatment regimens also induced transient increases in liver enzymes in woodchucks during treatment, before serum activity of SDH and AST (and ALT) became normalized at the end of treatment. Since the SDH level in Group 2 peaked at week 4, stayed elevated until the end of the 16-week treatment period, and was temporally associated with initial and then marked reductions in serum WHsAg, hepatic WHV cccDNA, and hepatic WHcAg and WHsAg expression, the rise in this liver enzyme and its durable presence thereafter may indicate in part immune-mediated viral clearance of infected hepatocytes by cytotoxic effector cells as it has been also suggested in other treatment studies in woodchucks with immunomodulators such as IFN-&#x003b1;5 and GS-9620 [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, as liver inflammation was undetectable at the end of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g005">Fig 5</xref>), this may further indicate that other, non-cytolytic mechanism(s) contributed to the peak suppression of WHV replication as also observed during treatment with IFN-&#x003b1;5 and GS-9620 [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. General cytotoxicity or even adverse effects mediated by the applied treatment regimens were not noted, and the elevated serum transaminase activity was not associated with necrosis in liver (data not shown). Interestingly, the SDH level in Group 1 also peaked at week 4 at the end of ETV treatment and then stayed elevated through the SB 9200 treatment period until the end of the study but this was not associated with a comparable reduction of WHV markers in serum and liver as observed in Group 2. The rise in serum transaminase activity in this group, therefore, may indicate a different underlying cause such as mediated by a pro-inflammatory immune response rather than by cytotoxic effector cells (see below).</p><p>Considering the diminished or impaired innate immune response in chronic HBV and WHV infections [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], the observed peripheral and hepatic induction of IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2; and ISGs such as CXCL10 and ISG15, and the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, during sequential treatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV is important because it suggests that an antiviral innate immune response was induced (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g008">8</xref>). Since the host immunity induced in Group 2 lasted even beyond treatment, it apparently also modulated the viral rebound following treatment discontinuation. This is further supported by the observation that the immediate recrudescence of viral replication in Group 1 was not temporally associated with innate immune responses in blood and liver. Since recrudescence of viral replication following cessation of prolonged monotherapy with ETV can be variable in individual woodchucks [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], it could be argued that viral relapse from ETV treatment is itself slow, or slower than relapse from SB 9200 treatment, thereby causing the delayed rebound that was observed in Group 2. While the inclusion of control groups receiving ETV and SB 9200 alone in the present study was not possible for addressing this question, a comparison of viral rebound kinetics following 4 weeks of monotherapy with ETV [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] or 12 weeks of monotherapy with SB 9200 [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] using the same doses as applied in the present study indicates that viral relapse occurs rather rapidly with either drug and that rebound from ETV treatment is not markedly slower than from SB 9200 treatment.</p><p>Considering the above result on long-lasting host immunity in Group 2, and the transient rebound of serum viremia and antigenemia in Group 1 during SB 9200 treatment after discontinuation of ETV dosing, it appears that SB 9200 needs to be administered for a certain duration before it unfolds its full immune stimulating potential. This assumption is supported by the results of the previous study in woodchucks [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] that suggest activation of the viral sensor pathway and induction of host immune response after 6&#x02013;12 weeks of SB 9200 administration. Once induced by SB 9200, activation of the RIG-I/NOD2 pathway and induction of host immunity is present in woodchucks for a prolonged time. Additionally, the elevated intrahepatic levels of IFN-&#x003b1;, IFN-&#x003b2;, CXCL10, and ISG15 in Group 1 at week 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g008">Fig 8</xref>) may indicate that host innate immune response was preactivated to some extent at the end of ETV treatment. Together with the increased IL-6 level in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g008">Fig 8</xref>), indicating the presence of a pro-inflammatory immune response, and the rise in serum SDH activity at this time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0169631.g006">Fig 6</xref>), this overall suggests that the hepatic immune environment in Group 1 was apparently different at the start of SB 9200 treatment when compared to Group 2. Since treatment with SB 9200 aims at inducing an endogenous type I IFN response <italic>via</italic> the activation of the RIG-I/NOD2 pathway, it appears that the applied immunomodulatory therapy is more efficient when innate and/or pro-inflammatory immune responses are not already activated in liver as it was the situation in Group 2. Differences in the antiviral response to IFN-&#x003b1; treatment that are determined by preactivation of host immune responses have been described in HCV-infected patients [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>An interesting finding of the present and previous studies in woodchucks was that the antiviral response to SB 9200, alone or followed by ETV, did not correlate well with the long-lasting hepatic expression of antiviral ISGs tested, suggesting that other immune response and/or antiviral mechanisms may play a role, especially in the peak response to treatment. This assumption is plausible considering that humans, chimpanzees, and woodchucks resolve HBV and WHV infection without inducing a strong type I IFN response [<xref rid="pone.0169631.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0169631.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, there are several limitations to consider: Since only three antiviral ISGs were tested, peripheral and hepatic expression of other antiviral ISGs may be important to and correlate with treatment response. In addition, as the collection of liver biopsy materials was restricted to the begin and end of the 12-week treatment period with SB 9200, significant induction of type I IFNs and most ISGs by this compound in liver during treatment may have been missed. Furthermore, the durable expression of antiviral ISGs beyond the end of sequential treatment may not entirely attributable to SB 9200 and ETV and could additionally include an immune response of the host to the recurrence of viral replication following cessation of treatment. Since gene expression during treatment was restricted to 2&#x02013;4 hours post-dose, it is likely that maximum expression of immune response genes was not detected and that peak induction may be associated with the antiviral response to SB 9200.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec018"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, the induction of host innate immune response in woodchucks by pretreatment with SB 9200 followed by ETV administration for additional viral load reduction resulted in declines in WHV DNA, WHV RNA, and WHV proteins in blood and liver. The magnitude of suppression in WHV replication during sequential treatment and the delayed viral rebound upon treatment discontinuation were superior to the antiviral effect obtained by using the strategy of viral load reduction with ETV followed by immune modulation with SB 9200. Antiviral efficacy of SB 9200 during the latter treatment regimen may have been limited by the innate and/or pro-inflammatory immune responses already present in liver. Considering all results, it appears that an immunotherapy designed at modulating the endogenous IFN-&#x003b1;/IFN-&#x003b2; response is more likely to be successful in a liver environment that is characterized by absent or only limited preactivation of host immune responses. These data in woodchucks, a fully immunocompetent animal model of CHB, support the ongoing Phase II clinical trials of SB 9200, alone as well as sequential, in combination studies with a nucleoside, in the treatment of chronic HBV in patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors gratefully acknowledge Drs.
