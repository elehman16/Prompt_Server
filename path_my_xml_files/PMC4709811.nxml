The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the vaginal cream of hyaluronic acid and conjugated estrogen (Premarin) in treatment of vaginal atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This study was a randomized controlled clinical trial on 56 menopausal women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy; they were randomly allocated to two groups (recipient conjugated estrogen and hyaluronic acid). The severity of each sign of atrophy was evaluated by visual analog signals (VAS) and on the basis of a four point scale. Also to recognize the cellular maturation with pap smear and the maturation degree were calculated according to the formula and scores 0-100. As to the vaginal PH, we used PH marker band, the rate of which was divided into 4 degrees. Data were analyzed using SPSS, version 20, and P&#x02264;0.05 was considered as significant.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The results of this study showed that the symptoms of vaginal atrophy compared with the baseline level were relieved significantly in both groups. Dryness, itching, maturation index, PH and composite score of the vaginal symptoms were relieved significantly in both groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). Dyspareunia in Premarin (P&#x0003c;0.05) and hyaluronic acid (P&#x0003c;0.001) decreased compared with pre-treatment. Urinary incontinence only showed improvement in the hyaluronic acid group (P&#x0003c;0.05). Improvement in urinary incontinence, dryness, maturation index (P&#x0003c;0.05) and composite score of vaginal symptoms (P&#x0003c;0.001) in the hyaluronic acid group was better than those in the Premarin group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>According to the results of the present study, hyaluronic acid and conjugated estrogen improved the symptoms of vaginal atrophy. But hyaluronic acid was more effective and this drug is suggested for those who do not want to or cannot take local hormone treatment.</p><p><bold>Trial Registration Number:</bold> IRCT2013022712644N1</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>Atrophic vaginitis</kwd><kwd>Estrogen</kwd><kwd>Hyaluronic acid</kwd><kwd>Menopause</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Menopause is defined as the permanent experience of long-lasting endocrinal, somatic and psychological changes.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> During these periods, women experience some symptoms which begin with vasomotor signs (like flushing, night sweat, etc.), changes in menstruation cycle, vaginal dryness, Itching and dyspareunia and continue with temper changes, memory reduction, disorders of sexual arousal reduction, stress urinary incontinence and complaint from musculo-eskeletal pains.</p><p>Even though some of the complications subside during the time, the symptoms of vasomotor, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia which are connected to disorder in sexual function related to lack of sexual hormones (especially Estrogen) irrespective of treatment will progress markedly and unfortunately will not be solved without treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup></p><p>Following the subsidence or discontinuity of this hormone, women are affected by symptomatic vaginal atrophy and basic changes will occur in their genitor-urinary mucous.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> These changes include vaginal dryness, irritation, itching, post-coital bleeding, vaginal discharge and dyspareunia and in the urinary system, urine frequency and urinary incontinence appear.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>As a whole, it is estimated that 10.0-40.0% of women experience the symptoms connected with atrophy and on the other hand about 16 million women (500 thousand new cases) show such symptoms every year.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> In confirmation to the prevalence of this problem, Crandall C et-al. (2004) and Mac Bride et-al. (2010) considered this matter and reported that the vaginal dryness was observed from 23.4% pre-menopause to 61.5% post-menopause among the women under the study.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The results of the researches conducted by Kingerberg et-al. (2009) and Mehta and Bachman also showed that 10.0-40.0% of women at the post-menopause stage face inconvenience and problems related to vulva and vaginal atrophy that requires treatment but only 25.0% of them refer for treatment.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup></p><p>Two hormonal and non-hormonal methods are usually used in treatment of such problems. In the studies which applied non-hormonal method, materials like lubricants and vaginal moistures,<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> vitamin E oil and improving lifestyle like stopping cigarette smoking have been mentioned.<sup><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> For hormonal methods also the conjugated Estrogen in two forms of systemic (oral and parenteral) and topical are prescribed.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The systemic method is useful for those women who are suffering from flushing and sleep disorder related to vaginal atrophy.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup></p><p>On the other hand, the contraindication of this method for tumors sensitive to Estrogen, liver failure and having thromboembolization history related to Estrogen should also be considered. Also, attention should be paid to their side effects like breast sensitivity, nausea and vomiting, vaginal bleeding, mild increase in the risk of affecting the neoplasms dependent on Estrogen and in lesser amount the pain in the perineal area.<sup><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup></p><p>Topical treatment in the form of cream, tablet and ring (conjugated Estrogen 0.625) which has been confirmed by FDA (Food and Drug Association) with the objective of preparing sufficient Estrogen for reducing the symptoms of atrophy and relief of its resultant complications is applied.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> In this regard, researches show that topical drugs have similar effect<sup><xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> and even though the probability of general absorption is there, as to the influence and improvement of the symptoms to the rate of 80.0-90.0%, which is expected, they are similar.<sup><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Topical hormones are also not without complication; the results of a study (2004) showed that they have similar effects in the incidence rate of hyperplasia and endometrial thickening.<sup><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> Creams are probably accompanied with more side-effects compared with ring or tablet which may be due to the application of a dose more than recommended.<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>Considering the aforesaid points, for those who do not select Estrogen-therapy due to the medical prohibitions or having side-effects,<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> the non-hormonal interventions which are mostly neglected for the sexual problems are propounded. In these methods, applying lubricants, moisture creams and using dilators are recommended. It was reported in a study in the year 2010 that their use will reduce the complications of vaginal atrophy.<sup><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Also, in this connection, materials which could be applied as gel in the form of the extract of some plants like Vitex Agnus-Castus and compounds like Hyaluronic Acid alone or in combination with Vitamin E for the treatment of sexual disorders and vaginal atrophy are mentioned.<sup><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Regarding Hyaluronic Acid which is a natural polysaccharide, it can be mentioned that, it forms an important part of extra-cellular matrix of the skin and cartilage. This substance is able to conserve a large amount of water molecules and due to the properties like formation and conservation of extra-cellular inflation, skin moistening in the case of inflammation and preservation of water equilibrium has a key role. Also, it is effective widely in treatment of skin diseases due to preservation of tissue consistency, facilitating the cellular emigration in the cases of inflammation and also the process of improvement and regeneration of the tissues.<sup><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p><p>Various studies carried out regarding Hyaluronic Acid have shown that this compound has been tolerated well without side-effects among patients and the complications have been observed only when applied in the form of parenteral jelly by creating susceptibility at injection sites as mild inconveniences, redness, edema and cyanosis.<sup><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> It should be notified that this medicine in the form of suppositories or tablets has rarely been used in Iran for treatment of atrophy of genitor-urinary system.</p><p>The present study aimed at achieving an appropriate and uncomplicated treatment, which is accepted by those who have contraindication for hormonal drug and or desire to use non-hormonal methods. Therefore, we tried to compare the effects of conjugated Estrogen cream 0.625 mg (hormonal) and hyaluronic acid cream (non-hormonal) for the treatment of atrophy and its complications with the aim to promote the health of menopause women. In spite of the importance of the matter and effect of vaginal atrophy symptoms on women&#x02019;s life, they are mostly not reported and do not go under treatment subsequently. Therefore, to remove such problems, beginning of treatment and taking care of them by physical evaluation, talking about their sexual problems and the qualitative problems of their life seem necessary.<sup><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study was approved by ethics committee under number: CT-92-6681 on Oct 2013 and was carried out in multi-stages as a simple randomized controlled clinical trial on 56 menopause women referred to Shahid Motahari Clinic during 6 months (September to March 2013-2014).

In a study by Ziagham et-al. (2012) which compared the effect of hyaluronic acid vaginal suppository with vitamin E in the treatment of vaginal atrophy among menopause women, both groups were similar as to the age, menopause duration, occupation, educational level and economical status and had no statistical difference.<sup><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup></p><p>In a study, the effect of Hyaluronic Acid vaginal tablet and Estradiol was compared on the vaginal atrophy for a period of 8 weeks; no significant difference was observed between the mean age and the age of menopause beginning among both groups.<sup><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In another study, the researchers compared the effect of Genestine with Hyaluronic Acid on vaginal Atrophy also no significant difference was observed between age, menopause age and their effects on vaginal symptoms.<sup><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup></p><p>The results of the research also indicated that both Hyaluronic Acid and Permarine improved the vaginal atrophy symptoms, cellular maturation increase and reduced PH; this improvement was sometimes more among the Hyaluronic Acid group.</p><p>We did not have access to the same study. But many researchers studied separately the effect of two aforesaid drugs on atrophy and their results were similar to those of the present study in selection of the objective group and effect of drug but there were some differences in terms of drug form and duration of the intervention.</p><p>In this respect, we reviewed some studies as Castelo-Branco C et al (2005) to study the management of post-menopausal vaginal atrophy and atrophic vaginitis with focuses on the changes involved in vaginal aging.
