The predominant co-morbidities of juvenile depression include sleep disturbances and persistent problems with the sleep-wake rhythm, which have shown to influence treatment outcomes negatively. Severe mood dysregulation is another condition that includes depressive symptoms and problems with the sleep-wake rhythm. Patients with severe mood dysregulation show symptoms of depression, reduced need for sleep, and disturbances in circadian functioning which negatively affect both disorder-specific symptoms and daytime functioning. One approach to treating both depression and problems with the sleep-wake rhythm is the use of light therapy. Light therapy is now a standard therapy for ameliorating symptoms of seasonal affective disorder and depression in adults, but has not yet been investigated in children and adolescents. In this trial, the effects of 2&#x000a0;weeks of morning bright-light therapy on juvenile depression and severe mood dysregulation will be evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>A total of 60 patients with depression, aged between 12 and 18&#x000a0;years, in some cases presenting additional symptoms of affective dysregulation, will be included in this trial.

About 1 out of 10 adults experiences affective disturbances and a loss of interest, the core symptoms of depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Behavioral and cognitive difficulties, including memory or attention problems, changes in eating behavior, and persistent sleep disturbances, have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Effective treatment strategies for MDD in adults include antidepressant medication, psychotherapy, or a combination of both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In adolescents, prevalence rates for MDD, also called juvenile depression in this group, are about 4 to 8%, and the rate seems to be increasing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This relatively high rate is of particular interest for two reasons.</p><p>First, the presentation of MDD in young people might be different from that in adults. However, there are many symptoms common to both groups, including irritability, low frustration tolerance, violent temper, and externalizing and histrionic behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These symptoms can lead to serious negative psychosocial consequences, including impaired academic and occupational functioning, high-risk sexual activity, and social difficulties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the predominant symptoms of juvenile depression implicate sleep disturbances and persistent problems with the sleep-wake rhythm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which are present in about 75% of adolescents with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Second, treating juvenile depression is difficult. The available treatments have substantial shortcomings, and remission rates of moderate to severe depression are low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the treatment of choice for mild depression, CBT alone might not be sufficient in more severe cases. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indicated no or only small differences between pharmacotherapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), psychotherapy, and placebo (for an overview, see the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). Combination trials of both SSRIs and psychotherapy, a treatment that is commonly implemented in clinical practice, have not shown superiority to treatment with either therapy alone, and remission rates have been reported to be less than 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Another important point is that treatment research has primarily focused on acute treatment, whereas early-onset depression is often chronic and recurrent. One influencing factor might be the presence of co-occurring sleep disturbances, which often remain as a residual symptom even after successful acute treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These problems with the sleep-wake rhythm have been suggested to be a robust risk factor for the development of both the first depressive episode and recurrent episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Sleep disturbances and insomnia presenting in juvenile depression are associated with higher depression severity, greater fatigue, and higher rates of suicidal behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Emslie <italic>et al</italic>. noted in two large, double-blind RCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] that sleep disturbances may negatively affect treatment response, as adolescents receiving treatment with the SSRI fluoxetine were less likely to respond to the treatment if they also had sleep disturbances. Based on these results, it is essential that sleep disturbances are adequately assessed and co-treated consistently along with the depression. However, there is as yet no evidence-based treatment for insomnia in adolescents with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>One possible non-pharmacological treatment approach for ameliorating depressive symptoms and co-occurring sleep disturbances is morning bright-light therapy, which has been used successfully for adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Light therapy has primarily been studied in patients with seasonal affective disorder (SAD) and has been shown to have good efficacy in ameliorating depressive symptoms in this subgroup. In adults with SAD, Lam <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] reported that light therapy was as efficient as antidepressant treatment with fluoxetine, but had a faster onset of action and fewer side effects. The effects of light therapy are apparent after about 1&#x000a0;week of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and remission rates of up to 80% have been reported for SAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, Even and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] carried out a systematic review based on 15 studies, and reported efficacy of light therapy as an adjuvant treatment to antidepressants in non-seasonal depression as well. However, they concluded that the evidence for the effects of light therapy alone (without antidepressant) was still inconsistent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Light therapy has also been shown to be effective for other symptoms besides depression. For example, it may induce stabilization of the circadian rhythm (the biological rhythm controlling the sleep-wake cycle) and thereby, improve difficulties with sleep onset and difficulties sleeping through the night [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This is of particular interest because an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion regulation has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], with the consequences of disturbed sleep including symptoms such as heightened impulsivity and aggressive behavior. Preliminary evidence indicates that light therapy has a positive influence on behavior, irritability and attention parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that, independent of specific diagnoses, the severity of psychiatric symptoms increases and long-term outcomes worsen when circadian disturbances are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], reinforcing the crucial relationship between sleep and regulation of emotions. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that light therapy might be a useful method of stabilizing circadian functioning and thereby inducing more general improvements on emotional regulation. Despite these positive results in adults, there have only been very few studies investigating light therapy for adolescents. One RCT of children and adolescents with SAD showed that 1&#x000a0;week of light therapy significantly decreased parent-rated depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A more recent 1-week trial of light therapy as an adjunctive treatment for young people with mild depression showed significant improvements in depression scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) from baseline to the end of therapy in the active treatment group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]; however, participants received concomitant CBT and pharmacotherapy during the trial, which may have led to additional positive effects.</p><p>One phenotype that has a high prevalence rate in clinical populations and that elicits considerable problems with emotional regulation, depression, and circadian disturbances is severe mood dysregulation (SMD). Children and adolescents with SMD show severe affective and behavioral dysregulation, including irritable mood, hyperarousal, and increased reactivity to negative emotional stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Characteristics of SMD include not only depressive symptoms that might develop into MDD later on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], but also circadian dysfunctions such as reduced need for sleep, disturbances in sleep continuity at sleep onset and through the night, lower sleep efficiency, reduced rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep and impaired daytime behavior, which have consistently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The initial treatment approaches, similar to those for pediatric bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), include mood stabilizers and stimulants, and have shown some positive effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. A novel psychosocial treatment with CBT indicated improvements in depressive symptoms, mood lability, and global functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Although these initial treatment approaches were reported to have some positive effects on SMD symptoms, children and adolescents with SMD and additional ADHD were more likely to remain significantly impaired than those with only ADHD after a 3-week combination trial with stimulants and behavior modification therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, a wider range of treatment approaches for SMD is needed, as those that have been evaluated to date have shown only limited improvements. It is possible that, as in juvenile depression, circadian disturbances might be an influencing factor on treatment outcome in SMD. Considering that preliminary results of light application besides SAD and MDD have shown positive influences on affective and behavioral regulation and on circadian functioning, light therapy might constitute a reasonable co-treatment for SMD symptoms as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>The proposed study is an RCT of bright-light therapy in juvenile depression. We plan to enroll 60 adolescents with depression. We hypothesize that 2&#x000a0;weeks of morning bright-light therapy will improve depressive symptoms and additional sleep disturbances in these adolescents. On an exploratory basis, the study will additionally evaluate the outcomes of morning light therapy on SMD symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Participants and recruitment</title><p>Participants of this study will be recruited from the inpatient unit of the LWL (University Hospital Hamm, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany), a tertiary-care hospital for child and adolescent psychiatry.

Each session will commence about 7.5&#x000a0;h after the estimated DLMO to parallel the experimental group.</p><p>Finding an appropriate control group for light therapy to minimize placebo effects is difficult, because these effects are expected to be relatively high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To design conditions that the patients will not consider a control group, we have chosen professional light-therapy devices for both groups, adjusting the lux levels respectively. To control for possible expectation bias, both groups will be instructed that the aim of the study is to compare two different types of light therapy. Moreover, to minimize bias, the therapists on the respective units will be informed that the light therapy for both groups is active.</p><p>To ensure that an appropriate and constant number of lux is administered in each group, intensities will be quantified using a lux meter (PCE-172; PCE Instruments, Meschede, Germany). The light intensity that will be used in this study lies within the range of normal daylight exposure.

The German version has shown good psychometric properties, with good test-retest-reliability (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;0.75) in a non-clinical population, and good internal consistency (&#x003b1; coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.92) for adolescent inpatients with depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical global impression scale</title><p>Assessment of general psychopathology will be performed using the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) for estimating symptom severity (CGI-S) and improvement (CGI-I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. The CGI is a 7-point scale that requires a rating of illness severity at the time of assessment.

In the proposed study, rating will be performed by clinicians blinded to group allocation.</p></sec><sec><title>Sleep questionnaire B - revised</title><p>Sleep and sleep difficulties will be assessed by using the Sleep Questionnaire (Schlaffragebogen) B - Revised (SF B/R) described by G&#x000f6;rtelmeyer <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. This questionnaire contains 31 questions, assessing the 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to assessment. Completion takes about 5 to 10&#x000a0;minutes, and 11 sleep indices can be created including: difficulties in sleep onset and in sleeping through the night, premature awakening, general sleep characteristics, total sleep duration, and sleep factors consisting of sleep quality, feeling of recovery after sleeping, mental balance before going to sleep, feeling of mental exhaustion before going to sleep, and psychosomatic symptoms during sleep phase. Internal consistency is moderate to excellent (&#x003b1; coefficient&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.68 to 0.92) for clinical populations. Test-retest reliability indicates that relatively stable sleep-related behavior and experiences can be assessed (r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.53 to r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.91).</p></sec><sec><title>DLMO</title><p>Melatonin production by the pineal gland is under the influence of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN), which receives information from the retina about daily patterns of light and darkness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Production of melatonin is inhibited by light and induced by darkness. Hence, when dim lighting is provided, the human body starts producing melatonin about 2&#x000a0;hours before bedtime, and this physiological process is called DLMO. Assessment of the DLMO can be considered the gold standard for measuring melatonin levels and circadian rhythms. In the present study, at the assessments T1, T2, and T5, four sequential melatonin saliva samples will be collected at hourly intervals, respectively. Collection starts from 4&#x000a0;hours before predicted bedtime (19.00 to 22.00&#x000a0;hours) under conditions of dim light. Light therapy has been shown to be most effective when it is applied about 7.5 to 9.5&#x000a0;hours after the individual DLMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Saliva will be sampled using sterile collection devices (Salivettes; Sarstedt AG &#x00026; Co, N&#x000fc;mbrecht, Germany). On the day of sampling, patients will be instructed to avoid caffeinated beverages, orange juice, eggs, chocolate, and bananas, because all these have been shown to have a possible influence on melatonin level. During the evening, electronic devies such as video games, TV, and cell phones will not be allowed because the light produced by such devices may have a melatonin-suppressing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Patients will be instructed to refrain from food or drinks for 30&#x000a0;minutes before sampling, and directly before sampling they will be instructed to rinse their mouth with water. Samples will be stored at &#x02212;26&#x000b0;C until analysis, and all samples will be analyzed simultaneously.

With this questionnaire, the individual chronotype can be estimated based upon 19 questions that are summed to give a total score and the individual DLMO is then estimated, as it has been shown to have a good correlation with the MEQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Using this procedure, the optimal time point for light exposure can be estimated directly (about 7.5&#x000a0;h after the individual DLMO) without the requirement for physiological data.</p></sec><sec><title>Child behavior checklist</title><p>The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is one of the best-studied, empirically derived parent checklists for measuring general child and adolescent psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It assesses the child&#x02019;s behavior over the past 6&#x000a0;months using a total of 118 items (plus two optional questions), and is rated by the parents or primary caregivers. The questionnaire includes a total problem score, two higher level scales (externalizing problems and internalizing problems), and eight syndrome scales (withdrawn, somatic complaints, anxious/depressed, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, delinquent behavior, and aggressive behavior). The reliability, factorial validity and discriminant validity of the German adaptation of the CBCL have been confirmed by previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Recently, a specific &#x02018;dysregulation profile&#x02019; has been identified in the CBCL, capturing severe affective dysregulation (CBCL-DP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. This profile is characterized by simultaneous high values on the syndrome scales &#x02018;anxious/depressed,&#x02019; &#x02018;attention problems,&#x02019; and aggressive &#x02018;behavior.&#x02019; The CBCL-DP has been consistently found to be associated with disruptive behavior disorders, suicidal behavior, and reduced need for sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], and it will be calculated to assess the phenotype of affective dysregulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Strengths and difficulties questionnaire</title><p>In addition to the CBCL, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) will be used in order to assess short-term changes and to evaluate parent and patient ratings. The SDQ is a brief behavioral screening questionnaire assessing 25 attributes, some positive and others negative, which can be allocated to five scales (emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and pro-social behavior) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>]. These scales can be summed to calculate a total difficulties score and, like in the CBCL, a dysregulation profile can be calculated that corresponds to the CBCL-DP, with the advantage of being able to assess short-term changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In this study, patient and parent rating versions of the SDQ will be used. The sensitivity to change of the SDQ allows estimation of treatment efficacy (&#x003b1;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.73; retest stability&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.62) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], therebv allowing monitoring of symptom changes of affective dysregulation and behavior during the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Tests of attentional performance</title><p>With the Tests of Attentional Performance (TAP), a large spectrum of specific attentional performances can be assessed in a computerized form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The following four subtests will be administered to evaluate highly relevant attention-related parameters.</p><p>1) Covert shift of attention. This assesses the ability to shift the attentional focus, measuring reaction times for valid and invalid cues in a visual reaction time task.</p><p>2) Go/nogo. Assesses the ability to suppress a response in the presence of irrelevant stimuli.</p><p>3) Alertness. Assesses the general level of arousal (tonic arousal), its stability over a longer period (intrinsic arousal) and the magnitude of elevation of arousal, induced by a warning signal (phasic arousal).</p><p>4) Divided Attention.

It is a frequently used screening instrument for assessing symptoms of SAD, with a high internal consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>] and has recently been used in young adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. In the present study it will be administered to calculate a total seasonality score, with seasonality being the degree to which seasonal changes affect criteria such as mood, energy, sleep length, appetite, food preference, or the wish to socialize with other people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>], and thus will be used to control for seasonal effects.</p></sec><sec><title>Therapy expectancy</title><p>Therapy expectancy will be assessed by using a modification of the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire, which is a quick and easily administered scale for measuring treatment expectancy and rationale credibility for use in clinical outcome studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. High internal consistency has been reported, lying between 0.84 and 0.85 for the whole scale. Inter-item correlations between studies ranged from 0.53 to 0.85 for the items on the expectancy factor, and between 0.62 and 0.78 for items on the credibility factor. Test-retest reliability over a 1-week period was also found to be good, at 0.82 for expectancy and 0.75 for credibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>].

A similar study for adolescent inpatients is not available. Therefore, effect-size calculation will be based on evidence from adult outpatients. Although research is generally scarce, it is assumed that the active light therapy intervention for SAD will have an effect size (pre-post) of about 0.78 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>], which can be considered a conservative estimate because effect sizes might be considerably higher [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Golden <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>] divided the studies used in their meta-analysis into four categories, and derived effect sizes for them. In the category &#x02018;non-seasonal depression&#x02019;, an effect size of 0.53 was reported for bright-light treatment, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.18 to 0.89. Conservative calculations indicate that the expected outcome for our study will require a total sample size of 54 subjects (&#x003b1; = 0.05, two-sided test) to achieve a power of 80%.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Data will be assessed using SPSS software (version 20; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Correctness of the data will be assured by double-entry of the data. Data will be analyzed according to both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP; efficacy population) principles. ITT will assess all randomized patients, while PP analyses will assess patients who receive 2&#x000a0;weeks of morning light therapy with no violation of the study protocol.</p><p>All planned comparisons will compare T2 to T5 relative to T1. The primary endpoint of the study is change in depressive symptoms (BDI-II total score) during the trial. Baseline depression level (that is, BDI-II total score at T1) will be controlled for in the two-factor repeated-measures ANCOVA. This model accounts for differences between groups at baseline. Furthermore, the study will evaluate whether the effects of morning light therapy on mood might partly be mediated by its effect on the circadian rhythm, and will be assessed by questionnaires and saliva samples. For missing values, the multiple imputations (MI) technique will be used, because a recent meta-analysis for RCTs in obesity found this to have modest superiority to fitting mixed linear models or using last observation carried forward (LOCF) methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. With the MI technique, plausible values for the missing data are imputed. Each of the datasets is then analyzed separately using the desired model (in this case, the two-factor repeated-measures ANCOVA). With this parameter, estimates are made for each of the datasets, and these are then combined using standard rules for MI analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>]. These combined parameter estimates can then be used for hypothesis testing and for making inferences. In this RCT, two-factor repeated-measures ANCOVA will be used with group as between-subject factor and time as within-subject factor (T1 to T5). In cases of significant correlations with the primary endpoint, covariates will include baseline BDI-II score, gender, intelligence, seasonality, and circadian preference. The 95% confidence intervals and pre-post effect sizes will be derived for each analysis.

This initial pilot study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of this chronobiological intervention for depressive adolescents by implementing a 2-week period of bright-light therapy. Because it will be implemented in an inpatient setting, there are several limitations, such as the short duration of bright-light therapy, interruption by weekend breaks, and lack of daily mood self-assessments that would allow a detailed picture of response to this chronobiological intervention. An additional challenge is the issue of blinding. In their systematic review, Even <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] discussed the possibility that some patients in a control group exposed to a device that only delivers 100 lux may correctly guess that they have been allocated to the placebo group. To control for possible expectation bias, both groups in this study will be instructed that the aim of the study is to compare two different types of light therapy. In accordance with this, it is important to bear in mind that even 100 lux in the morning might have some subtle effect on the circadian system. However, the answers to the questions of whether morning light therapy will have a beneficial effect on non-seasonal depressive symptoms in young people, and whether 2&#x000a0;weeks of morning light will be sufficient to elicit more general positive effects on the sleep-wake rhythm and on affective dysregulation, should be answered. Moreover, we expect insight into possible changes on a physiological level, such as shifts in DLMO.</p><p>After this pilot study has been conducted and specific effects of bright-light therapy have been observed, a combination of various chronotherapeutic interventions, such as light therapy, wake therapy, and additional sleep-phase advance could be conducted to investigate effects in young people more thoroughly.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Ongoing trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>MH has served in an advisory or consultancy role for: Lilly, Novartis, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and has received conference attendance support or was paid for public speaking by AstraZeneca, Janssen-Cilag, Lilly, Neuroconn, Novartis, Medice, and Shire.
