IBS is not a life-threatening disease, but has been shown to limit the activity of patients and to negatively impact social functioning, with substantial economic loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is also reported that IBS can severely compromise the patient&#x02019;s quality of life (QOL), even to a greater extent than in patients with end-stage renal disease or patients with diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Surveys conducted outside Japan have reported that the estimated prevalence of IBS in the general population is from 5 to 20%, with about 200 new patients per 100,000 population per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In Japan, a large population-based internet survey using the Rome III criteria by Kanazawa et al. revealed that about 16.5% of the survey population met the Rome III criteria for IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A web-based survey by Miwa that used Rome III showed that 13% of the respondents had IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>A variety of factors are considered to be involved in the etiology of IBS, including abnormal gastrointestinal (GI) motility, visceral hypersensitivity, abnormal brain&#x02013;gut interactions, GI infection, and sociopsychological strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Stress-related disturbance of brain&#x02013;gut interactions is a particularly important factor in functional gastrointestinal disorders including IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. IBS patients reported significantly more stress than controls without bowel dysfunction and the slope of the regression equation relating bowel symptoms to stress was significantly steeper for the IBS group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Stress is therefore considered to induce abnormal GI motility via efferent nerves, which in turn worsen the stress response by stimulating afferent nerves, resulting visceral hypersensitivity. This vicious cycle is thought to cause persistence of bowel symptoms. Patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D) show exaggerated colonic motility in response to colonic distention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and secretion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Ramosetron, a potent and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], was developed and has been approved at a dosage of &#x0201c;ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for IBS-D in male patients&#x0201d; since July, 2008 in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], followed by a supplemental indication and dosage of &#x0201c;ramosetron 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for female patients&#x0201d; in May, 2015 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In rats, ramosetron clearly reduces stress-induced diarrhea and defecation caused by corticotrophin-releasing hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, ramosetron increases the threshold of abdominal pain responses induced by colonic distension in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Thus, ramosetron is expected to improve IBS symptoms via reducing the vicious cycle for stress-related disturbance of brain&#x02013;gut interactions.</p><p>The choice of primary endpoint for a clinical trial is one of the most important determinants of the ability of a clinical trial to demonstrate the efficacy of therapeutic agents. The Committee on Functional Bowel Disorders and Functional Abdominal Pain, an international working group for the establishment of diagnostic criteria for functional gastrointestinal tract disturbances including IBS, discussed primary variables in clinical studies. It was concluded that, since IBS is a syndrome, instead of evaluating individual symptoms the improvement of overall symptoms of the syndrome should be assessed and subjects should evaluate the effects of therapeutics because improvement of subjective symptoms is clinically important for IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Consequently, the global assessment of relief of overall IBS symptoms was chosen to be the primary variable for previous clinical studies of ramosetron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and its efficacy was demonstrated. Global assessment allows patients to assess improvement of multiple IBS symptoms, however, global assessment cannot show how ramosetron is effective for individual IBS symptoms. Therefore, it was deemed beneficial to assess &#x0201c;clinically meaningful improvements, focusing on the patient&#x02019;s chief complaint and the severity of major IBS symptoms&#x0201d; in addition to the global assessment. This study was conducted as a pilot study to explore and examine those variables. Results that focus on the severity of major IBS symptoms are contained in a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. We thus used the same database as the previous report, but the hypothesis was completely different from that of the previous study. This report concentrates on improvement of the patient&#x02019;s chief complaint in a clinical study of ramosetron.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient population</title><p>The patients were the same as in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In brief, this study was conducted from June 2009 to December 2009 at 25 Japanese centers that have departments of gastroenterology. Almost all of the sites were primary care. Male outpatients aged 20&#x02013;64 years were diagnosed with IBS-D based on the Rome III criteria. The study protocol was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the institutional review board at each site. All patients provided written informed consent prior to participating in study-related procedures.</p><p>Patients satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria were enrolled in this study. Based on a medical interview conducted by the attending physician before provisional registration, patients were excluded if any of the following were evident: a history of resection of the stomach, small intestine, or large intestine (excluding appendicitis or resection of benign polyps); history or current evidence of inflammatory bowel disease; history or current evidence of ischemic colitis, concurrent infectious enteritis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, or other diseases that may affect gastrointestinal transit or colonic function; history or current evidence of abuse of drugs or alcohol within the previous year; malignant tumors; current evidence of severe depression or a severe anxiety disorder that could potentially affect the evaluation of study drug efficacy; concurrent serious cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal (excluding IBS), hematological, or neurological/psychiatric diseases; or a history of drug allergies. Other inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p>This randomized, placebo-controlled, pilot clinical trial comprised a provisional registration period, a one-week baseline period, and a 12-week treatment period, similar to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Following the baseline period, eligible patients were randomly assigned to 12-week oral treatment with placebo or ramosetron hydrochloride 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once daily before breakfast. Visits were scheduled at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 (or at discontinuation) to assess treatment efficacy, drug compliance, and occurrence of adverse events. Randomization was performed in a 1:1 ratio using a block size of four based on a randomization list developed by a third-party contract research organization. Placebo tablets were externally distinguishable from ramosetron hydrochloride tablets, however, they were indistinguishable when packaged in press through pack sheets. All patients, investigators, and sponsors were blinded until all observations and evaluations were completed, statistical analysis plans were finalized, and all data had been locked. All authors had access to the study data and reviewed and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>Patients recorded Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] for every bowel movement throughout the study period in their diaries. They scored the severity of all abdominal pain/discomfort they had experienced on a five-point ordinate (numerical rating) scale and their continuous time at baseline, from week 1 to week 4, and at weeks 8 and 12. Every seven days during the treatment period, patients also graded summarized IBS symptoms compared with the baseline period on a five-point ordinate scale as follows: relief from overall IBS symptoms and abdominal pain/discomfort (0, completely relieved; 1, considerably relieved; 2, somewhat relieved; 3, unchanged; and 4, worsened) and improvement in abnormal bowel habits (0, nearly normalized; 1, considerably relieved; 2, somewhat relieved; 3, unchanged; and 4, worsened).</p><p>Symptoms related to the chief complaint were clarified by an investigator at an interview. The investigator scored the most bothersome IBS symptoms the patient had (nothing, abdominal pain/discomfort, stool form, stool frequency, urgency, feeling of incomplete evacuation, and others) as symptoms of the chief complaint at the week 0, 4, 8 and 12 (or at discontinuation) visits. The investigator also scored any improvement in symptoms of the chief complaint the patients had before administration compared to the baseline period on a five-point ordinate scale (0, completely relieved; 1, considerably relieved; 2, somewhat relieved; 3, unchanged; and 4, worsened) at the week 4, 8 and 12 (or at discontinuation) visits.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Efficacy and safety endpoints</title><p>To explore and examine variables that allow evaluation of &#x0201c;clinically significant improvements, focusing on the patient&#x02019;s chief complaint,&#x0201d; the chief complaint and its relief by the study drug were assessed in this exploratory study. As an <italic>ad hoc</italic> analysis, patients with scores of 0 (completely relieved) or 1 (considerably relieved) at each evaluation point were defined as responders, with relief of their chief complaint. Patients with missing data were regarded as non-responders.

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Discussion</title><p>Because IBS is a syndrome, most previous studies to develop agents for IBS have used global assessments as primary endpoints, as these allow patients to assess the improvement of overall symptoms of IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Individual symptoms of IBS were assessed as secondary endpoints. The most bothersome IBS symptoms reported in clinical trials of alosetron were abdominal pain and urgency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, there were no data regarding the chief complaint in previous clinical trials of ramosetron. In this study, to evaluate &#x0201c;clinically meaningful improvements&#x0201d; that focus on the patient&#x02019;s chief complaint, IBS-D patients enrolled in this study were asked about their most bothersome IBS symptoms and improvement of those symptoms at every visit. IBS is characterized by two major IBS symptoms, abdominal pain/discomfort and abnormal bowel habits. Regarding the chief complaint that patients had before administration, 34.0% of the patients in the ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group and 42.0% of the patients in the placebo group reported abdominal pain/discomfort. The remaining patients complained of abnormal bowel habits, including abnormal stool form, increased stool frequency, defecation urgency, and a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Of these, the highest proportions were related to stool form (19.1% in ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group and 18.0% in placebo group) and stool frequency (25.5, 20.0%, respectively). Stool form and stool frequency were thus considered to be the most important chief complaints among the bowel habit abnormalities. When compared to placebo, the greatest improvement in symptoms of the chief complaint that patients had before administration of ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group was shown in stool consistency. This result was consistent with the finding that BSFS scores were significantly lower in the ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group than in the placebo group.</p><p>We therefore found that ramosetron acted most effectively on stool consistency. Stool consistency correlates with colonic transit time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and can be a good indicator of bowel function. In rats, ramosetron also clearly reduced stress-induced diarrhea and accelerated defecation caused by corticotropin-releasing hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. To show how ramosetron is effective for individual IBS symptoms, focusing on stool consistency was considered to be acceptable in light of the drug&#x02019;s pharmacological mechanism. However, if the effect of ramosetron on stool consistency is excessive, it leads to constipation. In developing agents to treat IBS-D, it is insufficient to only compare the change in stool form from baseline between ramosetron and placebo. It was considered important to define a clinically meaningful improvement in stool consistency as well. BSFS scores of 3 to 5 are recognized as normal stool form in the Rome III criteria. Therefore, patients with weekly mean BSFS scores of 3 to 5 during one week of the treatment period and a decrease of one or more points in mean BSFS scores from the baseline period were defined as weekly responders. Patients who were weekly responders for at least two of four weeks in one month were defined as monthly responders. We thus defined monthly responder rates in respect to improvement in stool consistency and revealed greater responder rates in the ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group compared to placebo group (40.5% vs 18.9% at the last point, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.067), by <italic>ad hoc</italic> analysis. Then, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study from October 2010 to August 2011 with male IBS-D patients to evaluate the prospective effect of ramosetron with the improvement of stool consistency as the primary endpoint. A statistically significant improvement in stool consistency was shown in the ramosetron group compared to the placebo group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Because IBS is a syndrome that includes multiple lower gastrointestinal symptoms, it is not known whether patients are satisfied by an improvement in just one universal symptom. As a result, it is considered to be important to assess the improvement of overall IBS symptoms using global assessment during a clinical study of ramosetron. Moreover, the result that global assessment was correlated with improvement in the Japanese version IBS severity index suggests that global assessments reflect improvement of symptom severity in patients with IBS-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In a phase III study involving female IBS-D patients, the co-primary endpoints of monthly responder rate for global assessment of relief of overall IBS symptoms and improvement in stool consistency were used to evaluate the efficacy of ramosetron. The results showed that efficacy in the ramosetron group was significantly superior to that in the placebo group for both primary endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. BSFS scores were also significantly lower in the ramosetron 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group than in the placebo group.</p><p>Although it was unclear that an improvement of one chief complaint influenced the other IBS symptoms of patients, our results suggest that improvement in the chief complaint the patient had before administration was more frequent in the responder group in global assessment compared to the non-responder group. Improvement of each IBS symptom seems to be related to improvement of overall symptoms. These relationships were obtained not only for stool form, but also for abdominal pain/discomfort and stool frequency. In another study with larger patient numbers, ramosetron showed a statistically significant improvement in the severity of abdominal pain/discomfort and stool frequency compared to placebo at some evaluation points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Ramosetron was suggested to improve abdominal pain/discomfort and stool frequency as well. Stress is considered to induce abnormal GI motility via efferent nerves, which in turn worsens the stress response by stimulating afferent nerves resulting visceral hypersensitivity. Another clinical trial with ramosetron showed that overall scores, dysphoria, interference with activity, and food avoidance included in IBS-QOL, disease specific health-related QOL were significantly improved by ramosetron treatment (5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for male and 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for female) compared to placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Thus, ramosetron is likely to induce a clinical improvement in the stress-related disturbance of brain-gut interactions by reducing exaggerated pain sensitivity and colonic motility in the gut.</p><p>The Japanese Society of Gastroenterology developed evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic algorithms for the Japanese IBS guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In their report, 5-HT3 antagonists should be used for IBS-D at step 1 therapy. Step 2 therapy begins by evaluating the role of psychosocial stress on each IBS patient. Almost all of the sites in this study were primary care sites two patients had current evidence of anxiety neurosis and no patients had depression. This number of patients was within our expectations, and the severity of the anxiety was not severe. In the United Kingdom, 58% of the patients with IBS are diagnosed by general practitioners, with up to 29% of the patients referred to a specialist when primary care management proves to be difficult or ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Koloski et al. reported that the central nervous system and gut interact bidirectionally in functional gastrointestinal disorders, including IBS and functional dyspepsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for male patients with IBS-D showed significant improvement compared to placebo in weekly responders for global assessment of relief of overall IBS symptoms and improvement in stool consistency at week one, with the improvement sustained throughout the treatment period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The same results were shown for ramosetron 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g for female patients with IBS-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. It is considered to be important to improve gastrointestinal disorders before the symptoms of patients move to Step 2 therapy. Those patients who have moderate severity with anxiety and/or depression are not expected to response to gut targeted pharmacotherapy.</p><p>Ramosetron improved stool consistency, but also occasionally triggered constipation and hard stool. Actually, the incidence of hard stool in the ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group (9/47, 19.1%) was higher than that of the placebo group (3/51, 5.9%) in this study. These adverse events were also observed, with a statistically significant difference between ramosetron and placebo in a study with a larger sample. The incidence of hard stool was 12/147 (8.2%) in the ramosetron 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group and 2/149 (1.3%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) in the placebo group for male patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, for female patients the incidences of constipation and hard stool were significantly higher in the ramosetron 2.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g group (32/292, 11.0 and 66/292, 22.6%, respectively) than in the placebo group (13/284, 4.6%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.005; and 16/284, 5.6%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. These were considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of ramosetron.</p><p>This post marketing study was a pilot study and has some limitations. First, the chief complaint was obtained at an interview and recorded by the investigator. No patients replied about symptoms other than those that were pre-listed. Bloating has recently been reported to be the most troublesome symptom in IBS patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. In previous studies of alosetron conducted in patients with IBS-D, about 10% of the patients reported bloating as their most bothersome IBS symptom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, bloating was not captured as a chief complaint on eliciting symptoms in this study. Second, the population of this study was limited to male patients.</p><p>The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a study design for clinical trials focused on IBS that would assist the pharmaceutical industry and investigators who are developing drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. These guidelines suggest the use of abdominal pain and stool consistency as co-primary endpoints for IBS-D. They also recommend the development of multi-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments that can capture clinically important signs and symptoms of the IBS target population (e.g., IBS-C or IBS-D). Some PRO measurements are under construction in the study of IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] in accordance with FDA guidance for PRO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In its PRO guidance, FDA recommends that acceptable PRO must be couched in an explicit and evidence based conceptual framework. In the future, PRO measurements that include validated assessment of multiple chief complaints might be available in clinical trials related to IBS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Ramosetron acted most effectively on stool consistency.
