Training adaptations within the neuromuscular and skeletal muscle systems modulate muscle force generating capacity and the resistance to fatigue. Much investigation has occurred to determine the effect of nutritional supplements on the adaptations of skeletal muscle to strength training (e.g., protein supplementation) and methods to support endurance performance (e.g., carbohydrate loading). To date, however, there has been limited investigation on the effect of nutritional supplements on the neuromuscular system.</p><p>Central and peripheral nerves are comprised of fatty acids which are predominantly polyunsaturated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Omega-3 (N-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are an integral component of neurons, nerve endings, myelin and muscle membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. N-3 PUFAs are essential nutrients which must be provided by the diet due to the inability of the body to synthesize them endogenously. The shortest N-3 PUFA is alpha linoleic acid (ALA; 18:3) found in seeds and nuts. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22&#x02013;6) are longer chain N-3 PUFAs found in marine sources (e.g., fatty fish, seal). Studies on the effects of N-3 PUFA supplementation have predominantly focused on their potential ability to reduce cardiovascular risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]; however, there is growing evidence that N-3 PUFAs might support neural function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and adaptations to exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Deficiencies in dietary N-3 PUFAs lead to reduced Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity and higher stimulation intensity for signal conduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In contrast, N-3 PUFA supplementation in different clinical and applied settings has enhanced nerve conduction velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], membrane fluidity, sensitivity to acetylcholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and also reduced post-exercise inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The effect of N-3 PUFA supplementation on neuromuscular and physical adaptations to resistance training was studied in postmenopausal sedentary women who were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: N-3 PUFA supplementation for 60-days followed by 90-days resistance training with N-3 PUFA supplementation (2&#x000a0;g<sup>.</sup>d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of fish oil), resistance training with N-3 PUFA supplementation or resistance training with no supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Supplementation without training over 60-days had no effect neuromuscular function or physical tests. After training all groups showed improvements in neuromuscular function and physical test; however, the N-3 PUFA groups showed significantly greater quadriceps peak toque and muscle EMG activation and the time delay between increased muscle electrical activity and contraction onset was decreased. These findings provide evidence of the ergogenic potential of this nutritional supplement. Since Lui et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] found that N-3 PUFA were incorporated into muscle membrane after 21-days of supplementation, we hypothesized that 21-days of N-3 PUFA supplementation would have an effect on neuromuscular function and physical performance.</p><p>Therefore, our objective was to determine if short-term N-3 PUFA supplementation has an ergogenic effect through adaptations in the neuromuscular system. The primary endpoint of this study was change in quadriceps maximal voluntary contraction force. The secondary endpoints were change in muscle activation during quadriceps maximal voluntary contractions and a series of performance tests.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Thirty-one healthy male athletes were recruited for this parallel design, placebo controlled study.

To our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate the effects of a N-3 PUFA supplement on athletes while measuring changes in both neuromuscular function and performance. This study found that N-3 PUFA supplementation increased muscle activation and attenuated fatigue as assessed during a Wingate test after maximal back squat exercise by reducing percent power drop.</p><sec id="Sec29"><title>Neuromuscular function</title><p>The primary outcome of this study was change in MVC force from pre-Visit &#x02212;1 to pre-Visit 2. The N-3 PUFA group had an unclear 4.1&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.6 increase in MVC force, indicating that individuals can experience a beneficial or harmful change. However, we did observe a 9&#x000a0;% increase in VL EMG activation in the N-3 PUFA group compared to baseline and a very likely beneficial 22.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20.0 increase in muscle activation. These data suggest N-3 PUFA supplementation supported peripheral (neuromuscular junction to contractile apparatus) but not central (brain to neuromuscular junction) neuromuscular adaptations. In comparison, Rodacki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] showed that 2&#x000a0;g<sup>.</sup>d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> fish oil N-3 PUFA supplementation for 90&#x000a0;days during resistance training in sedentary women increased muscle activation and MVC force by ~50&#x000a0;% over training only controls. Two differences between this work and the present study was supplement duration and dose of 90&#x000a0;days compared to 21&#x000a0;days and 2&#x000a0;g<sup>.</sup>d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> compared to 1.1&#x000a0;g<sup>.</sup>d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. Therefore, a longer supplementation period and/or a higher dose might be necessary for the observed increase in muscle activation to translate into a beneficial increase in muscle force in this highly trained population. These results along with Rodacki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] provide evidence of the effect N-3 PUFA supplementation on neuromuscular function across the training spectrum and suggest a beneficial relationship between N-3 PUFA supplementation and neuromuscular adaptations to training.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Neuromuscular fatigue</title><p>When we examined the neuromuscular fatigue assessed by change from pre to post Visit 2, N-3 PUFA had a mixed effect. Central neuromuscular fatigue was apparent but not different between groups as MVC force was ~20&#x000a0;% lower in both groups and voluntary activation was unchanged. Peripheral measures showed no difference in quadriceps rate of force development, while EMD was lower, indicating a faster activation of the contractile apparatus. Interestingly, N-3 PUFA VL EMG activation in was 10&#x000a0;% lower compared to pre-Visit 2 testing suggesting peripheral neuromuscular fatigue. We suggest that the N-3 group performed more work during visit 2 as demonstrated by attenuated fatigue in the Wingate test and the unclear 1.96&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.8 difference in 250&#x000a0;kJ TT performance. Regardless, VL EMG at post-Visit 2 returned to baseline levels, therefore we interpret any potential harm with caution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Performance changes</title><p>Over the 21-day intervention, all participants were instructed to continue with their normal daily training. This was an important aspect of the study intervention, as results from Rodacki et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] revealed N-3 PUFA supplementation only enhanced neuromuscular function during resistance training and not during normal activities of daily living. As expected, both groups showed evidence of training adaptations during the supplementation period. In the neuromuscular assessment, MVC RFD increased similarly between groups, while the number of back squat repetitions with 10RM weight was increased ~20&#x000a0;% from familiarization to Visit 1 and 2 respectively. The improvement in 10RM back squat repetitions caused 4.76&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.4 higher fatigue during the Wingate test in the placebo group. We did not observe any change in peak or mean Wingate power between visits, indicating no change in central neuromuscular function, however, the attenuation of fatigue observed in the N-3 group indicates maintained peripheral neuromuscular function. This finding is consistent with the observed increase in muscle activation. Performance in the 250&#x000a0;kJ time trial showed an unclear difference of 1.96&#x000a0;%&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.8 between N-3 PUFA and placebo. This measure was the most variable of the protocol as the participants were fatigued from previous tests. This was an inherent challenge of our protocol, as we wanted to measure the effect of N-3&#x000a0;s on all tests requiring all energy systems from power (ATP) to aerobic endurance. Nevertheless, 50&#x000a0;% of participants on N-3 PUFA improved time trial performance while only 33&#x000a0;% on placebo improved. Future evaluation of N-3 PUFA supplementation should focus on one or two of these areas to tease out the effects, as the combination clearly increases variability of results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Mechanism of action</title><p>Our data indicates N-3 PUFA supplementation improved peripheral neuromuscular function with an unclear effect on central neuromuscular function. Animal model research has shown N-3 PUFAs can increase acetylcholine concentration and acetylcholinesterase activity at the neuromuscular junction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This could increase the speed of action potential transmission across the neuromuscular junction, thereby increasing muscle activation and EMG.</p><p>N-3 PUFA supplementation is suggested to alter cellular membrane composition and fluidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. This may enhance nerve conduction through lower nerve resistance or improved ion channel function from the regulation of mitogen activated kinase transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. In this study, N-3 PUFA supplementation may have altered muscle membrane dynamics. This could have enhanced muscle action potential conduction through the working muscle. Altered membrane dynamics could have mitigated muscle damage resulting from the 10RM squat test. A reduction in damage might explain the attenuated Wingate test performance observed in the N-3 PUFA group. Similarly, reduced muscle damage could maintain muscle action potential conduction, thereby maintaining muscle excitation contraction coupling and ultimately muscle force generating capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Supplement duration</title><p>This study used a short-term supplementation period (21-days), as findings could be applied to support athlete adaptations during training camps or a pre-competition taper. Other studies with ergogenic application have demonstrated positive results in terms of reducing post-exercise inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], increasing muscle protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or adaptations to training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] using supplement periods of 4&#x02013;12 weeks. While our supplementation period was shorter than other studies, it has been shown that 7&#x000a0;days is sufficient to increase plasma EPA concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>] and attenuate muscle soreness from eccentric exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, 14 and 21-days of supplementation in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], was sufficient to increase muscle N-3 PUFA concentration.</p><p>Our supplementation protocol used a realistic N-3 PUFA supplement dose of 1115&#x000a0;mg<sup>.</sup>d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> essential fatty acids, compared to previous N-3 PUFA intervention studies using arguably super-physiologic doses of 3000 &#x02013; 8000&#x000a0;mg<sup>.</sup>d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, we feel these results have a high level of applicability to athletes and the training population, as high doses of N-3 PUFA may not be tolerable by individuals over the long term and also can be expensive.</p><p>This is one of the first exercise studies to use a seal oil N-3 PUFA supplement in contrast to the more commonly used fish oil N-3 PUFA. Seal oil N-3 PUFA supplementation is the sn-1/3 position of N-3 fats compared to the sn-2 of fish oil. This difference has been shown to promote more rapid digestion of seal oil N-3 leading to subsequent higher incorporation into non-hepatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Participants in this study ingested supplements in oil form to allow for potential sublingual absorption of the sn-3&#x000a0;N-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This method of uptake may have increased the total bioavailable N-3 PUFAs as transit through the stomach can increase oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and ultimately enable greater uptake into muscle and nervous tissue.</p></sec><sec id="Sec34"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>Several limitations became apparent throughout this study. Using participants from an endurance training background but different sports, yielded differences in athletic abilities. While triathletes excelled at the endurance portions of the experiment (time trial), they had more variability in the 10 RM squat test. It would be advisable that future studies of a similar nature recruit athletes from the same, or similar, athletic backgrounds and focus on a specific energy system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec35" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, 21-days of N-3 PUFA supplementation increased plasma EPA N-3 PUFA concentration. Neuromuscular function was improved through increased muscle activation and sprint cycling performance was maintained from attenuated Wingate percent power drop. Our data provide a basis for further investigation of the effects of N-3 PUFA supplementation on the neuromuscular system and as an ergogenic aid for trained individuals.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>DHA</term><def><p>Docosahexaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DPA</term><def><p>Docosapentaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMD</term><def><p>Electromechanical delay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EMG</term><def><p>Electromyography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EPA</term><def><p>Eicosapentaenoic acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MVC</term><def><p>Maximum voluntary contraction</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>N-3 PUFA</term><def><p>Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PLA</term><def><p>Placebo</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RFD</term><def><p>Rate of force development</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RM</term><def><p>Repetition maximum</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TT</term><def><p>Time trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VL</term><def><p>Vastus lateralis</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>EJHL has received speaking fees and conference travel support from Auum Inc.</p><p>TMSW is a part owner, President and Medical Director of Glycemic Index Laboratories, Toronto, Canada and has authored several popular diet books on the glycemic index for which he has received royalties from Phillipa Sandall Publishing Services and CABI Publishers.
