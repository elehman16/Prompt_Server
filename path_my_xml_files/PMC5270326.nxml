In the current study, we investigated for the first time whether real-time fMRI neurofeedback (rt-fMRI) training targeted at increasing activation levels within dACC in adults with ADHD leads to a reduction of clinical symptoms and improved cognitive functioning. An exploratory randomized controlled treatment study with blinding of the participants was conducted. Participants with ADHD (n = 7 in the neurofeedback group, and n = 6 in the control group) attended four weekly MRI training sessions (60-min training time/session), during which they performed a mental calculation task at varying levels of difficulty, in order to learn how to up-regulate dACC activation. Only neurofeedback participants received continuous feedback information on actual brain activation levels within dACC. Before and after the training, ADHD symptoms and relevant cognitive functioning was assessed. Results showed that both groups achieved a significant increase in dACC activation levels over sessions. While there was no significant difference between the neurofeedback and control group in clinical outcome, neurofeedback participants showed stronger improvement on cognitive functioning. The current study demonstrates the general feasibility of the suggested rt-fMRI neurofeedback training approach as a potential novel treatment option for ADHD patients. Due to the study&#x02019;s small sample size, potential clinical benefits need to be further investigated in future studies.</p><p>Trial Registration: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12390961">ISRCTN12390961</ext-link></p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003195</institution-id><institution>Ministerie van Economische Zaken</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SSM06011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4889-9700</contrib-id><name><surname>Zilverstand</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003195</institution-id><institution>Ministerie van Economische Zaken</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SSM06011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goebel</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003195</institution-id><institution>Ministerie van Economische Zaken</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SSM06011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Buitelaar</surname><given-names>Jan K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rubicon fellowship 446-14-015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4889-9700</contrib-id><name><surname>Zilverstand</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (Rubicon fellowship 446-14-015 to A.Z.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nwo.nl/en">http://www.nwo.nl/en</ext-link>) and the BrainGain Smart Mix Program of The Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and The Netherlands Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (grant number: SSM06011 to A.Z., R.G., J.K.B.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rvo.nl/subsidies-regelingen/smart-mix">http://www.rvo.nl/subsidies-regelingen/smart-mix</ext-link> SSM06011).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>The data have been uploaded as supplementary files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>The data have been uploaded as supplementary files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by a pervasive pattern of inattention, and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The disorder persists into adulthood in one third of the cases or more, with prevalence in adults being 2&#x02013;4% [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The first-line treatment is prescription of medication, mostly psychostimulants. However, response rates in adults are only 20&#x02013;50% [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], evidence for long-term efficacy of medication is inconsistent [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and there are concerns about potential side-effects of long-term use of medication [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Consequently, novel non-pharmacological treatments are currently being developed, among which electroencephalography (EEG) neurofeedback. Neurofeedback training aims at the remediation of aberrant neuronal functioning, by allowing participants to gain self-control over certain brain-signal aspects, such as theta/beta frequency ratio in EEG neurofeedback training.</p><p>A systematic and comprehensive meta-analysis of non-pharmacological treatments for ADHD documented significant treatment effects for EEG neurofeedback, but effects were substantially attenuated when the assessment of outcome was based on blinded raters [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A recent double-blind randomized placebo-controlled EEG-neurofeedback study in children and adolescents with ADHD was unable to establish positive treatment effects on clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance after frequency neurofeedback was compared to placebo-neurofeedback [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Consequently, this has spurred interest into the development of alternative neurofeedback methods, as for example neurofeedback based on real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI), which may be advantageous due to its higher spatial resolution and full brain coverage when compared to EEG. Current state of the art real-time processing techniques allow using fMRI signal for guided self-regulation of brain activation aimed at normalization of deviant brain activation patterns [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Importantly, participants are able to control specific aspects of their brain activation patterns, leading to specific changes in behavior [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. For example, up-regulation of activation levels in the motor network has been shown to lead to shorter reaction times in a motor task [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], while up-regulation of the speech network improved accuracy in a language task ([<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], for review see [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]). Further, exploratory investigations have indicated a benefit of rt-fMRI guided up- or down-regulation in clinical populations with chronic pain, tinnitus, Parkinson&#x02019;s disease, stroke, mood and anxiety disorders [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, the efficacy of rt-fMRI neurofeedback training in ADHD has not been investigated so far.</p><p>The current study was designed to target impaired cognitive control and attention in adults with ADHD by neurofeedback guided self-regulation of dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). Impaired cognitive control and attention are the most consistently found abnormalities in this clinical population, and are associated with deviant functioning of frontal, cingulate and parietal cortical brain regions [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The dACC is the brain region that has been most often linked to core ADHD symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Neuroimaging research using fMRI demonstrates hypo-activation of dACC in patients with ADHD, compared to non-ADHD individuals, specifically during tasks that require effortful control, e.g., interference tasks, continuous performance tests, switch tasks, and response inhibition tasks [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, hypo-activation of the dACC was found to normalize after successful treatment with ADHD medication [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], suggesting that normalization of dACC activity is a crucial component of a successful treatment.</p><p>The aim of the current study was to train individuals with ADHD to voluntarily up-regulate activation levels in the dACC through rt-fMRI neurofeedback training. We conducted an exploratory randomized controlled treatment study with blinding of the participants to investigate first, if self-regulation of dACC activation level could be achieved, and second, if rt-fMRI neurofeedback training would reduce ADHD symptoms and improve cognitive functioning. Participants attended four weekly rt-fMRI neurofeedback training sessions (60-min training time/session). We assessed ADHD symptoms and cognitive functioning at baseline, a week prior to the training, and a week after training. Participants in the control group underwent the same procedure, but were not provided with neurofeedback information.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were recruited among referrals to the Department of Psychiatry of the Radboud University Medical Center (Nijmegen, The Netherlands).

In addition, the Dutch version of the ADHD-DSM-IV Rating Scale [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] was completed by patient, spouse, parent, and investigator to gather information on the exact DSM-IV criteria for ADHD in childhood and adulthood. The following was required for assignment of a full diagnosis of adult ADHD: (1) at least six of the nine DSM-IV criteria for inattention and/or hyperactivity/impulsivity had to be met for diagnosis of childhood ADHD and at least five of the nine criteria for diagnosis of adult ADHD; (2) a chronic course of persistent ADHD symptoms from childhood to adulthood had to be reported; and (3) a moderate to severe level of impairment that can be attributed to the symptoms of ADHD had to be experienced. The cut-off point of five out of the nine criteria for diagnosis of adult ADHD is based upon the literature and epidemiological data using the same DSM-IV ADHD Rating Scale [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and consistent with the DSM-5 algorithm for ADHD.</p><p>Eighteen participants volunteered and were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Both groups were also representative of the patient population, demonstrating high levels of impairment, both regarding ADHD symptoms and during neuropsychological testing [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. Both groups were highly motivated and demonstrated consistent performance during the localization procedure. The consistent performance on the second localization task, which was similar to the training task, suggests that participants in both groups were generally able to follow the training instruction. Importantly, mastery confidence regarding training increased over sessions, again indicating that participants were able to perform the training task as instructed. The retention rate of the study was 100%, also indicating high general motivation in both groups. The dACC target regions, from which the neurofeedback was derived, could be localized reliably in all subjects and sessions and were located within the targeted network. The analysis on MRI data quality demonstrated that in the neurofeedback group sufficiently high signal quality was achieved for a rt-fMRI experiment [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], as providing continuous neurofeedback during training seemed to attenuate motion during training in this group. Interestingly, performance during neurofeedback training was neither predicted by general IQ, nor by severity of ADHD attention symptom, which makes it feasible to implement training even in more severe cases, as included in this study. Further, exploratory analyses showed that neurofeedback training performance was influenced by capacity for working memory and response inhibition, suggesting that it may be beneficial to perform a cognitive training program prior to neurofeedback or take these factors into consideration during recruitment. The results confirm previous investigations showing that working memory capacity is a predictor of success in EEG neurofeedback training [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Overall, the presented results demonstrate the general feasibility of the approach as implemented in this study for a neurofeedback training in this patient population.</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Training effects</title><p>During self-regulation training, both groups demonstrated similar changes in activation patterns over time. Both groups achieved the expected up-regulation of activation levels in dACC target regions after the second session and were able to maintain this improved capacity for self-regulation until the end of the training, with the neurofeedback group demonstrating a slightly larger increase in activation levels from the beginning until the end of training. Overall, these results indicate that both groups achieved a similar degree of learning. The presented results support that up-regulation of dACC target regions might be achieved through cognitive training alone, as has been suggested in recent research on the influence of working memory training on brain function [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. However, it remains to be explored in a larger study if there are differential effects of the two type of trainings (<italic>feedback</italic>, <italic>no feedback</italic>). Stronger performance of the neurofeedback group during neuropsychological testing suggests that subtle differences may exist between the groups, supporting that learning in the neurofeedback group may have been more efficient. More generally, the results further confirm previous studies reporting that multiple sessions may be necessary when neurofeedback training is implemented in clinical populations [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Importantly, from the third session onwards, participants were able to maintain high activation levels even during transfer runs, when no feedback was provided. This further suggests that some generalization of the learned skills took place in the neurofeedback group, enabling them to transfer these skills into a different context. Finally, the presented results show that individuals with ADHD did not achieve graded control of the brain activation level within the dACC as they were not able to differentially modulate the signal to two different levels within four training sessions. This result stands in contrast to previous results in healthy participants, demonstrating that healthy individuals indeed are able to achieve modulation up to at least three brain activation levels [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In general, this indicates that the implemented neurofeedback training may have been particularly challenging for individuals with ADHD, and may need further adaptation to the needs of this clinical population.</p><p>That the implemented neurofeedback training may have indeed been challenging for this clinical group is further supported by the fact that participants in the neurofeedback group indicated by self-report that they felt significantly more challenged throughout the training, relative to the control group. This stands in contrast to previous neurofeedback trainings in clinical groups, which reported that there was no difference in perceived challenge between the neurofeedback and the non-neurofeedback control group in individuals with anxiety disorder [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, one difference between the current and this previous study is that the current study provided continuous neurofeedback during task performance, while the previous study provided intermittent neurofeedback in-between task blocks [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Research systematically comparing these two sorts of neurofeedback in healthy participants (in the motor system), suggests that continuous neurofeedback may be indeed more challenging than intermittent neurofeedback [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. The reason for this may be that continuous neurofeedback requires participants to monitor the neurofeedback signal while performing a task, which poses a dual-task challenge. Indeed, the mentioned systematic study into different sorts of neurofeedback demonstrated that in some participants activation levels in the neurofeedback region were significantly reduced during continuous neurofeedback, while participants were actually trying to up-regulate the signal [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. This suggests that participants may actually have to exert more mental effort when up-regulating activation levels guided by continuous neurofeedback as the control group. Moreover, this may be particularly relevant when the aim is to up-regulate activation within the dACC, a region which is known for its involvement in task monitoring [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], and therefore likely to be affected by dual-task demands. In conclusion, participants in the neurofeedback group may thus indeed have had a more challenging task than control participants, when being asked to up-regulate dACC activation levels during continuous neurofeedback. Importantly, however, this did not seem to have an adverse but more likely a beneficial effect on outcome in the neurofeedback group, as neuropsychological functioning was significantly improved in this group only.</p></sec><sec id="sec026"><title>Limitations</title><p>The fact that we did not include an additional sham neurofeedback control group, which receives non-valid continuous neurofeedback, may be seen as a limitation of this study. However, the same line of research investigating different sorts of neurofeedback, also demonstrated that sham neurofeedback may be perceived as frustrating and can thus induce a negative performance bias in the control group, limiting the performance of the control group [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. A non-neurofeedback control group with blinding of participants therefore seemed the strictest design choice available. To ensure comparability between the neurofeedback and control group, several measures were taken. First, both groups were instructed in the exact same way, receiving the same information regarding the goal of the study. To both groups, we pointed out that recent neuroscience reports suggested that up-regulation of activation within their individual dACC region by mental effort may be beneficial, and we also stressed that we would monitor their progress by looking at their brain activation levels. That this resulted in high motivation in both groups is supported by the reported levels of interest and mastery confidence, which were high and comparable to previous studies [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Second, both groups received an active instruction on how to up-regulate activation levels in dACC region. Also, they were explicitly instructed to keep adapting the task throughout the training, in order to keep themselves challenged. By providing both groups with a very similar and active instruction, we may, unintentionally, have compared two different active interventions, instead of comparing a neurofeedback with a true control training. The instructions given to the control group may be conceptualized as a working memory training, which has been shown to have beneficial effects in ADHD individuals [<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0170795.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Importantly, however, the present results provide preliminary evidence that the neurofeedback training may have had a stronger beneficial effect than the provided control training, as neuropsychological functioning was improved in the neurofeedback group only.</p><p>A second limitation of this study is its limited sample size. Due to the small sample size, any conclusion regarding the potential clinical outcome needs to be drawn carefully. The presented exploratory results confirm the general feasibility of the chosen approach, but cannot be used to evaluate the clinical benefits of rt-fMRI neurofeedback training in adult ADHD individuals. However, the overall positive effects of the neurofeedback training suggest that it is warranted to further explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback training as a novel treatment option in ADHD.</p></sec><sec id="sec027"><title>Future recommendations</title><p>The first aim of this study was to establish the feasibility of the suggested approach. The results suggest that the employed recruitment and randomization strategies, standardized task instructions and technical procedures were successfully implemented, as demonstrated by the different indicators for monitoring the study quality. Importantly, the analysis of performance predictors indicated that the approach is suited for ADHD patients with average IQ, even when ADHD symptoms are severe. However, this analysis also indicated that ADHD patients with severe deficits in working memory and inhibitory control profited much less from the training. For future trainings, it may therefore be beneficial to design step-wise trainings to reach a larger group of patients. Rt-fMRI neurofeedback training may need to be complemented with other training modules, aimed at ameliorating the cognitive capacities that were predictive of success, such as working memory and response inhibition. A more elaborate training on motion control prior to scanning may also be useful. Third, an initial training module providing neurofeedback from brain regions that are more easily controllable (e.g., motor system), may be beneficial to accustom participants to the dual-task demands of monitoring continuous neurofeedback during training. Finally, the goal of achieving graded control over the signal may only be attainable with more additional training sessions. Overall, the presented results suggest that the benefits of rt-fMRI neurofeedback training effects may be maximized by additional instruction and practice modules prior to the neurofeedback training itself, therefore supporting a multifaceted interventional approach.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec028"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, the presented results suggest that rt-fMRI neurofeedback training may constitute a potential novel treatment for adults with ADHD. This proof-of-principle study exploring a rt-fMRI neurofeedback training for the first time in adult ADHD demonstrates both that the methodology is generally feasible and that such a training targeting the dACC can significantly improve cognitive functioning. Further, the results suggest that self-regulation success can be predicted by working memory/inhibition capacities, therefore calling for more elaborate multifaceted interventional approaches. Due to the limited sample size in the current study, the clinical benefits of the novel approach need to be evaluated in future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0170795.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Neurofeedback display.</title><p>Participants in the neurofeedback group were instructed to performed mental calculations at varying levels of difficulty to achieve up-regulation of their activation level within dACC target regions.
