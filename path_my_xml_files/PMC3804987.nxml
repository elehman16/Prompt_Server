physical exertion was carried out to evaluate its physiological effects and its effect on
improve endurance capacity. [Subjects and Methods] The subjects were nine healthy adults
(mean age 20.4, SD &#x000b1; 1.7&#x02005;years). The combined training group (n = 5) carried out 6 weeks
of combined training using a cycle ergometer, with exercise load tests and respiratory
function tests performed before and after the training. The results of the training were
compared to a control group (n = 4) that only performed the cycling exercise without the
combined training with breathing resistance. [Results] In the combined training group,
ventilatory threshold, maximal load of the cycle ergometer in exercise load tests, and
maximal voluntary ventilation increased after training. These increases after training
were all significant, but none of these variables changed significantly in the control
group. [Conclusion] The results imply that in comparison to conventional training methods,
combined training with breathing resistance and sustained physical exertion is beneficial
for increasing endurance capacity and respiratory muscle function. This result provides
important information regarding the effects of the new training method for improving
endurance capacity.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Respiratory muscle training</kwd><kwd>Exercise tolerance</kwd><kwd>Cardiorespiratory endurance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Peak oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2peak</sub>) and ventilatory threshold (VT) reflect the capacity

methods of training have been recommended for effectively improving endurance capacity, and
the effectiveness of these methods has been examined. Rhythmic physical exercise such as
running or cycling leads to improved VO<sub>2peak</sub> and VT<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Endurance capacity depends on respiratory function in addition to circulatory and muscular
function, and for this reason, there has recently been considerable interest in the
relationship between respiratory muscle training, which aims to improve respiratory muscle
function, and cardiorespiratory endurance. Some studies have reported that inspiratory
muscle training during rest improves the cardiorespiratory endurance of patients with
weakened respiratory muscles and that of healthy adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref><sup>)</sup>, whereas other studies have reported no effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, there is
no consensus of opinion. In addition, with inspiratory muscle training during rest, it is
difficult to combine an increased ventilation requirement brought about by an increase in
required oxygen intake with respiratory load. Therefore it is difficult to continually carry
out inspiratory muscle training during rest by applying resistance to deep breathing.
Physical exercise under hypoxic conditions has been shown to be very effective at increasing
endurance capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref><sup>)</sup>, but it is not
possible to apply resistance to the respiratory muscles during this type of training. The
subject needs to go to a location at a high altitude or use an apparatus to control the
partial pressure of oxygen; thus, the training is difficult from the point of view of time
and the financial costs involved. A training method that resolves these problems and
effectively increases endurance capacity and respiratory muscle function would be beneficial
not only for healthy adults, but also for elderly people and patients suffering from certain
diseases. However, to date, there has been no examination of combined training with
breathing resistance and sustained physical exertion in which rhythmic physical exercise is
combined with the application of a respiratory load.</p><p>In this study, attempting to effectively improve endurance capacity and respiratory muscle
function, we carried out combined training with breathing resistance and sustained physical
exertion (CBS) and examined its effectiveness by comparing the results with those of a
control group without breathing restrictions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The subjects were nine healthy adults (3 men, 6 women) who were randomly divided into two
groups: the CBS group, which carried out CBS training on a cycle ergometer wearing a mask
that provided resistance to breathing (2 men, 3 women); and the control group, which
carried out training on a cycle ergometer with no mask (1 man, 3 women). The subjects
performed the training over 6 weeks, and body measurements, respiratory function tests,
and exercise load tests were carried out before and after the training period. The study
was approved by the Ethics Committee of Saitama Prefectural University (no. 21042), and
the subjects consented to participate after receiving a written explanation of the details
of the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p> Appearance of the ReBNA. There are separate spaces inside the mask for the nose and
mouth.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-25-605-g001"/></fig><p>Both groups carried out three 2-week courses of training, for a total of 6 weeks. The
training intensity was set using the heart rate reserve (HRR) method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. HRR value is calculated by subtracting heart rate at
rest (HR<sub>rest</sub>) from maximum heart rate (HR<sub>max</sub>). Target heart rate
during exercise was calculated according to the formula:<disp-formula>Target HR =
[(HR<sub>max</sub> &#x02212; HR<sub>rest</sub>) &#x000d7; % intensity] +
HR<sub>rest</sub></disp-formula></p><p>Target HR was 75% HRR during the first course, 80% HRR during the second course, and 85%
HRR during the third course. HR<sub>max</sub> was estimated by the formula
HR<sub>max</sub> = 220 &#x02212; age<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Frequency of exercise was three times per week, and the control group performed cycle
ergometer exercise for 30&#x02005;min at a load that maintained the target heart rate. The
pedaling cadence was 60&#x02005;rpm. The CBS group wore a ReBNA (Patent Works Inc.; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref>) and exercised at the same target heart rate
as the control group. The ReBNA is a mask-type device with valves arranged such that
inhalation is only through the nose and exhalation only through the mouth, and ventilation
through two inspiratory valves and two expiratory valves produces respiratory load<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. Cycle ergometer load and rating of
perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded immediately before the end of training. An amended
Borg scale<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref><sup>)</sup> was used for RPE. On
completion of the third course of training, difficulty in breathing and fatigue in the
legs were investigated using a questionnaire.</p><p>Height, weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, and abdominal circumference were
measured. Weight, body fat percentage, and muscle mass were measured using an InnerScan
50V (Tanita Co.).</p><p>Ramp load maximal exercise tests were carried out using a 232C xL cycle ergometer (Combi
Co.). Measurements were taken using a Vmax respiratory metabolism measuring device (Nihon
Kohden Co.). For exercise load measurement, subjects rested for 3 min and then warmed up
for 3&#x02005;min (men, 25&#x02005;W; women, 15&#x02005;W); this was followed by ramp load exercise (men,
25&#x02005;W/min; women, 15&#x02005;W/min) until either no further increase in oxygen extraction fraction
was seen or the subject reached total exhaustion and was unable to continue. The criteria
for discontinuing exercise tests were in line with the &#x0201c;General Indications for Stopping
an Exercise Test in Low-Risk Adults,&#x0201d; according to the guidelines of the American College
of Sports Medicine. After the exercise test, subjects cooled down for 3&#x02005;min (men, 25&#x02005;W;
women, 15&#x02005;W). The pedaling cadence was 60&#x02005;rpm. VT was determined using the V-slope
method<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Vital capacity of the lungs (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), and maximal voluntary
ventilation (MVV<sub>12</sub>) were measured using a FUDAC-70 spirometer (Fukuda Denshi
Co., Ltd). VC and FVC were measured twice each, the values were checked to ensure less
than 10% measurement error between the two, and the larger value was adopted. If the
measurement error exceeded 10%, measurements were repeated until the error came within
10%. MVV<sub>12</sub> was measured three times, and the largest value was adopted. Maximum
inspiratory mouth pressure (P<sub>Imax</sub>) and maximum expiratory mouth pressure
(P<sub>Emax</sub>) were measured using a HI-801 spirometer (Chest M.I., Inc). Each
measurement was taken three times, and the largest value was adopted.</p><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software (SPSS Statistics version 19).
Data were tested for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The paired t-test, or
Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed-rank test in cases of non-normality, was used to compare baseline (BL)
values of all measures before training with their values after 6 weeks (6W) within each
group. The unpaired t-test, or Wilcoxon&#x02019;s test in cases of non-normality, was used to
compare the results of the CBS and control groups.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Characteristics of all subjects at baseline</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Control Group (n = 4)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CBS Group (n = 5)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age (y)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21&#x000b1;2.1 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20&#x000b1;1.1 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male/Female</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1/3</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2/3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body height (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">161.8&#x000b1;7.7 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">163.3&#x000b1;10.8 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body weight (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.4&#x000b1;5.9 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">56.7&#x000b1;9.3 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">BMI (kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.5&#x000b1;0.6 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.2&#x000b1;1.7 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Body fat percentage (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.8&#x000b1;5.3 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21.5&#x000b1;9.4 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Muscle mass (kg)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42.4&#x000b1;6.9 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">42.6&#x000b1;10.7 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Abdominal circumference (cm)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.5&#x000b1;3.3 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">70.8&#x000b1;4.7 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of exercises per week (times)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.5&#x000b1;2.6 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2&#x000b1;1.9 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial VO<sub>2peak</sub> (ml/kg/min)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33.4&#x000b1;4.1 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35.6&#x000b1;6.7 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Initial ventilatory threshold (ml/kg/min)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.2&#x000b1;4.6 </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.1&#x000b1;3.4 </td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>mean &#x000b1; SD</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Load of bicycle ergometer and RPE for the training</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="2" colspan="1"/><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Control Group (n = 4)</td><td align="center" colspan="2" rowspan="1">CBS Group (n = 5)</td></tr><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Load (watts)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RPE</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Load (watts)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RPE</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1st course</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">119.0&#x000b1;6.3 </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.2&#x000b1;0.2 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">106.5&#x000b1;6.8 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.2&#x000b1;0.2 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2nd course</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">120.3&#x000b1;5.4 </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.9&#x000b1;0.3 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">114.3&#x000b1;4.8 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.3&#x000b1;0.2 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3rd course</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">123.4&#x000b1;4.2 </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.9&#x000b1;0.2 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">132.5&#x000b1;7.0 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.9&#x000b1;0.2 </td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean of 1st&#x02013;3rd courses</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">120.9&#x000b1;3.1 </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7.0&#x000b1;0.2 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">117.7&#x000b1;3.6 </td><td align="right" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8.4&#x000b1;0.1 </td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>mean &#x000b1; SE</p><p>RPE: rating of perceived exertion.

respiratory muscle function through CBS, in which rhythmic physical exercise was combined
with respiratory load. To clarify the effectiveness of this training, a comparison was made
with a control group that exercised with no respiratory load. The results yielded two major
findings.</p><p>First, the results imply that CBS is more beneficial at improving endurance capacity than
conventional training. VO<sub>2peak</sub> in both groups was significantly greater after the
training, indicating that the amount of training performed in the present study was
sufficient to increase endurance capacity. Maximal load and VT did not show any significant
changes after the training in the control group, but these variables were both significantly
greater after training in the CBS group. In the CBS group, valves provided resistance to
inhalation and exhalation, thus exerting a load on the respiratory muscles during exercise.
It is likely that the combined training involves physiological mechanisms different from
those involved in exercise with no breathing resistance, and that this different mechanism
influences the increase in maximal load and VT. Also, when the tidal volume increases, there
is a decrease in the dead space ventilation, and ventilation efficiency increases, so that
this breathing pattern reduces the oxygen consumption required for breathing movement. In
the present study, although T<sub>VVT</sub> in the control group was almost unchanged after
training, it increased by 20% in the CBS group (p = 0.06). CBS therefore tended to aid deep
breathing. In studies to date of healthy adults, one report indicated that inspiratory
training at rest increased endurance capacity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, and other studies reported that it did not produce an increase<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Thus, there is no consensus of opinion. The CBS carried out in the
present study differs from the respiratory training of previous studies in that a load was
applied to both inhalation and exhalation. Furthermore, it was carried out under the
increased ventilation requirement brought on by physical exercise, and there was no decline
in the dust cleaning or humidifying effects on the air that accompanies inhalation through
the nose. Thus, it appears that one of these training loads, or a combination of two or more
factors, contributed to the improvement of maximal performance and cardiorespiratory
endurance. The training effectiveness of CBS has not been reported in prior studies, and
this new finding that a combination of respiratory load and physical exercise can contribute
to an increase in endurance capacity is likely to be important when selecting training
methods for sports or therapeutic exercise. However, the subject sample in the present study
was small, which could possibly have influenced the result. Studies examining a greater
number of subjects are needed to verify the effectiveness of CBS.</p><p>The second major finding of the present study is the implication that CBS improves
respiratory muscle function. MVV did not change significantly after training in the control
group, but in the CBS group, it showed a 17% increase (p &#x0003c; 0.05) after training.
Increases in MVV of about 10% in healthy subjects as a result of respiratory training at
rest have previously been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref><sup>)</sup>, but no increases as a result of CBS have
been reported. The present results show that CBS increased MVV, and to a greater degree than
respiratory training at rest. Therefore this result suggest that CBS effectively increases
MVV. Neither P<sub>Imax</sub> nor P<sub>Emax</sub> changed significantly in the CBS group;
thus, it is possible that factors other than maximum respiratory muscle strength are
involved in the increase in MVV. Both MVV and endurance capacity improved in the present
training, suggesting that respiratory muscle function and endurance capacity are
related.</p><p>Although the results of the present study suggest that CBS yields superior improvements in
endurance capacity and respiratory muscle function, there are many points regarding the
mechanisms involved that are unclear. In the responses to the fatigue questionnaire, many
subjects in the CBS group reported greater fatigue in breathing than in the legs, indicating
the possibility that CBS brings about changes in load on the respiratory muscles and the leg
muscles. It will be necessary to investigate muscle activity during training to test this
possibility. In addition, there is also a need to measure the actual resistance to breathing
experienced by subjects to clarify the exact load.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study yielded results suggesting that CBS achieves greater
improvements in maximal performance, cardiorespiratory endurance, and maximal voluntary
ventilation than conventional methods. These results provide important information regarding
the effectiveness of the new training method aiming to improve endurance capacity. The
degree to which these results can be generalized to training for subjects other than healthy
young adults is unclear. Therefore, further studies are needed to clarify the rationale and
mechanism through which the training improves endurance capacity and respiratory muscle
function.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was partially subsidized by a Grant-in Aid for Product Development for Small and
