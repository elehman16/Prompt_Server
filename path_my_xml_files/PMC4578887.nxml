The prevalence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB is high and converge with the pandemics of HIV and diabetes, which generates further problems with a lethal combination of diseases [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite this scenario, TB is a preventable and curable disease, although treatment of TB is currently long and requires multiple drugs that often have side effects which may range from mild to severe and may require tailored approach to individual cases. Development of new anti-TB drug has been very slow and most available drugs were developed more than 40 years ago [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, there is a pressing need for development of new classes of novel drugs or repurposed drugs that can shorten the duration of treatment and combat infection with both susceptible and resistant strains of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>A series of <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have demonstrated that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> or 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>, induces the gene expression of beta-defensin 2 and human cathelicidin LL-37 [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These peptides belong to two classes of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) produced in lung epithelial cells, monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that are able to suppress the growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> and modulate antimicrobial responses [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Active vitamin D, 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> also induces autophagy in <italic>Mtb</italic>-infected macrophages/monocytes that can control the infection via an LL-37-dependent mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Accordingly, several studies have shown an association between vitamin D deficiency and an increased risk to develop active TB [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Altogether, these findings rekindled the interest of vitamin D as an adjunctive therapy to standard anti-TB treatment [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>There is growing evidence that adjunct host-directed therapies, could serve as novel approaches to improve standard TB treatments [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We have earlier shown that treatment with sodium butyrate enhances cathelicidin expression in a colonic epithelia cell line [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> in colonic epithelium in a rabbit model of shigellosis, which resulted in rapid clinical recovery and a concomitant decline in bacterial load in stool [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, we have further shown that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (PBA), a registered drug used for the treatment of urea cycle disease [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] induces LL-37 expression in a bronchial epithelial cell line and <italic>in vivo</italic> in the rabbit shigellosis model [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. A synergistic effect in the induction of LL-37 has also been demonstrated between PBA and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In a proof-of-concept study, we showed that supplementation with a combination of PBA and vitamin D to healthy adults enhanced LL-37 expression and intracellular killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> in macrophages <italic>ex vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>In this clinical trial, we aimed to test our hypothesis that oral adjunct therapy with PBA and/or vitD<sub>3</sub> administrated to patients with active pulmonary TB would increase LL-37 expression in macrophages and other immune cells and eventually increase elimination of <italic>Mtb</italic> from the host. Thus, we conducted a randomized clinical trial to examine if PBA or vitD<sub>3</sub> separately or in combination as adjunct treatment to standard chemotherapy could enhance clinical recovery in newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB patients. Primary outcomes of the trial included the proportion of TB patients who became culture negative at week 4 and also assessment of clinical endpoints at week 8. Secondary outcome measures included time to sputum smear conversion, radiological changes, plasma 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels, expression of LL-37 in immune cells and killing of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> by infected MDM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec008"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec009"><title>Clinical trial study participants</title><p>Patients with newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB were recruited from the National Institute of the Diseases of the Chest and Hospital (NIDCH) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, after providing written informed consent. NIDCH is a government supported research institute and hospital where the majority of the patients are of low socioeconomic status. Inclusion criteria: both males and females (age &#x02265;18 years) with a newly diagnosed sputum smear-positive TB who consented to study enrollment. Exclusion criteria: pregnancy and lactation, relapse TB, HIV infection, hypercalcaemia, regular intake of vitamin D, known concomitant chronic illness such as diabetes, cardiovascular, hepatic and renal diseases and malignancy. Patients with suspicion of prolonged drug abuse were also excluded. Information such as history of contact with active TB cases, duration of illness, BCG vaccination and tuberculin skin test status were recorded.</p><p>The study was approved by the Research and Ethical Review Committees at the International Centre for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number NCT01580007) in April 2012 whereas patient recruitment started in December 2010. The reason for not registering the clinical trial before the recruitment of the first patient was that the authors were not aware of journal requirements for prospective registration. Importantly, the delay in trial registration did not have an impact on the study design or on the analysis or presentation of the results (see attached protocol).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Study design and interventions</title><p>The study was a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled 4-arm intervention trial with adjunct therapy with PBA and/or vitD<sub>3</sub> for 2 months. TB patients received directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) of a 4 fixed-dose-combination (4-FDC) drugs for 2 months followed by 2-FDC for the next 4 months. The 4-FDC consists of Rifampicin 150mg + Isoniazid 75mg + Pyrazinamide 400mg + Ethambutol 275mg/tablet while the 2-FDC consists of Rifampicin 150mg + Isoniazid 75mg/tablet. The company EM-Partners AB (R&#x000e5;&#x000e5;, Sweden) prepared tablets containing the adjunctive study drug (4-phenylbutyrate (PBA) (Tributyrate&#x000ae;) and identical tablets that contained the placebo (tablet bulking agents or excipient). Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (vit D<sub>3</sub>) (Vigantol oil) and placebo (Miglyol oil) were obtained from Merck KGaA in Darmstadt, Germany through Popular Pharmaceuticals Ltd in Bangladesh. After enrollment, patients were randomized to the following adjunct treatment arms in a 2x2 factorial design and received oral doses of either: (1) placebo PBA and placebo vitD<sub>3</sub> or (2) 500 mg twice daily of PBA and placebo vitD<sub>3</sub> or (3) placebo PBA and 5000 IU of vitD<sub>3</sub> (Cholecalciferol) once daily or (4) PBA combined with vitD<sub>3</sub> (PBA+vitD<sub>3</sub>).</p><p>The dose of PBA was chosen based on a recent study from our group where 500 mg PBA given twice daily to healthy volunteers proved to be the optimal oral dose to induce LL-37 and enhance mycobactericidal activity in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) obtained from treated individuals [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The dose of vitD<sub>3</sub> was selected based on our previous findings that a weekly dose of 35,000 IU of vitD<sub>3</sub> given for 2&#x02013;3 months to pregnant women in the 3<sup>rd</sup> trimester was found to be safe and also raised maternal 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> concentrations in serum significantly in most women without any adverse effects [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, there is evidence that daily doses up to 10,000 IU/day for several months have not lead to adverse effects of changes in serum calcium [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Randomization and blinding</title><p>Independent assistants from the Hospital pharmacy of icddr,b prepared the study medication packs (PBA and placebo tablets; with identical appearance, color and taste), and labeled these tablets with a randomization number corresponding to the computer-generated randomization sequence. Similarly, Popular Pharmaceuticals Ltd. labeled bottles for vitD<sub>3</sub> (Vigantol oil and Miglyol placebo oil; with identical appearance, color and taste) with the provided randomization number. To control and balance for the influence of gender a computer-generated stratified block randomization method was used to randomize participants into four groups that would result in equal sample sizes including 4x72 = 288 patients. The randomized block procedure was performed as follows: (1) a block size of four was chosen at two levels: male and female, (2) possible balanced combinations with four subjects were calculated as 24 blocks and (3) blocks were randomly chosen to determine the assignment of all 288 participants. This randomization protocol resulted in 72 participants (36 males and 36 females) in each of the four treatment groups. Treatment allocation was concealed from patients, study investigators and staff.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Sample size</title><p>No published data is available on the culture conversion of drug-sensitive TB patients at week 4 or week 8 in Bangladesh. Data on smear conversion of Bangladeshi TB patients are available from a publication from 1998 [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] which shows 85% smear conversion at 1 month (4 weeks) following anti-TB treatment. After 2 months of anti-TB chemotherapy close to 99% patients became sputum smear negative. Thus, to observe treatment effect of adjunctive therapy on smear conversion in TB patients at 2 months is also not useful. Using these smear conversion data the sample size becomes impractically large (e.g. 726/arm). For these reasons, in absence of data for powering the trial according to the primary outcome findings from our preclinical studies [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and TB scores reported by Wejse et al [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] were used for sample size calculation. Sample size calculations were made based on: i) preclinical outcome as a surrogate marker for sputum conversion: The mean difference in expression of the rabbit cathelicidin CAP-18 in the gut mucosal tissue of untreated <italic>Shigella</italic>-infected rabbits and infected rabbits compared to PBA-treated infected rabbits was 6.94 with an expected standard deviation of 3.5. Allowing for 4 groups and expecting a 30% increase in the expression of human cathelicidin LL-37 in tissues when treated with PBA+vitD<sub>3</sub> along with standard anti-TB treatment (from 6.94 to 9.04), at a 5% level of significance and 80% power the sample size would be 62 per group. Considering a loss to follow-up of 15%, the sample size in each group would be 72 with a total of 288 patients. ii) A composite clinical score: In a superiority design, with a 50% reduction of clinical scores occurring at 2 month post anti-TB treatment [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], we assume that 25% reduction will take place after one month. A sample size of 212 patients (53 in each arm) would provide 80% power to demonstrate that each treatment will result in a 25% reduction of the clinical scores after 4 weeks of adjunct therapy (from 6.5 to 4.88) with expected standard deviation of 2.3 [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] making an allowance for 15% attrition rate at 5% level of significance. The highest sample size was considered. For sputum smear conversion, the study may be underpowered.</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>Primary outcomes of the trial included assessment of both microbiological and clinical endpoints. The microbiological outcome was measured as the proportion of TB patients who became culture negative at week 4, while effect size was assessed for major clinical endpoints (cough remission, reduction in lung involvement in chest x-ray, normalization of fever and weight gain) at week 8. Secondary outcome measures included time to sputum smear conversion, radiological findings, concentrations of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in plasma, immunological status measured as the expression of the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 in immune cells and also as killing of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> by MDM <italic>ex vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Patient safety monitoring, adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE)</title><p>A data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) was formed that conducted three meetings (before initiation of the study, interim and after completion) to review the results and to advice on the safety to continue or stop the trial after occurrence of a Serious adverse events (SAE) if any.

The clinical score defined as a TB score is an assessment tool developed by clinicians/ investigators to measure changes in clinical symptoms of the TB patients in an unbiased and objective manner. The TB score (<bold><xref rid="pone.0138340.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref></bold>) allocated points for self-reported symptoms (cough, shortness of breath/dyspnea, chest pain, haemoptysis, anorexia), and clinical signs (fever, anemia (&#x0003c;11 g/dl), tachycardia, auscultatory findings) as reported by study doctors. Weight gain was minimum (&#x0003c;8.5%) for the Bangladeshi TB patients and therefore not used in the scoring system. The TB score was determined at week 0&#x02013;4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24.</p><p>In addition to the TB score, chest x-ray findings were assessed and scored as previously reported [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since chest x-ray was performed only at week 0, 8, 12 and 24 following the National TB program guidelines, a TB score including chest x-ray was determined separately for these four time points. For the chest x-ray analysis, each lung field was divided into three zones, upper, mid and lower zones. Presence of nodules, patchy or confluent consolidation and cavitation were recorded for each of the three zones. The size of nodules appearing as round or irregular were recorded in millimeters (small nodule, 1 to 2 mm; large nodules, &#x0003e;2 mm) and total cavity size was recorded in centimeters. The presence of effusion was also determined and the effusion volume was estimated by visual assessment as the percentage of a given lung field. Similarly, the extent of opacification, cavitation or additional pathology was graded as the percentage of the affected lung [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Finally, the total percentage of the lungs affected by any pathology was estimated.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Preparation of blood samples</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma were separated from whole blood by Ficoll-Paque<sup>TM</sup> PLUS (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) density gradient centrifugation.

The cell pellet of non-adherent lymphocytes were treated with 0.1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany) for formation of reversible pores in the cell membrane to release their intracellular content, which was collected as intracellular fluid (ICF) after centrifugation. Next, the adherent MDM were harvested using a cell scraper and treated similarly with saponin, the ICF was collected and stored until further analysis. RNAlater (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) was added to the MDM cell pellets to prepare for mRNA isolation and subsequent analysis of LL-37 mRNA content.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Assessment of LL-37 peptide and level of mRNA encoding the LL-37 peptide</title><p>LL-37 peptide levels were measured by ELISA in ICF of MDM and non-adherent lymphocytes and in ECF of PBMC. A standard curve of the ELISA was generated from synthetic LL-37 (Innovagen, Lund, Sweden). Polystyrene microtiter plates (Maxisorp by NUNC, Naperville, IL, USA) were coated with monoclonal anti-LL-37 (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] in carbonate buffer (15 mM sodium carbonate, 35 mM sodium bicarbonate and 0.02% sodium azide [pH 9.6]) and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Non-specific binding was blocked after washing with 0.1% gelatin in Tris-buffered saline for 1 hour at RT. Next, patient samples and the diluted standard were added and incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After sequential incubations with biotinylated rabbit anti-LL-37 (1 &#x003bc;g/mL) (Innovagen) and Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Chemicon, Melbourne, Australia) for 2h each at RT, the reaction was developed using 4-methyl-umbelliferyl phosphate as the substrate (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands).

Data not normally distributed were log transformed that included CRP, LL-37 peptide expression in MDM and lymphocytes as well as plasma 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels. A p-value of &#x02264;0&#x000b7;05 was considered significant. The primary analysis of the outcomes of interest was performed by modified intention-to-treat (ITT) for up to week 12 and per-protocol analysis for week 24. Efficacy was assessed by modified ITT that excluded patients who had a negative sputum culture at baseline. Outcome variables were reported as means, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) or standard deviations when continuous, and categorical variables were reported as numbers with percentages. The Chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of patients who became sputum culture negative at week 4 and 8 compared to placebo. Effect size was estimated as difference in proportion of outcome of interest (sputum culture conversion and clinical endpoints) among treatment groups and strength of effect size was examined using Odds Ratio (OR) generated by multivariable logistic regression model. In the model, placebo was used as reference. A mixed model ANCOVA was used to follow-up outcome values as dependent variable and treatment arm as independent variable, to investigate effectiveness of TB scores, leukocyte and monocyte counts, concentrations of hemoglobin, ESR, CRP, calcium, LL-37 and 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> between the treatment arms and placebo. Least significant difference (LSD) was used for multiple comparison test of means of targeted parameters across the treatment arms. We initially investigated potential treatment and covariate interactions and adjusted for those covariates that were significantly associated (by 5% or more) with the outcomes. The covariates examined in the analyses were age, sex, duration of illness, BCG vaccination status, and history of contact with active TB cases. Analyses of time to sputum smear conversion (at week 0&#x02013;4, 6, 8, 10, 12) and MDM-mediated killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> (at week 0, 4, 8 and 12) were conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank (Mental&#x02013;Cox) test.

Our hypothesis was that oral adjunct therapy with PBA alone or in combination with vitD<sub>3</sub> to TB patients would increase the expression of the AMP LL-37, a marker for multiple AMPs, in alveolar macrophages and pulmonary epithelium and eventually accelerate elimination of <italic>Mtb</italic> bacilli from the respiratory tract. Adjunct therapy with vitD<sub>3</sub> alone or in combination with PBA showed increased sputum culture conversion at week 4 and vitD<sub>3</sub> alone at week 8 compared to the placebo group. Importantly, treatment with PBA, vitD<sub>3</sub> or the combination also resulted in reduced clinical symptoms. In line with an improvement of the primary outcomes, treatment with PBA and vitD<sub>3</sub> also resulted in a synergistic increased expression of LL-37 in immune cells that was paralleled with an enhanced intracellular killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> in macrophages <italic>ex vivo</italic> (<bold><xref rid="pone.0138340.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6</xref></bold>).</p><p>In similar clinical trials, the primary endpoint is usually culture conversion assessed at several time points after initiation of TB therapy. Although there are no published data on sputum culture conversion in Bangladesh, the smear conversion rate of Bangladeshi TB patients is estimated as fairly good ranging from 13 to 22 days (K Zaman, personal communication). Martineau <italic>et al</italic> have demonstrated that the median time to sputum culture conversion was 36 days in TB patients [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Accordingly, week 4 was selected as the readout time point for culture conversion in this study. Indeed, significant changes in the other outcome variables were also noted already at week 4 including reduction of TB scores, significantly elevated concentration of plasma 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub>, LL-37 mRNA, LL-37 peptide in PBMC and lymphocytes in the different intervention groups compared to the placebo. Significant changes in the same variables were also evident at week 8.</p><p>A significant effect of adjunctive therapy with PBA could be demonstrated using a composite TB score including resolution of symptoms [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. PBA alone was able to reduce clinical TB symptoms as early as the 2<sup>nd</sup> week of treatment; the effect persisted until week 12 (<bold><xref rid="pone.0138340.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref></bold>). Adding chest x-ray to the TB score further supported a beneficial effect of adjunct PBA treatment from week 8 to 12 [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The resolution of clinical symptoms was also reflected by reduced neutrophil counts in the PBA and PBA+vitD<sub>3</sub> treatment groups. In this study, we did not find a decrease in the ratio of lymphocyte and monocyte as shown by Martineaue et al [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], however, monocyte counts alone declined significantly after adjunct therapy with PBA+vitD<sub>3</sub> which is also suggestive of resolution of inflammation. Importantly, our significant finding on the TB scores should be interpreted with caution since the decline in TB scores was also significant in the placebo group. It is difficult to show an adjunctive effect of immunotherapy with PBA and vitD<sub>3</sub> on top of the highly effective standard DOTS therapy. However, as our aim was to decrease the time of standard therapy and to reduce side effects, the biological effects of PBA and vitD<sub>3</sub> may still be clinically relevant.</p><p>The role of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> as an inducer of LL-37 expression has previously been well-established [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have shown that PBA can induce the level of LL-37 mRNA and the production of the LL-37 peptide in both lung epithelial cells [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and human macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Importantly, a synergistic effect on LL-37 expression was observed when 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> was combined with PBA [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] as seen <italic>ex vivo</italic> in the current study. A recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study have been shown that, PBA together with vitamin D enhance the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects against <italic>Mtb</italic> infection in macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. We have also provided evidence that oral supplementation with PBA and vitD<sub>3</sub> can induce LL-37 in MDM and lymphocytes in healthy volunteers that was linked to an improved killing of intracellular <italic>Mtb</italic> by infected macrophages <italic>ex vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Here we show that the PBA+vitD<sub>3</sub> and the vitD<sub>3</sub>-groups exhibited a more rapid sputum culture conversion detected already at week 4 compared to the placebo-group. Furthermore, enhanced bactericidal capacity of MDM was significant in the PBA group. The MDM was cultured from peripheral mononuclear cells of TB patients which might behave differently compared to tissue-resident macrophages, since circulating monocytes do not always end up replenishing tissue macrophage populations [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Our findings may indicate that there was a synergistic effect between PBA and vitD<sub>3</sub> in elimination of bacteria from the lungs <italic>in vivo</italic> in the early phase of the treatment, where resident macrophages and additional immune cells have a major role.</p><p>Altogether, the findings of reduced TB scores, increased LL-37 concentration in MDM and increased MDM-mediated killing of <italic>Mtb</italic> in the PBA-group, suggest an important role of AMPs, such as LL-37, in the recovery from TB disease. Remission of clinical TB symptoms is probably through resolution of inflammatory responses as well as mycobacterial clearance from the body. Besides antimicrobial functions, LL-37 exhibits immune-modulatory activities [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] including both pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. For example, local effects of LL-37 include influences on cytokine/chemokine production, macrophage development and differentiation toward an inflammatory M1 phenotype [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] and enhanced phagocytosis by macrophages [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. In addition, LL-37 can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine production by down-regulation of signaling through TLR4 via binding to LPS and/or interrupt function of the TLR4 receptor complex in macrophages and dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Furthermore, LL-37 has been linked to receptor-mediated autophagy [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>Our study confirms that there were no safety concerns regarding the daily oral doses of vitD<sub>3</sub> and PBA that were given to the study patients. It is important to note that 91% of the Bangladeshi TB patients demonstrated low vitD<sub>3</sub> status and 26&#x02013;48% patients demonstrated hypocalcaemia at baseline. Treatment with vitD<sub>3</sub> increased plasma levels of 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in both vitD<sub>3</sub> and PBA+vitD<sub>3</sub> arms. However, there were no cases of hypercalcaemia, although hypocalcaemia persisted in patients who had low calcium at baseline. We found that the 2-month dose of vitD<sub>3</sub> used in the trial enabled almost 100% patients to attain sufficient vitamin D status (&#x0003e;50 nmol/L). PBA is an FDA approved drug for urea cycle disorders [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and a dose up to 10 g/day can be safely used for this purpose, which is about 10 fold higher compared to the dose used in the present trial (1g/day). There were no adverse events specifically linked to the PBA or vitD<sub>3</sub> intervention, the majority of the adverse events was very likely due to standard anti-TB therapy.</p><p>The limitations of this study were that negative <italic>Mtb</italic> culture results were not examined for non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, although these patients received DOTS. The use of antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin) in cell culture media for preventing contamination may have some effect on intracellular growth of <italic>Mtb</italic> in MDM. In line with other reports using vitD<sub>3</sub> adjunct therapy in the treatment of TB, we also showed that the vitD<sub>3</sub> intervention did not have an impact on time to sputum smear conversion [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Importantly, in contrast to our findings, none of these clinical trials showed any impact on sputum culture conversion. Only, Martineau <italic>et al</italic> showed significantly hastened sputum culture conversion in a sub-group of patients with polymorphism in TaqI vitamin D receptor genotype with improved responsiveness to supplementation [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The strengths of our study are the convenience of dosing regimen of adjunctive therapy that matched with 2 months&#x02019; duration of 4-FDC in the standard treatment regimen of DOTS; the daily dose of vitD<sub>3</sub> (5000 IU) for 2 months (total dose 300,000 IU) significantly increased the plasma 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels in TB patients that sustained for 6 months. In most TB trials, a high dose of vitamin D eg. up to 100,000 IU has typically been administrated at 3&#x02013;4 occasions during standard anti-TB treatment, which has not provided any clear evidence of adjunctive treatment efficacy [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Importantly, the dose and/or dosing interval required for antimycobacterial therapy is not known and thus it may be insufficient to give such bolus doses. It has been proposed that daily dosing could be more beneficial than bolus dosing in the treatment of respiratory diseases [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A dose of 150,000 IU of vitD<sub>3</sub> given to Indonesian patients did not result in beneficial effects on TB outcomes [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Two intramuscular doses of 600,000 IU of vitD<sub>3</sub> in Pakistani patients resulted in greater weight gain and rapid radiographic clearance of the disease in the intervention group. However, concentration of vitD<sub>3</sub> was not determined after supplementation in either study, thus it was not clear if the clinical improvement was associated with elevated 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> levels [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In a trial in Guinea-Bissau, a total dose of 300,000 IU did not result in higher serum 25(OH)D<sub>3</sub> in the intervention group compared to the controls [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Also opposed to our study, the TB patients in two of the other trials were not vitamin D insufficient or deficient at baseline (60 nmol/L), which is probably an important prerequisite to observe a positive clinical effect of vitD<sub>3</sub> supplementation [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0138340.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. We assumed that vitamin D has to be administered in a concentrated dose (5000 IU/day) at much earlier and more frequent time points (i.e. daily for 2 months) in order to have an optimal antimycobacterial effect and to significantly shorten the duration of standard anti-TB chemotherapy. Moreover, PBA was added as an additional adjunct therapeutic compound for enhanced impact.</p><p>The therapeutic potential of LL-37 in various infections has been demonstrated by <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, but efficient use of elicitors of AMPs in clinical studies is rare. There is a great interest in the use of nutritional agents or repurposed drugs that can be used as adjunct therapy to treatment of infectious diseases. Tailoring the use of such agents as host-directed or pathogen-directed therapies that can restore clinically relevant immune responses can be a novel approach [<xref rid="pone.0138340.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Altogether, the findings of this clinical trial are encouraging; there are indications that this type of host-directed therapy can be exploited to fight respiratory infections by enhancing innate immunity, antimicrobial activity and modulating immune responses. Further studies are needed to understand the role of PBA and vitD<sub>3</sub> in reducing inflammatory responses or restoring appropriate immune responses in the treatment of MDR-TB, extra-pulmonary TB as well as TB and associated co-morbidities including diabetes or HIV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec036"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138340.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138340.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138340.s002"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Study Protocol.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138340.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138340.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Clinical parameters used for clinical scores.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138340.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138340.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Differences between baseline characteristics when randomized patients were compared to potentially eligible patients who declined or had to be excluded from the study.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138340.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138340.s005"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>) status of TB patients at baseline and at 8 and 24 weeks after initiation of adjunctive therapy.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0138340.s005.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0138340.s006"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Consent.
