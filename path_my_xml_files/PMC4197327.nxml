The World Health Organisation considers bullying to be a major adolescent health problem, defining this to include the intentional use of physical or psychological force against others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This includes verbal and relational aggression that aims to harm the victim or their social relations, such as through spreading rumours or purposely excluding them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The prevalence of bullying among British youth is above the European average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], with approximately 25% of young people reporting that they have been subjected to serious peer bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There are marked social gradients, with both family deprivation and school-level deprivation increasing the risk of experiencing bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Bullying most commonly occurs in schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and prevalence varies significantly between schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>Being a victim of peer bullying is associated with an increased risk of: physical health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; engaging in health risk behaviours such as substance use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]; long-term emotional, behavioural and mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; self-harm and suicide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]; and poorer educational attainment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Students who experience physical, verbal and relational bullying on a regular basis tend to experience the most adverse health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. There is also evidence suggesting that childhood exposure to bullying and aggression may also influence life-long health through biological mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The perpetrators of peer bullying are also at greater risk of a range of adverse emotional and mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Bullying is also often a precursor to more serious violent behaviours commonly reported by British youth. One UK study of 14,000 students found that 1 in 10 young people aged 11 to 12 reported carrying a weapon and 8% of this age group admitted they had attacked another with the intention to hurt them seriously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. By age 15 to 16, 24% of students report that they have carried a weapon and 19% reported attacking someone with the intention to hurt them seriously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Inter-personal violence can cause physical injury and disability, and is also associated with long-term emotional and mental health problems. There are also links between aggression and anti-social behaviours in youth and violent crime in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. There is increasing concern because low-level provocation and aggressive behaviours in secondary schools are educationally disruptive, emotionally harmful, reduce educational attainments and later life-chances, and can lead to more overt physical aggression over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The economic costs to society as a whole due to youth aggression, bullying and violence are extremely high. For example, the total cost of crime attributable to conduct problems in childhood has been estimated at about &#x000a3;60 billion a year in England and Wales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>School-based interventions</title><p>Reducing aggression, bullying and violence in British schools has been a consistent priority within recent public health and education policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The 2009 Steer Review concluded that schools&#x02019; approaches to discipline, behaviour management and bullying prevention vary widely and are rarely evidence-based, and that further resources and research are urgently needed to combat aggressive behaviours and other conduct problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. There is, therefore, a pressing need to determine which interventions are effective in addressing bullying and aggression in schools, and to scale up such interventions across local and national school networks.</p><p>A number of systematic reviews assess school-based interventions to address bullying and aggression. Interventions that promote change across school systems and addressed different levels of school organisation, that is &#x02018;whole-school&#x02019; or &#x02018;school environment&#x02019; interventions, are particularly effective in reducing victimisation and bullying than curriculum interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The effectiveness of such interventions may be because they address bullying as a systemic problem meriting an &#x02018;environmental solution&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Whole-school interventions are also inherently universal in reach and likely to provide a cost-effective and non-stigmatising approach to preventing bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. This is in keeping with other evidence from the UK and internationally which shows that schools promote health most effectively when they are not treated merely as sites for health education but also as physical and social environments which can actively support healthy behaviours and outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>These school environment interventions thus take a &#x02018;socio-ecological&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] or &#x02018;structural&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] approach to promoting health whereby behaviours are understood to be influenced not only by characteristics of individuals, but also the wider social context. A recent National Institute of Health Research (NIHR)-funded systematic review of the health effects of the school environment found evidence from observational and experimental studies that modifying the way in which schools manage their &#x02018;core business&#x02019; (teaching, pastoral care and discipline) can promote student health and potentially reduce health inequalities across a range of outcomes, including reductions in violence and other aggressive behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Other outcomes that are improved by school environment interventions include mental health and physical activity and reduced substance use including alcohol, tobacco and drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p>School environment interventions that impact on a range of health risk behaviours including aggression are likely to be one of the most efficient ways of addressing multiple health harms in adolescence, due to their potential for modifying population-level risk as well as their reach and sustainability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Multiple risk behaviours in adolescence are subject to socio-economic stratification, and are strongly associated with poor health outcomes, social exclusion, educational failure and poor mental health in adult life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. A recent King&#x02019;s Fund report on <italic>The Clustering of Unhealthy Behaviours Over Time</italic>, emphasised the association of multiple risk behaviours with mortality and health across the life-course, and the policy importance of reducing multiple risk behaviours among young people through new interventions that address their common determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].</p><p>The INCLUSIVE intervention under trial here has been particularly informed by two international evidence-based school environment programmes. First, the Aban Aya Youth Project (AAYP) is a multi-component intervention, enabling schools to modify their social environment as well as delivering a social skills curriculum. This approach was designed to increase social inclusion by &#x02018;rebuilding the village&#x02019; within schools serving disadvantaged, African-American communities. To promote whole-school institutional change at each school, teacher training was provided and an action group was established (comprising both staff and students) to review policies and prioritise actions needed to foster a more inclusive school climate. For boys, the intervention was associated with significant reductions in the growth in violence and aggressive behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The intervention also brought benefits in terms of reduced sexual risk behaviours and drug use, as well as provoking behaviour and school delinquency. Second, the Gatehouse Project in Australia also aimed to reduce health problems via changing the school climate and promoting security, positive regard and communication among students and school staff. As with the AAYP, an action group was convened in each school, facilitated by an external &#x02018;critical friend&#x02019; and informed by data from a student survey, alongside a social and emotional skills curriculum. A cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) found consistent reductions in a composite measure of health risk behaviours, which included violence and anti-social behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>INCLUSIVE extends the AAYP and Gatehouse interventions by including &#x02018;restorative justice&#x02019; approaches. The Steer Review in 2009 called for English schools to consider adopting more restorative approaches to prevent bullying and other aggressive behaviour to help minimise the harms associated with such problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The central tenet of such approaches is to repair the harms caused to relationships and communities rather than merely assign blame and enact punishment. Such approaches have now been adapted for use in schools and can operate at a whole-school level, informing changes to disciplinary policies, behaviour management practices, and how staff communicate with students in order to improve relationships, reduce conflict and repair harm. An example of such restorative practice currently employed in schools is the use of &#x02018;circle time&#x02019; to develop and maintain good communication and relationships [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Restorative &#x02018;conferencing&#x02019; can also be used in schools to deal with more serious incidents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].</p><p>Restorative approaches have only been evaluated using non-random designs, although such studies do suggest that the restorative approach is a promising one in the UK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] and internationally, particularly when implemented at the whole-school level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. For example, in England and Wales, the Youth Justice Board evaluated the use of restorative approaches at twenty secondary schools and six primary schools, and reported significant improvements regarding students&#x02019; attitudes to bullying, and reduced offending, and victimisation in schools that adopted a whole-school approach to restorative practice. Restorative approaches thus appear to have the potential to complement school-environment interventions such as Aban Aya and the Gatehouse Project. They offer a highly promising way forward for reducing aggressive behaviours among British youth. A recent Cochrane review found no RCTs of interventions employing restorative approaches to reduce bullying in schools and recommended that this should be a priority for future research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. If trialled and found to be effective, such a universal school-based approach could be scaled up to reach very large numbers of young people and deliver significant population-level health improvements.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Findings from the INCLUSIVE pilot study</title><p>The evidence above demonstrates that bullying and aggression are highly prevalent in English schools, and generate health harms and inequalities, educational and other harms, and economic costs. While existing systematic reviews suggest &#x02018;whole-school&#x02019; interventions are an effective approach to addressing these problems, the recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>] recommends further trials in this area examining restorative practices. The INCLUSIVE intervention addresses these points and has been successfully piloted, funded for 20&#x000a0;months (July 2011 to February 2013) through a commissioned funding call from the UK NIHR Health Technology Assessment (HTA). Criteria were agreed for progression to a full trial, with further funding for a phase III trial of a three-year intervention being dependent on a new funding application. Intervention funding was provided by the Paul Hamlyn Foundation, the Big Lottery Fund, and the Coutts Charitable Trust.</p><p>We undertook a cluster RCT in eight mixed-sex secondary schools in London and south-east England, purposively sampled to ensure diversity with regard to Ofsted rating and rate of eligibility for free school meals (four intervention, four comparison) with integral process evaluation. The aim was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the INCLUSIVE intervention and trial methods over one academic year (whereas INCLUSIVE was designed as a three-year intervention). The objectives of the study were to: (1) examine the feasibility and acceptability of delivering and trialling the intervention according to pre-specified criteria agreed with the HTA; (2) explore participants&#x02019; experiences of implementing and trialling the intervention and how this varied according to school context to refine the intervention and trial methods; and (3) pilot indicative primary outcomes (aggressive behaviour measures), other outcomes and economic evaluation methods.</p><p>All pre-specified feasibility and acceptability criteria were met (objective 1) and the process data indicated that all intervention components, the trial design and methods were feasible and acceptable (objective 2). Qualitative data suggested that student participation may be a core component in improving relationships and engagement across the school. Appropriate outcome measures and economic methods were identified (objective 3): the Gatehouse Bullying Scale (GBS) and the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime (ESTYC) school misbehaviour subscale were acceptable, discriminating and reliable measures of bullying and aggression in this context. Pilot economic analyses support the use of the Child Health Utility 9D (CHU9D) scale with this population and the feasibility of cost-utility analysis. Analysis of outcomes in the pilot showed that confidence intervals encompassed potential intervention benefits. There was no evidence of harm.</p><p>We were then successful in obtaining further NIHR funding from the Public Health Research programme (PHR) to undertake a large-scale cluster RCT to examine the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the INCLUSIVE intervention. Intervention funding was obtained from the Educational Endowment Fund (EEF), which also funded an independent evaluation of effects on educational attainment to be conducted by the University of Manchester.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Research questions</title><p>RQ1.

The curriculum targets students in years eight to ten who receive five to ten hours teaching and learning per year on restorative practices, relationships, and social and emotional skills based on the Gatehouse Project curriculum. The curriculum is designed as a set of learning modules which schools can address using our own or existing materials if these aligned with our curriculum. Modules cover: establishing respectful relationships in the classroom and the wider school; managing emotions; understanding and building trusting relationships; exploring others&#x02019; needs and avoiding conflict; and maintaining and repairing relationships. Informed by the needs-assessment data, schools will tailor the curriculum to their needs and could deliver modules either as &#x02018;stand-alone&#x02019; lessons, for example within Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), and/or integrated into various subject lessons (for example, English).</p></list-item></list></p><p>The intervention enables local tailoring, informed by the needs survey and other local data sources. These locally adaptable actions occurred within a standardised overall process with various core standardised intervention elements, such as the staff training in restorative practices; review and revision of school rules and policies; and the social and emotional skills curriculum. This balance of standardisation and flexibility is a common practice in complex interventions, enabling a balance between fidelity of the core components with local adaption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. This allows schools to build on their current good practice, and also encourages students and staff to develop ownership of the work, which may be a key factor in intervention effects. To support this, the facilitator works with schools to ensure all members of the action group are supported to identify and undertake locally determined actions to improve the school environment.</p><p>Internally facilitated intervention year: the third intervention year will be identical to the externally facilitated intervention described above, with the exception that there will be no provision of external facilitation.

Control schools are free to engage in actions to reduce bullying and aggression but the contract signed with head-teachers will preclude their engaging in a facilitated whole-school programme similar to INCLUSIVE during the period of the trial.

As is conventional in trials of interventions addressing violence and aggression in schools, we will rely on self-reports from students, rather than observations or teacher reports, because of the impracticality and greater likelihood of bias respectively of the latter two.

This measure was designed by one of our collaborators (LB) and has been shown to be related to other measures of social attachments, school engagement, and anxiety and depressive symptoms. The scale has 12 items, and asks about being the subject of recent teasing, name-calling, rumours, being left out of things and physical threats or actual violence from other students in the last 3&#x000a0;months. Each section asks about the recent experience of that type of bullying (&#x02018;yes&#x02019; or &#x02018;no&#x02019;), how often it occurred, and how upset the student was by each type of bullying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime</italic> (<italic>ESYTC</italic>) <italic>school misbehaviour subscale</italic>.

A systematic review of school-based secondary preventive interventions to prevent violence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>] reported a pooled effect size of 0.41 on measures of aggressive behaviour. Effect sizes for aggressive behaviour from similar interventions approximate 0.3 to 0.4 SDs in males. Recent data from three large UK school cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] suggest that intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICC) for aggression and bullying outcomes vary between 0.01 and 0.03</p><p>We propose to recruit sufficient participants to detect a difference between groups of 0.25 SD with 90% power and a 5% level of significance. This is considered to represent a moderate size of effect and in line with the effect sizes seen in the literature.</p><p>Conservatively, taking an ICC of 0.04 and 150 students per school, a trial involving 20 schools per arm will provide 90% power to identify an effect size of 0.25 SD with a 5% significance level. If two schools per arm (that is 10%) were to be lost to follow-up over the course of the trial, we would still have 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.25 SD.</p><p>The total student sample size will be approximately 6,000. As we will be surveying all young people in the relevant school year at each follow-up, this sample is likely to remain similar across the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Economic evaluation</title><p>The aim of the economic evaluation is to assess the costs, consequences and cost-effectiveness of the INCLUSIVE intervention compared with standard school-based practices for managing aggression.</p><p>The primary economic evaluation will take the form of a within-trial cost-consequence analysis, with a secondary analysis that will report relative cost-utility with health outcomes expressed in terms of Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs), as recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)&#x02019;s public health methods guidance.</p><p>This NICE guidance also recommends that the base-case cost-effectiveness estimate is presented from a public sector perspective as this allows the costs and benefits of more than one central/local government body to be taken into account. This statement is particularly pertinent to INCLUSIVE as the costs of implementing it are likely to fall on the educational sector, yet there are potential cost implications for sectors such as the NHS, the police and the judiciary through reduced anti-social behaviour.</p><p>The costs to the education sector include cost of the facilitator to deliver the intervention and the cost of staff time. The facilitator costs for the delivery of the intervention will be collected using log sheets. The impact on staff time for training and delivering bullying policy will be obtained as part of the process evaluation. It is possible that the intervention might offset some of the staff time related to dealing with pupil aggression or bullying behaviour and this will be captured as part of the teacher survey. It might also impact on teacher health and we will capture this by valuing the number of days off work, which will be captured as a secondary outcome measure. The implications for NHS resource use and policing will be identified with specific questions in the student survey and valued accordingly. The time horizon will capture costs and outcomes within the trial.</p><p>Changes in health-related QoL (as expressed using QALYs) will be measured from the study participants&#x02019; (that is student&#x02019;s/teacher&#x02019;s) perspective.</p><p>The <italic>Child Health Utility</italic> (<italic>CHU</italic>) <italic>9D measure</italic> (CHU-9D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] will be used to assess student&#x02019;s health-related QoL as part of the economic evaluation. The CHU-9D is a validated age-appropriate measure that was explicitly developed using children&#x02019;s input and has been suggested to be more appropriate and function better than other health utility measures for children and adolescents. For teachers, we will use the SF-12 for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Student and teacher utility values will be collected (at baseline and at follow-up surveys at 24 and 36&#x000a0;months) using the CHU-9D and by converting the SF-12 questionnaires respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Data will be used to examine intervention implementation and receipt and examine possible causal pathways in order to facilitate interpretation of outcome data. In line with Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on complex interventions, this component of the trial will also enable refinement of the intervention logic model. Informed by existing frameworks, the process evaluation will examine the following:</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial context</title><p>We will assess the context within the intervention and control arms, including what other relevant services and practices operate, such as the nature of school discipline systems, staff training, social skills curricula and student participation in decision-making.

The primary analysis will be a repeat cross-sectional analysis that includes data from all students at both time points for two main reasons: (1) the intervention is a whole school intervention and, based on a school-level theory of change, is expected to impact on all pupils, not just on those pupils who were present at baseline; (2) the literature suggests that in cluster randomised trials, when migration into or out of the clusters is high over time, the baseline cohort may not remain representative of the cluster and therefore repeated cross-sectional analysis is preferred to minimise bias. Based on our pilot data and existing research on student mobility, we anticipate student turn-over of up to 25% in some schools over 36&#x000a0;months. Because of this we will use multilevel analyses that include all students at all time-points, which essentially provides a repeat cross-sectional analysis with a nested longitudinal cohort.</p><p>Data will be analysed by appropriate multivariate regression models, fitting pre-hypothesised potential confounders as covariates. Note that data on ethnicity and socio-economic status will be collected by self-report from students. Both primary outcomes will be fully analysed and reported separately, using separate multi-level models. A small number of secondary analyses based on explicit hypotheses, for example, subgroup effects/causal pathway analyses will be specified in advance. These secondary analyses will include a longitudinal analysis of pupils present at both baseline and follow-up, with further analyses using individual-level baseline data to explore the implications of missing individual-level outcome data.</p><p>Secondary analyses will include staff outcomes and will be carried out according to the principle of ITT using the same approach to modelling as described for the student outcomes. Secondary analyses will also examine moderators and mediators. We will examine whether intervention effects are moderated by individual-level gender and socio-economic status measured using the Health Behaviours in School-aged Children (HBSC) Family Affluence Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and sex, as well as by school-level stratifying factors (single sex versus mixed sex school; school-level deprivation; value added strata); and facilitator, though these analyses may be underpowered. We will examine whether intervention effects are mediated by process and intermediate outcome measures. Other such analyses will be informed by hypotheses derived from analysis of qualitative data.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Economic analyses</title><p>The primary economic evaluation will be a cost-consequence analysis. We will undertake a cost-utility analysis as a secondary analysis. These analyses will be linked and use of both is consistent with NICE methods guidance for evaluating public health interventions. We propose using a multi-level modelling approach with random intercepts to estimate the mean and standard errors for both cost and effects along with the covariance matrix. From these data mean incremental net benefit and confidence intervals will then be estimated. Missing data will be handled using multiple imputation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Process evaluation analyses</title><p>Qualitative data will be entered into the data analysis package NVivo (QSR International (UK) Limited, Vanguard House, Keckwick Lane, Daresbury, Cheshire, WA4 4AB, United Kingdom, Telephone: +44 (0) 1925 357 960) which will be used to manage and code data. Qualitative data from the process evaluation will be subjected to a thematic content analysis. Codes will be applied to transcripts, which identify key themes and how these inter-relate in order to develop an analytical framework. Each transcript will be coded to indicate the type of participant, school and date, allowing analytical themes to be explored in relation to different groups&#x02019; experiences and to compare processes across schools. Drawing on methods associated with &#x02018;grounded theory&#x02019;, we will make constant comparisons and examine deviant cases to refine our analysis. Analysis will explore implementation and receipt and contextual factors affecting these, as well as potential causal pathways in order to develop hypotheses to examine in secondary moderator and mediator analyses.

The trial manager will report to the CIs and to a trial management group made up of RV, CB, AM together with the lead study statistician Elizabeth Allen (EA) and the lead for the intervention team, Meg Wiggins (MW). The trial management group will meet monthly throughout the study, and report to the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) made up of all named investigators. The SSC will meet four- to six-monthly throughout the trial. Responsibility for data integrity and analysis will be held by the Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) (Diana Elbourne and EA). Responsibility for economic evaluation will be held by Richard Grieve at the LSHTM.</p><p>The intervention team will be managed by MW at the Institute of Education, together with Miranda Perry (MP), the intervention educational consultant who will direct day-to-day operation of the intervention and coordinate the educational facilitators.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec37" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The INCLUSIVE trial is part of a growing number of cluster randomised trials related to health but conducted within the education system in the UK. We have built upon evidence from US and Australian studies, modified the intervention to include restorative justice elements and shown feasibility and acceptability in a pilot study. This full trial of the INCLUSIVE intervention is a pragmatic &#x02018;realist&#x02019; trial, evaluating not only the facilitated intervention (for the primary outcome) but also a further year of the intervention when continued by schools without external facilitation.</p><p>A number of elements of the trial will aid generalisability and scalability if shown to be effective. We have included a very wide range of participating schools, including all but schools whose current functioning we judge to be too low to be able to implement or benefit from the intervention. The intervention is flexible and can be tailored to each school&#x02019;s needs and we have partnered with a number of school networks to facilitate future scalability.</p><p>Funding was obtained from both the health sector (through the National Institute of Health Research) and the education sector (the Education Endowment Fund). Each is funding separate teams to undertake the research (health sector) and the intervention (education sector).</p><p>The trial will be overseen by an independent TSC and DMC appointed by the main funders (NIHR)</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Trial status</title><p>At time of submission (2 June 2014) the trial has recruited all schools and is currently recruiting and surveying students for the baseline survey.
