It was first described in 1873 by Runge. The incidence of tennis elbow in the population varies from one to three percent [<xref rid="REF1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It is not exclusively secondary due to the playing of tennis and is commonly seen in people who do heavy manual work&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>Many theories have been suggested to explain the etiology of this condition like bursitis, periostitis, infection, aseptic necrosis, neuritis of branches of the radial nerve, radiohumeral synovitis, and irritation of the collateral ligament. The most widely held theory is that there are macroscopic or microscopic tears in the common extensor origin&#x000a0;as described by Cyriax and others [<xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Symptoms may include local tenderness over the lateral epicondyle, pain in the extensor muscles induced by gripping or resisted extension movements of the wrist [<xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. On examination, pain may be exacerbated by resisted wrist extension in the pronated position. It is worse with the elbow at full extension. The range of motion of the wrist and elbow is usually complete [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Greater than 90% of these patients can be successfully treated nonoperatively [<xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Those who do not respond to conservative treatment are usually offered surgery. A variety of surgical procedures for treating tennis elbow has been described in the literature [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>-<xref rid="REF8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. One of them is tenotomy of the common extensor origin at the elbow. Many authors have now published their results of releasing the common extensor origin percutaneously using either the surgical blade or the hypodermic needle under general anesthesia&#x000a0;[<xref rid="REF9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>-<xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is a simple operation with minimal morbidity and good-to-excellent results in most of the studies. We present our results of percutaneous tenotomy of the common extensor origin conducted in the outpatient department using the bevel of an 18 gauge hypodermic needle for the tenotomy instead of a surgical blade. Informed consent was obtained from the patients for this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Our non-randomised control trial study was conducted at the Department of Orthopaedics Surgery in a tertiary care hospital from July 2015 to June 2016&#x000a0;on 50&#x000a0;patients who underwent percutaneous release of the common extensor origin using an 18 gauge hypodermic needle&#x000a0;(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="TAB1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="TAB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Table showing inclusion and exclusion criteria</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr style="background-color:#ccc"><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Since different etiologies have been proposed for this condition, a variety of surgical options have been tried depending upon the etiology. These include:</p><p>1. open/percutaneous division of the common extensor origin,</p><p>2. excision of pathological tissue at the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB),&#x000a0;</p><p>3. repair of the longitudinal defects,</p><p>4. denervation of the lateral epicondyle both by isolation of the individual nerve branches (all of the radial nerve),</p><p>5. decompression of the radial nerve as it dives deep to the proximal border of the superficial head of the supinator muscle and Arcade of Frohse,</p><p>6. division of the annular ligament,</p><p>7. excision of intraarticular synovial folds [<xref rid="REF7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>],</p><p>8. and surgical lengthening of the ECRB tendon.</p><p>The results of the percutaneous release of the common extensor origin have been very attractive regarding simplicity, safety, minimal morbidity to the patients, and good to excellent outcome in the majority of patients.</p><p>Grundberg and Dobson reported 29 of 32 operated cases having excellent or good results, but they have not mentioned any criteria for the same in their publication. Similarly, Yerger and Turner operated on 149 patients with more than 90% achieving excellent or good results. Once again, they have not mentioned any criteria for the same in their publication. Baumgard and Schwartz delivered excellent results in 32 of 35 patients they operated. Their results were termed Excellent (no preoperative symptoms), Good (improvement of preoperative symptoms) or Poor (no improvement of preoperative symptoms) depending on the outcome symptoms. Since our outcome criteria are different from the one mentioned in literature and because two of the other publications do not have any outcome criteria for excellent or good results at all, the result of our study with 80% good or excellent results cannot be compared with that of others.</p><p>All of these chronic tennis elbow patients had undergone various modalities of non-operative treatments including multiple steroid injections for the condition before being undertaken for surgery. It is&#x000a0;hard to believe that they do not affect microscopic changes in some way at the local site. No published studies have examined specimens from patients with an acute diagnosis of lateral tennis elbow syndrome. After going through the literature, we tend to agree with those who believe that it results from a gradual degenerative tear of the common extensor origin [<xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We believe that tenotomy of the common extensor tendons and scraping of the epicondylar region using the beveled end of an 18 G needle expedites the healing process of the degenerative tendon by converting a chronic inflammatory condition to an acute inflammatory condition which heals rapidly, thereby relieving the pain of tennis elbow which is not amenable to conservative treatment.</p><p>As this is a non-randomised control trial there is a possibility of observer bias, which can be avoided by doing a randomized control trial. Another limitation of our study could be the halo effect, which can be avoided by increasing the number of observers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Most patients with lateral epicondylitis respond to conservative treatment.
