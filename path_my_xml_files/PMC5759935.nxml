Doxorubicin has been found to be associated with insulin resistance in animal models. Onion, a so-called functional food, is noted to affect the insulin signaling pathway of diabetes <italic>in vitro</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the effects of consuming fresh yellow onions on insulin-related indices compared with a low&#x02013;onion-containing diet among breast cancer (BC) patients treated with doxorubicin. <italic>Methods</italic>. This parallel-design, randomized, triple-blind, controlled clinical trial was conducted on 56 eligible BC patients (aged 30-63 years), diagnosed with invasive ductal carcinoma. Following their second cycle of chemotherapy, subjects were assigned in a stratified-random allocation to receive body mass index&#x02013;dependent 100 to 160 g/d of onion as high onion group (HO; n = 28) or 30 to 40 g/d small onions in low onion group (LO; n = 28) for 8 weeks intervention. Participants, care givers, and those who assessed laboratory analyses were blinded to the assignments (IRCT Registry No.: IRCT2012103111335N1). <italic>Results</italic>. The compliance level of participants in the analysis was as high as 87.85%. A total of 23 available cases was analyzed in each group. The daily use of HO resulted in a significant decrease in serum fasting blood glucose and insulin levels in comparison with LO, over the period of study (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Posttreatment with HO showed a significant decrease in homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance relative to changes in the LO group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). A comparison of the changes that occurred throughout pre- and postdose treatments indicated improved quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) and controls on C-peptide in the HO group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). <italic>Conclusions</italic>. The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of onion to ameliorate hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in BC during doxorubicin-based chemotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>onion</kwd><kwd>insulin resistance</kwd><kwd>doxorubicin</kwd><kwd>intervention</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1-1534735416656915"><funding-source id="funding1-1534735416656915"><institution-wrap><institution>Tabriz University of Medical Sciences</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100004366</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding1-1534735416656915">5/97/803</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award2-1534735416656915"><funding-source id="funding2-1534735416656915"><institution-wrap><institution>Drug Applied Research Center</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id rid="funding2-1534735416656915">5-64403</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1534735416656915"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy and the second most lethal cancer type among women worldwide.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Epidemiological observations have supported several lines of evidence from experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on dietary factors as lifestyle-related variables to be implicated in breast tumorigenesis.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr4-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Findings from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition and other cohort studies resulted in inverse associations regarding fruit and vegetable intakes with BC risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="bibr6-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr"/>-<xref rid="bibr7-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> The risk of female breast carcinoma in relation to the consumption of <italic>Allium</italic> vegetables evaluated in the Netherlands Cohort study related to diet and cancer showed no significant results, whereas a French epidemiological study showed that higher onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic> L) intake, as the most frequently consumed <italic>Allium</italic> vegetable, was correlated with a lower risk of BC.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr8-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Evidence from a case-control study undertaken in Switzerland has indicated that a high frequency of onion consumption was associated with a notable decrease in BC risk.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> According to Leviac et al, a descending trend within the range of 40% to 60% BC risk has been observed for the highest versus the lowest tertiles of consumptions.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Although there is consensus within most observational studies to indicate an inverse association between onion and <italic>Allium</italic> intake and cancer risk, no clinical trial has to date been undertaken to prove the role of onion consumption on biomarkers related to BC prognosis and metabolic determinants.</p><p>Insulin is a peptide hormone synthesized in pancreatic &#x003b2; cells and considered as a potent mitogenic hormone.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> C-peptide is a by-product of cleaved pro-insulin released when insulin is being secreted.

The second chemotherapy cycle was chosen to rule out a level of adaptation to chemotherapy that might change metabolic and proliferation-related indices in patients. Prior to the baseline of the study, all participants (between the initial and second chemotherapy cycles) were placed in a 2-week run-in (4 days had been planned in initial protocol, to include the ovulation phase of the menses cycle) period in order to obtain information regarding well-tolerated conditions in chemotherapy, lifestyle-related carcinogenic risk factors, and the compliance of patients to follow the basics of treatment. During the run-in period, participants were instructed not to consume any onion and less than half a serving of other <italic>Allium</italic> species such as spring onion, shallots, garlic, garlic chives, native water-cress leaves, and leek on a daily basis (amount of <italic>Allium</italic> had to be less than 90 g/d). Dietary assessments and information were provided regarding the concept of treatment to encourage better adherence during the 8-week intervention, as described in detail in previously published data.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Possible cachexia following chemotherapy might increase the patients&#x02019; desire for weight gain, which might have been a potent motivation for overreporting of calorie intake and underreporting of some food intakes.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr29-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> Therefore, in order to possibly improve the accuracy of data compliance related to onion consumption, based on Goldberg cutoffs, individuals with misreporting were not included for randomization after the run-in period.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> The measure of the actual body weight at diagnosis prior to surgery was used for basal metabolic rate calculation.</p><p>All participants were individually counselled not to change their habitual diet, with some considerations regarding World Cancer Research Fund International guidelines (specifically, the fat content of their diet) and abstaining from <italic>Allium</italic>-based products, as well as a limitation to eat less than 90 g/d of <italic>Allium</italic> vegetables in order to increase their compliance throughout the study.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> A physical activity record was also obtained from each participant during run-in period, in addition to baseline assessments.

The duration of each chemotherapy protocol was estimated around 24 weeks (except for the regimen in arm 3, which was 33 weeks). The present 8-week intervention was carried out within this duration and commenced after the second treatment cycle of DOX. The endpoint of the intervention was determined prior to any prescription of docetaxel. Tamoxifen as a hormonal adjuvant therapy (20 mg/d) was prescribed during chemotherapy for 20 patients out of 46 participants and intended to be used for almost 5 years in patients with estrogen receptor&#x02013;positive and/or progesterone receptor&#x02013;positive tumors characterized by immunohistochemistry staining data. Radiation therapy was also set as adjuvant therapy according to institutional guidelines. Dexamethasone was administered in 8 mg IV (Daroo Pakhsh Inc, Iran) for each participant before DOX treatment to prevent nausea and vomiting induced by IV injection of DOX.</p><p>Details about the compliance for onion intervention were described in a previous report.<sup><xref rid="bibr26-1534735416656915" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In summary, weighing the leftover parts of onion and a weekly checklist to estimate the frequency of onion use were employed to monitor the compliance of each participant to the study. This checklist also instructed participants to record in a diary details for all unexpected adverse occurrences, cases of doubtful or accidental consumption, as well as delivering the checklist at each 3-week visit. During the study, all participants provided data concerning a 3-day 24-hour dietary records and a weekly physical activity record once every 2 weeks. As a result, each participant had 3 visits between the baseline and end point of 8 weeks. In addition, physical examinations at these visits were conducted following chemotherapy-related changes such as primary and secondary cachexia. Nonresponse to follow-up was defined for patients who ate less than 85% of the prescribed onions and thus were not included in the study. However, this was clearly not the case. At the beginning and end of the study, fasting blood samples were obtained and sera were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until the analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1534735416656915"><title>Interventions</title><p>Obese participants with body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were not included in the randomization and this resulted in less variation regarding calorie-dependent risk factors.

The BMI-dependent amount of onion (those with BMI &#x0003c; 24.9 consumed 100-120 g/d and those with BMI &#x0003e; 25 consumed 140-160 g/d) was taken daily by the high onion group (HO) in addition to main meals. Participants in the low onion group (LO; placebo group) took 30 to 40 g/d onion in addition to meals in a BMI-dependent manner (modified to the initial protocol). This range of onion consumption by participants was also followed in other studies. This superiority trial was set to demonstrate that HO treatment could be more effective than LO on outcome measures. Patients did not experience any loss of body weight more than 25%, which would have triggered exclusion from the study. All participants were asked not to consume any onion a day after receiving chemotherapy in order to enhance compliance and adherence to the study. The duration of treatments for both groups was set at 8 weeks. The complete date range for patient follow-up took place between October 2012 and September 2013.</p><p>Two onions for daily usage were packed in a 5&#x02033; &#x000d7; 5&#x02033; white foam&#x02013;hinged container to provide supplies every 3 weeks in order to fulfil the concealment criteria. The weight of the container was adjusted by pieces of wood so that filled containers of the 2 treatments had identical weights, and onions were fixed by surrounding them with cotton (introduced to the protocol). Opaque plastic foam containers were used to pack onions to fulfil the concealment criteria. Participants were asked to store all onions in a refrigerator at 4&#x000b0;C. Subjects were served one fresh raw onion with lunch and another with dinner meals. Only the 2 outer layers of onions were peeled off before consumption, and the onions were sliced in half before being served to the patient. The average weight of this pulled-off skin (20-30 g) was excluded from the computed weight of served raw onion (pure weight). Raw yellow onions were obtained from a local market (one seller, Tabriz), who declared obtaining the onions from a particular cultivated farm.</p><p>Sequence generation and allocation concealment were listed and marked by the designer of the study and implemented by clinic personnel unaware of the allocated intervention at the time of enrolment. Participants, clinic personnel, and laboratory assessors were blinded to the treatment assignments. The date of entry to receive the first chemotherapy varied between participants in the study. The multicenter design of the study prevented participants from coming in contact with each other collectively during the course of the intervention, in order to improve the blinding concept. Ultimately, each participant at posttreatment timeline was asked whether she had been aware of assignment in control or intervention group and responded of being unaware of grouping.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1534735416656915"><title>Anthropometric Assessments</title><p>Measurement of participants&#x02019; height without shoes was conducted in the standing position to the nearest 0.1 cm, using a wall-mounted stadiometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany).

Aliquots were stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C until laboratory tests were conducted.

Measurements were carried out following the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions. The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) was calculated using the following: HOMA-IR = [glucose (mg/dL) &#x000d7; insulin (&#x000b5;IU)/405] and HOMA-&#x003b2; = [(360 &#x000d7; insulin (&#x000b5;IU)]/[glucose (mg/dL) &#x02212; 63] &#x000d7; 100.

The sample size by subgroups of the present interventions was relatively small and small changes in serum levels of biomarkers might not be supported by sufficient power of analysis. The interventional time frame of 8 weeks after the second cycle of chemotherapy was considered limited by the possible interaction of high onion consumption in the detoxification of taxane (docetaxel and paclitaxel), which was administered according to the protocol after 12 weeks in the chemotherapy regimens in this study. We attempted to ensure homogenous adjuvant chemotherapy was given alongside the onion intervention by including only patients on DOX-based regimens in the study. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility of IR changes induced by the DOX-based chemotherapy. Thus, the observed prospective effects of onion consumption on IR changes might be masked to some extent by the profound effects of primary adjuvant therapy. We suggest that at least stratified random allocation could be imperative to attenuate the variable effects that resulted from variant chemotherapy regimens. Potential dietary changes are frequently observed after cancer diagnosis, when patients can become more sensitive about their lifestyle. To overcome this challenge, instructions to patients that they should remain on their habitual diets were administered and verified over the run-in period and throughout the 8 weeks of intervention. Although chemotherapy-related metabolic changes that promote weight loss (eg, cachexia) can be observed after receiving the first cycle of chemotherapy, our intervention, which was administered after the second cycle, was not associated with significantly reduced anthropometric changes in controls. One advantage of the study is that the variables of insulin and insulinemia-related indices were validated by the C-peptide biomarker. Overall, the results of this 8-week intervention suggest that onion favorably alters some markers of insulin in a direction that would be effective during chemotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section15-1534735416656915"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The present study demonstrated the potential effectiveness of onion in ameliorating hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in BC during DOX-based chemotherapy. Manipulation of diet through high intake of onion is promising for having a synergistic effect with DOX-based chemotherapy. The common use of fresh and raw onion in Iranian dietary habits renders this study important in terms of establishing the possible effects of regular onion consumption associated with DOX among BC survivors. Fresh yellow onion demonstrates promising properties in terms of insulin-related indices in BC patients prone to IR while being treated with DOX.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank all those involved in this study for their participation, and the staff members of Nour-Nejat Hospital, Cancer Clinic, Danesh-2 Laboratory, Shahid Ghazi and Emam Reza Hospitals for providing their valuable time to this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Note:</bold> Authors Ali Adili and Ali Esfehani contributed equally to this work.
