Likewise, Harada et al<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> showed that 45% of baseball players (age range, 15-17 years) had elbow pain and that 17% of players had a sonographically determined medial elbow joint space gapping. In 2005, the Japanese Society of Clinical Sports Medicine<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> reported that 50% of all elementary school&#x02013;aged players have elbow pain, with 20% of all players having radiographic bone abnormalities. In junior high school students, 46% of baseball players have elbow pain, and in high school students, approximately half of players have a history of injury and have consulted a sports doctor about their elbow pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> It can therefore be seen that elbow pain is a major problem among young baseball players that requires further attention. Therefore, we advocate for the prevention of the burden of the elbow among young baseball players.</p><p>According to the results of our study, throwing without an elbow brace induces widening of the elbow medial joint space after 60 pitches. This indicates that throwing more than 60 pitches without an elbow brace may lead to increased medial elbow joint space gapping, as measured by gravity stress ultrasound. Kirkley et al<sup><xref rid="bibr26-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> showed that repetitive loading exercise contributes to an increase in translation at the joint. Pitching-generated repetitive valgus stress in the elbow is considered to correspond to the repetitive loading exercise. In our study, repetitive valgus stress of the elbow during repetitive throwing contributed to an increase in medial elbow joint space gapping.</p><p>The National High School Baseball Tournament (Koshien) is the highest-level baseball tournament among high school baseball players in Japan. To become a champion in the Koshien tournament, it is necessary to win at least 5 consecutive games in 14 days.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Because of the pressure to succeed in this tournament, teams often rely on a specific pitcher for all of their games unless there is an injury. Assuming the 100 pitches per game recommended by the Japanese Society of Clinical Sports Medicine, a pitcher usually has to pitch 500 balls in 14 days at this tournament. This demanding schedule is not specific to the Koshien tournament but is the same for other local tournaments in each prefecture of Japan. Therefore, overuse of the elbow is quite common among baseball players during intense practice and game schedules.</p><p>Baseball elbow screening using ultrasound has been tested in various locations as a means of preventing elbow injury,<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> but its effectiveness is not known. Although baseball elbow screening is a possible method of detecting early elbow injury, it is not likely to prevent elbow injury. Pitching limitations have been recommended to reduce elbow injury,<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> but the number of elbow injuries has not decreased in recent years. In fact, the number of elbow-injured players who require surgery to the medial elbow joint has increased.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
</p><p>We suggest that elbow bracing may reduce mechanical stress on the elbow by reducing medial elbow joint space gapping. The results of our study showed that medial elbow joint space gapping when wearing an elbow brace was unchanged after 100 repeated pitches. Furthermore, the medial elbow joint space gapping when wearing an elbow brace was significantly less when compared with not wearing an elbow brace after 60 pitches. These results may indicate that using an elbow brace for repetitive throwing is a means of protecting the thrower&#x02019;s elbow. The elbow brace used in this study is designed to control lateral instability by aluminum hinges built into both sides of the brace overlying the elbow joint. In addition, valgus instability is controlled by straps with 3 points of fixation to suppress valgus stress. A study of a brace with similar makeup showed that it applies valgus moment to the knee joint and reduces the varus moment to the joint in action.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2325967117702361" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> In the current study, the varus brace is designed to apply a varus moment to the elbow joint and potentially reduce the valgus moment to the elbow joint during repetitive throwing. The current results indicate that the use of an elbow brace can decrease the medial elbow joint space gapping seen during repetitive throwing.</p><p>With regard to pitching performance, these results indicate that pitching performance, including ball velocity and accuracy of pitching, can be maintained even when wearing an elbow brace.</p><p>With regard to the comfort of the elbow brace, 68% of participants (n = 17) reported some difficulty with pitching when wearing the elbow brace. Some factors such as hinge structure, straps, and brace materials may have an impact on comfort, and refinement of the brace in this regard may improve brace comfort. The weight of the brace (120-132 g) is also a factor that needs to be considered and may affect the comfort and smooth movement of the arm during the throwing motion.</p><p>Currently, the use of an elbow brace is prohibited in baseball games because it is thought that a brace may influence performance in baseball pitchers. In spite of this, we believe that an elbow brace has the potential to reduce elbow injuries in adolescent baseball pitchers. Therefore, we recommend that the governing institutions allow a clinical study to be undertaken to see whether elbow braces can decrease injury rates in adolescent pitchers.</p><p>There are a number of limitations to this study. First, it is not possible to directly correlate decreased elbow injury with reduced medial elbow joint space gapping. To determine this, it is necessary to conduct a longitudinal study with throwers wearing a brace matched with a control group to determine whether wearing a brace can decrease the incidence of medial elbow injuries in this population. Second, the elbow brace was uncomfortable in more than half of the players. Future studies should look at improving the elbow brace configuration. Third, the measurements using ultrasound were not blinded as to brace use. Last, participants of this study included only a narrow age range of baseball players (16.6 &#x000b1; 0.7 years). It is necessary to widen the age range of participants in further studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section8-2325967117702361"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We investigated the effects of elbow bracing as a way to reduce stress on the elbow during repetitive throwing in adolescent baseball players. According to the results of our study, it is apparent that throwing without an elbow brace for more than 60 pitches induces an increase in medial elbow joint space gapping, as determined by gravity stress ultrasound. During repetitive throwing with an elbow brace, the medial elbow joint space gapping was not significantly different after 100 repeated throwing actions. Wearing an elbow brace significantly reduced medial elbow joint space gapping when compared with not wearing an elbow brace after 60 pitches. With regard to pitching performance, there was no significant difference for ball velocity and accuracy of pitching between the elbow brace condition and control. Regarding comfort of the elbow brace, more than half of players reported the brace as uncomfortable. Future studies are needed to demonstrate whether a brace will reduce elbow injuries in adolescent patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr Toby Hall, Director of Manual Concepts, for the English-language review.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="fn1-2325967117702361"><p>The authors declared that they have no conflicts of interest in the authorship and publication of this contribution.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other" id="fn2-2325967117702361"><p>Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the Faculty of Health and Medical Care of Saitama Medical University.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2325967117702361"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
