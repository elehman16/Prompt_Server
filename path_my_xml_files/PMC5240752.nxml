treatment or supplementing trace elements for disease prevention. This tool consists of a
three-layered capsule that dissolves in the lower digestive tract, but not in the rumen.
The capsule was manufactured by capsule-forming techniques through the use of liquid
surface tension. This method does not involve high-temperature treatment, so the capsule
can contain not only lipophilic substances but also hydrophilic or heat-sensitive
substances. Furthermore, the capsule has a specific gravity of 1.3 and diameter of 6.0 mm,
which were previously shown to be appropriate to avoid rumination. The objective of this
study was to confirm the effectiveness of the capsule pertinent to rumen escaping. In
order to validate rumen escape, capsules containing 30 g of water-soluble vitamin
(thiamine hydrochloride) per head were administered to four lactating cows assigned in a
crossover trial. In the group administered encapsulated thiamine hydrochloride, blood
thiamine levels increased from 12.4 &#x000b1; 1.03 <italic>n</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> before
administration to 54.8 &#x000b1; 2.21 <italic>n</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> at 6 hr following
administration, whereas the level remained at 13.3 &#x000b1; 2.05
<italic>n</italic>g/m<italic>l</italic> in the control group administered via aqueous
solution. This indicates that the three-layered capsules passed through the rumen and
dissolved in the lower digestive tract, thus functioning as a rumen escapable tool.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>capsule</kwd><kwd>dairy cattle</kwd><kwd>water soluble vitamin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Advances in the genetic improvement of dairy cows, especially the Holstein variety, have led
to large increases in per capita milk production. Since it is necessary to balance nutrient
intake to meet this increased milk production, a greater burden is placed on the body,
including the metabolization of lipids and carbohydrates in the liver. Consequently, metabolic
disorders have become more frequent and are now a significant problem for dairy management
[<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
Metabolic diseases, such as ketosis, are primarily caused by a negative energy balance during
early lactation [<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Clinical and latent ketosis are major economic diseases, reducing milk production and also
causing reproductive problems, such as an increase in the number of days open [<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Ketosis is both prevented and treated by the intravenous
administration of B vitamins and sugars [<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However,
cows are polygastric, and of their four stomachs, the first stomach (the rumen) contains 1&#x02013;100
billion microorganisms per gram. Consequently, even when B vitamins are administered orally,
they are broken down by microorganisms, with as little as 52% of thiamine (VB1), 1% of
riboflavin (VB2) and 3% of niacin (VB3) escaping the rumen [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, intravenous or subcutaneous injections, or a rumen escapable feed must be
used when administering these functional ingredients to cows.</p><p>Substances that have particularly high potential for decomposition by microbes in the rumen
can be protected by coating with oil, enabling them to avoid degradation and reach the
abomasum [<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, because this method involves the
suspension of the administered substance in heat-treated oils followed by solidification
through cooling, it is difficult to achieve escaping using hydrophilic substances, such as
water-soluble vitamins or medicine, or heat-sensitive substances, such as live microbial
agents. More specifically, mixed hydrophilic substances treated in heated oil can be easily
separated during solidification process. Also, heat-sensitive substances are inactivated by
hot melting oils. Therefore, in the present study, we developed a new rumen escapable tool for
cattle, consisting of a three-layered capsule that can protect the contents from degradation
by microorganisms and dilution in the massive rumen. The capsule is manufactured at room
temperature so that hydrophilic or heat-sensitive substances can be contained without
suffering any harmful heat effect. Encapsulated thiamine hydrochloride indicator was
administered to lactating cows to verify that the capsules had escaped the rumen degradation
and reached the lower gastrointestinal tract.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p><italic>Animals and diet</italic>: All animal procedures conformed to the guidelines of the

according to the following procedure [<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Schematic of (a) the three-layered capsule and (b) method of manufacture. (a) Core: a
mixture of hydrogenated palm oil and water-soluble vitamins, including titanium
dioxide as a density-adjusting agent. Middle layer: composed of hydrogenated oils and
titanium dioxide. Outer layer: consists of starch, carrageenan and so on. Diameter is
6 mm, and specific gravity is 1.3. (b) Triple concentric nozzle: core, middle and

kinds of liquid suspension of core, middle layer and outer layer. Core liquid included
substances intended to be escaped rumen. Flowing oil: carrier of spherical
droplets.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jvms-78-1765-g001"/></fig>): The core liquid suspension consisted of 25% w/w of thiamine hydrochloride and 25%
w/w of titanium dioxide to regulate specific gravity, in liquid palm kernel oil having a
melting point of 38&#x000b0;C. The middle layer was designed to avoid degradation by stomach acid in
the abomasum. It was produced from a liquid suspension consisting of 30% w/w titanium
dioxide in hardened palm kernel oil having a melting point of 56.5&#x000b0;C. The outer layer was
intended to protect the middle layer from physical damage caused by jostling during
transport. The composition of the outer aqueous suspension was as follows: 3.0% w/w
kappa-carrageenan, 11.3% w/w cassava starch, 4.7% w/w sorbitol, 0.02% w/w locust bean gum,
1.4% w/w low-methoxy pectin, 0.23% w/w potassium chloride, 0.01% w/w calcium chloride, 0.09%
w/w potassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.28% w/w potassium dihydrogen phosphate and 2.3% w/w
titanium dioxide. These three types of suspension were applied via an encapsulation machine
equipped a triple concentric nozzle. The core, middle and outer layers of the liquid
suspension were simultaneously ejected (via the innermost, intermediate and outermost
nozzles, respectively) to a flowing-oil chamber. The suspension formed a spherical capsule
with three layers via its own surface tension in oil. The obtained wet capsules were dried
at 20&#x000b0;C and 22.6% relative humidity on a rotating fluidized bed, thereby solidifying to form
three-layer capsules. The polysaccharide (kappa-carrageenan, cassava starch, locust bean gum
and low-methoxy pectin), sugar alcohol (sorbitol) and salts (potassium chloride, calcium
chloride, potassium hydrogen phosphate and potassium dihydrogen phosphate) comprised in the
outer thin layer of the capsule are commonly used for food additive and authorized feeding
to cattle by Inc. Administrative Agency Food and Agricultural Materials Inspection Center in
Japan. The palm kernel oil comprised in the middle layer and core are used for feed of
cattle, and also, authorized. Titanium dioxide to regulate specific gravity comprised in the
all layers of the capsule is used for food additive in Japan. Wang <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] reported that the titanium was accumulated in
the spleen and brain when female mice were one time administrated 5 g/kg body weight of
fine-sized titanium dioxide suspensions, but showed no acute toxicity. In the present study,
orally administrated titanium dioxide was approximately 0.08 mg/kg
body weight of cattle. We concluded that the capsule in itself is harmless to cattle and
products. In addition, we confirmed that specific gravity of the capsule can be adjusted by
using talc (which is authorized feeding to cattle) in exchange for titanium dioxide.</p><p><italic>In vitro incubation of capsules and preliminary administration</italic>: Twenty
particles of manufactured capsules per flask were anaerobically incubated by shaking in 100
m<italic>l</italic> rumen liquor at 39&#x000b0;C for 24 hr in triplicate. Rumen liquor was
obtained from lactating cows via rumen catheter and was immediately used for <italic>in
vitro</italic> incubation of the capsules. Twenty-four hr later, capsules were recovered
using a 2.0-mm screen. Visual inspection established whether or not the
capsules had undergone lysis in the rumen liquor. Before the main test, the rumen insoluble
capsules were preliminarily administered to cows in order to examine the effect of the
breaking strength of the capsules on their solubility in the lower digestive tract
subsequent to the rumen <italic>in vivo</italic>. Two cows were orally administered the
capsule with five kinds of breaking strength (0.9, 2.5, 4.1, 5.4 and 8.1 N) every other
week. All feces were picked up from the floor after administration for 24 hr, and the status
of excreted capsules was checked visually. A rheometer (CR-500DX, Sun Scientific Co., Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) was used to measure the breaking strength of the capsule, and the breaking
strength was defined as the breaking load when the capsule broke due to constriction. The
measurement was carried out using a pressure sensitive disc-shaped shaft with a diameter of
10 mm, moving at 20 mm/min at 39&#x000b0;C.</p><p><italic>Administration of capsules containing water-soluble vitamins</italic>: Thiamine
hydrochloride was used to determine whether the capsules successfully escaped the rumen. The
capsules contained a core of thiamine hydrochloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.,
Osaka, Japan). The test group was administered encapsulated thiamine hydrochloride, whereas
the control group was administered the same amount of thiamine hydrochloride in an aqueous
solution. Both the test and control groups were orally administered 30 g of thiamine
hydrochloride (approximately 1,500 capsules for test group) per head. A polyvinyl chloride
resin installer RUMENFIBE (Meiwa Sangyo Co., Ltd., Kyoto, Japan) was used for oral
administration. Administration of both the capsules and solution was forced at 10:00 prior
to feeding. Blood samples were collected from the jugular vein every 3 hr, from immediately
before administration until 24 hr after administration. All urine was collected by urinary
catheterization for 24 hr after administration and weighed after each excretion. Then, 2
m<italic>l</italic> of urine was immediately stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis.</p><p>The thiamine concentration was measured using the modifications by Fukuwatari <italic>et
al</italic>. [<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] to the high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) method by Kimura <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Specifically, for blood samples, 300 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic> of whole
blood was taken using sodium heparin as an anticoagulant, to which 600 <italic>&#x000b5;l</italic>
of 5% w/v trichloroacetic acid solution was added. This mixture was then centrifuged at
15,000 &#x000d7;<italic>g</italic> and 4&#x000b0;C. The supernatant was used as an HPLC injection sample
following filtration. Following column separation using 0.2 M sodium dihydrogen
phosphate/0.3% v/v acetonitrile as the mobile phase, it was mixed with 0.1% w/v potassium
ferricyanide and 15% w/v NaOH before measurement using a fluorescence detector. The columns
were reversed-phase HPLC columns (COSMOSIL 5C18-MS-II, 4.6 &#x000d7; 250 mm, NACALAI TESQUE, Inc.,
Kyoto, Japan).</p><p><italic>Statistical analysis</italic>: For samples collected concurrently, Student&#x02019;s
<italic>t</italic>-test was used to examine inter-group differences in blood thiamine
concentrations. Tukey&#x02019;s multiple comparison analysis was used to determine differences in
the concentrations of blood thiamine within each group. All analyses were performed using R

concluded that capsules placed into the rumen retained their shape until flowing out to the
omasum. Our previous study in dairy cattle showed that the proportion of ruminated
indigestible plastic balls (which are similar to the capsules used in this study in shape,
size and specific gravity) was 2% or less [<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].
According to that finding, almost all the capsules possibly passed through the rumen without
being degraded by microorganisms in rumen and/or physical destruction by rumination. In the
present study, the capsules were found to be insoluble in rumen liquor <italic>in
vitro</italic>. At the same time, no intact capsules were found in feces after the
preliminary administration when the breaking strength of capsule was set for less than 4.1
N. In addition, we have reported in our previous study that oral administration of the same
three-layered capsules containing live lactic acid bacteria had altered the intestinal
bacterial flora of cattle [<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. These results
strongly suggest that the capsules used in the main administration tests in this study
escaped from being broken in the rumen, but dissolved in lower digestive tract.</p><p>The elevated blood thiamine concentration in the test group suggests that the capsule
reached the intestinal tract after passing quickly through the anterior stomach. It has been
suggested that solids with a high specific gravity, such as the capsules used in this study,
quickly enter the ruminal ventral sacs rather than being limited to the mat formed in the
rumen [<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Additionally, it is known that once solids
have entered the ventral sac, they flow through the omasum without reentering the dorsal sac
[<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Hoeller <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] reported that the rumen wall of sheep has an extremely
low permeability to thiamine and that the rumen may not be a site of significant absorption
of thiamin. Moreover, Miller <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported that absorption of
thiamine occurs mainly in the small intestine. In the results of our study, the blood
thiamine levels started to increase 3 hr after administration in the test group, even though
thiamine half-life in blood is very short, reported as 4.7 and 7.1 min in fitting two
exponential functions [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Furthermore, plasma
thiamine concentration peaked between 6 and 9 hr after administration before subsequently
starting to decline. These results suggest that the capsules moved rapidly to the duodenum
without stopping in the rumen; and that almost all the capsules had dissolved and released
their contents in a rapid manner, since no capsules lysed in rumen liquor in <italic>in
vitro</italic> incubation, as indicated above. The rise of blood thiamine level for the
test group seems to be relatively low with respect to the amount of administered thiamine.
It is thought to be due to that thiamine is quickly metabolized in blood and its half-life
is very short [<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>In contrast, the ruminal retention time of the aqueous solutions, such as those used in the
control group, is estimated to be about 10 hr in dairy cows [<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Assuming that as much as 52% administered thiamine hydrochloride reached the
lower digestive tract intact [<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], a rise in blood
concentrations would be expected to occur 10 hr following administration. However, in
practice, this was not observed. This is considered to be due to metabolic action of ruminal
microorganisms and/or quick hydrolysis or tissue uptake that somewhat absorbed thiamin, as
mentioned above. With regard to urine, there was no difference in accumulated thiamine
hydrochloride between control and test groups. Nakajima <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that in cattle, thiamine is absorbed from
blood by some tissues, such as the brain, heart, liver and kidney. For this reason, it was
concluded that tissue uptake of migrated thiamine from capsules occurred in a matter of
hours and that thiamine was not excreted to urine.</p><p>The above results show that encasing water-soluble vitamins within a multi-layer capsule
structure allows for efficient absorption by cows. The three-layered capsules developed in
this study for cows were shown to function as a rumen escapable tool. Additionally, it was
demonstrated that the capsules rapidly moved to the duodenum following administration, since
peak blood thiamine concentration occurred between 6 and 9 hr after oral capsule
administration.</p><p>Thiamine is effective for prevention and treatment of bovine ketosis, but has been
administered intravenously because it is degraded in the rumen. Our present work suggests
that the three-layered capsule presented here could enable oral administration of thiamine
to cattle, which is easier than intravenous injection on-site. Furthermore, capsules could
be used in cases where the bypass oil method is not available, such as for medical products,
probiotics or transmucosally administered vaccines that have little resistance to heat or
acid. A further study is required for more detailed evaluation of the capacity of
three-layered capsules, such as the escape efficiency of capsules and quantification of the
rumen escape level of contents for clinical veterinary use.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Adaptable and Seamless Technology Transfer
