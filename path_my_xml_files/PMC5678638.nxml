There are no US Food and Drug Administration&#x02212;approved therapies for FSGS, and treatment often fails to reduce proteinuria. Endothelin is an important factor in the pathophysiology of podocyte disorders, including FSGS. Sparsentan is a first-in-class, orally active, dual-acting angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) and highly selective endothelin Type A receptor antagonist. This study is designed to evaluate whether sparsentan lowers proteinuria compared with an ARB alone and has a favorable safety profile in patients with FSGS.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>DUET is a phase 2, randomized, active-control, dose-escalation study with an 8-week, fixed-dose, double-blind period followed by 136 weeks of open-label sparsentan treatment. Patients aged 8&#x000a0;to 75 years with primary FSGS will be randomized to treatment with sparsentan or irbesartan for 8&#x000a0;weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The primary efficacy objective is to test the hypothesis that sparsentan over the dose range&#x000a0;(200&#x000a0;mg, 400 mg, or 800 mg daily) is superior to irbesartan (300 mg daily) in decreasing the&#x000a0;urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPC) from baseline to 8 weeks postrandomization. As secondary objectives, the trial will evaluate the proportion of patients who achieve prespecified targets of UPC&#x000a0;reduction, changes in laboratory and quality-of-life indices, and detailed safety analysis. Analyses will be conducted at the end of the double-blind (week 8) and open-label (week 144) periods.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This study will provide important evidence on whether dual ARB and endothelin blockade&#x000a0;may be an effective therapeutic strategy for FSGS and may provide the rationale for next-phase trials.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>endothelin receptor antagonist</kwd><kwd>focal segmental glomerulosclerosis</kwd><kwd>irbesartan</kwd><kwd>nephrotic syndrome</kwd><kwd>proteinuria</kwd><kwd>sparsentan</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is a histopathological pattern of injury seen in some patients who present with nephrotic syndrome or isolated proteinuria.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> There is a large and heterogeneous group of known causes of FSGS, which are historically classified as primary and secondary.

Initially, only patients aged 18 years or older will be enrolled at the lowest sparsentan dose (200 mg). After 8 patients have completed 4 weeks of treatment, the DMC will perform a safety review and will determine whether the study should continue enrollment.

This randomized, iterative enrollment process will continue until 5 dosing cohorts are fulfilled. Patients whose body weight is 50 kg or less at week 0 will receive a 50% reduction in the allocated sparsentan (i.e., 100 mg, 200&#x000a0;mg, or 400 mg) and irbesartan (i.e.,&#x000a0;150 mg) doses.<fig id="fig2"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Progressive dosing cohorts for the DUET study.

Tertiary efficacy endpoints include changes from baseline in 24-hour urinary protein excretion, serum albumin, serum creatinine levels, eGFR, BP, and lipid profiles. Additionally, changes from baseline in quality of life using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL v4.0, Mapi Research Trust, Lyon, France) questionnaire for patients younger than 18 years<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> and the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire for patients aged 18 years or older will be evaluated.<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></p><p>Efficacy endpoints for the open-label period include the changes from week 8 to week 144 (final visit) in UPC, serum creatinine, eGFR, BP, serum albumin, plasma renin activity, serum endothelin, serum aldosterone, quality of life, and lipid profile parameters. The proportion of patients experiencing a UPC ratio&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;1.5 g/g with &#x0003e;40% reduction from baseline in UPC at each visit during open-label sparsentan treatment will also be evaluated.</p><p>The DUET trial will characterize plasma pharmacokinetics (PK) of sparsentan and irbesartan over the range of doses administered. The PK parameters will be assessed at week 0 (after the initial dose of sparsentan/irbesartan) and week 8, and will include maximum and minimum serum drug concentrations, time of the maximum and minimum drug concentrations, and area under the drug concentration&#x02212;time curve for specified time intervals.</p><p>In addition, blood samples collected for biorepository will be assessed for biomarkers that may become available after the study. These biomarkers may help to elucidate the mechanisms of FSGS disease and treatment. Patients may withdraw consent for use of biorepository samples at any time.</p><p>The safety and tolerability of sparsentan will be assessed by double-blind monitoring of physical parameters, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, and echocardiographic functional parameters, as well as by monitoring of medications required to control extracellular fluid volume, edema, and BP. Patients will be evaluated by investigators for adverse events (AEs) at each study visit and with each contact outside the clinic visits (e.g., telephone calls). AEs will be assessed for severity (mild, moderate, severe) and relationship to study treatment (none, unlikely, possible, related). Medications required for controlling fluid volume, edema, and BP and any dosage changes will be documented. The safety of the study intervention will be monitored periodically by the DMC as described above. If 2 or more patients who receive study drug experience a severe AE within a system organ class that is life-threatening or results in death, and the severe AE is deemed possibly related to treatment by the investigator and/or by Retrophin, the DMC will be notified within 24 hours. The DMC may decide to immediately stop the trial, stop recruitment and dosing, or allow continued recruitment at a lower dose.</p><p>During the double-blind treatment period, clinic visits will occur at weeks 0, 1, 4, and 8.

The efficacy evaluable set (EES) is a subset of the FAS and is defined as all patients who have received at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and have both baseline and week 8 UPC values. The EES will be used for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. The per protocol population is a subset of the EES and excludes patients with major protocol deviations or medication compliance of&#x000a0;&#x02264;80% or&#x000a0;&#x02265;120%. Use of specific disallowed medications and other protocol deviations that exclude patients from the per protocol analysis set will be identified before unblinding the database for the primary analysis. The safety analysis set consists of all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of double-blind study drug and have at least 1 postbaseline safety assessment. For each analysis set, patients will be analyzed based on the treatment that they have received.</p><sec id="sec1.5.1"><title>Primary Efficacy Endpoint and Analyses</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint analyses will be based on the EES and will test the hypothesis that sparsentan is superior to irbesartan in decreasing the UPC in patients with FSGS, as measured by the change from baseline to 8 weeks&#x02019; postrandomization in 24-hour UPC ratios. To reduce skewness, the natural logarithm will be used to transform UPC data before analysis. The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to week 8 in log-transformed values of UPC. An analysis of covariance model will be the primary method of analysis for log (UPC) and other continuous data (measured as change from baseline to week 8), with treatment as a fixed effect and baseline value as a covariate. Results of the analysis will be back-transformed (via exponentiation) to obtain the geometric mean ratio of the UPC values at week 8 to the baseline value and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The values will then be expressed as percentage change in adjusted geometric mean of the UPC for week 8 relative to baseline. Sparsentan doses or their combinations will be compared with irbesartan in the following hierarchical order:<list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>All sparsentan doses (800 mg, 400 mg, and 200 mg) versus irbesartan</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Sparsentan 800-mg and 400-mg dose groups (combined) versus irbesartan</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Sparsentan 400-mg dose versus irbesartan</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Sparsentan 800-mg dose versus irbesartan</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="sec1.5.2"><title>Secondary and Tertiary Endpoints and Analyses</title><p>The calculation of the proportion of patients achieving UPC&#x000a0;&#x02264; 1.5 g/g with 40% reduction in UPC at week 8 will be conducted using the Fisher exact test to compare sparsentan doses, or combinations of doses, with irbesartan, in a manner similar to the primary endpoint. Tertiary endpoints will be based on the EES population. Analyses of change in 24-hour urine protein excretion from baseline to week 8 will mimic those of the primary endpoint. Descriptive statistics for the change from baseline to week 8 in urinary excretion will be displayed. Analysis of covariance models will be fitted and used to compare treatments in the same manner as the primary endpoint analysis.</p><p>Analysis of quality-of-life assessments will be based on the FAS population. Summary statistics per treatment group will be tabulated for SF-36 total scores and each subdomain, and reported as overall scores and&#x000a0;&#x02265;5-point improvement in SF-36 physical or mental component scores. Summary statistics will be provided for PedsQL scores by visit and the change from baseline to subsequent visits.</p><p>Analyses of changes from baseline in serum albumin and changes from baseline in lipid profile (i.e., total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) will be based on the FAS. Data will be presented as descriptive statistics with 95% confidence intervals for mean change from baseline for all sparsentan doses, mean change from baseline for all irbesartan doses, and the difference in mean changes from baseline for all sparsentan and all irbesartan groups. If confidence intervals indicate that there may be treatment differences with respect to 1 or more of these endpoints, the specific endpoint will be analyzed further using a mixed-effect model, repeated-measures analysis.</p><p>Subgroup analysis will be performed on patient subgroups of the EES, including age (patients aged &#x0003e;18 years vs. patients aged&#x000a0;&#x02264;18 years), race, baseline UPC ratio for nephrotic (UPC&#x000a0;&#x02265; 3.5 g/g) versus nonnephrotic (UPC&#x000a0;&#x0003c; 3.5 g/g) patients, gender, and baseline severity of kidney disease (eGFR &#x0003e; 90, 60&#x02013;90, 45&#x02013;60, and 30&#x02013;45 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), and BP.

Tabulations will be similar to those produced for the double-blind period, with an extended-visit schedule.</p><p>Due to the relatively low numbers of patients per site, no site-specific analyses will be conducted, and no&#x000a0;adjustments will be made for individual sites. All analyses will be performed using pooled data across all study sites.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5.4"><title>Unblinding Considerations</title><p>The only planned analysis of unblinded data during the ongoing study is for the purpose of the DMC&#x02019;s review of accumulating safety data. A limited number of preidentified individuals from the contract research organization responsible for the interim analysis will have access to unblinded data to prepare a safety output for the DMC review; this team will be independent of the project team and will not have access to ongoing data management activities. If a patient&#x02019;s information needs to be unblinded for a medical emergency, the sites have an interactive Web response system unblinding manual that instructs them how to unblind a patient after consulting with the sponsor. If an event requires unblinding to comply with regulatory reporting requirements for a suspected, unexpected serious adverse reaction, this process is outlined in the safety management plan for the study. After database lock for the study, appropriate study team members will be unblinded, as outlined in a pre-established unblinding plan.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5.5"><title>Sample Size and Power Calculations</title><p>The study plan is to enroll 100 patients at a 3:1 sparsentan-to-irbesartan ratio, yielding 15, 30, and 30 patients in the sparsentan 200-mg, 400-mg, and 800-mg groups, respectively, and 25 patients in the irbesartan group. A cohort may be expanded to enroll additional patients (no more than 2 times the original size), and/or additional cohorts at doses&#x000a0;&#x02265; 800 mg may be added to better assess the safety and tolerability profile of sparsentan.</p><p>Based on published observations in proteinuric patients with type 2 diabetes<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> treated with baseline RASI and add-on ET receptor antagonist, the mean reduction in UPC (expressed as the ratio of geometric means) is expected to be at least 20% greater with sparsentan compared with irbesartan (i.e., mean reduction of 40% vs. 20%). This difference represents a geometric mean ratio of 2.0. To calculate the study power, ratios were explored in the range of 1.25 to 2.5, in the original units, using a Student <italic>t</italic> test (2-sided &#x003b1;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05) of log-transformed UPC values for sparsentan and irbesartan. Under a range of assumptions for the variability in UPC, the study has approximately 64% to 76% power to demonstrate the expected difference between sparsentan and irbesartan (e.g., 40% vs. 20% reduction in UPC). The study power will be adequate if the high doses of sparsentan have a marked effect on UPC (i.e., more than double the average percent reduction compared with irbesartan), but smaller effects may not reach statistical significance. In this scenario, analysis of combined sparsentan dose groups compared with the irbesartan group (n&#x000a0;= 25) will provide enhanced power to detect the same difference in UPC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1.6"><title>Strategies for Achieving Adequate Participant Enrollment</title><p>As with all rare diseases, recruitment for clinical trials is a challenge. Recruitment for DUET will rely on the existing pool of patients at individual participating sites. To enhance enrollment, information about the trial will be disseminated via patient advocacy groups (e.g., NephCure Kidney International, King of Prussia, PA), recruitment vendors (e.g., Matthew&#x02019;s Medical Group), social media, and a study website.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Discussion</title><p>Currently there is no US Food and Drug Administration&#x02212;approved therapy for FSGS. This unmet clinical need has put a premium on the development of safe, well-tolerated nephroprotective agents. Initial experience with ET antagonists as derived from the results of A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes (ASCEND) trial in diabetic nephropathy<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> has been disappointing because of the clinical limitations and disabling AEs, such as worsening edema and anemia, that prevented widespread application despite demonstrable reduction in proteinuria. More recent short-term studies with another ERA, atrasentan, have shown a more favorable profile at lower dose ranges together with significant add-on effect on proteinuria reduction in type 2 diabetic patients.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, the long-term nephroprotective potential of atrasentan is not known and is currently being established in an ongoing Study of Diabetic Nephropathy with Atrasentan (SONAR) trial in type 2 diabetic patients with proteinuria.</p><p>DUET is the first study to evaluate the antiproteinuric effects and long-term safety of a dual angiotensin II and ET 1 antagonist in the nondiabetic context of primary FSGS. Evaluation of the effects on proteinuria will be specifically important in primary FSGS, a podocytopathy in which changes in proteinuria are critical in disease pathogenesis and course.</p><p>It is important to recognize the potential limitations of the DUET trial. The intended sample size is modest, and the study cohort may not reflect the diversity of patients affected by FSGS. Although participating sites are encouraged to recruit every eligible patient, which should include a representative distribution of patient demography, the study sample size will not support ancestry-stratified analysis. The protocol does not include assessment of proteinuria after discontinuation of drug treatment; therefore, it will not be possible to definitively ascertain the degree to which beneficial effects of sparsentan endure beyond the treatment period. The double-blind treatment phase is only 8&#x000a0;weeks in duration. However, as outlined above, the option for patients to participate in the open-label phase will enable collection of data to assess the effect of sparsentan on proteinuria for a more extended period and to clarify the safety profile. Potential unintended consequences of sparsentan use include exacerbation of edema, increased incidence of anemia and heart failure, and adverse effects on acid&#x02212;base balance. Careful follow-up of the study cohort with surveillance for these and other unanticipated adverse effects will be essential before sparsentan can be considered for routine use in patients with FSGS.</p><p>Overall, this phase 2, randomized, double-blind, active control FSGS clinical trial will test the efficacy and safety of the dual ARB-ETA compared with ARB alone for the control of FSGS in children and adults. In addition to double-blind evaluation of antiproteinuric effects of sparsentan over the period of 8 weeks, the long-term, open-label treatment will provide information on sparsentan safety and clinically relevant outcomes, namely prevention of increased serum creatinine concentration and progression to ESRD. Sparsentan may be the first agent acting as an endothelin antagonist that is suitable for extended use as a nephroprotective agent. This would be especially notable in patients with a glomerular disease such as FSGS who are susceptible to edema as part of their clinical phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>Disclosure</title><p>DSG, PN, SA, TS, KEM, VKD, KEM, PP, and HT are investigators for the DUET study.
