However, conventional mechanical plaque control is often difficult for these patients because of the pain or the risk of aspiration. Although antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT), which is considered an alternative or adjunct to mechanical approaches, has potential application as a less stressful method of daily plaque control, no clinical application of this technique has been reported.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated the inhibitory effect of a combination of toluidine blue O (TBO), and a red light-emitting diode (LED) on dental plaque formation in healthy volunteers. The optimal concentration of TBO was determined in preliminary <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments to evaluate the bactericidal effect of aPDT on <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic> and to clarify its safety in fibroblast cells. To survey the mechanism of TBO-mediated aPDT, the quality and quantity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during aPDT were also examined using electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. Subsequently, the inhibitory effect of aPDT on dental plaque formation was investigated in eleven subjects as a clinical pilot study. The right or left mandibular premolars were randomly assigned to the treatment (with aPDT) or control (without aPDT) groups. In total, aPDT was applied six times (twice per day) to the teeth in the test group over a period of four days. On the fourth day, the study concluded and the analyses were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A combination of 500 or 1000 &#x003bc;g/ml TBO and LED irradiation for 20 s significantly decreased the number of colony forming units of <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic>. The cytotoxicity of aPDT was comparable to that of standard antiseptics used in the oral cavity. Hydroxyl radicals were detected by ESR analysis, but singlet oxygen was not. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated that aPDT with 1000 &#x003bc;g/ml TBO and red LED irradiation significantly suppressed dental plaque formation without harming teeth or the surrounding tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>aPDT has the potential to be a promising novel technical modality for dental plaque control.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This trial was registered with University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr.cgi?function=brows&#x00026;action=brows&#x00026;type=summary&#x00026;recptno=R000010490&#x00026;language=E">UMIN000012504</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/1472-6831-14-152) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy</kwd><kwd>Red light emitting diode</kwd><kwd>Toluidine blue O</kwd><kwd>Dental plaque control</kwd><kwd>Hydroxyl radical</kwd><kwd>Randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) is a procedure in which oxygen-dependent activation of a photosensitizer by light (mainly lasers) leads to the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recently, this procedure was introduced in the medical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and dental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] fields. Besides confirmation of its antimicrobial potential <italic>in vitro</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], prior clinical studies have evaluated the application of aPDT for the treatment of acne vulgaris in dermatology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and of periodontal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], endodontic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and peri-implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] disease in dentistry. Further, since it uses light-generated compounds, aPDT may be able to eradicate multidrug-resistant bacteria without influencing the emergence of further resistance in those bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Increasing evidence exists that oral care is critical for systemic health, especially in compromised patients. Previously, Yoneyama <italic>et al</italic>. reported that good oral care lowers the risk of pneumonia and the rate of mortality in elderly institutionalized individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Abe <italic>et al</italic>. also suggested that oral hygiene was effective in the prevention of influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has recommended that &#x0201c;all cancer patients should have an oral examination before the initiation of cancer therapy, and the treatment of preexisting or concomitant oral disease is essential in minimizing oral complications in all cancer patients&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Conventionally, mechanical tools such as a toothbrush, dental floss, or sponge brush accomplish the removal of dental bacterial plaque. However, mechanical plaque control is technically demanding, and can be physically stressful for subjects with a decreased range of arm motion, or a medical condition that impedes them from maintaining good oral hygiene. Therefore, the application of a non-mechanical means for controlling dental plaque formation could be of wide interest.</p><p>In 1993, Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] proposed aPDT as an alternative to pharmaceutical and mechanical means of eliminating dental bacterial plaque. However, there are no clinical reports on the use of aPDT as a preventive oral care method for the control of dental plaque formation. If aPDT could be used as a novel method to control dental plaque formation, patients may be able to receive efficient oral care without the unpleasant stresses that accompany conventional mechanical tooth cleaning, such as bleeding or pain.</p><p>Accordingly, we aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects of aPDT in the oral cavity of healthy volunteers as a pilot study, prior to the clinical trial involving actual patients. We focused on toluidine blue O (TBO), which is a classic photosensitizer of phenothiazinium salt, because its bactericidal effects were already clarified in previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], as well as in the treatment of periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Further, the bactericidal effects of TBO-mediated aPDT using high-power red light-emitting diode (LED) on two typical periodontopathic bacteria, <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, have also been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Before the pilot study in healthy volunteers, the antimicrobial effects of aPDT on <italic>Streptococcus oralis (S. oralis),</italic> one of the typical facultative anaerobic bacterium in human dental plaque, and the cytotoxic effect of aPDT on fibroblasts, were examined <italic>in vitro</italic>. Further, the characterization of ROS generated during aPDT treatment was investigated by electron spin resonance (ESR).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Experiment 1: <italic>In vitro</italic>evaluation of bactericidal effects of aPDT on <italic>Streptococcus oralis</italic></title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Preparation of bacterial planktonic suspension</title><p><italic>S. oralis</italic> OMZ 607 was maintained on blood agar plates (E-MP23; Eiken Chemical Co.

In total, aPDT was applied six times (twice per day, once in the morning, and once in the evening) to the test group teeth for four days. During the trial period, the participants were prohibited from brushing the premolar and the adjacent teeth, and from using mouthwash. On the fourth day, the study concluded and analyses were performed.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>

The lingual photographs were taken with a mirror designed especially for mandibular lingual photography (Photographic Mirror ST for Lingual 13262, YDM Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The red color-stained area of dental plaque deposition, as well as the area of the whole tooth surface on the buccal and lingual sides, was determined on the photographs using a software program (Photoshop CS5 Extended; Adobe Systems Inc., CA). To reduce interobserver variability, the determination of the areas was performed independently for each site by two examiners blinded to the experimental groups (A. A. and Y.

The percentage of the area of plaque deposition relative to the total tooth surface was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Determination of the number of bacteria in dental plaque collected from the lingual surface of second premolars</title><p>The lingual surface of the second premolars was selected as the representative site for plaque collection, because the lingual surface usually has more constant plaque accumulation than the buccal surface, and the second premolar has a larger lingual surface than the first premolar. Supragingival plaque samples were collected with a Gracey curette from the lingual surface of the second premolar prior to treatment (baseline), and 4&#x000a0;days after completion of the clinical trial by blinded examiners (A.

The number of bacteria was measured using a bacterial counter available at the chair side (Rapid oral bacteria detection apparatus; Panasonic Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) that was suitable for rapidly counting a large number of bacteria. The counter device employed the dielectrophoretic impedance measurement method, which has been reported to demonstrate a good correlation with the conventional culture method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data from the first experiment were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Dunnett&#x02019;s test.

Further, this study confirmed that TBO with red LED effectively reduced the bacteria <italic>S. oralis,</italic> which is known as an initial colonizer in dental plaque formation, and is often detected in the blood of patients who suffer from infectious endocarditis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The use of TBO with a high-power LED device and a 20&#x000a0;s irradiation time, led to a significant dose-dependent reduction in CFUs <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, the reduction was less when 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml TBO (final concentration of 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) was used than when 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml (final concentration of 250&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) was applied. A possible explanation was the fact that the blue-colored 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml TBO mixed bacterial solution was too dark for the red light to penetrate through the solution to the bottom of the 96-well plate, and thus the sensitization of TBO by LED irradiation was potentially blocked. Nonetheless, 1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml TBO was used because in clinical situations, the immediate dilution of TBO with saliva and its superficial spread on the tooth surface could lead to the more efficient light sensitization of TBO than witnessed <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the present study, the focus was only on <italic>S. oralis</italic>; however, the formation of dental biofilm consists of different primary colonizers and complex inter-microbial interactions. Therefore, several other plaque forming bacteria including <italic>Actinomyces viscosus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus sanguis</italic> should be investigated in future studies.</p><p>With respect to the safety of the procedure, TBO alone negatively influenced the viability of fibroblasts in a concentration-dependent manner, and the application of LED enhanced the affect. However, the <italic>in vitro</italic> reduction in cell viability under the present aPDT conditions (1000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml TBO with 20&#x000a0;s LED irradiation) did not exceed that observed with other antiseptics, which indicated that the cytotoxicity of aPDT was within the conventional levels. Additionally, although prior reports have indicated the resistance of bacteria to antiseptics such as benzalkonium chloride, which is a quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant that interrupts the lipid membrane of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the lack of bacterial resistance following application of aPDT would be another benefit in clinical application [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In the present study, however, we only observed acute cytotoxicity at 2&#x000a0;h after single application of aPDT, and thus further studies are required to investigate the long-term influence of aPDT on cell proliferation, as well as the cumulative action following repeated applications.</p><p>The analysis of ROS generated during TBO-mediated aPDT resulted in the novel finding that the hydroxyl radical was the primary product. Although the mechanism of aPDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] is generally thought to take place by a Type I process, which produces a hydroxyl radical by electron transfer, or a Type II process, which yields singlet oxygen by energy transfer, no modality of cell death by TBO-mediated aPDT has been clarified. Singlet oxygen is regarded as the major damaging species in aPDT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], and the common photosensitizer methylene blue is a known producer of singlet oxygen. In our previous pilot study (data not shown), we confirmed the production of singlet oxygen in methylene blue-mediated aPDT. However, ESR analysis clearly revealed that the hydroxyl radical was the predominant product of TBO-mediated aPDT. Further, Type I machinery was speculated to play an important role in this aPDT procedure.</p><p>Following the results of the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, we attempted the clinical application of aPDT for the inhibition of dental plaque formation, and observed a significant suppression of plaque deposition on teeth treated with aPDT. The four day duration of the clinical trial was short, and thus a longer duration was desirable. However, the duration of this pilot study was limited to four days, due to consideration of the physical and mental stresses caused by prohibiting tooth brushing, and the concerns of volunteer dentists regarding the occurrence of tooth decay and gingival inflammation.</p><p>Regarding the mechanism of aPDT, a recent proteomic approach by Dosselli <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] revealed that aPDT delays the growth of bacteria, and reduces the capacity of bacteria for glucose consumption. Combined, the bacterial killing effect and the retardation of bacterial growth with aPDT could reduce plaque deposition on teeth.</p><p>Nonetheless, the negative aspects of the clinical use of aPDT should be considered. Some reports have noted tooth staining with TBO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], however, residual staining of teeth and gingival tissue with TBO after the aPDT procedure was not visible, and did not present a problem in this clinical trial. Additionally, light energy has a biological effect on the activations of cells and tissues. Therefore, various positive and negative effects of the irradiation of teeth and gingival tissues, such as reducing gingival inflammation or inducing the calcification of dental pulp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], need to be clarified. In particular, although the performance of aPDT was only short term in this present study, more attention to the cumulative action of potential side effects should be paid in the long-term repeated usage for daily plaque control.</p><p>Additionally, in this clinical trial, the reduction rate in the plaque-deposition area was on average no more than approximately 56% following aPDT treatments, probably because the susceptibility of bacteria to aPDT was thought to be much lower in biofilms than in the planktonic condition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Hence, modification of the system for delivery of the photosensitizer into the biofilm should be examined for the effective enhancement of the inhibitory effects of aPDT on dental plaque formation. An example of a possible modification is the use of an antibody conjugated to photosensitizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Similarly, the optimal power and time of LED irradiation, in combination with the frequency of aPDT procedure, should be clarified. In addition, the present pilot study was limited by the employment of healthy volunteer dentists as subjects, as well as by the small number of participants and the short duration of the clinical trial. Consequently, further investigations involving suitable conditions for clinical plaque control in a larger number of subjects and for a longer trial duration are required to confirm the safe and effective aPDT procedure compared with conventional treatments. In the future, aPDT could be used for plaque control at an office equipped with a specific appliance, or at home with the combination of tooth paste containing a photosensitizer and a light-emitting toothbrush [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The application of aPDT significantly suppressed the formation of dental plaque, which indicated that aPDT may be a promising alternative or adjunct method to mechanical means in dental plaque control for oral care. This study provides initial data on a potentially new approach, and thus further validation to determine optimum conditions including dye concentration, the modification of dye application, the light power, and the frequency of the procedure, as well as any potential adverse effects, are required in order to establish a safe and effective aPDT procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec26"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="12903_2014_483_MOESM1_ESM.zip"><caption><p>Additional file 1:
