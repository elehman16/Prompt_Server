Any change in the musculoskeletal system&#x02019;s biomechanics, especially in the feet and ankles, will strongly influence the biomechanics of runners, possibly predisposing them to injuries. A thorough understanding of the effects of a therapeutic approach focused on feet biomechanics, on strength and functionality of lower limb muscles will contribute to the adoption of more effective therapeutic and preventive strategies for runners.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>A randomized, prospective controlled and parallel trial with blind assessment is designed to study the effects of a "ground-up" therapeutic approach focused on the foot-ankle complex as it relates to the incidence of running-related injuries in the lower limbs. One hundred and eleven (111) healthy long-distance runners will be randomly assigned to either a control (CG) or intervention (IG) group. IG runners will participate in a therapeutic exercise protocol for the foot-ankle for 8&#x000a0;weeks, with 1 directly supervised session and 3 remotely supervised sessions per week. After the 8-week period, IG runners will keep exercising for the remaining 10&#x000a0;months of the study, supervised only by web-enabled software three times a week. At baseline, 2&#x000a0;months, 4&#x000a0;months and 12&#x000a0;months, all runners will be assessed for running-related injuries (primary outcome), time for the occurrence of the first injury, foot health and functionality, muscle trophism, intrinsic foot muscle strength, dynamic foot arch strain and lower-limb biomechanics during walking and running (secondary outcomes).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This is the first randomized clinical trial protocol to assess the effect of an exercise protocol that was designed specifically for the foot-and-ankle complex on running-related injuries to the lower limbs of long-distance runners. We intend to show that the proposed protocol is an innovative and effective approach to decreasing the incidence of injuries. We also expect a lengthening in the time of occurrence of the first injury, an improvement in foot function, an increase in foot muscle mass and strength and beneficial biomechanical changes while running and walking after a year of exercising.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02306148">NCT02306148</ext-link> (November 28, 2014) under the name &#x0201c;<italic>Effects of Foot Strengthening on the Prevalence of Injuries in Long Distance Runners</italic>&#x0201d;.

Although popular worldwide due to its low cost, versatility, convenience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and health benefits to people of all ages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], running is associated with a high prevalence of lower extremity injuries (between 19.4 and 79.3&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The occurrence of injuries limits the intended benefits by inducing changes in practice habits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] or temporary or even permanent cessation of running. In addition, injuries lead to increased costs due to medical treatment and/or work absence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The understanding of risk factors associated with these injuries, particularly the intrinsic factors, can provide important benefits for runners. Among these intrinsic factors, those that are noteworthy include biomechanical factors and muscle functionality of the lower extremities, particularly the feet. A systematic review by van der Worp et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] included 11 high-quality longitudinal studies and concluded that alterations in the biomechanical force distribution patterns, amount of training, history of previous injuries, increased index of the navicular drop, and the misalignment of the ankle, knee, and hip are among the main intrinsic risk factors for running-related injuries. In addition, extrinsic factors such as the training surface and the type of footwear are also relevant risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is noteworthy that out of these seven diverse risk factors, two are related to the foot-ankle complex, demonstrating the importance of maintaining the health and functionality of its musculoskeletal structures to prevent injuries. It is also believed that any biomechanical alteration in the musculoskeletal system, in particular the foot-ankle complex, broadly influences a runner&#x02019;s functionality, predisposing him/her to a lesser or greater extent to injuries, in addition to the possibility of compromising his/her quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The foot has a complex structure that can perform a broad variety of functions in different postural and dynamic tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. This versatility can only be achieved through its unique arch-shaped architecture and its powerful intrinsic and extrinsic muscular activity, which is responsible for the maintenance and control of foot arches, postural corrections during disturbances, and torque generation during body displacement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Even with this unique and specialized structure, a high prevalence of injuries associated with running practices occurs in this complex. Among the most common hypotheses used to explain this high prevalence are factors such as the excessive ankle/foot pronation in the stance phase of running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], the lowering of the medial longitudinal arch due to navicular drop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], the alteration of rigidity of the plantar arches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and the increase in impact and acceleration of the tibia during running [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests the importance of the intrinsic foot musculature, showing that fatigue can cause a significant increase in pronation, which is evaluated by the navicular drop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In addition, weakness may be a risk factor for falls in the elderly population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is understandable that the specific training of foot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and ankle muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] is an important tool that improves functions and functionalities of the lower extremities, as has been shown in recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>In one of those studies, the unsupervised practice of a single exercise for the feet (short-foot exercise) four times a week promoted a decrease in the navicular drop, an increase in the medial longitudinal arch index, and an increase in the functionality quality of the intrinsic foot muscles in asymptomatic individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. These results were maintained 1 month after the training had been completed. Although the results of Mulligan and Cook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] are promising, they only measured the foot function in static conditions and the unsupervised practice of an isolated exercise for 4 weeks may not have been sufficient to cause a transfer of the static gains for a more dynamic task where the foot would be more robustly utilized, according to the star excursion balance test. In contrast, one study compared two groups: one group performed a 4-week period of short-foot exercises, including 100 repetitions for five seconds each, and the second group performed a 4-week period of towel-curl exercises with the same amount of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. This controlled study showed that both groups exhibited decreased displacement of the centre of pressure during the modified star excursion test. Therefore, a load increase in the same exercises used by Mulligan and Cook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] resulted in positive effects for postural control.</p><p>The same short-foot exercise was practiced by individuals with flat feet in a randomized controlled trial to investigate its effect on the use of foot orthoses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The protocol consisted of three to five sets of exercises with five repetitions each, twice a day, for 8 weeks. In both study groups, the isometric force and the transversal section area of the abductor hallucis muscle were increased after the interventions, with a significant increase in the group that used orthoses during exercises. These results demonstrated that even in structurally unfavourable conditions, exercise for the foot muscles leads to important strength gains. It is noteworthy that even with a well-planned intervention, the lack of a control group and the evaluation of the muscle strength alone limit the study conclusions. In addition, the study did not take into account the potential clinical and functional changes of the plantar arches, as performed by Goldmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This group of researchers investigated the effects of the hallucis flexors strengthening in the kinetic and kinematic of foot and ankle during walking, running, and vertical jumping among university athletes. Training of the experimental group consisted of isometric contractions of the hallucis flexors at 90&#x000a0;% of the maximum voluntary contraction using a dynamometer four times a week for 7 weeks. The authors observed a significant increase in the performance of vertical jumping and extensor and flexor momentum of the metatarsal-phalangeal joint and a gain of 60 to 70&#x000a0;% in the strength of the hallucis flexors. This study shows that the flexor muscles of the foot respond in a quick and intense manner to training; even for simple training, the strengthening of the muscles in question results in global kinematic and kinetic alterations. It would still be interesting to determine how long these gains would last after the completion of the intervention and whether more elaborate training, involving more muscles and different postures and loads, would alter the study outcome, especially with regard to foot biomechanics during locomotor tasks.</p><p>The understanding of the effects of a therapeutic approach focused on the foot biomechanics of walking and running, on the strength and functionality of lower extremity muscles will contribute to the adoption of more effective therapeutic and preventive strategies for runners. However, no evidence exists that supports the efficacy of the therapeutic exercises already used and recommended for the health of the feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] with regard to preventing recurrent injuries in long-distance runners. However, one research protocol aims to assess the effects of ankle and hip muscle strengthening and functional balance training on running mechanics, postural control, and injury incidence in novice runners with less than 1 year of running experience but without focusing on the intervention of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the feet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, a controlled and randomized clinical trial would determine whether these interventions are efficacious by using the incidence of running-related injuries as the primary outcome and following both intervention and control subjects during a period of time equal to or greater than 1 year (the period during which the incidence and prevalence of these injuries are reported) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>It is important to highlight that rehabilitation programs rarely include the intrinsic muscles of the feet in their therapeutic protocols. The present proposal uses a new paradigm in which the focus of training and preventive interventions in runners is a &#x0201c;ground-up&#x0201d; approach rather than the traditional "top-down" approach, which focuses on the hip strengthening. This new approach, advocated by Baltich et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], will seek to improve the function of the ankle-foot complex, which is directly associated with the absortion and transmission of body forces to the ground and vice-versa during running.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Hypotheses</title><p>Our hypotheses are that the therapeutic exercise protocol for the foot-ankle as practiced by long-distance recreational runners for 1 year will:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>H 1.

Each domain scores from 0 to 100 points, where 100 is the best condition and 0 the worst.</p><p>We will access variations in foot posture of the runners using the Foot Posture Index (FPI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The FPI is a six component measures that allows multiple segment evaluation of foot posture on a static measurement and requires that subjects stand in their relaxed stance position looking straight ahead while the assessment is in process. The assessment consists on the (1) palpation of the talar head, (2) observation of supra and infra malleolar curvature, (3) observation of the calcaneal frontal plane position, (4) observation of the bulging in the region of the talo-navicular joint, (5) observation of the height and congruence of the medial longitudinal arch and (6) presence of abduction or adduction of the forefoot. Scores reaching from -12 to +12 and normative values are presented on the literature.</p><p>Subjects will then be assessed for intrinsic foot muscles strength, lower-limb running kinematics and kinetics, and dynamic foot-arch strain. The feet of 30&#x000a0;% of the participants in each group (41 participants) will be imaged by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess trophism and strength of the foot intrinsic muscles; this will be scheduled for the same week of each subject&#x02019;s baseline measurements.</p><p>After baseline assessment, all subjects will be scheduled for two follow-ups assessments, one at 8&#x000a0;weeks and the other at 16&#x000a0;weeks. They will maintain contact with the Researcher 3 through the follow-up period by the web software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], e-mail and telephone.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Running-related injuries</title><p>Running-related injuries will be assessed initially at the baseline and will be assessed continually throughout the study by the web software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The definition of running-related injury was set according to the study of Macera et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They stated that any musculoskeletal pain or injury that was caused by running practice and that induces changes in the form, duration intensity or frequency of training for at least 1 week will be considered a running-related injury. Only lower-limb injuries will be accounted during the 12-month period after the baseline assessment; both the incidence and time of occurrence of the first injury will be analyzed.</p><p>If any subject presents a new injury during his or her participation in the study, the injury will be accounted for and the intervention or placebo intervention will be discontinued, even though all subjects will still keep being followed for the completion of the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Isometric intrinsic foot muscles strength</title><p>Strength of the foot&#x02019;s intrinsic muscles will be assessed in trials using a pressure platform (EMED: Novel, Germany) on which the subjects will place their dominant foot while standing with knees extended. They will push down as hard as possible using only their hallux and toes, particularly the metatarsophalangeal joints and not the hallux interphalangeal joint. A physiotherapist will determine whether the subject lifted the heel, and inspect fluctuations in the line of gravity and trunk posture during each trial. If any changes are observed in the line of gravity or positioning of the heel or trunk, the trial will be excluded. Three trials will be completed on each foot (left and right) according to Mickle et al. (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Maximum force will be normalized by body weight and analyzed for hallux and toes areas separately.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Foot muscle trophism and strength</title><p>One indirect method of measuring foot strength is through MRI, which, combined with other techniques, offers good reliability and a way to follow changes in muscular volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, MRI can facilitate understanding the etiology of running-related injuries and rehabilitation of the foot-ankle complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>The MRI of the foot will be performed with a 1.5&#x000a0;T system. Foot images will be acquired by the same technician using a coil of four channels positioned in the magnetic centre. Participants will be placed in supine position with the ankle at 45&#x000b0; of plantar flexion inside the coil. Images will be acquired in the frontal, sagittal and transverse planes to confirm the position of the feet, and the subject will be repositioned if necessary. T1-weighted images of the entire foot length will be acquired perpendicular to the plantar aspect of the foot using a spin-echo sequence (repetition time&#x02009;=&#x02009;500&#x000a0;ms, echo time&#x02009;=&#x02009;16&#x000a0;ms, averages&#x02009;=&#x02009;3, slice thickness&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x000a0;mm, gap between slices&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x000a0;mm, field of view&#x02009;=&#x02009;120&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;120&#x000a0;mm, flip angle&#x02009;=&#x02009;90&#x000b0;, matrix&#x02009;=&#x02009;512&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;512) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The set of images will cover the distance between the most proximal and most distal images in which every intrinsic foot muscle is visible.</p><p>To assess changes in the cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume of the intrinsic foot muscles, 30&#x000a0;% of the subjects from each group will have MRI of the foot at three times: baseline, 8&#x000a0;weeks and 16&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p>The CSA will be measured by ImageJ planimeter software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Following, Miller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] for each muscle at each slice and muscle volume will be calculated by multiplying the CSA of all slices for a muscle by their linear distance (4&#x000a0;mm) and adding these volumes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Walking and running biomechanics</title><p>To ensure maximum reliability, all biomechanical testing sessions will be completed by the same researcher.</p><p>Gait and running kinematics will be acquired using three-dimensional displacements of passive reflective markers (10&#x000a0;mm in diameter) tracked by nine infrared cameras at 100&#x000a0;Hz (OptiTrack FLEX: V100, Natural Point, Corvallis, OR, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Some 14 markers will be placed on the right subject&#x02019;s foot according to Leardini&#x02019;s protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Extra markers will be placed at the medial knee joint line, lateral knee joint line and bilaterally at the iliac spine antero-superior, superior aspect of the greater trochanter, and sacrum. These markers will be used to determine relative joint centres of rotation for the longitudinal axis of the foot, ankle and knee. The extra markers from the medial aspect of the knee joint line will be removed during the dynamic trial. In addition, three non-collinear reflective markers will be fixed at two technique clusters. One of the clusters will be placed in the lateral thigh and the other over the shank.</p><p>The laboratory coordinate system will be established at one corner of the force plate and all initial calculations will be based on this coordinate system. Each lower-limb segment (shank and thigh), will be modelled based on surface markers as a rigid body with a local coordinate system that coincides with the anatomical axes. Translations and rotations of each segment will be reported relative to the neutral positions defined during the initial static standing trial. All joints will be considered to be spherical (i.e., with three rotational degrees of freedom). The foot will be modeled according to Leardini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. That is, the calcaneus, mid-foot and metatarsus are considered rigid bodies and the longitudinal axis of the first, second and fifth metatarsal bones and proximal phalanx of the hallux will be tracked independently.</p><p>Ground reaction forces will be acquired by a force plate (AMTI OR-6-1000, Watertown, MA, USA) with a sampling frequency of 1&#x000a0;kHz embedded in the centre of the walkway. Force and kinematic data acquisition will be synchronized and sampled by an A/D card (AMTI, DT 3002, 12 bits).</p><p>The subjects will go through a habituation period before the data acquisition to establish confidence and comfort in the laboratory environment, and to ensure appropriate movement velocity. To assess lower-extremity running mechanics, subjects will perform 10 valid over-ground walking trials and 10 valid over-ground running trials at a constant velocity (9.5&#x000a0;km/h to 10.5&#x000a0;km/s); these will be monitored by two photoelectrical sensors (Speed Test Fit Model, Nova Odessa, Brazil).</p><p>The automatic digitizing process, 3D reconstruction of the markers&#x02019; positions and filtering of kinematic data will be performed using AMASS software (C-motion, Kingston, ON, Canada). Kinematic data will be processed using a zero-lag second-order low-pass filter with cutoff frequencies of 6Hz for walking and 12&#x000a0;Hz for running<bold>.</bold> Ground reaction force data will be processed using a zero-lag low-pass Butterworth fourth-order filter with cutoff frequencies of 50Hz for walking and 200&#x000a0;Hz for running.</p><p>A bottom-up inverse dynamics method will be used to calculate the net moments in the sagittal and frontal planes of the ankle and knee joints using Visual3D software (C-motion, Kingston, ON, Canada). The human body will be modeled by three linked segments (foot, shank and thigh) and the inertial properties will be based on Dempster&#x02019;s standard regression equations. The moment of inertia and location of center of mass will be computed assuming the thigh and shank segments as cylinders.</p><p>Calculation of all variables will be performed using a custom-written MATLAB function (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). Data of only one lower limb (randomly chosen) per subject will be analyzed and compared.</p><p>The following ankle kinematic variables will be analysed: maximum dorsiflexion at foot contact, maximum plantarflexion, maximum dorsiflexion at the toe-off and dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) in the sagittal plane during the stance phase. The knee kinematic variables are: maximum flexion at foot contact, maximum extension, maximum flexion in the stance phase, ROM on sagittal plane, maximum abduction and adduction in the stance phase. The foot kinematic variables are: elevation/drop of the longitudinal arch angle and of the first, second and fifth metatarsal bones; rearfoot to forefoot rotation; transverse plane angle between first and second metatarsal bones and between second and fifth metatarsal bones; and maximum inversion and eversion of the calcaneus (frontal plane).</p><p>The ankle and knee kinetic variables to be analysed are net ankle and knee moments normalized by body weight times height and power normalized by body weight in the sagittal plane. The ground reaction force variables will be normalized by body weight and are as followings: first peak force (body weight &#x02013; BW), second peak (BW), loading rate 80 [N/ms], defined as the force rate between 20 and 80&#x000a0;% of the contact of the foot with the ground during the first peak; loading rate 100 [N/ms], as determined by the force rate between 0 and 100&#x000a0;% of the first peak and push-off rate [N/ms], as defined as the rate of the second peak force, between the minimal values until the second peak.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Dynamic longitudinal foot arch strain</title><p>The dynamic longitudinal foot arch strain will be measured according to Liebermann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The measurement involves navicular height (NH), which is the minimum distance from the navicular tuberosity relative to the line formed by the first metatarsal head and the medial process of the calcaneus. These three landmarks form a plane and NH is independent of rear-foot inversion or eversion. Arch strain can also be quantified by fitting a parabola to markers (with the navicular head as the vertex) and then measuring the average curvature at 100 points evenly spaced along the curve.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>The primary outcome measurement will be the incidence of running-related injuries in the lower limbs accounted at the end of 12&#x000a0;months of study.</p><p>The secondary outcomes will be: 1) the time of the occurrence of the first injury along the study period (time to event); 2) foot health and functionality (change from baseline); 3) foot, ankle and knee kinematics, ankle and knee joint moments, and knee and ankle power during walking and running (change from baseline); 4) strength of the intrinsic foot muscles (change from baseline); 5) foot muscle trophism (change from baseline); and 6) dynamic foot arch strain (change from baseline).</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Interventions</title><p>Runners allocated to the IG will receive a foot-ankle therapeutic exercise protocol for strengthening and improving functionality. Part of the exercise protocol (12 exercises) is to be performed once a week under the supervision of a physiotherapist for 8&#x000a0;weeks (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1).

Data regarding the subjects running practice, such as training volume, time of practice and occurrence of injuries, will be reported to the web software, which will summarize it and make it viewable in the users&#x02019; area. In addition, for the duration of the study, runners' responses in the web software concerning their foot-ankle exercise practice and running training will be stored and be accessible to the researchers and subjects at any time. If any subject fails to log in to the web software for more than five consecutive days, an e-mail will be automatically be sent, asking the subject to log in to his or her account and report data on the training (or lack of it) for the past week. The physiotherapist responsible for the therapeutic protocol will make phone contact with subjects who fail to attend to any of the weekly locally supervised sessions. They will also make phone contact with subjects who do not respond to e-mail reminders from the web software.

Runners will be informed about the anonymity and this form will only be accessed after completion of the study.</p><p>For the duration of the trial, subjects will be advised not to engage in any new physical activity or preventive training protocols for the foot and ankle. If any subject cannot avoid such behavior, he or she must report this situation during web software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] access. Concomitant care, such as physical therapy, acupuncture or other conventional medical care, will not be permitted except for runners who are injured during the study.
