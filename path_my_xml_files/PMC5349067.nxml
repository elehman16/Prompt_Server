preparations due to the use of new techniques and restorative materials that preserve
sound tooth structure by minimizing the necessity to enlarge the cavity
preparation<sup><xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup>. Aluminum oxide
air abrasion is one of the methods used for the preparation of conservative cavity
designs. Air-abrasive technique using a high-speed stream of purified aluminum oxide
particles delivered by air pressure for removal of tooth structure was reintroducedwith
the intention to eliminate pressure, heat, noise and vibration associated with rotary
instruments, and to reduce pain, allowing preparation with less need for local
anesthesia<sup><xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup>.</p><p>Contemporary restorative techniques are based on the adhesive properties of resin-based
materials. The basic mechanism of bonding to enamel and dentin is an exchange process
involving replacement of minerals removed from the hard tissue by resin monomers that
upon setting become micro-mechanically interlocked in the created porosities<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>.</p><p>Following an etch-and-rinse approach, the tooth is first etched and rinsed off. This
conditioning step treats enamel and dentin with inorganic acid (mostly 30-40% phosphoric
acid), promoting the increase of the permeability and the demineralization of enamel as
well as dentin (inter-, peritubular, intratubular)<sup><xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup>. However, these systems produce a deep demineralized area,
without the certainty of complete infiltration of monomers into the exposed collagen
fiber mesh, thus affecting the longevity of adhesion<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>Self-etching adhesives use non-rinse acidic monomers that simultaneously condition and
prime dentin, eliminating the acid-conditioning step and reducing the technique
sensitivity<sup><xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup>. This technique
avoids the formation of extensive demineralized areas, which may not be fully
impregnated by monomers<sup><xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup>. According
to the literature, the incorporation of smear layer to the adhesive interface can result
in a more defective adhesion area<sup><xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup>.</p><p>The most cited reasons for failure of adhesive restorations placed with earlier
adhesives are loss of retention and marginal adaptation<sup><xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup>. The behavior of restorative materials in cavities
prepared with aluminum oxide air abrasion has been extensively investigated<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>, and, in general, differences have not
been observed between the restorations of cavities prepared with air abrasion or turbine
followed by acid conditioning<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup>. The restorations that did not receive
acid conditioning after preparation with air abrasion presented increase in
microleakage<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup>. In addition,
better marginal seal has also been observed in enamel margins of cavities prepared with
air abrasion<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup>.</p><p>Despite the advances in restorative dentistry, there is only a limited number of
studies<sup><xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> reporting the
effectiveness of self-etching adhesive systems in the sealing ability of cavities
prepared with air abrasion. Thus, the present study evaluated <italic>in vitro</italic>
the degree of microleakage in conservative cavities prepared with air abrasion and
restored using a self etching adhesive system. The hypothesis of this study was that
conservative class V cavities prepared with air abrasion and restored with a
self-etching primer have less marginal microleakage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><p>The research protocol was approved by the Research ethics Committee of Ribeir&#x000e3;o
Preto Dental School, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo (process # 2003.1.312.58.9).</p><p>Forty sound human premolars, extracted within a 6-month period and stored in 0.9% saline
solution at 4&#x000b0;C, were examined to confirm the absence of defects in enamel and dentin,
and selected for the study. Teeth were carefully cleaned with a hand scaler and
water-pumice slurry in prophylaxis rubber cups, and randomly assigned to 4 groups
(n=10), according to the cavity preparation method and conditioning approach. The
experimental groups were as follows: Group I: Air abrasion + Phosphoric acid; Group II:
Air abrasion + Self-priming etchant; Group III: Turbine + Phosphoric acid; Group IV:
Turbine + Self-priming etchant.</p><p>Forty non-carious class V cavities were prepared on buccal surfaces with the occlusal
margin located in enamel and cervical margin in dentin/cementum. The cavity outline was
previously traced on surfaces with a OHP marker pen, to define a uniform size (3 mm
mesiodistal width and 1.5 mm occlusogingival dimensions). The depth of the cavity was
approximately 1.5 mm, as measured with a premarked periodontal probe.</p><p>Following the pre-defined dimensions The airabraded cavities were prepared with the
air-abrasive system Mach 4.1 (Kreativ Inc., Albany, OR, USA) with aluminum oxide
particles of 27.5 mm under 60 psi pressure with an intensity of 4 g/min at continuous
mode, delivered by a 0.011-inch nozzle opening, with a 90&#x000b0; angle with the tooth surface.
The application distance was standardized using a custom designed apparatus consisting
of a moving holder that positioned the handpiece in such a way that the aluminum oxide
particle stream was delivered at a constant distance of 2 mm from the delimited surface
of the specimen. The specimens were fixed with wax at a semi-adjustable base. The
operator manipulated the apparatus' screws in such way that the semiadjustable base with
the specimen was moved in right-to-left and forward-to-back directions, thereby allowing
the stream to provide a more accurate application of the entire delimited site. After
the stream application, the specimen was removed and the cavity was rinsed for 30 s, and
then gently dried with oil-free compressed air.</p><p>For cavities prepared with turbine, a #330 carbide bur was used (JeT Brand; Beavers
Dental, Morrisburg, Canada) at a high-speed handpiece (Silent MRS; Dabi Atlante S.A.
Ind. Med. Odontol&#x000f3;gica, Ribeir&#x000e3;o Preto, SP, Brazil) under water spray.
Cavity finishing was done with the same bur at a low-speed handpiece. The enamel
cavosurface angle was beveled with a #1195-diamond bur.</p><p>After cavity preparation, the enamel/dentin surfaces were conditioned according to the
experimental group. Specifications of the materials employed for surface treatment are
shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Figure 1</xref>. For groups I and III, the
cavities were etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Figure 1</xref>) for 30 s for enamel and 15 s for dentin, washed with water spray
for 30 s and dried with absorbing paper, providing a moist surface. Groups II and IV
were conditioned with the self-priming etchant Tyrian SPe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t01">Figure 1</xref>). equal amounts of part A and B were mixed thereby
generating a purple color. Then, the mixture was applied with a foam pellet for 10 s,
and the excess was removed until the purple color had completely disappeared.</p><table-wrap id="t01" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Specifications of the materials and equipments employed</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Material</bold></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Composition</bold></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Batch no.</bold></th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Manufacturer</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Etch 37</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">37% phosphoric acid</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">E- 5503EBM</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Bisco Inc., Schaumburg, IL, USA</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tyrian SPE</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Part A: 2-Acrylamido, 2-methyl propanesuflonic acid,

for 10 s to evaporate the solvent, and light-cured for 10 s with a visible light-curing
unit with a 450 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> output (XL 3000, 3M eSPe, St Paul, MN, USA). The
cavities were restored with a hybrid light-activated composite resin (Z250, 3M; shade
A3.5), inserted in three increments (maximum thickness of 2 mm). The first two
increments were applied obliquely against the occlusal and the gingival walls,
respectively. The final increment was inserted following tooth contouring. each
increment was light-cured for 40 s with the same visible light-curing unit.</p><p>Specimens were stored for 24 h in distilled water at 37&#x000b0;C and then the restorations were
polished with Super-Snap disks (Shofu Inc., Kyoto, Japan) in a decreasing abrasive
order. All cavity preparations, restorations and finishing procedures were performed by
the same operator.</p><p>The specimens were subjected to a thermocycling regimen of 500 cycles between 5&#x000b0;C and
55&#x000b0;C waterbaths. Dwell time was 1 min, with a 3-s transfer time between baths. In
preparation for the dye penetration test, the teeth were dried superficially, had the
apices sealed off with epoxy resin and the entire tooth received two coats of nail
varnish, except for a 2-mm window around restoration margins. As the nail varnish dried,
the teeth were immersed in distilled water for 2 h, and then immersed in a 50% aqueous
silver nitrate solution for 8 h, kept in a light-proof container. Next, the teeth were
rinsed thoroughly in tap water and the nail varnish was entirely removed with a sharp
instrument.</p><p>The specimens were embedded in chemically activated acrylic resin (JeT, Cl&#x000e1;ssico,
S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil) and sectioned longitudinally in a mesiodistal direction
with a water-cooled diamond saw, in a sectioning machine (Minitom; Struers A/S,
Copenhagen, Denmark). Then, they were embedded again in acrylic resin blocks and
sectioned in a buccolingual direction, providing two to three 1.0-mm-thick sections for
each tooth. Then, the sections were exposed to the light of a photoflood lamp for 20 min
(115 V, 500 W) to reveal the silver nitrate, which, exposed to light, acquires a dark
color, allowing the visualization of the tracer-penetrated areas. The sections were
initially thinned in a polishing machine (Struers A/S) with 180- to 600-grit silicon
carbide paper, and then manually smoothed with 1000- to 1200-grit SiC paper to obtain a
flat surface and a final thickness of approximately 0.25 mm.</p><p>The cuts were identified and carefully fixed on microscopic slides, and the margins were
analyzed separately; each margin was viewed under a x5 magnification optical microscope
(Axiostar Plus, Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH, M&#x000fc;nchen-Hallbergmoos, Germany) connected
to a digital camera (Cybershot 3.3 MPeG Movie eX, model no. DSC-S75, Sony Corporation,
Tokyo, Japan). The images obtained were transmitted to a personal computer and, after
digitization, they were analyzed by Axion Vision 3.1 software (Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH),
which performs a standardized assessment of the tracer&#x02019;s extent along the
tooth-composite-interface and allows a quantitative measurement in millimeters. The dye
penetration depth along the cavity wall (including both occlusal and cervical margins)
of each cut was measured. Microleakage at each interface was obtained by calculating the
ratio (percent value) of the tracer penetration along the tooth-restoration interface
and the total length of the enamel and/ or dentin interface. Tracer penetration at
enamel and dentin interfaces was calculated separately for each section, and then the
mean for each tooth was determined.</p><p>Data were analyzed statistically by three-way ANOVA followed by Tukey&#x02019;s test for
pair-wise multiple comparisons at a 0.05 significance level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The means of dye penetration and standard deviations at both interfaces for each

provided different seal at the margins of composite resin restorations compared the
turbine. This fact may be due to the macro and microscopic irregularities in the abraded
surface, which may have influenced in the mechanical interlocking. Moreover, the
roughened surface resulting from air abrasion preparation limits the penetration of the
adhesive agent when this modified surface is not etched with acid<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>. In addition to these factors, the
permanence of aluminum oxide particles on the abraded surface can also influence the
penetration of the adhesive. A scanning electronic microscopy study<sup><xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> revealed that the morphology of the
adhesive interfaces of the lateral walls of airabraded cavities was similar to the
obtained with bur-prepared. However, the adhesive interfaces of the pulpal walls were
more irregular in the air abrasion preparations. Several studies<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> have found a decrease in marginal seal
in cavities prepared with air abrasion, mainly when 27-&#x000b5;m-diameter particles were
used<sup><xref rid="r06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>. Another important aspect
to be observed in the present study is that the absence of finishing in cavities
prepared with air abrasion probably no interferes in the adaptation of the restorative
material. Corona, et al.<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> (2001)
verified that air abrasion preparation do not promote a well define contour in cavity
margins and walls that can adversely influence in the marginal seal of the
restorations.</p><p>In the present work, differences were observed between enamel and dentin/cementum
margins, only for phosphoric acid. This could be ascribed to morphological and
structural differences of the substrates, as well as their distinct composition. Such
results corroborate the findings of the literature<sup><xref rid="r04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> which report better behavior of enamel surface as for
adhesive resistance as for marginal microleakage.</p><p>Another important aspect that must be taken into account is the polymerization shrinkage
of the resinous restorative material. Despite conservative preparations and the
incremental composite insertion technique, as performed in this study, thereby reducing
the amount of material and the polymerization shrinkage, it was not possible the
completely seal both cavity margins. It is known that the resultant stress of
polymerization shrinkage of composite resin can generate tensions between the
restorative material and tooth substrate, which, consequently, can generate gaps in the
adhesive interface. This stress depends on some factors, such as the cavity
configuration (factor C), and can reach around 10 to 15 MPa<sup><xref rid="r05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup>. In spite of the care with regard to this factor, Class V
restorations present a relatively small factor C that results in less stress in the
adhesive interface, creating less gaps and subsequent less microleakage<sup><xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>.</p><p>In the overall and independent analysis of the studied factors, the surface treatment
with the etchand-rinse system provided better marginal seal than the self-etching
system. This fact may be explained by the surface morphological pattern created after
phosphoric acid application. At enamel, this acid promotes a demineralization, which
produces an intra- and interprismatic dissolution that results in irregularities,
through which the adhesive agent can flow and form a micromechanical interaction due to
the formation of resinous tags after its polymerization<sup><xref rid="r03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>. At dentin, this acid completely removes the smear layer,
demineralizing the peri- and intertubular dentin, widening dentinal tubule openings and
increasing the permeability of this substrate<sup><xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup>.</p><p>According to Hannig, et al.<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> (2004),
tooth surface treatment with self-etching agents does not remove the smear layer
significantly, since it is not carried through the washing of the surface, remaining
some regions without treatment<sup><xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup>. In
addition, selfetching systems consist of weak acids The reactive components in the
primers of these systems consist of phosphates derived from hydrophilic
monomers<sup><xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> that are able to
treat and penetrate simultaneously in the enamel surface, but not in a homogeneous
way<sup><xref rid="r09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>.</p><p>In this study, for both preparation methods, enamel margins showed higher microleakage
values when the self-etching system was applied. A feasible explanation for such
behavior is the lower capacity of these systems to etch as 35% or 37% phosphoric acid,
due to the relatively higher pH of these selfetching agents (1.5 - 3.0) as compared to
phosphoric acid (pH 0.02 &#x02013; 0.42)<sup><xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup>. In
dentin, it is known that a conditioning agent with low pH, as phosphoric acid, provides
more demineralization<sup><xref rid="r01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup>.</p><p>At dentin/cementum margins, this study disclosed that the conventional preparation with
turbine, associate to the etch-and-rinse system, still could not be replaced by air
abrasion preparation. The particle stream acts indiscriminately in the organic and
inorganic portions of the substrate, leading to surface roughness and tubule
obliteration, and consequently absence of resinous tags, compromising the adhesive layer
and the marginal seal<sup><xref rid="r02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup>.</p><p>The findings of this study revealed a distinct behavior of the adhesive systems, and
showed that the aluminum oxide air abrasion did not influence significantly the marginal
seal of conservative class V restorations, with improved results in enamel after acid
etching. It is important to emphasize that, clinically, no matter its length, the
presence of significant leakage is the problem. Also, the intrinsic aspects related to
adhesive systems, such as the pretreatment technique required, composition and mechanism
of adhesion, may decisively influence their effectiveness in sealing cavity margins and
preventing marginal microleakage.</p><p>Comparison with the literature is difficult due to the lack of studies assessing the
factors studied in this work. Thus, further studies are necessary to investigate the
properties of restorative materials as well as other aspects of cavity preparation and
tooth conditioning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Based on the results obtained in this study, it may be concluded that: conditioning of
enamel and dentin with phosphoric acid provided better marginal seal than the
self-etching approach; marginal seal of class V cavities prepared with air abrasion was
different from that of conventional turbine preparation; there was higher marginal seal
of enamel margins than dentin/cementum margins for groups I and III.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Authors would like to acknowledge CAPeS-Brazil for providing financial support.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r01"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Blackwood</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Dilley</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Roberts</surname><given-names>MW</given-names></name><name><surname>Swift</surname><given-names>EJ</given-names><suffix>Jr</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Evaluation of pumice, fissure enameloplasty and air abrasion on
