People with dementia residing in nursing homes frequently exhibit these challenging behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which include wandering, physical aggression, screaming, depression and resistance to receiving help with activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Rather than cognitive dysfunction, functional impairment or physical dependence, these behaviors constitute one of the greatest burdens for professional caregivers in nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Challenging behaviors of people with dementia can have multiple etiologies that differ among individuals and settings. According to the need-driven dementia-compromised behavior (NDB) model, these behaviors result from an unmet need, and if they are responded to appropriately, patients&#x02019; quality of life will be enhanced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. A dementia-specific case conference represents a promising means of analyzing and exploring the unmet needs of people with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Two different approaches to the dementia-specific case conference have been most commonly described in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The first approach entails the use of an assessment instrument to systematically guide nursing staff through the diagnostic process of a case conference (WELCOME-IdA; Innovative dementia-oriented Assessment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The second approach involves the use of an open-thinking method to determine the potential triggers and causes of challenging behaviors rather than an assessment instrument (WELCOME-NEO) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, thus far, it is unclear whether the use of assessment instruments in dementia-specific case conferences are effective in supporting nursing teams in the diagnostic processes of need-driven behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Additionally, the advantages of dementia-specific case conferences using an open approach (without a standardized assessment) have not been explored in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or assessed in terms of their effectiveness.</p><p>The ongoing FallDem study (dementia-specific case conferences) is a stepped-wedged, cluster-randomized trial that aims to evaluate the uses of these two different types of dementia-specific case conferences (WELCOME-IdA and WELCOME-NEO) in 12 nursing homes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This study is investigating whether these case conferences have an impact on residents&#x000b4; challenging behaviors (primary outcome), quality of life and psychotropic drug use, as well as on the burnout and work-related stress experienced by nursing staff and their vocational action competences (secondary outcomes).</p><p>Because an effectiveness study is limited in its ability to provide information regarding whether an intervention is successful [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], the FallDem study is being accompanied by a process evaluation, which is the main focus of the current study. A process evaluation provides insight into the so-called &#x02018;black box&#x02019; of an effectiveness study and explains deviations between expected and observed outcomes. It further contributes to the understanding of how and to what extent an intervention is implemented in daily practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, it provides information about the manner by which findings might be transferred across settings and populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>The process evaluation is of particular importance in the FallDem study because it is a dementia-specific case conference representing a complex intervention with interacting components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] that will probably need time to be implemented in daily practice. It can be assumed that a dementia-specific case conference will have a delayed treatment effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] because teams in nursing homes have to learn how to employ it. This assumption needs to be further explored and defined in the process evaluation. Information about delayed treatment effects can subsequently aid in the design of a generalized linear mixed-effects model for the FallDem effectiveness study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>For the current study, the framework suggested by Grant <italic>et al</italic>. for designing process evaluations of cluster-randomized trials seems to be suitable because it considers &#x02018;delivery to clusters&#x02019;, the &#x02018;responses of individuals&#x02019; and the &#x02018;responses of clusters&#x02019; as essential domains to be studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These data can provide important evidence regarding the implementation success of an intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Delivery to clusters includes information about how an intervention was delivered to each participating cluster and whether it was delivered as intended. Cluster variations in the delivery of an intervention might explain differences in its implementation and therefore variations in outcomes between clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Response of individuals refers to the manners in which individuals in a target population react to a delivered intervention, for example, their attitudes, learning processes and behavioral changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. If an intervention is not accepted by participants, the success of its implementation can be questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Response of clusters describes how the intervention was adopted by each participating cluster. Differences in the adoption of clusters might also explain variations in outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The framework suggested by Grant <italic>et al</italic>. also includes the &#x02018;recruitment of clusters&#x02019;, &#x02018;recruitment and reach of individuals&#x02019; and &#x02018;context&#x02019; as areas to be studied in a process evaluation. These domains can help to assess the external validity of an effectiveness study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Recruitment of clusters focuses on the strategies used by the research team to recruit clusters and the reasons why clusters decide (or not) to participate. Recruitment and reach of individuals describes the processes by which clusters identify and enroll individuals for an intervention and the proportion of recruited individuals who actually receive the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Information about recruitment and reach of clusters and individuals is important for deciding whether participants are representative of a target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A thorough description of the context in which a trial and intervention is embedded is of great importance for the generalization of findings, providing further relevant information about contextual factors that might act as barriers or facilitators to the implementation of the intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], thereby impeding or strengthening its effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In summary, the framework suggested by Grant <italic>et</italic><italic>al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] combines domains that are important for evaluating the implementation success of an intervention or that are crucial for judging the external validity of an effectiveness study, explaining why this specific framework was used to design the process evaluation of the FallDem study.</p><p>Due to the complexity of dementia-specific case conferences, a comprehensive implementation strategy has been developed based on expert consultation to support the cluster-randomized controlled trial, in which case conferences are employed in daily practice. This strategy follows a step-wise plan and consists of the following six components: (1) information about the research project and dementia-specific case conferences, (2) kick-off meetings, (3) in-service training on dementia and moderator skills, (4) the establishment of a steering group, (5) reminders and (6) a telephone hotline (see Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Although the effectiveness of the implementation strategy for the FallDem study will not be evaluated, knowledge about the usefulness of this strategy will be important for future implementations of dementia-specific case conferences in nursing homes. Therefore, four of the six domains of the process evaluation will be expanded to create a comprehensive implementation strategy, as shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

This method will be carried out alongside the FallDem study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]) between September 2013 and March 2015. A total of 12 nursing homes (clusters) located in the area of North-Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) will take part in the process evaluation. The inclusion criteria for the clusters have been previously published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>In the FallDem study, the intervention is rolled out every three months to two nursing homes (cluster group) over a period of 18&#x000a0;months (stepped-wedge design). Within every cluster, two nursing wards, which each include one nursing team (core team), participate in the intervention. The order in which the 12 nursing homes will receive the intervention and the type of intervention are determined at random (six WELCOME-IdA clusters and six WELCOME-NEO clusters). Two nursing teams that belong to one cluster will receive the same type of intervention to avoid contamination between WELCOME-IdA and WELCOME-NEO. The last group of clusters includes four instead of two clusters because two nursing homes functioning as cluster reserves will be dropped before the end of the study (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).</p><p>The intervention phase (in-service training during case conferences, on-the-job training and case conferences with support) for each cluster lasts seven months, after which a follow-up phase, which lasts until the end of the data collection period for all 12 clusters (T6), occurs. Hence, the intervention phase is the same duration for each nursing home, but the durations of the pre-intervention and follow-up phases differ (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>

Dementia-specific case conferences are embedded within the general theory of hermeneutics and the NDB model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Hermeneutics generally describes the philosophy of understanding and interpreting the social actions of individuals, groups and organizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, using hermeneutics as a strategy to interpret observed behaviors strengthens the abilities of nursing teams to understand the perspectives of people with dementia with respect to their social or biographical backgrounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The NDB model applies a more specific theory that provides explanations for the reasons underlying the challenging behaviors exhibited by individuals with dementia. In the NDB model, challenging behaviors reflect the interactions of relatively stable background factors (such as neurological factors, health status, demographic and pre-morbid characteristics) with more changeable proximal factors (such as physiological and psychological needs and physical and social environments) that commonly result in need-driven behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] (Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Thus, the aim of a dementia-specific case conference is to identify and analyze those background and proximal factors that commonly cause challenging behaviors in people with dementia.<fig id="Fig3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>

The application of the deductive category employs previously formulated, theoretically derived aspects of an analysis (see Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>; theoretical basis) and connects these aspects with the text. In a methodological, controlled assignment, a passage of text is linked with a category. Each deductive category has an explicit definition, example and coding rule with regard to the theory and material and is revised during the analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>The audiotapes of the dementia-specific case conferences will be analyzed using the documentary method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>], which is a reconstructive analysis tool that allows for case comparisons (key concept). Thus, internal and cross-case comparisons as well as the determination of the comparative knowledge of an interviewer will be possible. Four phases will be implemented as follows: (1) the formation of an outline and detailed paraphrasing that begins prior to transcription with a focus on &#x02018;what is said&#x02019;. To avoid bias, the whole case conference will be transcribed; (2) reflection on interpretation, examining the reconstruction and explication of the orientation frame with a focus on &#x02018;how it is said&#x02019; (during phase 2, internal and cross-case comparisons will be initiated to ensure inter-subjectivity of the results); and (3) the &#x02018;stage of case description&#x02019; (case structure) phase, during which the essential reconstructed elements will be summarized. For phase 1 (what is said), the &#x02018;act for team model&#x02019; will be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. The standardized protocols for the dementia-specific case conferences and the written documentation will be analyzed using documentary analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] (see Tables&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">6</xref> and <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table">7</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec18"><title>Defining delayed treatment effect</title><p>It can be assumed that a dementia-specific case conference shows its full treatment effect (100%) when it is delivered over time as intended, is accepted by the nursing team and is adopted by the nursing home. The earliest time point at which a full effect could be expected according to the data is at the transition from training on the job (II) to case conferences without support (III). However, case conferences represent complex interventions that require training and education (as expected, the staff may need more time to learn how to use the case conferences in their daily work routines). Therefore, a delayed treatment effect cannot be excluded (for example, the intervention being only 75% effective after transition from training on the job (II) to case conferences without support (III)). This information provided by the process evaluation will be important for improving model building using a generalized linear mixed-effects model of the effectiveness study. The delay must be modeled as a fractional treatment effect in the mixed-effects model as described by Hussey and Hughes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. To define a possible delayed treatment effect for each nursing home, the data pertaining to the delivery of intervention to clusters, the response of individuals to the intervention and the response of clusters to the intervention will be used.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>The Institutional Review Board for Ethics in Research, German Society for Science in Nursing (E-DG-P) has discussed and considered the proposal, entitled Fallbesprechungen bei Menschen mit Demenz (FallDem), Teil II: Interventionsdurchf&#x000fc;hrung (delivered in August 2011), and has approved this study.

Implementation errors can be explained in cases in which the results of the effectiveness study show no effect or weak effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Thus, this study overcomes the general criticism that implementation issues have been overlooked in healthcare research on psychosocial interventions in daily residential dementia care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>].</p><p>Testing a clinical intervention while gathering information on its implementation in a real-world situation, which is also called an effective-implementation type I hybrid design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], can further facilitate the incorporation of a new innovation into daily practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. For this study, knowledge about contextual factors that might promote or inhibit the implementation of the dementia-specific case conferences and information about the delivery, acceptability and adoption of the implementation strategy will be gathered. Both types of data will be subsequently used to strengthen the implementation strategy, which in turn will facilitate and reinforce the implementation of the dementia-specific case conferences in daily routines in nursing homes once the stepped-wedged cluster-randomized study has been completed. The results will be further used to design a successive hybrid III study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], in which the implementation strategy will be tested and information on the clinical intervention and its related outcomes will be gathered.</p><p>Using the results of the process evaluation to design the generalized mixed-effects model of the stepped-wedged, cluster-randomized effectiveness study, new methodological pathways in healthcare research will be explored that have not been widely used to date. Previous studies, such as those on the effects of depression and behavior management programs on nursing home residents with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], have considered a full treatment effect directly after the intervention has been rolled out to the cluster. Due to the complexities of both programs, a delayed treatment effect can also be assumed in both of these studies, which may have affected their results.</p><p>The limitations of the process evaluation of the FallDem study are also worth noting. The maintenance of dementia-specific case conferences in nursing is an important issue to be explored in a process evaluation; this issue will be only partially addressed in this study. The manner by which individuals and organizations respond to and adopt an intervention may change over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], thus, although that topic is beyond the scope of the present study, it may be interesting to determine what will happen during the follow-up-period after the intervention phase of the FallDem study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial was initiated in 2013 and will be completed by the end of 2015.
