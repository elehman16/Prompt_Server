The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients&#x02019; perception of onset of effect with a single dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this double-blind, crossover, Phase IV study, 40 patients were randomized to receive a single dose of indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g or placebo via a dry powder inhaler device. The primary variable was time until patient&#x02019;s perception of onset of effect, using a simple self-administered (nonvalidated) questionnaire that patients answered at nine protocol-specified time points. Exploratory variables included change in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and change in percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> from predose to postdose (determined 60&#x02013;75 minutes postdose).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The least-squares mean time to patient&#x02019;s perception of onset of effect was 25.4 minutes and 23.9 minutes for indacaterol and placebo, respectively. There was no significant effect for treatment, period, or sequence on the time to patient&#x02019;s perception. In addition, no statistically significant differences between treatments were observed for patient&#x02019;s global satisfaction with onset of effect and global expectation of treatment adherence. For the exploratory variable change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from predose to postdose, indacaterol showed superiority over placebo with a clinically relevant least-squares mean treatment difference of 0.12 L (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001). There was little or no association between patient&#x02019;s perception of time to onset of effect and change in FEV<sub>1</sub>, or change in percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub>.

Patients were excluded if they had a history of asthma or repeated COPD exacerbations (two or more in the previous 2 years). Medication-based exclusions included bronchodilators for COPD with a pharmacodynamic activity greater than 48 hours and/or once-daily dosing, and a washout of 48 hours was required for patients on maintenance bronchodilators (eg, formoterol and salmeterol).</p></sec><sec><title>Treatments</title><p>At visit two (3&#x02212;10 days postscreening), eligible patients were randomized in a crossover design in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single dose of indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g followed by placebo at visit three, or placebo at visit two followed by indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g at visit three (washout of 7&#x02212;10 days between visits), via a dry powder inhaler device. Patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids at baseline continued this treatment (or the inhaled corticosteroids component alone if taken as a fixed combination with a bronchodilator) at equivalent dose and regimen during the study. Albuterol was available for rescue use.

Exploratory variables included change in FEV<sub>1</sub> and change in percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> from predose to postdose (60&#x02212;75 minutes postdose), as well as patient&#x02019;s global satisfaction with onset of effect and patient&#x02019;s expectation of treatment adherence (both administered after completion of the 60 minute perception of onset of effect questionnaire; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-copd-9-919">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Safety assessments included all adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, vital signs, blood chemistry, urine tests, and electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Patients were randomized to one of the two treatment sequences in this double-blind study (see Treatment section).

Patients in the safety set were analyzed according to the treatment they received.</p><p>The primary variable was analyzed for the FAS using a repeated-measures analysis of variance model with fixed effects for treatment, period, and sequence and a random effect for patients within sequence. Patients who did not perceive onset of effect by 60 minutes were considered as having a perceived onset of effect at 70 minutes. For analysis of the primary variable, if a patient had missing data for the second period, no imputations were performed.</p><p>The change in FEV<sub>1</sub> from predose to postdose, the patients&#x02019; global satisfaction with the onset of effect, and patients&#x02019; expectation of treatment adherence were also analyzed for the FAS with the same repeated-measures analysis of variance model that was used for the analysis of the primary variable.</p><p>The associations between time until patient&#x02019;s perception of onset of effect, and change in FEV<sub>1</sub>, and change in percent predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> from predose to postdose were examined by computing Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficients and Spearman&#x02019;s rank correlation coefficients.

The mean (SD) predose FEV<sub>1</sub> (L) of first dose for indacaterol and placebo was 1.53 (0.606) and 1.59 (0.530), respectively.

For patient&#x02019;s global satisfaction with onset of effect, there was a small improvement with indacaterol compared with placebo (LS mean 2.2 vs 2.5; difference &#x02212;0.2), but this was not statistically different (<italic>P</italic>=0.40; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-9-919">Table 3</xref>). Similarly, for patient&#x02019;s expectation of treatment adherence score, the LS mean treatment difference (&#x02212;0.2) between indacaterol (2.1) and placebo (2.3) indicated a small improvement but was not significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.54; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-9-919">Table 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Safety</title><p>Overall, five patients (12.5%) receiving indacaterol and one patient (2.5%) receiving placebo experienced at least one AE after study treatment.

Other AEs reported by patients in the indacaterol group included rhinorrhea, throat irritation, dyspepsia, pyrexia, muscle spasm, and headache (one case per AE [2.5%]). COPD worsening was reported by one patient in the placebo group. One patient in the placebo group discontinued due to AEs. No serious AEs or deaths were reported in the study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this Phase IV, single-dose study, the effect of active treatment (indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g once daily) and placebo on patient&#x02019;s perception of onset of effect was evaluated with a simple patient-reported instrument in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. The study did not show a significant treatment, period, or sequence effect for the primary variable, time until patient&#x02019;s perception of onset of effect. However, a statistically significant improvement was observed in FEV<sub>1</sub> with indacaterol compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-copd-9-919">Table 3</xref>). The treatment difference of 0.12 L (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) in FEV<sub>1</sub> at 60&#x02013;75 minutes postdose for indacaterol versus placebo was clinically meaningful<xref rid="b3-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and was comparable with the improvement reported in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> with indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g versus placebo by Kerwin et al.<xref rid="b2-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Therefore, the absence of patient perception of onset of effect occurred despite a strong bronchodilator response.</p><p>Evaluation of patient perceptions of treatment effects involves significant challenges. In particular, it is recognized that subjective responses to placebo may be similar to those reported for active treatments, despite marked differences in objective measures. For example, Wechsler et al<xref rid="b15-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> compared the effects of the bronchodilator albuterol with two placebo interventions and no intervention in patients with asthma. Although albuterol significantly improved FEV<sub>1</sub>, whereas the placebo interventions did not, self-reported outcomes were similar between the active and placebo groups. Wechsler et al<xref rid="b15-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> concluded that placebo treatments can result in clinically meaningful effects that may rival those of active treatments in patients with asthma. Other studies have also indicated that placebo exerts positive effects on subjectively assessed outcomes (such as pain and depression) but not on objectively evaluated outcomes.<xref rid="b16-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In 610 patients with asthma, Wise et al<xref rid="b17-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> demonstrated that placebo given with enhanced messages to increase the expectation of benefit significantly increased subjective outcomes but had no effect on objective outcomes. The results of our study are consistent with these findings.</p><p>Disparities between subjective and objective assessments have been noted in other trials of COPD treatments. For example, significant improvements (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) in FEV<sub>1</sub> and health status (SGRQ) were noted at week 12 in patients receiving indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g, compared with placebo, in two pivotal Phase III studies.<xref rid="b2-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In both the studies, the improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> met the prespecified criterion for clinical relevance (120 mL difference versus placebo), and the differences in the SGRQ scores approached clinical significance (defined as a four-point difference versus placebo).<xref rid="b2-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b18-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, dyspnea (measured using the Transition Dyspnea Index) was significantly improved with indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g versus placebo in one study but not in the other.<xref rid="b1-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Disparities between different assessments were also observed in a study by Lindberg et al<xref rid="b11-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> that used the same instrument employed in our study to evaluate budesonide/formoterol, salmeterol/fluticasone, salbutamol, and placebo in patients with COPD. In this trial, significant objective differences were recorded in lung function between active treatments, but patient perceptions of the onset of action were similar. Of note, 61% of placebo recipients answered &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; when asked whether their medication was working (versus 81%&#x02013;84% for the active treatments). As well as raising concerns regarding the sensitivity of the questionnaire, Lindberg et al<xref rid="b11-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> noted that patients may have been in a &#x0201c;steady state&#x0201d; with regard to symptoms, and many may have been relatively asymptomatic, thus compromising the ability of the instrument to assess treatment effects.</p><p>Studies investigating the effect of single-dose bronchodilators on lung function, exercise capacity, and walking performance in patients with COPD have reported improvements in objective measures (lung function, walking performance, and arterial oxygen saturation), as well as subjective measures (perceived breathlessness, exertion, chest pain, and fatigue).<xref rid="b19-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b21-copd-9-919" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In contrast to the current study, where there was no physical challenge prior to the assessments, these earlier trials involved an exercise test. It can be hypothesized that an improvement in subjective assessments could have been seen with indacaterol if the study involved a physical challenge, such as a 6-minute walk test.</p><p>We assessed the single-dose effect of indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g (US approved dose) versus placebo on patient perception of onset of effect. The sensitivity of the instrument used in this study and the symptom severity of the patients enrolled may have influenced the results. An effect on patient perception of onset of effect with indacaterol may have been observed with a different instrument with a higher sensitivity, or had the study been conducted among patients with more severe impairment (eg, with severe to very severe air flow obstruction or with acute symptoms such as dyspnea or fatigue as a result of exercise). Patients with COPD may need the use of rescue medication for immediate relief of bronchospasm. Our study allowed the use of albuterol as a rescue medication for rapid relief of acute dyspnea.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, a single dose of indacaterol 75 &#x003bc;g was not associated with a significant difference in patient perception of benefit compared with placebo, despite significant improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub>. There were no differences in time to perception of onset of effect between indacaterol and placebo. It may be that a more sensitive instrument or an exercise challenge study would be required to address the discrepancy between a patient&#x02019;s perception of effect and the significant bronchodilation achieved. As has been shown in other studies, significant improvements in physiologic function do not always correlate directly with patients&#x02019; perception of relief.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank the patients and staff at the participating study centers and David Young (Novartis, Horsham, UK) for critically reviewing the manuscript.
