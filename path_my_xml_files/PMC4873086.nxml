Some of these studies have been informed by neurological models of Executive Functioning (EF). There is a general consensus within the literature that the three core EF skills are; working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. The development of these core EF skills has been linked with learning and academic achievement and is an essential component in the delivery of PE using a new and innovative approach called &#x02018;Better Movers and Thinkers (BMT).&#x02019; A mixed methods design was used to investigate the effectiveness and feasibility of a 16-week intervention programme using BMT where 46 children were tested on two separate occasions for coordination and balance control, academic skills, working memory and non-verbal reasoning skills. One school acted as the control condition (21 students, aged 9 &#x02013; 10 years) and another school acted as the intervention condition (25 students, aged 9 &#x02013; 10 years). Quantitative data revealed an effect between pre and post-test conditions in the areas of phonological skills (p = .042), segmentation skills (p = .014) and working memory (p = .040) in favour of the intervention condition. Further analysis identified a gender-interaction with male students in the intervention condition making significant gains in phonological skills (p = .005) segmentation skills (p = .014) and spelling (p = .007) compared to boys in the control condition. Analysis of qualitative data from a sample of students from the intervention condition and their class teacher indicated good acceptability of BMT as an alternative approach to PE.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>physical education</kwd><kwd>academic achievement</kwd><kwd>executive function</kwd><kwd>activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent research has reignited interest into the physical and cognitive benefits of physical activity with some studies specifically highlighting beneficial aspects of activity on Executive Functioning (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Blair &#x00026; Razza, 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Coe, Pivarnik, Womack, Reeves, &#x00026; Malina, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Diamond &#x00026; Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">Trudeau &#x00026; Shephard, 2010</xref>). Executive Functioning (EF) is an umbrella term that describes the complex cognitive processes required to perform novel or difficult goal-directed tasks, including the ability to delay or inhibit responses, develop a plan of action sequences, and working memory. Recent research has suggested plausible links between physical activity and the enhancement of EF including; physiological influences such as greater cerebral blood flow; increased secretion of neurotrophins as a result of increasing levels of physical activity; psychological influences such as an increase in self-esteem and a desire to learn and be part of the school (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Ahn &#x00026; Fedewa, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr">Strong et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">Trudeau &#x00026; Shephard, 2010</xref>). Other studies have identified that no decrease in academic performance has been observed despite a curtailing of time spent teaching academic subjects in favour of more time participating in PE (<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">Ahamed et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">Trudeau &#x00026; Shephard, 2010</xref>). Aside from the cognitive gains that can be attributed to increasing time allocated to PE (and consequently being physically active), there is a well-established link between increasing levels of physical activity and the general health of children (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Ahn &#x00026; Fedewa, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr">Kristensen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Studies have investigated the impact of gentle, vigorous and chronic bouts of exercise on academic performance (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Coe, Pivarnik, Womack, Reeves, &#x00026; Malina, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">Davis &#x00026; Cooper, 2011</xref>). One study carried out in the United States reported an immediate increase in concentration levels in grades 2 to 4 following 15 minutes of stretching and walking (<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">Caterino &#x00026; Polak, 1999</xref>). Whilst this demonstrates a positive impact between the engagement in physical activity and concentration levels, the activities carried out in this study are not normally part of a PE lesson and lasted for a much shorter duration. Other larger-scale studies (<xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">Hamre &#x00026; Pianta, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr">Hughes &#x00026; Graham, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr">Welsh &#x00026; Pennington, 1988</xref>) have shown that being physically active is known to increase an individual&#x02019;s immediate level of arousal through an increase in neural activity in the reticular formation of the brain, although the long-term impact of this increase is less established (<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Biddle &#x00026; Asare, 2011</xref>). Similarly, endurance exercise (a sustained period of running and swimming, for example) leads to a substantial increase in systemic blood pressure where the overall perfusion of the brain typically increases by 14 &#x02013; 25% (<xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr">Goswami, 2008</xref>; <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">Hamre &#x00026; Pianta, 2001</xref>). It would appear that the intensity, duration and frequency of physical activity may impact differently on an individual&#x02019;s potential gains with respect to their academic achievement. There is little information on the different impact that comes from different modes of activity and further research is required in this area.</p><p>Despite discussions around the diverse nature of physical activity and how this may impact differently on academic achievement, the literature reveals two related findings. Firstly, that increasing the time spent on PE and thus reducing the time spent on teaching academic subjects does not reduce academic achievement, and secondly, that when students are more physically active, this can often be associated with improvements in their academic achievement suggesting that there may be a link between physical activity and learning. These findings seem to correlate and do not appear to be influenced by variability in study design or by the different measurement techniques that are cited between studies, perhaps adding weight to the justification for increasing time allocated to PE provision in our schools.</p><p>Research further reveals divergent findings regarding the relationship between gender and academic achievement with some evidence favouring boys and some evidence girls (<xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr">Hyde, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">Machin &#x00026; Pekkarinen, 2008</xref>). Other authors (<xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr">Matthews, Ponitz, &#x00026; Morrison, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r56" ref-type="bibr">Weaver-Hightower, 2003</xref>) note that historically boys were largely advantaged in the school classroom and most academic settings. Other studies, however, reveal that girls tend to build better relationships with their teachers, attain higher results, achieve higher levels of education and generally progress scholastically better when compared with boys (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">Duckworth &#x00026; Seligman, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr">Ready, LoGerfo, Burkam, &#x00026; Lee, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr">Silverman, 2003</xref>). However, within these studies there is a clear differential effect between gender depending on the subject being assessed and the nature of that assessment. The literature indicates a significant advantage for girls in language based tasks (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">Duckworth &#x00026; Seligman, 2006</xref>) and an advantage for boys in standardised tests that may be based on their motivation within a competitive environment being greater than girls (<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">Gneezy, Niederle, &#x00026; Rustichini, 2003</xref>). One of the plausible causes underpinning these gender differences is that strong behavioural regulation developed in the earlier years in the school sets precedence for successful academic achievement through increased school engagement and motivation (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">Fredericks, Blumenfeld, &#x00026; Paris, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman &#x00026; Schunk, 2011</xref>) and studies have shown that girls are able to regulate their behaviours earlier than boys (<xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">Fredericks, Blumenfeld, &#x00026; Paris, 2004</xref>; <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman &#x00026; Schunk, 2011</xref>). To varying degrees, self-regulation tasks tap executive functions such as attention and inhibitory control which, according to some researchers, support self-directed classroom behaviours (<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">Blair, 2002</xref>; <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">Brook &#x00026; Boaz, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">Howse, Lange, Farran, &#x00026; Boyles, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr">Ponitz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr">Saracho &#x00026; Spodek, 2007</xref>). Deficiencies in self-regulation present at a younger age may undermine academic achievement and predict outcomes (<xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">Green &#x00026; Francis, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="r55" ref-type="bibr">Vitaro, Brendgen, Larose, &#x00026; Trembaly, 2005</xref>) with one study suggesting that there is a particular link between inhibitory control (for example, delayed gratification, impulse control) and phonological awareness (for example, blending and segmenting of sound components and syllables within written and/or oral tasks) (<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">Blair &#x00026; Razza, 2007</xref>). This particular finding is of considerable relevance as research has shown that blending and segmentation of sounds and phonics has the greatest transfer to emergent reading and spelling (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Ehri et al., 2001</xref>). Phonological awareness is known to develop earlier in girls with concomitant findings demonstrating that girls are better readers than boys (<xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">Machin &#x00026; Pekkarinen, 2008</xref>). It would appear from other studies that this phenomenon may be universal and the result from large-scale international comparisons of reading literacy among 10-year olds and 15-year olds also showed that girls read better than boys in a wide variety of school systems and cultural settings (<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">Chiu &#x00026; McBride-Chang, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">Machin &#x00026; Pekkarinen, 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, if time spent in PE enhances EF through participation and engagement in physical activities, then this in turn may lead to better levels of inhibitory control and attention which have been directly linked to phonological awareness. The levels of enhancement and progress may differ between boys and girls.</p><p>Historically, a common approach to PE for primary age children typically involves a skills-based session which is often teacher-led (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>). An alternative approach has been developed which directly involves a shift in pedagogical practice where sports and other activities are used as a vehicle to develop three key constituent parts: thinking skills (decision making, problem solving, adaptability, working memory), human capacities (determination, perseverance, self-confidence) and physical literacy with no instruction provided with regards to the development of technical skills (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). This approach consciously directs a specific focus towards the inclusion of EF skills and sets out to identify if this different approach to teaching primary PE, can lead to improvements in academic achievement.</p><p>&#x02018;Better Movers and Thinkers (BMT)&#x02019; is designed to develop the ability to move and think in an integrated way within PE. Exponents of BMT contend that if children have better quality and control over their balance and movements, this can then become more automatic potentially resulting in reduced levels of conscious thought having to govern movement and balance. To coincide with this development, EF have been specifically developed through the BMT approach, assisting the development of cognitive processes, which in turn will help them, succeed across the curriculum (<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">Diamond, Barnett, Thomas, &#x00026; Munro, 2007</xref>). There have been many studies identifying the impact of good EF skills in children (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">Booth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">Diamond &#x00026; Lee, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr">Koziol &#x00026; Lutz, 2013</xref>; <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr">Monette, Bigras, &#x00026; Guay, 2011</xref>) but there are no studies that have used PE as the context for learning. The present study therefore acts as an exploratory study into the possible links between PE and EF skill development leading to educational gains. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref> represents the BMT learning framework that encompasses the three constituent parts that come together to make performance. Physical literacy focuses on the development of key physical attributes that enhance physical performance such as balance, postural control, gross motor coordination, rhythm and timing. Personal qualities relate to aspects of human characteristics such as determination, courage, motivation and perseverance which are considers by the proponents of BMT to be essential to remain engaged with the process of learning. Thinking skills refers to the development of cognitive processes such as the development, enhancement and refinement of EF skills. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref> represents the BMT process that should occur in each individual session where there is the identification of the series of movement skills to develop physical literacy, the inclusion of a series of differentiated cognitive tasks to develop thinking skills, a specific focus on integrating and developing EF skills and encouraging the active engagement of the learner through the development of personal qualities.</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>The Learning Framework.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ejop-11-722-g01"/></fig><fig id="f2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="anchor"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>The BMT Process.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ejop-11-722-g02"/></fig><p>The purpose of this study was to evaluate if BMT positively influences academic skills, and to identify what the perceptions of students and staff are of this approach within primary education. The perceptions of these stakeholders will help to inform an understanding of the acceptability, feasibility and impact of BMT in the delivery of PE within the primary school.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>A mixed methods design (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">Denscombe, 2008</xref>) utilising both quantitative and qualitative data was adopted for this study to provide information about the efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of BMT as an approach to delivering PE in primary schools.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants in this study were aged 9 &#x02013; 10 years and were attending two mainstream state schools in a Primary 6 class in Scotland, UK.

The schools were identified as being similar in terms of school roll, school facilities and were within close proximity (i.e. less than one mile) from one another.

Finally, the class teacher made a direct link between the sharing of ideas, appreciation of one another&#x02019;s work, working in pairs and good demonstrations of good practice as being something that the children do in BMT and in the classroom stating <italic>&#x02018;that is something we do in class a lot.&#x02019;</italic></p></sec><sec><title>Class Teacher Theme 3: School Attendance</title><p>The class teacher found no connection between school attendances being different on BMT days compared to non-BMT days.</p><p>&#x0201c;I don&#x02019;t think they&#x02019;ve actually made their attendance better on a PE day as far as I know.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study aimed to provide information about the efficacy, acceptability and feasibility of BMT as an approach to delivering PE in primary schools. Two schools received two PE lessons per week over 16 week duration between January and May with both conditions receiving the 32 planned sessions. The control condition received their PE provision from a combination of PE specialist, qualified NGB sports coaches and the class teacher. The intervention condition received all of their BMT sessions from the two experts who had contributed to the design and conception of BMT. The study was completed within the timescale allocated.</p><p>The findings from this study revealed statistically significant improved overall score changes in measures of working memory, phonological awareness and segmentation abilities for participants recruited to the BMT intervention condition. Significant group by gender interactions further revealed that boys in the intervention condition made greater gains than boys from the control condition in Phonological Composite Scores, Segments and Spelling subtests.</p><p>Traditionally the literature has revealed girls showing advanced language-based skills when compared to boys (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">Duckworth &#x00026; Seligman, 2006</xref>), yet findings from this exploratory study have shown boys to make more significant gains in scores on certain aspects of language-based tasks when compared to girls as a result of BMT. Therefore, these results are potentially important findings and provide evidence in support of BMT having a positive impact on learning.</p><p>The improvements identified in working memory hold specific significance to learning and educational processes as memory is considered the most basic and fundamental concepts required for learning (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">Brown &#x00026; Minns, 1999</xref>). The statistically significant gains achieved in phonological awareness and segmentation scores are of similar interest to that of the working memory results as these are considered as the foundations of literacy development (<xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr">Justice &#x00026; Pullen, 2003</xref>). These foundations are known to develop as part of emergent reading and spelling capabilities and the literature has shown that this typically happens in girls ahead of boys (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Bruininks, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Ehri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">Flynn &#x00026; Rahbar, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">Green &#x00026; Francis, 1988</xref>; <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">Machin &#x00026; Pekkarinen, 2008</xref>). However, the results from this study identified boys making more significant gains and present a different finding from these previous studies. This may be due to the specific focus that BMT has on the development of EF skills; and in particular the enhancement of working memory, inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility. It could be suggested that improvements in EF skills may lead to concomitant improvements in attention and concentration levels as a result of improvements in self-regulatory behaviours. The literature has indicated a direct correlation between increased levels of attention and the development of phonological abilities (<xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">Ehri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">Green &#x00026; Francis, 1988</xref>). Qualitative findings support this theory as the class teacher made specific reference to the students having to concentrate throughout the duration of the BMT sessions inferring that this is not the case during traditional PE sessions. To substantiate this stance the class teacher remarked how the students remained engaged throughout the BMT session due to the <italic>&#x02018;nature of the programme</italic>.&#x02019;</p><p>It has been noted that the influence that improved levels of concentration can have on phonological awareness, and that phonological awareness positively influences spelling (<xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr">Muter, Hulme, Snowling, &#x00026; Stevenson, 2004</xref>). It may be suggested that the findings from this study indicate that BMT has supported the development of attention and concentration with concomitant influence on academic achievement and in particular a relationship between gains in phonological awareness and improvements in spelling amongst boys. As boys traditionally lag behind girls in this area of development (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">Duckworth &#x00026; Seligman, 2006</xref>), these findings are interesting and provide evidence in support of BMT having a positive impact on learning.</p><p>However, results from the reading tests identified no main effect for the intervention condition suggesting that there has not been a transfer of skills from improved phonological abilities to reading competency as previous research has suggested (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Bruininks, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr">Machin &#x00026; Pekkarinen, 2008</xref>). It may be the duration of the intervention phase was not sufficient enough to allow for transference, or possibly that emergent reading skills develop before the age of this study cohort.</p><p>The significant findings from the LASS assessment may have been a result of the levels of Moderate-Vigorous Physical Activity (MVPA) achieved by the intervention condition being greater than that of the control condition, and may perhaps help explain for the gender interaction identified in some of the subtests. As no measurement for MVPA was used during the intervention phase sessions it is not possible to account for the effect of this potential variable. Similarly, no data were collected on the students&#x02019; participation in physical activity outside of school, yet many studies have identified this as a key factor when evaluating the impact that physical activity has on academic achievement (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">Davis &#x00026; Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">Etnier, Nowell, Landers, &#x00026; Sibley, 2006</xref>). It could be suggested that limited engagement in MVPA may hinder the development of good coordination and balance control which may limit the direct engagement in physical activity and result in more sedentary behaviours. If there is a link between physical activity and academic achievement, then future studies should take cognisance of this to help account for the differences identified within this pilot study.</p><p>The results from the MABC2 identified that balance and postural control scores did not change over the course of this study, as a ceiling effect was observed. These subtests were used as static balance reaches adult levels for open-eye conditions<sup>i</sup> between 9 and 10 years of age (<xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr">Wolff et al., 1998</xref>) but in retrospect they may not have been sensitive enough for this particular cohort. It has been suggested that static balance maintenance supports the fundamental process of coordinated accurate movements (<xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr">Nashner, Shumway-Cook, &#x00026; Marin, 1983</xref>) and therefore it could be suggested that any flaws in static balance may limit the student&#x02019;s access to a worthwhile and positive PE experience as it has the potential to detrimentally affect coordination. Student feedback clearly identified that their enjoyment levels were often linked to their perceived physical competence and therefore poor self-image may result in a disengagement from PE (and physical activity) altogether. Within this study perhaps students with under-developed static balance capabilities were not identified as a symptom of the limitations within the measurement tool used. However, the MABC2 is a popular instrument for the evaluation and identification of children with motor impairment and is used in many clinical and research contexts where studies on validity have shown 80% agreement between the MABC2 and &#x02018;Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Performance&#x02019; (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">Bruininks, 1978</xref>; <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">Chow &#x00026; Henderson, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">Croce, Horvat, &#x00026; McCarthy, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Variables that have not been investigated within this study, such as intensity of the physical activity and/or the individual student differences (i.e. motivation) may help explain for the different results. Similarly, no evaluation of the level of teaching expertise or experience was taken into account but may also have impacted upon results.</p><p>Findings from the pilot study provide an opportunity for a larger-scaled study to be conducted. Some key adjustments and additions need to be made to the measurement tools used in order to design a more robust study.</p><sec><title>Strengths of the Study</title><p>The schools used within the current study shared catchment areas, had a similar school roll and similar PE resources. This helped to reduce the possible influence of other known variables such as socio-economic status (<xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr">Rhoades, Greenberg, Lanza, &#x00026; Blair, 2011</xref>) and class sizes (<xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr">Wilson, 2007</xref>) from influencing the results.</p><p>Both the control and intervention condition received 16 weeks of PE with no omissions. This prevented time spent doing PE being a confounding variable as both conditions received 32 sessions during the 16-week intervention phase.</p><p>Testing was completed by the main researcher at both pre- and post-test in the same location within the school for all students. This standardised operational procedures and allowed the students to feel secure within the process. The validity and reliability of both assessment tools used were good for this exploratory study, and both were standardised for a UK population allowing for it to be free from any cultural interpretations as the study took place within Scotland.</p><p>Pre-testing was completed in both conditions in December 2011 before the start of the intervention phase in January 2012, and post-testing was completed in both schools within two weeks from the end date of the intervention phase (May 2012). This reduced the influence that time of testing could have had on the data gained in either condition.</p><p>The estimate of internal consistency associated with the composite scores for working memory was moderate (&#x003b1;&#x000a0;= .61) suggesting good reliability and validity in using a composite score for the two memory subtests.</p><p>The teachers and NGB sports coaches delivering the PE experience in either condition were not involved in the collection of the quantitative or qualitative data, or in the analysis of the results. Similarly, the independent researcher who conducted the student focus group and class teacher interview was not involved in the analysis of the quantitative or qualitative data helping to reduce the level of bias as they were blind to the procedures of the intervention and other assessment tools.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>No measurement of the student&#x02019;s overall level of physical activity was taken at pre- or post-intervention. There is a considerable amount of research that identifies school-aged students who have increased levels of time spent being physically active typically perform better in academic tasks than those who are less physically active (<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">Coe et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">Davis &#x00026; Cooper, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">Etnier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr">Trudeau &#x00026; Shephard, 2010</xref>).</p><p>There was no measure of the intensity levels of physical activity being achieved by the students during their PE lessons. Studies have shown a different impact on academic performance depending on acute bouts of exercise or chronic bouts of exercise (<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">Ahn &#x00026; Fedewa, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">Biddle &#x00026; Asare, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The expertise and experience levels of the teachers as well as their adopted style when delivering PE was not evaluated or compared. Studies (<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">Chatoupis, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">Demetriou &#x00026; H&#x000f6;ner, 2012</xref>) have shown that the approach adopted by the teacher can have a significant effect on the outcomes achieved during the lessons and therefore can have an impact on any benefits associated with this learning opportunity for students. In addition to this, the teachers delivering to the intervention condition contributed to the development of BMT and therefore may have been more motivated to achieve significant results that those who conducted the control condition lessons.</p><p>The control condition received their PE provision on Mondays and Thursdays and the intervention condition received their provision on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It may be suggested that the delivery to pupils on different days of the week may have been a confounding variable as their attitudes and motivations to participate in the PE lessons may have been different given that one school received their first session of the week on Mondays (immediately after the weekend) and the other on Tuesdays. This could therefore have had the potential to influence the results realised from the outcome measures.</p><p>The measurement tool used for evaluating the physical competence of the students was limited and this restricted the possibility of identifying students with movement difficulties. Therefore, motor incompetence could not be taken into account during the results analysis.</p><p>The estimate of internal consistency associated with the composite scores for reading was low (&#x003b1; = .28) and similarly the composite score for phonological subtests was low (&#x003b1; = .44) when conducting and interpreting internal consistency reliability analysis through Cronbach alphas (<xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr">Sijtsma, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The reading tests used within LASS 8&#x02013;11 did not best reflect a pure sight word reading test or cloze reading test as pictures are provided as part of these tests. The illustration represents a non-verbal process and may assist the students in identifying the correct word from 5 possible answers. This does not involve the pupil having to sound out the components of the word itself in order to read it correctly. The word is read out to the child which does result in the child&#x02019;s need to process the information phonologically, but in the presence of the non-verbal information being provided (i.e. the visual representation of the picture), it reduces the level of reading and phonological processing that has to be done in order to complete this task.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Quantitative results showed there was an effect between school with the intervention making statistically significant gains in working memory, phonological awareness and segmentation abilities. The quantitative data analysis showed results in spelling that were approaching significance, though the small sample size did not allow for this. There was a group by gender interaction identified and in particular; male students in the intervention condition made significant gains in comparison to the male students in the control condition in measures of phonological awareness, segmentation abilities and spelling. Gains being made, especially for boys, indicate a potential mapping between BMT and academic skills. The gains may be attributed to specific improvements in EF skills, and in particular to inhibitory control, cognitive flexibility and working memory, though further research is required where a direct measure of these core EF skills could be included. This study only included measures of working memory.</p><p>Qualitative results indicated that students enjoyed BMT as a different approach to PE and the class teacher felt that it enhanced aspects of classroom learning and in particular the engagement of the girls in PE. The findings support BMT as one approach to PE with concomitant benefits to academic achievement and EF skills.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>i</label><p>Other tests of static balance are performed with the eyes closed, but all of the subtest within the MABC2 are performed with the eyes open.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The authors have no funding to report.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p>The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors have no support to report.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="r1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ahamed</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Macdonald</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><name><surname>Reed</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Naylor</surname><given-names>P.
