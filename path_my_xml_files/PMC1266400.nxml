This can be demonstrated by measuring the response to beta-agonist following bronchoconstriction using methacholine. However most studies have demonstrated tolerance after a period of beta-agonist withdrawal, which is not typical of their use in clinical practice. This study assessed tolerance to the bronchodilator action of salbutamol during ongoing treatment with long-acting beta-agonist.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Random-order, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. After 1 week without beta-agonists, 13 asthmatic subjects inhaled formoterol 12 &#x003bc;g twice daily or matching placebo for 1 week. Eight hours after the first and last doses subjects inhaled methacholine to produce a 20% fall in FEV<sub>1</sub>. Salbutamol 100, 200 and 400 &#x003bc;g (cumulative dose) was then given at 5-minute intervals and FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured 5 minutes after each dose. After a 1 week washout subjects crossed over to the other treatment. Unscheduled use of beta-agonists was not allowed during the study. The main outcome variable was the area under the salbutamol response curve.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The analysis showed a significant time by treatment interaction indicating that the response to salbutamol fell during formoterol therapy compared to placebo. After 1 week of formoterol the area under the salbutamol response curve was 48% (95% confidence interval 28 to 68%) lower than placebo. This reduction in response remained significant when the analyses were adjusted for changes in the pre-challenge FEV<sub>1 </sub>and dose of methacholine given (p = 0.001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The bronchodilator response to salbutamol is significantly reduced in patients taking formoterol. Clinically relevant tolerance to rescue beta-agonist treatment is likely to occur in patients treated with long-acting beta-agonists.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Long-acting beta-agonists are often added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] Despite this, most patients still need a short-acting beta-agonist for relief of breakthrough symptoms. The possibility that chronic long-acting beta-agonist use might adversely affect the acute response to short-acting beta-agonists is rarely considered.</p><p>It is well known that regular use of long-acting beta-agonists leads to tolerance to their bronchoprotective effects (their ability to prevent bronchoconstriction).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] Studies looking for bronchodilator tolerance have had more variable results.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] This has led to a widespread belief that clinically significant tolerance to bronchodilation does not occur.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] However, several recent studies have clearly shown that bronchodilation tolerance does occur and becomes more apparent with increasing levels of bronchoconstriction. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] This raises the possibility that beta-agonists will be less effective during acute severe asthma in patients using long-acting beta-agonists.</p><p>Much of the evidence for bronchodilator tolerance has come from studies using a 'challenge-rescue model' that measures the response to short-acting beta-agonists after bronchoconstriction has been induced with either methacholine or exercise.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] Testing bronchodilation from a state of increased bronchomotor tone is thought to mimic patients' use of beta-agonists to relieve asthma symptoms. However, many of these studies have been performed after a period of withdrawal from maintenance beta-agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the findings may not be relevant to patients who continue to use their long-acting beta-agonist twice daily. Other studies have been carried out at the time of peak effect of long-acting beta-agonist, when subjects are least likely to need additional bronchodilator and when results are confounded by differing baseline levels of bronchodilation and bronchial reactivity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]</p><p>The bronchodilator and bronchoprotective effects of long-acting beta-agonists peak within 1 hour of inhalation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] If they are taken twice daily as recommended then patients will be most vulnerable to bronchoconstriction and most likely to need their reliever inhalers 8&#x02013;12 hours after inhalation. Tolerance to the bronchodilator effects of these inhalers at this time is therefore of the highest clinical relevance. Although tolerance to bronchoprotection is known to occur at this time,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] changes in bronchodilation using this 'challenge-rescue'[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] model have not been studied in placebo-controlled trials.</p><p>This study was designed to assess tolerance to salbutamol bronchodilation 8 hours after regular formoterol treatment in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Subjects had a physician diagnosis of asthma and a PD<sub>20 </sub>methacholine (provocative dose of methacholine required to produce a 20% fall in FEV<sub>1</sub>) &#x0003c;1.5 mg (&#x0003c;7.7 &#x003bc;mol). Those currently using long-acting beta-agonists were excluded. Those who had used oral corticosteroids in the previous 3 months or who had changed asthma treatment in the previous 6 weeks were excluded, as were pregnant and lactating women. All subjects provided written informed consent. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the Waikato Ethics Committee.</p><p>After a 1-week run-in period during which no beta-agonists were used, subjects were computer randomised to receive coded bottles of capsules containing formoterol 12 &#x003bc;g or matching placebo for use with the Foradil aerolizer device (Foradil, Novartis, Auckland, New Zealand). A methacholine challenge and salbutamol response was performed 8 hours after the first dose of study medication. The study medication was then taken twice daily for 1 week. A further challenge and response was performed 8 hours following the last dose. After a washout period of at least 1 week the study was repeated using the alternative medication. Use of additional beta-agonists was not allowed throughout the study. Ipratropium bromide (20 &#x003bc;g Atrovent metered dose inhaler, Boehringer Ingelheim, Auckland, New Zealand) was used for symptom relief.</p><p>Methacholine challenge was performed using a modified Yan technique.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] Baseline FEV<sub>1 </sub>was the highest of 3 consistent measurements. Subjects then inhaled doubling doses of nebulised methacholine from 0.0073 mg to 3.728 mg from a dosimeter. FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured 1 minute after each dose. Once the FEV<sub>1 </sub>had fallen by &#x02265;20% from baseline, methacholine challenge was stopped. The PD<sub>20 </sub>(cumulative dose) was calculated by linear interpolation. Where the FEV<sub>1 </sub>fell &#x0003c;20% from baseline (2 subjects each on 1 occasion after formoterol) an arbitrary PD<sub>20 </sub>of 15 mg was assigned (twice the maximum cumulative dose given).</p><p>Salbutamol (Ventolin, GlaxoSmithKline, Auckland, New Zealand) 100 &#x003bc;g, 100 &#x003bc;g and 200 &#x003bc;g via metered dose inhaler and Volumatic spacer was given at 0, 5 and 10 minutes after challenge respectively. The FEV<sub>1 </sub>was measured 5 minutes after each dose of salbutamol, giving a total response time of 15 minutes.</p><p>The main outcome measurement was the area under the salbutamol response curve (AUC), expressed as a percentage of the methacholine-induced fall in FEV<sub>1</sub>. A secondary outcome was the final (15-minute) FEV<sub>1 </sub>after 400 &#x003bc;g salbutamol. Previous studies indicate that the pre-methacholine FEV<sub>1 </sub>and dose of methacholine used are significant covariates of the post-methacholine bronchodilator response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and analyses adjusted for these covariates using analysis of covariance. Methacholine doses were log-transformed for analysis to approximate a normal distribution. The test of the hypothesis used a general linear model with terms for subject, drug and time as well as the covariates of pre-methacholine FEV<sub>1 </sub>and log methacholine dose. Whether tolerance to bronchodilation occurred was assessed using the drug*time interaction term in the model. Post-hoc comparisons of the AUC and final FEV<sub>1 </sub>between placebo and formoterol treatments on day 1 and after 1 week of treatment used Tukey's exact method. Comparisons of pre-challenge FEV<sub>1 </sub>and PD<sub>20 </sub>methacholine use paired t tests.

One subject did not attend for the second placebo challenge.

Hence at this time point there was little protection against bronchoconstriction and greatly reduced bronchodilation.</p><p>It is known that cellular tolerance to beta-agonists occurs very rapidly, within 8 hours <italic>in vitro</italic>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] so it is possible that 'tolerance' had occurred even prior to the challenge on day 1 of formoterol treatment. However, there may be other explanations for a reduced response to salbutamol during formoterol therapy, including the fact that beta<sub>2</sub>-receptors continue to be occupied by formoterol 8 hours after the last dose, leaving fewer receptors available to bind salbutamol. This could explain the reduction in the salbutamol response after the first dose of formoterol. However, the analysis showed a significant interaction between time and treatment, indicating that the bronchodilator response to salbutamol declined further during the formoterol treatment period. Lee et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] also found that the salbutamol response 1 hour after a single dose of salmeterol or formoterol was significantly lower after 1 week of treatment than after the first dose of long-acting beta-agonist. If receptor occupancy was the only explanation for the reduction in AUC we would expect to have found a similar reduction in AUC on the first and last day of formoterol treatment. Moreover, the reduction in salbutamol response after a week of formoterol treatment observed in this study was similar to a previous study in our laboratory, where the salbutamol response was measured 24 hours after the last dose of formoterol.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Receptor occupancy by formoterol would be much lower at this time, suggesting that the reduction in response is more likely to be due to receptor downregulation.</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism, we have shown that the bronchodilator response to salbutamol is reduced during long-acting beta-agonist treatment. Previous studies have been criticised for only analysing changes in FEV<sub>1 </sub>from baseline rather than actual post-bronchodilator levels of FEV<sub>1</sub>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] It is notable in this study that the final FEV<sub>1 </sub>after 400 &#x003bc;g of salbutamol was lower during formoterol treatment than during placebo, despite a higher pre-methacholine FEV<sub>1 </sub>(figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>A recent meta-analysis of studies of regular beta-agonist therapy concluded that the bronchodilator response to subsequent beta-agonist is reduced.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] However, most of the individual studies included in this analysis failed to show significant tolerance. In contrast, all of the published trials that have measured the bronchodilator response after methacholine challenge have shown significant tolerance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] The 'challenge-rescue model' appears to be more sensitive to changes in the response to bronchodilators. Bronchodilation is a 'closed-end scale'[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] with a maximal achievable level. The dose-response to beta-agonist bronchodilators is therefore dependent on the pre-bronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] Subjects with mild, stable asthma are often close to their maximum FEV<sub>1 </sub>and have little capacity for additional bronchodilation. Using methacholine to induce a controlled level of bronchoconstriction before testing bronchodilators ensures that there is capacity for bronchodilation and differences in responses can be shown more easily. Since asthmatics take bronchodilators to relieve symptoms caused by bronchoconstriction it seems logical to test bronchodilators from a state of bronchoconstriction.</p><p>This study is the first blinded, placebo-controlled trial to test for bronchodilator tolerance during the trough period of long-acting beta-agonist dosing using the 'challenge-rescue' model. A recent non-blinded trial compared the bronchodilator response to salbutamol after methacholine challenge between formoterol/budesonide or salmeterol/fluticasone to inhaled steroids alone, at 12 hours after inhalation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] This study found a similar degree of tolerance to the present study despite methodological differences including the use of salbutamol as-needed.</p><p>International guidelines recommend that long-acting beta-agonists are used only in those subjects already taking inhaled corticosteroids.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] Not all of our subjects were taking such medication. However, this does not detract from the applicability of our study as it has been established that stable doses of inhaled corticosteroids do not alter the development of tolerance to beta-agonists.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] Moreover, it is widely recognised that patients are often poorly compliant with their inhalers and it is likely that many patients will continue to use their long-acting beta-agonists without inhaled corticosteroids.</p><p>All but one of our subjects showed some decrease in the bronchodilator ability of salbutamol after 1 week of formoterol treatment, although the magnitude of this was variable (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The reasons for this variability are unknown. Lee et al found that tolerance occurred to the same extent in subjects who were homozygous for the Arg-16 or for the Gly-16 polymorphisms of the beta<sub>2</sub>-receptor.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Individual data for AUC after 1 week of placebo and formoterol</bold>.

Wraight found that tolerance to salbutamol bronchodilation increased with increasing levels of bronchoconstriction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] The level of bronchoconstriction induced in this study (20%) was mild compared to that likely to occur during a severe exacerbation of asthma. Patients using long-acting beta-agonists who experience exacerbations of asthma may have an inadequate response to beta-agonist relievers.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>RH conceived the trial, participated in its design, interpretation of results and helped to draft the manuscript.
