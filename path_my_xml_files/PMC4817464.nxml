Profuse sweating that accompanies PAH can result in skin maceration and secondary microbial infections.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Treatment options for PAH include topical aluminum salts, systemic anticholinergics, various laser devices, and surgical interventions. The main limitations of the above-mentioned options are financial constraints, and transient results, such as those are observed with botulinum toxin therapy.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In recent years, despite the potential risks, including scarring, burning and symptom recurrence, surgical interventions present the most effective options.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] A handful of studies evaluating radiofrequency (RF) energy in the treatment of PAH have suggested that newer bipolar RF devices are effective in reducing the amount of sweating.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] The combination of RF and fractional microneedle technology, termed fractional microneedle radiofrequency (FMR), creates an effective method with a better safety profile for treating various dermatologic conditions.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Several variables, including temperature and humidity, seasonal conditions, and physiological and psychological conditions can affect the accurate assessment of patient sweating.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Axillary hyperhidrosis represents a good model to perform placebo-controlled comparative studies, in which each patient acts as his/her own control, to clinically evaluate novel treatments for this disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMR as an alternative, permanent treatment for PAH with long-term follow-up.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title/><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>This was a single-blind, right-left comparative study in which each patient acted as his/her own control. This study included 25 subjects with PAH, defined as having a score of 3 or 4 on a hyperhidrosis disease severity scale (HDSS). The exclusion criteria were as follows a history of surgery for PAH, history of botulinum toxin therapy within the previous 6 months, history of pacemaker implantation, active infection in the treatment area, the tendency for keloid formation, pregnancy or intention to become pregnant, or breastfeeding. To be included in the study, all patients had to have been unresponsive to any conventional treatments. The Ethics Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. The Clinical Trial Registration was IRCT2013111915455N1.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Treatment protocol</title><p>Three sessions of FMR treatment carried by using a novel applicator (INFINI TM; Lutronic, Goyang, Korea) at 3-week intervals of one side; the other side functioned as a sham control when the device was on standby mode. The applicator of the INFINI consists of rows of 49 insulated microneedles over an area of 10 mm that sent 1 MHz of RF current in a fractional manner that extends below the surface of the skin. The starch iodine test was used to outline the area of excessive sweating. For this procedure, iodine solution was applied to a dry surface on the skin and then corn starch was sprinkled over the area. The patients were asked to sit for 15 min in a room at 23&#x000b0;C. Starch and iodine interact in the presence of sweat leaving blue-black sediment. After marking the hyperhidrotic area accompanied starch-iodine test, all subjects were pretreated by a topical eutectic mixture of 2.5% lidocaine hydrochloric acid and 2.5% prilocaine (EMLA; Astra-Zeneca, Sodertalje, Sweden) under occlusion 45 min prior to FMR treatment to induce anesthesia. The skin was cleansed with alcohol and allowed to dry completely. The target areas were treated with a total of three passes. The treatment included the following parameters: (1) A depth of 2&#x02013;3 mm; (2) a time range of 120&#x02013;180 ms, (3) an energy level of 6&#x02013;10, with a small range (&#x000b1;10%) of energy and time settings determining the optimal parameters for the population being treated. Ice packs were applied during treatment and for 10 min after FMR therapy to reduce heat damage to the epidermis. At the end of treatment, the treated area was covered with sterile vaseline gauze. The use of topical zinc oxide several times daily for a few days after each treatment session was recommended to promote local healing. All patients were subjected at baseline and posttreatment after 3, 6, and 9 weeks, as well as 3 months.</p></sec><sec id="sec3-3"><title>Outcome assessments</title><p>Photographic documentation of starch-iodine test (Canon power shot G12, Cannon components Inc., Japan) for each patient before and after the course of treatment was done to compare and evaluate the clinical response by means of the area of discoloration.

Although both interventions had similar efficacy, botulinum toxin injections are considered temporary, lasting only 3&#x02013;6 months.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>Novel bipolar RF devices can destroy eccrine glands by a process of thermolysis at the interface of the deep dermis and subcutis while minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The results demonstrate that microwave technology is well suited for targeting sweat glands while allowing for the protection of both upper skin layers and the structures beneath the subcutaneous fat.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Hong <italic>et al</italic>. reported that microwave devices had long-term effects (12 months) on the treatment of PAH. In their study of 31 adults with PAH, at the 12-month follow-up visit, 90.3% had HDSS scores of 1 or 2 and 90.3% had a minimum 50% reduction in axillary sweat from baseline.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In a large, multicenter, randomized, sham-controlled clinical trial by Glaser <italic>et al</italic>., 120 adult subjects were randomized to either a treatment group or a sham group. Patients were treated in two sessions spaced 2 weeks apart, with the primary efficacy measure as the percentage that had their HDSS scores reduced to 1 or 2. The results for the treatment group were as follows: 89% at 30-days posttreatment, 67% at 6-months, and 69% at 12-months. In the sham group, a significant difference was observed at 30-days and 6 months.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Similarly, in their study using a microwave device on Asian subjects, Lee <italic>et al</italic>. showed a 2-point drop or greater in HDSS in 83.3% of subjects (10/12 axillae) as measured at the 7-month follow-up.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Our results suggest that HDSS scores increased in some cases after a 1 year follow-up, which indicates that repeated sessions of FMR therapy may be warranted. In addition, the significant correlations between HDSS score and BMI indicate that dermatologists should be aware of the potential for reduced effectiveness of FMR in patients with more amount of subcutaneous adiposity. The probable mechanism for this phenomenon is that, in these patients, the subcutaneous adipose hindered the delivery of heat to the sweat glands, which were not completely destroyed. Hence, repeated sessions are necessary to achieve successful treatment in overweight individuals.</p><p>In this study, 3 patients did not respond to the treatment. There were not any significant differences between ages, the age of onset, duration of disease, BMI, and family history. This phenomenon is probability related to genetic background and amount of subcutaneous adiposity in axilla area which lead to insufficient delivery of FMR. Further studies are needed for more information in this regard. Our results showed that the BMI is a significant factor in the durability of treatment. Hence, it is necessary to consider the BMI factor in this treatment method.</p><p>Among the side effects analyzed in this study, posttreatment inflammation was the notable problem; however, it spontaneously resolved within 2 months. All of the side effects, including pain and pruritus, however, frequent, were acceptable and temporary. Similarly, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. reported numbness and compensatory hyperhidrosis in the treatment of PAH with FMR in 1 and 2 patients, respectively.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>It is recommended that future studies compare FMR, a noninvasive treatment modality to permanent surgical interventions. FMR treatment appears to be a safe and effective treatment alternative for moderate to severe PAH. It is suggested that repeated sessions of FMR be considered to achieve a complete response.
