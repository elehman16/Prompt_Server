The predominantly expressed protein peak at 11480 Da was the primary splitter regardless of one- or two-stage analysis.

Although advances in non-invasive imaging have improved its detection, &#x0003e; 75% of lung cancer patients present with advanced stages, when therapeutic options are limited[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Even patients who present with clinical stage I have at best a 60% 5-year survival rate, signifying that a large percentage of patients regardless of stage have undetectable metastatic disease at the time of presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Early detection is the most important factor to improve survival. However, the current tools used for early detection are non-satisfactory in accuracy and timing, despite routine chest X-ray, computed tomography, bronchoscopy, sputum cytology, and tumor markers. Current serum biomarkers are convenient but lack of adequate sensitivity and/or specificity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Better biomarkers are needed for screening, follow-up, and differential diagnosis.</p><p>SELDI-TOF-MS is currently one of the techniques used for cancer biomarker screening, including ovarian, breast, prostate, and liver cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. SELDI profiling reportedly detects lung cancer from healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and most of the SELDI profiling comes from analyzing samples from cancer patients and healthy individuals. However, inflammatory reaction is commonly associated with lung cancer diagnosis. Many identified serum peaks turn out to be the fragments of acute phase proteins. Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a sample of acute phase protein that has been detected by SELDI study. It belonged to a family of apolipoproteins and is reported as a serum biomarker of lung cancer and other malignancies, as well as many inflammatory diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>A positive association between previous lung disease, such as chronic bronchitis or pneumonia, with lung cancer has been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Pneumonia frequently co-exists when lung cancer is diagnosed. A study shows that &#x0003e; 50% of newly-proved lung cancer patients have been diagnosed within 3 months after hospitalization for pneumonia[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A history of previous lung disease, including asthma, chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, is associated with significantly increased risk of lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Thus, differentiating lung cancer from inflammatory disease is an important concern. The impact of inflammatory disease on the detection of lung cancer by SELDI profile has not been highlighted. This study aimed to improve the detection accuracy of lung cancer by SELDI in mixed individuals, those who are healthy and those with inflammatory disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and samples</title><p>The serum samples from cancer patients were collected from the Department of Chest Medicine of Shin Kong Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital.

The serum was distributed into 100 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>l aliquots and stored frozen at -80&#x000b0;C until analysis. A total of 221 serum specimens were collected. In the 118 cancer patients (80 males and 38 females), histologic distribution were 27 squamous cell carcinomas, 71 adenocarcinomas, 9 small cell cancers, and 11 others. Patients with inflammation (23 males and 8 females) included 15 pneumonia, 6 tuberculosis, and 10 urinary tract infection patients. None of them had any evidence of malignancy. The 72 healthy controls (39 males and 33 females) came from general survey of health were used as normal control and had no cancer history or acute/chronic inflammatory disease.</p><p>The serum specimens were randomly assigned to a training group and testing group by a 3:2 ratio from the three sets of patients. Thus, the training group had 71 cancer patients (40 adenocarcinoma, 19 squamous cell carcinoma, 5 small cell carcinoma, and 7 other types), 46 healthy controls, and 17 inflammatory disease patients. The testing group has 47 cancer patients (31 adenocarcinoma, 8 squamous cell carcinoma, 4 small cell carcinoma, and 4 other types).

The CM10 ProteinChip Arrays incorporated a carboxylate group that acted as a weak cation exchanger. The chips were put in a bioprocessor (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.), which allowed larger volumes of serum to each chip array. Within the bioprocessor, the chips were equilibrated for 15 min in 150 &#x003bc;l binding/washing buffer (100 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0) per well. Six-microliter serum samples were denatured in 12 &#x003bc;l urea buffer (9 M urea, 2% CHAPS, and 50 mM Tris). Then, 220 &#x003bc;l of binding buffer were added to the serum mixture, and 100 &#x003bc;l of the denatured, diluted serum were randomly applied to each chip spot. The bioprocessor was then sealed and shaken at a speed of 400 rpm on a platform shaker for 30 min.</p><p>After the incubation, the bioprocessor was washed with 150 &#x003bc;l of washing buffer in each well. This step was repeated three times, and each time the binding buffer was discarded by inverting the bioprocessor on a paper towel. The bioprocessor was rinsed with 1 mmol/l HEPES and the chips were removed from the bioprocessor. After the arrays were air-dried, 1 &#x003bc;l of 50% saturated matrix solution (sinapinic acid in 50% acetonitrile and 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid) was applied on the array and allowed to air dry. Arrays were analyzed using a ProteinChip Reader (ProteinChip PBS IIC, Ciphergen Biosystems Inc.), with the following settings: laser intensity 185, detector sensitivity 9, and molecular mass range 2,000-20,000 Da. Analysis were performed in duplicate on serum specimens from each patient in the study group. Mass accuracy was calibrated externally using the all-in-one peptide molecular mass standard (Ciphergen Biosystems, Inc.).</p></sec><sec><title>Peak Detection, Data Analysis, and Decision Tree Classification</title><p>Peak detection was performed using Ciphergen ProteinChip Software, version 3.0.2 (Ciphergen Biosystems). The spectra were normalized to total ion current intensity of m/z between 2,000 and 20,000, and baselines were subtracted. The part of the spectrum with m/z values &#x0003c; 2,000 was eliminated for analysis, since the energy absorbing matrix signal usually interfered with peak detection in this range. ProteinChip Software auto-detected the peaks to clusters between 2,000 and 20,000 m/z ratios with a signal-to-noise ratio of &#x0003e; 5. The cluster mass window was 0.3% of mass. The peaks clustered using second-pass peak selection with signal-to-noise ratio &#x0003e; 2. The M/Z values that were within the 0.3% mass accuracy window were regarded as equal between replicates. In order to minimize data variation data between multiple samples, the peak intensity values were logarithmically transformed.</p><p>Based on the peak intensities of each signal cluster, three decision trees were constructed from the training groups. For each sample, the intensity values for each peak within the 2,000-20,000 m/z range were inputted into the Biomarker Patterns Software (Ciphergen Biosystems) and classified according to the tree analysis described. A data set was divided into two nodes by tree analysis pattern, using one rule at a time in the form of a question. The presence or absence, and the intensity levels of one peak defined the splitting decision. This splitting process continued until the terminal nodes or leaves were produced or further splitting had no gain. Classification of terminal nodes was determined by the group ("class") of samples (i.e., lung cancer, healthy, or inflammatory) representing the majority of samples in that node. Peaks selected by this process formed the splitting rules to achieve the maximum reduction of cost in the two descendant nodes.</p></sec><sec><title>Serum SAA determination</title><p>Serum levels of SAA were measured in human serum samples using a commercial enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Invitrogen, Camarillo, CA, USA), according to the manufacturers' instructions. ELISA tests were performed in triplicate on serum specimens from each patient in the study group. SAA levels were assayed in serum diluted by a factor of 200. If the absorbance readings exceeded the linear range of the standard curves, the ELISA assay was repeated after serial dilution of the supernatants.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The SPSS software version 13.0 (SPSS INC.,Chicago, IL, USA) or Ciphergen ProteinChip Software, version 3.0.2 was used for statistical analysis and results were expressed as mean &#x000b1; SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by using a two-tailed Student's t test and <italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Ten protein peaks randomly selected over the course of the study were used to calculate the coefficient of variance (CV) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The reproducibility of the SELDI spectra was determined, both within and between arrays (intra-assay and inter-assay, respectively). The inter-assay (chip to chip) CV was 17.9% (14.9% to 20.3%) for peak intensity and 0.08% (0.056% to 0.102%) for mass accuracy (peak range: 5902-17340).

This analysis identified 51 signal peak protein clusters, seen in the spectrum representations of the two groups (cancer and non-cancer) within the 2,000 to 20,000 m/z range. No single peak could adequately discriminate lung cancer sera from healthy sera and inflammatory disease patients.</p><p>Using the spectrum, a decision tree classification algorithm was built and three protein peaks at 11480, 8802 and 3185 Da were automatically selected as splitters (<italic>p </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05, for each). The 11480 Da peak was used as the root node in the classification tree to divide the 134 samples into two groups (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).

The two-stage training set had a sensitivity of 80.3% (57/71) and specificity of 88.8% (56/63) in the training set, which was 70.1% (33/47) and 80% (32/40), respectively, in the test group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).

In first-stage training set, the peak was 11480 Da protein.

In the second-stage training set, the protein peaks with 12580, 6836, and 3185 Da was used to separate cancer patients from non-cancer inflammatory disease. The average peak intensity of 12580 was higher in lung cancer patients and health controls, but relatively lower in inflammatory disease patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). The predominately expressed protein peak at 11480 Da was the primary splitter (distinguishing factor) in all classification trees generated to separate healthy individuals, which were most likely to have SAA with average m/z countered around this area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The splitting peaks in two-stage training protocol and the density peaks of these two proteins in all sera samples</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>The first splitting peak from the first-stage training set marker showing a protein peak marker of 11480 Da on the CM10 chip (vertical line).

Using a two-stage training process can effectively improve the discrimination of lung cancer from inflammatory disease. The purer and simpler clinical sample classification in the test group can achieve more reliability in the final decision tree made by SELDI. Although it seems to be a simple idea, it has not been clearly validated in previous SELDI literature.</p><p>Currently, there are no satisfactory serum biomarkers suitable for screening and early diagnosis of lung cancer. SELDI is a high through-put technique used to generate protein expression profiles which, in combination with bioinformatics tools to extract information for biomarker discovery, has been essential in identifying novel protein biomarkers. The SELDI-TOF-MS analysis is divided into a pattern discovery and a pattern-matching phase. This technology has shown great potential for the early detection of ovarian, breast, prostate, liver and lung cancers from healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It is generally believed that the training samples should include randomly selected subjects without cancer and subjects with cancer for analysis.</p><p>Nonetheless, most of the studies focus on distinguishing cancer patients from healthy controls. Because inflammatory diseases are commonly associated with cancer patients and malignancies are often connected to inflammatory response for the host, the inclusion of benign disease connected to an inflammatory response is crucial in obtaining a cancer profile. This study investigates not only the influence of inflammatory disease in the differential diagnosis of lung cancer but also point out that a two-stage decision process is more accurate than a single-step process.</p><p>In the current study, peaks at 11480, 4466, 9284, 13749 kDa are over-expressed in the lung cancer group, which can be distinguished from healthy individuals and is compatible with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In previous studies, Han et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] used SELDI-TOF protein analysis to distinguish lung cancer patients from healthy individuals and demonstrated high sensitivity (89%, 81 of 89) and specificity (91%, 86 of 96). That study suggested the use of tumor markers such as CEA. However, inflammatory disease will interfere with the detection of lung cancer by SELDI analysis if this method is applied clinically. The current study is therefore designed to evaluate the influence of inflammatory disease and use a novel two-stage method to improve the detection rate.</p><p>Yang et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] used SELDI proteomic pattern to distinguish lung cancer and healthy individuals using a one-stage decision tree. They demonstrated good sensitivity (86.9%, 73 of 84) and specificity (80%. 24 of 30). But how the inflammatory status contaminated their lung cancer samples can't be evaluated in their study. According to our results, subjects not belonging to "pure healthy" population will have to go through another 3 protein discrimination at 12580, 6836, and 3185 kDa obtained from the secondary stage training with the population of lung cancer and inflammatory disease to further distinguished lung cancer. Follow-up peaks identification and validations are needed.</p><p>The peak of 11480 Da is suspected to be SAA from similar m/z size. The m/z of SAA ranges from 11400 to 11800 Da in different studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. SAA is a non-specific inflammatory marker found in inflammatory diseases and is elevated in many malignancies, such as ovarian, prostate, renal, and lung cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Both SAA levels and peak 11480 intensity levels have similar AUC from ROC curve analysis from the samples here, which may serve as indirect evidence that SAA mimics protein peak 11480 Da [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. This study aimed to increase the detection accuracy by partitioning analysis into two stages. We found that protein peak 11480 Da was the primary splitter regardless one- or two-stage analysis. It should be important to perform protein identification about this peak because proteins other than SAA may also give a peak of this m/z. SAA is a non-specific acute phase protein induced by host inflammatory response to stimuli from liver. Recently, SAA is found to be highly expressed in lung cancer tissue and it can be induced when lung cancer cells are cocultured with macrophage or cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. These properties may place SAA an important role for tumor pathogenesis within tumor microenvironment[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Elevated SAA may be a primary product of tumor cells as well as hepatocytes. We believed SAA can be served as clinical biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis and treatment guidance but not diagnosis. This opinion warrants further investigation.</p><p>Screening biomarker patterns for diagnosis of lung cancer using SELDI-TOF has been hindered by the false-positive results due to inflammatory disease. These concerns become significant when clinically applied for cancer screening. Our study provided a simple idea of using two-stage method to lower the influence of inflammatory disease. Although it seems like a simple idea, it has not been clearly validated in previous SELDI literature. So we hope the manuscript may contribute something in this regard. Reproducibility in different laboratories by different investigators, even with the same chips, will remain difficult to standardize and validate. There is still a long way to go before the SELDI platform can be used as a clinical diagnostic tool.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study reveals the influence of inflammatory disease in the detection of lung cancer using the SELDI profile, which needs to be considered given the increasing use of proteomics for cancer diagnosis. It is possible to examine mass spectra derived from a two-stage decision tree as shown here. The two-stage test sample stratification based on inflammatory status will improve the false positive rate and be more useful in differentiating lung cancer patients from healthy and non-cancer inflammatory disease populations.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PSH wrote the main manuscript and performed the data analysis.
