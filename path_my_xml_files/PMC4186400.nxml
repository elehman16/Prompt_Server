Three groups of male subjects received as randomly assigned ascending single XG-102 doses (10, 40, and 80 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg; 6 subjects per dose) or placebo (2 subjects per dose) as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 60 min. Safety and tolerability were assessed by physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiography, eye examination, clinical laboratory tests and adverse events (AEs). PK was analyzed using noncompartmental methods. All reported AEs were mild to moderate and neither their number nor their distribution by System Organ Class suggest a dose relationship. Only headache and fatigue were considered probably or possibly study drug related. Headache frequency was similar for active and placebo, consequently this was not considered to be drug related but probably to study conditions. The other examinations did not show clinically relevant deviations or trends suggesting a XG-102 relationship. Geometric mean half-life was similar among doses, ranging from 0.36 to 0.65 h. Geometric mean XG-102 AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> increased more than linearly with dose, 90% confidence intervals (CIs) did not overlap for the two highest doses. Geometric mean dose normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> values suggest a more than linear increase with dose but 90% CIs overlap. It may be concluded that XG-102 single IV doses of 10&#x02013;80 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/kg administered over 1 h to healthy male subjects were safe and well tolerated.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Clinical study</kwd><kwd>healthy volunteers</kwd><kwd>infusion</kwd><kwd>intravenous</kwd><kwd>phase I</kwd><kwd>PK</kwd><kwd>safety</kwd><kwd>tolerability</kwd><kwd>XG-102</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Broad cellular activities are partly mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and their intracellular-induced signaling pathway (Kim and Choi <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).

The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade is activated mainly by cellular stresses (Keshet and Seger <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) including genotoxic, osmotic, hypoxic, or oxidative stress and by proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1; and interleukin (IL)-1&#x003b2; (Kim and Choi <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic representation of JNK signaling. The JNK pathway is activated in multiple cells by various extracellular factors (including stresses and cytokines) and is involved in different cellular processes through multiple intracellular signaling. Extracellular factors lead to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinases (MAPKKKs). MAPKKK activates either MAP kinase kinase 4 or 7; both MAPKK4/7 activates the JNKs MAPK. JNK activation leads to specific substrates activation and subsequent cell transcription.

JNK inhibition has also been shown to decrease the formation of autophagic vesicles under conditions of endoplasmic reticulum stress (Bogoyevitch et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>The main CNS diagnoses where JNK activation was observed include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), stroke, brain contusion, brain injury, spinal cord contusion, and brain artery occlusion (Shoji et al. <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>; Zhu et al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Savage et al. <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Borsello et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Zhuang et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Colombo et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ortolano et al. <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Bessero et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Braithwaite et al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kim and Choi <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Michel-Monigadon et al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Nijboer et al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Spigolon et al. <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Antoniou et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Armstead et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Mehan et al. <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sclip et al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Navon et al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Repici et al. <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sabapathy <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) while the main cardiovascular conditions where JNK activation was observed include coronary events suggestive of ischemia and heart failure (Milano et al. <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Sabapathy <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). In the hepatobiliary/digestive tract, JNK activation has been observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colitis, hepatic injury, liver ischemia, reperfusion injury, acute liver injury, chronic hepatitis C virus infection, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (Relja et al. <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Han et al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Reinecke et al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Sabapathy <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Seki et al. <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Other diagnoses where JNK was observed includes rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis (Han et al. <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>, <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Guma et al. <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) inner ear injury (Wang et al. <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Eshraghi et al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Omotehara et al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), Behcet's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (Sabapathy <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and diabetes (Bogoyevitch et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Andreasen et al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>).</p><p>Given that the JNK signaling pathway is a very complex and multifactorial pathway involving many intracellular processes and stimulated by many extracellular signals, there are probably many other tissue types and inflammatory processes which have yet to be discovered that activate JNK production (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Consort 2010 flow diagram. Progress of all participants through trial execution (enrollment, allocation, follow-up, and analysis).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="prp20002-e00020-f2"/></fig><p>It has been hypothesized that JNK types may act as a mediator of cell stress responses following their role as regulators of proapoptotic death signaling events. The possible relation between JNK activation and cell death, as revealed by gene knockout and/or the use of JNK inhibitors, has stimulated the development of JNK inhibitors that can prevent cell death.</p><p>The majority of the inflammatory molecules are produced by immune cells activation caused by some non-physiological processes. Example of such molecules include TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-2, E-selectin, and MMP, which are regulated by the transcription factors AP-1 and ATF-2 being controlled by the JNK pathway (Manning and Davis <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Due to the above reasons, there may be a potential for JNK inhibition to treat specific medical conditions of inflammatory origin (Manning and Davis <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Keshet and Seger <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kim and Choi <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>The discovery of the JNK-inhibitory properties of the JNK scaffold protein JIP1, followed by the identification of its minimum inhibitory sequence, has opened a new avenue in the use of JIP1-derived JNK inhibitory peptides (Bogoyevitch et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In the program leading to the drug evaluated in this study, different peptides were obtained by linking the 19-amino acid JNK-binding motif of JIP-1 to the 10-amino acid HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat) transporter sequence. The Tat peptide is one of the cell-penetrating peptides used for intracellular drug delivery (Chen and Harrison <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) as cell penetration capabilities are needed due to the intracellular location of the JNK signaling cascades. JIP-1 and c-Jun share a similar binding motif, but JNK's affinity of binding to JIP-1 is about 100-fold higher.</p><p>In addition to the L-form of the JNK-inhibitory peptide (L-JNKI-1) the protease-resistant all-D-retroinverso form (D-JNKI-1 with a 31 amino acids also named XG-102) was synthesized to expand its half-life in vivo. The use of D-amino acids seemed crucial, especially because the Tat sequence is containing multiple disulfide bonds (six in total) that render it extremely sensitive to the proteases involved in peptide processing in the nervous system (Borsello et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and other organs.</p><p>XG-102 is a protease-resistant peptide composed of 31 amino acids in the D-configuration that selectively inhibits JNK activity in a non-ATP competitive manner.</p><p>The dextrogyre XG-102 peptide has been extensively studied in different pathologies as JNK was clearly demonstrated as being a key player in many inflammatory and/or pathological processes and as the peptide JNK-inhibiting function may have important therapeutic effect in such models. Among all previously cited pathologies, XG-102 demonstrated activity in all different major disease groups and among these in most of the cited JNK implicating pathologies.</p><p>Main groups wherein XG-102 demonstrated specific activity were the following (specific studied pathologies are pointed out): neuronal (AD [Braithwaite et al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Sclip et al. <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Colombo et al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>], brain ischemia [Borsello et al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Esneault et al. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Benakis et al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Bessero et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Bogoyevitch et al. <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Liu et al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Nijboer et al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Antoniou et al. <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Gow et al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>], seizure [Spigolon et al. <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Zhao et al. <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>], retinal excitotoxicity [Bessero et al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>], brain contusion/percussion [Ortolano et al. <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Armstead et al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>], spinal cord injury [Zhuang et al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Repici et al. <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]), cardiovascular (myocardial ischemia reperfusion and/or ischemia [Milano et al. <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>]), digestive (IBD [Reinecke et al. <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>]), and auditive (ear injury [Wang et al. <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Eshraghi et al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Omotehara et al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>]).</p><p>In addition to the above experiments, in the rat model of uveitis induced by footpad injection of endotoxin, treatment with XG-102 by either the IV or the intravitreal route just before endotoxin administration significantly decreased the uveitis clinical scores, the numbers of infiltrating inflammatory cells and the inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in the eye as compared to vehicle (Touchard et al. <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Those results were a clear demonstration of the potential for treating inflammation and subsequent inflammation-related diseases with the specific XG-102 compound. Besides the impressive positive results in this ocular inflammation model, the results need to be confirmed in clinical trials demonstrating safety (phase I) and efficacy (phase II ongoing).</p><p>Human experience at the time this study was planned included the following processes:</p><sec><title>Intratympanic administration</title><p>A small study with AM-111 (specific XG-102 intratympanic formulation) applied intratympanically for acute acoustic trauma (firecrackers induced) in which it was safe and well tolerated but the small number of patients (<italic>N</italic> = 11) and the comparison limited to two AM-111 dose levels preclude conclusions on efficacy (Suckfuell et al. <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>).</p><p>A phase II study with AM-111 applied intratympanically for acute sensorineural hearing loss that was completed in October 2012 (NCT00802425).</p></sec><sec><title>Systemic administration</title><p>A first-in-man study was performed in patients having sustained either a stroke or a transient ischemic attack (TIA). The study was performed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose escalation trial. In total, 10 patients participating in this trial were randomized in a 4:1 ratio (four active and one placebo patients). Two doses of XG-102 were evaluated in this study given in a single IV infusion. None of the patients allocated XG-102 showed signs of acute intolerance at either the start or during the study treatment infusion. The observed reactions were of different types: cardiac disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders, and administration site conditions, metabolism and nutrition disorders, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, vascular disorders, blood and lymphatic system disorders, ear and labyrinth disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, respiratory and mediastinal disorders, nervous system disorders, and investigations. None of the reported adverse events (AEs) were considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment and the severity of the majority of the reported events was considered to be mild. The AEs did not show any temporal pattern or dose-response relationship suggesting a relationship to XG-102 but this affirmation has to be read within the constraints of the limited available sample size (Unpublished data on file, Xigen SA).</p></sec><sec><title>Subconjunctival administration</title><p>A phase Ib with XG-102 administered subconjunctivally in patients with post surgery or post traumatic intraocular inflammation was conducted as a monocenter, open-labeled, multiple-dose escalation trial. A total of 20 patients were included in the study, divided into four groups (one dose per group was tested given in a single subconjunctival injection) of five patients. Patients were followed up for 4 weeks to collect safety and tolerance data. Patients' follow-up was 100%. None of the patients allocated XG-102 showed signs of intolerance at either time during the study and observed AEs (different types of reactions were observed: blood and lymphatic system disorders, general disorders and administration site conditions, ocular disorders, and investigations) were not attributed to drug study and for those existing they were rated as mild or moderate degree (for two of them) [Unpublished data on file, Xigen SA].</p><p>A phase II is currently ongoing with XG-102 administered subconjunctivally in patients with post surgery inflammation.

No serious AEs were reported. Neither the number of reported AEs in each System Organ Class nor the number of reports for each individual AE suggest a dose-response relationship to XG-102 (Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">4</xref>).</p><p>Five AEs, reported by five subjects, were considered by the investigator to be probably or possibly related to the study drug, and of these five subjects, two had received placebo (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">5</xref>).</p><p>During blinded causality assignments, headache was considered related to the study drug. Upon unblinding, headache frequency was found to be similar for XG-102 and placebo and no headache was reported with the highest 80 &#x003bc;g/kg XG-102 dose. Fatigue was the only other AE considered to have a possible or probable relationship to the study drug. Fatigue was reported by one subject (treated with 80 &#x003bc;g/kg XG-102), at 30 min post dose, but it was graded as mild and resolved without treatment after 15 min (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">5</xref>) (there was no clinically significant finding in vital signs at the same time).</p><p>Clinical laboratory examinations, vital signs, and ECG including cardiac monitoring evaluations did not show any clinically relevant deviation from their normal ranges or numerical trends with a dose-response relationship or temporal pattern which may suggest a relationship to the administration of XG-102.</p><p>In the XG-102 PK evaluation, XG-102 body weight-normalized V<sub>ss</sub> (geometric mean ranging from 168 to 217 mL/kg in the different doses [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">6</xref>]) is similar or slightly higher (13.7&#x02013;29.8%) than the expected value of 19% of total body weight for extracellular water and higher than the expected values of 4% and 8% of body weight expected for the plasma and the blood volume, respectively (Gibaldi <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>) suggesting a relatively wide extravascular distribution.</p><p>The geometric mean by dose of <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and MRT ranged from 0.36 to 0.65 h and from 0.76 to 1.02 h (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl6">6</xref>), respectively, showing a rapid disappearance of XG-102 from the plasma. MRT and <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> do not clearly differ among doses. The results of this study do not allow deciding whether this rapid t<sub>1/2</sub> corresponds to an initial phase or to the actual terminal phase of the PK profile.</p><p>XG-102 <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) increased with dose. The geometric mean values with 90% CIs for dose-normalized AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl7">7</xref>), demonstrate a more than linear increase in AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> with dose (no overlap in the 90% CIs) in the 40&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;g/kg range. Data are suggestive but inconclusive for the 10&#x02013;40 &#x003bc;g/kg dose range (overlapping 90% CIs, but the geometric mean dose-normalized AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> after 10 &#x003bc;g/kg is lower than after 40 &#x003bc;g/kg).</p><p>For dose-normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, all 90% CIs for the geometric mean after the different doses overlap. The geometric mean dose-normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for the 80 &#x003bc;g/kg dose is higher than and outside the 90% CIs for the geometric mean dose-normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for the other doses, suggesting that there may be an increasing trend in <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>/dose, which is not conclusively demonstrated due to the small sample size (six subjects per dose).</p><p>The intersubject variability in the PK parameters is moderate after 10 and 40 &#x003bc;g/kg doses (geometric mean CV% for most parameters approximately in the 15&#x02013;30% range, exceptions are <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> and nonbody weight-normalized <italic>V</italic><sub>ss</sub> at the lower dose, the latter potentially due to the short quantitation period). In subjects treated with the highest 80 &#x003bc;g/kg dose, intersubject variability was higher, approximately in the 29&#x02013;44% range, other than for MRT. This higher variability may be an effect of the low sample size or of the observed nonlinearities.</p><p>The geometric mean CV% of body weight and nonbody weight-normalized CL and <italic>V</italic><sub>ss</sub> are similar, suggesting that body weight normalization of the XG-102 dose had limited efficacy in decreasing the interindividual variability in exposure. However, the study design and the available sample size only allow a tentative evaluation of this issue.</p><p>The study population features, summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>, and the subject compliance with all inclusion and exclusion criteria makes unlikely that baseline subject condition has had an undue influence in the study results. Likewise, the administered previous and concomitant medications would not be expected to interfere with the study medication and its evaluation.</p><p>This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, and PK of XG-102 in male healthy subjects, who were all of Western European descent. Due to these reasons, the applicability of the data shown here to other populations (female subjects, subjects from other racial origin, patient populations&#x02026;) cannot be assumed and has to be evaluated by future studies.</p><p>Regarding PK, it may be concluded that after the end of XG-102 IV infusion, plasma concentrations quickly decreased, as shown by a short <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> (geometric mean ranging from 0.36 to 0.65 h at the different doses for <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>). XG-102 AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> increased in a more than linear proportion with dose, with nonoverlapping 90% CI for the geometric mean dose-normalized AUC<sub>0&#x02013;last</sub> between the 40 and 80 &#x003bc;g/kg doses and only limited overlap between the 10 and 40 &#x003bc;g/kg doses. XG-102 <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> also appeared to increase in a more than linear proportion with dose but results are inconclusive as the geometric mean dose-normalized <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> for the 80 &#x003bc;g/kg dose higher than and outside the 90% CI for the other dose groups, but the 90% CIs overlap among all dose levels.</p><p>We can conclude from this study that XG-102 was safe and well tolerated when administered as single IV doses of 10&#x02013;80 &#x003bc;g/kg over 1 h to healthy male subjects. XG-102 pharmacokinetics was evaluated with a geometric mean half-life of XG-102 in plasma ranging from 0.36 to 0.65 H. The incidence of AEs in subjects who received XG-102 or placebo was similar. No trends suggesting a relationship to XG-102 dose were apparent for any AE. All AEs observed during the study were mild to moderate with no specific dose relationship. There were no clinically significant findings in clinical laboratory data, vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations or ocular examinations (fundus and IOP).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Rolf Pokorny and Michael Seiberling for their support in the realization of the study.
