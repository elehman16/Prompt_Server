Increasing knowledge of anaerobic bacteria as predominant agent in the development of periodontal disease has led to new treatment modalities, aiming primarily at suppression/elimination of specific periodontal pathogens. A less invasive approach in the management of periodontitis is administering an antimicrobial agent into the pocket, which is biodegradable and provides appropriate antimicrobial level for sustained period.</p><p>Recently, a local anti-infective treatment for periodontitis has been introduced that delivers a formulation of 10% doxycycline hyclate to the periodontal pocket in a biodegradable liquid polymer that solidifies on contact with the gingival crevicular fluid. As it biodegrades, this solid implant delivers doxycycline at high levels to the site for 7-14 days.</p><p>Atridox (Atrix Laboratories, NJ) is a recently developed gel system, which incorporates doxycycline in a syringeable gel system. An animal study by Polson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] in beagle dogs initially suggested beneficial aspects of locally delivered doxycycline. Studies undertaken by Polson <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] when compared to sanguinarine indicated that 10% doxycycline hyclate is an effective means of reducing the clinical signs of adult periodontitis, Stoller <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] indicated that this controlled release delivery system displays an appropriate pharmacokinetic profile for the delivery of doxycycline into periodontal pockets, Garrett <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] when compared to scaling and root planing indicated that 10% doxycycline hyclate is equally effective as scaling and root planing in reducing the clinical signs of adult periodontitis, Walker <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] showed that doxycycline treatment significantly reduced the anaerobic population in plaque and did not change the number of resistant bacteria. Most of the studies in literature have excluded aggressive periodontitis cases to assess the efficacy of local doxycycline therapy.</p><p>Therefore, an attempt has been made in this study to evaluate the efficacy of 10% doxycycline hyclate subgingivally delivered gel system in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis and chronic periodontitis with and without scaling and root planing (SRP).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study overview</title><p>A crossover split mouth design was performed. Four patients (both males and females), two diagnosed as aggressive periodontitis and two as chronic periodontitis were selected from outpatient Department of Periodontics, College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India. This study reports the results of the relative clinical efficacy of each of three periodontal treatments over a 90 day period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Screening procedures</title><p>Eligibility was determined by conducting a periodontal evaluation at pre-baseline screening visits to assess current disease status, periodontal treatment history, and medical history. Subjects were included if they gave signed consent, have diagnosed as aggressive periodontitis and chronic periodontitis (American Academy of Periodontology (AAP) -1999), at least two quadrants where each of these quadrants contained periodontal pockets measuring &#x02265;5 mm and &#x02264;7 mm with bleeding gentle on probing on clinical examination, and radiographic evidence of bone loss. Sites with these criteria were termed as tests sites.</p><p>The following criteria excluded subject participation in the study suffering from known systemic disease, if they had contraindicated medications, pregnancy or active lactation, using chemotherapeutics during past six months, allergy to periodontal dressing, known hypersensitive to doxycycline or lignocaine and if they have received any surgical or non &#x02013; surgical periodontal therapy for the past six months of the baseline visits. Ethical clearance was obtained from the ethical committee of College of Dental Sciences, Davangere, Karnataka, India. All participants gave informed consent.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Treatment procedure</title><p>A split mouth design was used in this study for the delivery of treatment.
