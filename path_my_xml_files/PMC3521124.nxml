A range of interventions including imaginal exposure and elaboration of the trauma memory in its autobiographical context are effective in reducing such unwanted memories. This study explored whether priming for stimuli that occur in the context of trauma and evaluative conditioning may play a role in the therapeutic effects of these procedures. Healthy volunteers (<italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;122) watched analogue traumatic and neutral picture stories.

A blurred picture identification task showed that neutral objects that preceded traumatic pictures in the stories were subsequently more readily identified than those that had preceded neutral stories, indicating enhanced priming. There was also an evaluative conditioning effect in that participants disliked neutral objects that had preceded traumatic pictures more.

A range of therapeutic interventions are effective in reducing such unwanted memories (for reviews see <xref rid="bib6 bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra, &#x00026; Westen, 2005; Bisson et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>). These include imaginal reliving of the trauma (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Foa &#x00026; Rothbaum, 1998</xref>) and cognitive interventions designed to increase the elaboration of the traumatic experience in terms of linking it with its context of other autobiographical information (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &#x00026; Clark, 2000</xref>). This raises the question of what memory processes are involved in unwanted memories of trauma and their successful treatment.</p><p>This study focuses on two memory processes that may be involved in the triggering of unwanted trauma memories: perceptual priming and evaluative conditioning. Interest in perceptual priming was generated by clinical observations suggesting that a particularly wide range of stimuli can trigger unwanted trauma memories (e.g., <xref rid="bib7 bib20" ref-type="bibr">Brewin, Dalgleish, &#x00026; Joseph, 1996; Foa, Steketee, &#x00026; Rothbaum, 1989</xref>). Interview and questionnaire studies suggested that triggers are often perceptually similar to the intrusive content or to stimuli that signalled the onset of these moments from the trauma (<xref rid="bib13 bib14 bib35 bib40" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers, Hackmann, &#x00026; Michael, 2004; Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2002; Michael, Ehlers, Halligan, &#x00026; Clark, 2005; Southwick et&#x000a0;al., 1993</xref>). For example, a patient with PTSD kept seeing headlights coming towards him, just like he had seen them shortly before his head-on car crash. Observations in therapy suggested that these intrusions were often triggered by round patches of light on a dark surface, (e.g., a patch of sunlight on a lawn, white spots on a dark cloth). <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark (2000)</xref> suggested that the easy triggering of reexperiencing in PTSD by perceptually similar cues is in part a function of <italic>strong perceptual priming</italic> for stimuli that occurred shortly before and during the traumatic event.</p><p>Some studies have tested the hypothesis that stimuli that are associated with the trauma are more strongly primed in people with PTSD than in those without PTSD. Participants encoded trauma-related and control stimuli (mainly words or sentences) and priming was tested later with word-stem completion or perceptual identification tasks. The results mostly support the hypothesis of greater perceptual priming for material associated with the trauma in people with PTSD compared those without PTSD (<xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib17 bib32 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Amir, Leiner, &#x00026; Bomyea, 2010; Amir, McNally, &#x00026; Wiegartz, 1996; Ehring &#x00026; Ehlers, in press; McNally &#x00026; Amir, 1996; Michael, Ehlers, &#x00026; Halligan, 2005</xref>, but see <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">McNally &#x00026; Amir, 1996</xref> for negative results). Priming for trauma-related words predicted PTSD severity 6 months later (<xref rid="bib17 bib34 bib35" ref-type="bibr">Ehring &#x00026; Ehlers, in press; Michael, Ehlers, &#x00026; Halligan, 2005; Michael, Ehlers, Halligan, &#x00026; Clark, 2005</xref>). These experiments investigated post-trauma priming and thus supported a role of priming in the maintenance of intrusive memories and generalization of triggers, but they did not investigate perceptual priming during the trauma.</p><p>Experimental analogue studies provided initial support for the role of perceptual priming in the development of analogue intrusive trauma memories in healthy controls (<xref rid="bib4 bib16 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Arntz, de Groot, &#x00026; Kindt, 2005; Ehlers, Michael, Chen, Payne, &#x00026; Shan, 2006; Michael &#x00026; Ehlers, 2007</xref>). For example, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et&#x000a0;al. (2006)</xref> developed an experimental paradigm to study visual perceptual priming for stimuli that occur&#x000a0;in a traumatic context. The paradigm investigates priming for neutral objects that occur just before something &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; happens. Participants watch a series of &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; and neutral picture stories. The content of the first picture is unemotional. It contains neutral preceding stimuli (e.g. a cushion) for which memory is later tested. During the second picture, either something &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; (e.g., a man being attacked with a knife) or something neutral happens. The last picture focuses on the outcome of the story for the main character (e.g., the attacked man is being decapitated). In accordance with the enhanced perceptual priming hypothesis, the results showed that neutral stimuli preceding a &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; event showed enhanced perceptual priming and predicted intrusive memories (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael and Ehlers (2007)</xref> replicated these results with a somewhat modified set of picture stories and further showed that a post-&#x0201c;trauma&#x0201d; experimental manipulation designed to promote autobiographical elaboration of the memory for the picture stories reduced the enhanced perceptual priming effect and the relative probability of subsequent reexperiencing symptoms. This intervention was modeled on procedures used in Cognitive Therapy for PTSD (<xref rid="bib11 bib12 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &#x00026; Clark, 2000; Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2003; Ehlers, Clark, Hackmann, McManus, &#x00026; Fennell, 2005</xref>) that involve accessing the most traumatic moments from the trauma and their meanings, and then explicitly linking them with other information from the patient&#x02019;s experience (or from cognitive restructuring) that give these moments a less threatening meaning.</p><p>Other memory processes of interest in the triggering of unwanted trauma memories are learned associations (e.g., <xref rid="bib11 bib20 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &#x00026; Clark, 2000; Foa et&#x000a0;al., 1989; Keane, Zimering, &#x00026; Caddell, 1985</xref>). It has been suggested that during trauma fear responses become associated with stimuli that are present at the time, and subsequently generalize more broadly to stimuli and situations that resemble the original trauma (Pavlovian conditioning, e.g. <xref rid="bib20 bib27" ref-type="bibr">Foa et&#x000a0;al., 1989; Keane et&#x000a0;al., 1985</xref>). Several studies demonstrated that trauma survivors with PTSD show heightened physiological reactivity to trauma reminders compared to traumatized and non-traumatized controls (see <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Pole, 2007</xref>, for a review). In addition, learned S&#x02013;S associations may play a role (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &#x00026; Clark, 2000</xref>). More generally, there is a large literature on evaluative conditioning (for reviews see <xref rid="bib9 bib24" ref-type="bibr">De Houwer, Thomas, &#x00026; Baeyens, 2001; Hofmann, De Houwer, Perugini, Baeyens, &#x00026; Crombez, 2010</xref>). Evaluative conditioning refers to a change in the valence of a stimulus that is due to the pairing of that stimulus with another positive or negative stimulus. Evaluative conditioning has been shown with explicit measures of valence (e.g. ratings of how much the individual likes the stimulus) as well as implicit measures (e.g. startle responses) (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). Neutral stimuli that people perceive in the context of trauma may thus acquire negative valence via evaluative conditioning and may therefore become triggers of negative affect and unwanted trauma memories in its aftermath. Interestingly, the literature also shows that evaluative conditioning is modifiable by subsequent intervention such as extinction training (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The present experimental analogue study used <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael and Ehlers&#x02019;s (2007)</xref> paradigm to test whether priming for stimuli that occur in the context of trauma and evaluative conditioning may play a role in the therapeutic effects of imaginal exposure and autobiographical memory elaboration on subsequent unwanted trauma memories.

Picture stories and memory tests were presented on a 15&#x02019;&#x02019; screen of an Apple Macintosh computer. The picture stories were the same as in <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael and Ehlers (2007)</xref>. Participants saw eight analogue &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; and eight neutral picture stories, each consisting of three pictures. One additional neutral story (of a man getting drunk) was used to familiarize the participants with the task. The first picture (presented for 20&#x000a0;s) introduced the main character. It was always neutral so that it was not possible to conclude from this picture whether the story was unpleasant or neutral. The first picture contained two neutral objects in the background that were unimportant for the course of the story (<italic>preceding</italic> objects). The second picture (presented for 20&#x000a0;s) depicted the plot of the story and showed something traumatic or neutral happening. It contained one <italic>central</italic> object that was important for the course of the story, and determined whether the content was traumatic or neutral. The third and last picture (presented for 15&#x000a0;s) showed the final outcome for the main character of the story. It focused on and underlined the traumatic versus neutral content of the story. The unpleasant and neutral picture stories were matched for the number of males, females, and objects occurring in them, and whether the event happened indoors or outdoors. For example, one unpleasant story contained a dog killing a man and the matching story depicted a cat stealing a sandwich from its owner.

They were asked to watch the pictures closely and to imagine that they were present at the scene. After each picture story, they were asked to rate the pictures for pleasantness and arousal. There was no indication that memory for the pictures would be tested later.</p><p>Picture stories were presented in two blocks of &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; and neutral stories, in counterbalanced order. Blockwise presentation was chosen to prevent crossover of negative emotions produced by unpleasant picture stories to neutral ones. Order of presentation did not influence the results. Between blocks participants had a 5-min break.

Participants were asked to close their eyes and to visualize the picture stories in their mind&#x02019;s eye as vividly as they could. They were encouraged to visualize as much detail as possible and recall their own feelings and thoughts while holding the images in their mind. They were asked to go through the picture stories in the order they had seen them and to slow down when they came to the ones that they found most disturbing, making sure that they visualized all the details and recalled their feelings and thoughts at the time. The condition lasted 20&#x000a0;min. As a manipulation check, participants were asked every 5&#x000a0;min (via a tape recording) to write down what they had visualized and to rate how vivid the imaginal exposure had been, on a scale from 0 &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; to 10 &#x02018;very much&#x02019;.

Participants were asked to answer five questions in writing, which were designed to facilitate autobiographical memory elaboration. The participants received a sheet of paper with the five questions, as well as oral instructions. The first question asked what the participants had done before they came to the experiment and how they had felt. The second question was whether the experiment had matched the participant&#x02019;s expectations. In the third and fourth questions the participants were asked to think back to the stories and to indicate which ones they liked/disliked most, and whether the stories reminded them of things that had happened in their own lives. The final question asked about any plans that participants had for the rest of the day and how they felt about them. The experimenter reassured the participants that their answers would be treated with the strictest confidentiality. The participants had 20&#x000a0;min to answer the questions, and were instructed to spend the same amount of time on each of the questions. When the time for one question was up, participants were told to move on to the next question.

The first task contained a list of neutral words and participants had to explain the meaning of these words (e.g. &#x02018;connect&#x02019; means &#x02018;join together&#x02019;). The second task contained phrases, and participants had to identify words that were not correctly spelled given the context of the phrase (&#x02018;a honey be&#x02019;). The third task was to identify which word of a group of four was misspelled (investigation, <italic>readilly</italic>, examined, assuming). The fourth task comprised groups of words, and participants had to find the word that was closest in meaning to a word typed above the group (malaria: basement, fever, theatre, fruit, ocean, tune).

To check for possible influences of explicit memory on the pattern of results, participants also completed a recognition test. In designing the memory tests, objects from the picture stories were isolated and edited using Adobe PhotoShop. All objects were left in their original size. As each participant completed both memory tests, two equivalent sets (set 1, set 2) of objects were created for each task. Each set contained one of the preceding objects from each story and, in the recognition task, half of the central objects from unpleasant and neutral scenes. Half of the participants saw objects from set 1 in the perceptual priming task and objects from set 2 in the recognition task. For the other half of the participants, sets were reversed. Picture set did not influence the results.</p><sec id="sec3.2.1"><label>3.2.1</label><title>Perceptual priming task</title><p>A blurred object identification task assessed priming as visual perceptual priming leads to an enhanced identification rate for previously seen objects. In order to decrease the chance that participants noticed that the task was a memory test, only the preceding objects from the stories (8 from &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; and 8 from neutral stories) were included. Furthermore, the majority of items (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24) were unprimed objects that had not featured in the picture stories (e.g., a hole punch, scissors). These unprimed objects were matched for size to the primed objects from the picture stories.</p><p>Participants were told that they were now doing a different task that was unrelated to the picture stories. They were informed that the task was about how easy it is for people to identify blurred pictures. They were instructed to look at the pictures and guess what the object might be, working as quickly and as accurately as possible. The experimenter wrote down the answers, which were later coded for accuracy. If participants could not guess what the object might be, they indicated that they did not know. After their answer, participants moved on to the next object by pressing the space bar.</p><p>The preceding objects from the picture stories were blurred with a Gaussian filter to a degree which allowed approximately 50% correct identification in pilot participants with no prior exposure to the picture stories. The preceding objects shown in the &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; and neutral stories did not differ in baseline identification rates (objects from unpleasant stories: <italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;51.3%, objects from neutral stories: <italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;49.8%, <italic>N</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40 pilot participants, <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael &#x00026; Ehlers, 2007</xref>). The unprimed items were blurred slightly less so that their baseline identification rate was <italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59.7%. This was done to ensure that each participant would identify at least a few unprimed objects, thus reducing the chance that participants would notice that the task tests performance for stimuli from picture stories. <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael and Ehlers (2007)</xref> presented a series of pilot studies showing that there were no differences in priming, recognition memory or emotional evaluations when the objects were presented without their emotional context. Thus, possible memory differences in the present experiment can be interpreted as due to the emotional character of the stories.</p><p>The objects were presented on the computer screen in successive, random order that varied with each participant.</p><p>As the baseline identification rates for the individual objects varied substantially, we calculated the incremental identification probability for each object compared to its baseline identification rate. This method allowed us to obtain for each object a precise measure of how much its identification rate was increased through prior exposure. If the baseline identification rate for an object were, for example, 0.4, then the incremental identification rate would be 0.6 in the case of correct identification and &#x02212;0.4 in the case of non-identification. For objects from picture stories, perceptual priming from prior exposure would show in positive incremental identification probability, whereas unprimed objects (no prior exposure) should be identified at baseline rates, resulting in a mean incremental identification probability of 0.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2.2"><label>3.2.2</label><title>Evaluative conditioning</title><p>To assess evaluative conditioning, participants rated how much they liked each picture of the blurred picture task on a scale from 0 &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; to 100 &#x02018;very much&#x02019;, with 50 representing &#x02018;neutral.&#x02019; <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael and Ehlers (2007)</xref> had shown that participants who had only seen the first picture of the picture stories rated the objects as neutral (objects from trauma stories: <italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;45.20, SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12.77, objects from neutral stories, <italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;44.56, SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12.32; distractor objects, <italic>M</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;44.37, SD&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;11.23).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.2.3"><label>3.2.3</label><title>Recognition task</title><p>The recognition task tested explicit memory performance for objects from the picture stories.

First, intrusive trauma memories often appear to be triggered by cues that are perceptually similar to the intrusions, or to stimuli that immediately preceded the respective sensation during the trauma (e.g., <xref rid="bib11 bib14 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &#x00026; Clark, 2000; Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2002, 2004</xref>). Second, a range of therapeutic interventions including imaginal reliving (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Foa &#x00026; Rothbaum, 1998</xref>) and cognitive interventions designed to increase the elaboration of the traumatic experience and link it with its context of other autobiographical information (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &#x00026; Clark, 2000</xref>) are effective in reducing such unwanted memories. The study explored whether priming for stimuli that occur in the context of trauma and conditioned emotional evaluations may play a role in these therapeutic effects.</p><p>The two memory mechanism under investigation showed the expected pattern of differences between objects that were perceived in the context of trauma and those that occurred in neutral contexts. In line with Hypothesis 1 (enhanced priming effect), the study replicated previous results (<xref rid="bib4 bib16 bib33" ref-type="bibr">Arntz et&#x000a0;al., 2005; Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2006; Michael &#x00026; Ehlers, 2007</xref>) that neutral objects that occur in a &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; context are more strongly primed than comparable stimuli that occur in a neutral context. The results complement those demonstrating that people with PTSD show stronger priming for trauma-related sentences or words than trauma survivors without PTSD (<xref rid="bib3 bib34" ref-type="bibr">Amir et&#x000a0;al., 1996; Michael, Ehlers, &#x00026; Halligan, 2005</xref>). Enhanced priming was experimentally induced by embedding neutral objects in a context of either &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; or neutral picture stories. When presented without this context, the degree of priming for the objects from these scenes did not differ (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael &#x00026; Ehlers, 2007</xref>). Thus, the differences in priming can be attributed to the different emotional context in which the objects occurred. Perceptual priming may be more influenced by stimulus context and possibly interacts more closely with conditioning processes than previously thought (e.g., <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Squire, 2004</xref>). Overall, the results appear to be consistent with theories that emphasize the role of associative learning in perceptual learning (e.g., <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">McLaren &#x00026; Mackintosh, 2000</xref>).</p><p>There has been a debate in the literature on the influence of explicit memory on the performance in implicit memory tasks such as priming tests (e.g., <xref rid="bib26 bib44" ref-type="bibr">Jacoby, Toth, &#x00026; Yonelinas, 1993; Tulving, Schacter, &#x00026; Stark, 1982</xref>). The present study was not designed to address this issue so we cannot conclude with certainty that a pure implicit memory effect was observed. However, the pattern of findings in the recognition test makes it very unlikely that the enhanced priming effect for objects from the &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; stories stemmed from the intentional search for these objects and the use of explicit knowledge. On the basis of eye-witness research (e.g., <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Christianson, 1992</xref>), one may have expected enhanced sensitivity in the recognition test for central objects from &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; stories compared to central objects from neutral stories. This was not the case in this experiment, possibly due to ceiling effects as all participants showed very good sensitivity in recognizing central objects. Importantly, there was no indication of an enhanced sensitivity in recognizing preceding objects from traumatic stories. Furthermore, previous research would suggest that if emotional context has an effect on preceding stimuli, it would be in the direction of poorer rather than better recall (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Christianson, 1992</xref>). Thus, it is extremely unlikely that the enhanced priming effect for these stimuli can be explained by enhanced explicit memory.</p><p>In line with Hypothesis 3 (<italic>evaluative conditioning effect</italic>), participants reported that they liked neutral objects that had preceded the &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; pictures less than those that had preceded neutral pictures. These results are in line with the general literature on evaluative conditioning (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Hofmann et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). They further show that evaluative conditioning can take place even with a single pairing of the conditioned stimulus (preceding object) and unconditioned stimulus (&#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; picture).</p><p>The experimental interventions used for the study were modeled on treatment procedures used in effective treatments of PTSD. As expected (Hypothesis 5, intervention effect on unwanted memories), both interventions decreased the likelihood of subsequent intrusive memories. This result is in line with the effects of imaginal exposure (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Foa, Zoellner, &#x00026; Feeny, 2006</xref>) and cognitive therapy as early interventions for PTSD (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). They suggest that such very early post-trauma interventions may have a role in preventing unwanted memories of the trauma and, possibly, PTSD. The interventions studied here complement other research on the possible prevention of reexperiencing symptoms. While some clinically-derived post-trauma interventions such as psychological debriefing have not shown promising results (e.g., <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Rose, Bisson, &#x00026; Wessely, 2003</xref>), interventions that are based on cognitive science may show greater promise (e.g., <xref rid="bib25 bib28" ref-type="bibr">Holmes, James, Coode-Bate, &#x00026; Deeprose, 2009; Kindt, Soeter, &#x00026; Vervliet, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The effects of the interventions on the two memory mechanisms under investigation differed, as expected. In line with Hypothesis 2 (effects of elaboration on enhanced priming), a post-&#x0201c;trauma&#x0201d; intervention designed to increase the elaboration of the picture stories in the context of the participants&#x02019; other autobiographical experiences eliminated the enhanced priming effect. This result replicates <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael and Ehlers&#x02019;s (2007)</xref> findings. The present study extended the previous results in two respects. First, the study showed that imaginal exposure does not eliminate the enhanced priming effect and thus operates via other mechanisms. Second, the study clarified that memory elaboration appears to operate by enhancing priming for neutral stimuli stimuli rather than by decreasing priming for stimuli from the traumatic context. This finding may have therapeutic implications as it highlights the need to increase awareness of signs that the world is has gone back to normal and is reasonably safe after traumatic experiences. This may be promoted in several ways, for example, stimulus discrimination training to promote awareness that the current environment is different to the trauma, or reclaiming your life assignments to promote access of memories of the non-traumatized self before the trauma (<xref rid="bib11 bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers &#x00026; Clark, 2000; Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In line with Hypothesis 4 (intervention effects on evaluative conditioning), both interventions affected emotional evaluations of the stimulus material from the picture stories. In contrast to the control group who reported to dislike the stimuli from the &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; picture stories more than those from the neutral stories, and thus showed the expected conditioned evaluation effect, participants who had received the interventions gave similar ratings regardless of the context in which they had experienced the objects. This demonstrates that conditioned evaluations can be modified in several ways. The lack of differential ratings to objects from the trauma stories may reduce the probability that negative mood is triggered by similar cues in the environment, which may then trigger trauma memories. It is of interest to note that the intervention groups did not give neutral ratings. Rather, they reported that they disliked objects from <italic>both</italic> sets of stories. The findings parallel research into learned fear responses showing that learned associations are not erased by subsequent extinction training, but can be inhibited (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">LeDoux, 1992</xref>). Both the results for perceptual priming and evaluative conditioning suggest that participants&#x02019; responses to the objects from the &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; stories were relatively unaffected by the interventions. Rather, the interventions facilitated similar responses to the objects from neutral stories. Thus, both interventions may prevent selective responses to trauma reminders in the natural environment.</p><p>The interventions used in this experiment delivered components of complex treatment protocols without the context of a therapeutic relationship to study their pure effects. The pattern of results may be therefore be different for the full treatment programs. For example, the imaginal exposure condition used in this study did not affect priming. This procedure used the visualization component of the <italic>Prolonged Exposure</italic> treatment protocol (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Foa &#x00026; Rothbaum, 1998</xref>) and participants did not give a running commentary about what they were visualizing and did not discuss their experience afterwards. It is possible that an effect on priming would have been observed if participants had verbalized their experience. This would be in line with theories that emphasize the role of creating a trauma narrative in PTSD (<xref rid="bib7 bib21" ref-type="bibr">Brewin et&#x000a0;al., 1996; Foa &#x00026; Riggs, 1993</xref>). Similarly, the memory elaboration condition did not include methods to facilitate access to the most traumatic moments and their meanings that are used in <italic>Cognitive Therapy for PTSD</italic> (<xref rid="bib12 bib46" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et&#x000a0;al., 2003, 2005</xref>), nor other techniques to change problematic meanings such as socratic questioning or behavioral experiments. Including these techniques may have enhanced the effects of the intervention.</p><p>It is noteworthy the term memory elaboration as used in this study differs from the way it is interpreted by <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rubin, Berntsen, and Bohni (2008)</xref>. This study followed <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers and Clark&#x02019;s (2000)</xref> and <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ehlers et&#x000a0;al. (2004)</xref>&#x02019;s hypothesis that a predominance of data-driven (as opposed to conceptual) and a lack of self-referential processing during the trauma leads to a relatively poor elaboration of trauma memories, in particular, a failure to link the worst moments of traumatic experience with other relevant information in autobiographical memory. This is thought to prevent these moments from being updated with other relevant (usually subsequent) information that corrects predictions made at the time such as &#x0201c;I did not die,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;I saw my children again.&#x0201d; <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et&#x000a0;al. (2008)</xref> on the other hand suggested an enhanced elaboration of the trauma in that it is thought to become a central component of identity and reference point for other autobiographical experiences. These hypotheses are not mutually exclusive. Several studies showed that both memory disorganization and appraisals of being permanently changed by the trauma predict PTSD (e.g., <xref rid="bib10 bib15 bib45" ref-type="bibr">Dunmore, Clark, &#x00026; Ehlers, 2001; Ehlers, Maercker, &#x00026; Boos, 2000; Halligan, Michael, Clark, &#x00026;&#x000a0;Ehlers, 2003</xref>). The permanent change concept is very similar to <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Rubin et&#x000a0;al.&#x02019;s (2008)</xref> centrality of event concept.</p><p>The study had several limitations. First, the experiments used an analogue design and it remains unclear to what extent the results would generalize to traumatic events that would meet DSM-IV (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>) criteria. Ethical considerations limit the induction of trauma in the laboratory. Similarly, it remains uncertain to what extent the unwanted memories that participants reported in this study are comparable to those in PTSD, although it is known that witnessing horrific events can be sufficiently traumatic to induce PTSD (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">American Psychiatric Association, 1994</xref>). Second, the study only assessed two memory processes and other processes are likely to play a role in reexperiencing symptoms, e.g. Pavlovian conditioning of physiological responses (e.g., <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Foa et&#x000a0;al., 1989</xref>). Third, there was considerable interindividual variability and the effect sizes for the effects of the intervention were small. In particular, the proportion of participants who experienced intrusive memories of the picture stories was low. This reduced the power of the analyses and possibly the effect sizes. It is possible that clearer group differences would have emerged if intrusions had been assessed somewhat earlier, for example, at 2 weeks after the experiment. Fourth, the stimulus material had some limitations. The results are based on a relatively small number of objects. In order to make the material as realistic as possible, the paradigm used film clips that show the main character from the story throughout the picture story. This made it impossible to counterbalance the objects across the neutral and &#x0201c;traumatic&#x0201d; picture stories. Although the objects were carefully matched for ease of identification, salience and memorability and <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Michael and Ehlers&#x02019; (2007)</xref> data consistently showed that the objects were comparable in these respects, we cannot completely rule out that subtle material effects influenced the results. It is therefore reassuring that a recent study (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000fc;ndermann, Hauschildt, &#x00026; Ehlers, in preparation</xref>) replicated the enhanced priming effect when objects were counterbalanced across neutral and trauma stories.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group
