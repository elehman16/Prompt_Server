Thirty-six patients hospitalized in a coronary care unit were randomly allocated into two groups using a convenience sampling method. Following peripheral intravenous cannulation, five drops of pure sesame oil were applied to the skin within a 10 cm radius of the infusion site prior to the administration of amiodarone in the intervention group. Sesame oil was rubbed on the skin at the infusion site every 6 h in the 24-h period of amiodarone infusion. In the control group, liquid paraffin, used as a placebo, was rubbed on the skin at the infusion site of amiodarone. Both groups were monitored for the development of phlebitis and its degree within the 24-h period of amiodarone infusion as well as 6 h after its administration. The incidence of phlebitis was confirmed and recorded by an assessor who was blind to the two groups.

However, these methods are often not applicable, as amiodarone is administered in an emergency over a short period of time,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and further dilution of the drug is not applicable due to concerns about increased circulating fluid volume for cardiac patients.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Various procedures have been suggested to prevent phlebitis, including administering heparin,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] dilution of drugs, and use of topical corticosteroids,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] none of which is without complications. Heparin is associated with the risk of bleeding at the operation site and thrombocytopenia, and corticosteroids are followed by increased risk of infection through impaired defense system.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Thus, it is recommended to use simpler, more economical, and available methods. One of these methods seems to be the use of complementary and alternative medicine, an example of which is applying sesame oil. This oil has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, and contains various lignans such as sesamin and sesaminol that prevent the release of pro-inflammatory agents including interleukin-8 and endothelin-1, which ultimately prevent inflammation.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] According to available databases, no papers have been published in relation to the effect of sesame oil in preventing amiodarone-induced phlebitis. In this area, there has only been one study conducted in Iran, which aimed to examine the effect of sesame oil in preventing chemotherapy-induced phlebitis. Sixty patients undergoing chemotherapy entered this randomized controlled clinical trial. Results indicated significant differences between the two groups in terms of severity and timing of phlebitis.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Since chemotherapy-induced phlebitis is a chemical type of phlebitis and amiodarone is also a chemical, it seems sesame oil can be as effective on amiodarone-induced phlebitis as it is on chemotherapy-induced phlebitis. Thus, this study was conducted with the aim to determine the effect of sesame oil on the prevention of amiodarone-induced phlebitis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This study is a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial, which was conducted following approval of the Ethics Committee of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences, coded IRCT201308127494N7, on patients admitted to the cardiac and CCU departments of Shahid Yahyanejad Hospital, Babol, who received intravenous infusion of amiodarone protocol according to doctors&#x02019; orders.

Amiodarone is diluted with dextrose 5% solution. In the first 10 min, 150 mg (1.5 mg/ml) of amiodarone is administered as a bolus. The next dosage of 360 mg (1.8 mg/ml) is infused immediately afterward (over 6 h). The 540 mg (1.8 mg/ml) maintenance dose is infused over 18 h.

This was specifically used for amiodarone infusion, and no other injection was performed through this vein. To prevent bias, all sampling stages were performed equally for every patient by the same researcher. In the intervention group, catheterization was performed with aseptic considerations, and before the first injection of amiodarone, five drops of pure sesame oil (from Barij Essence Company, Kashan, Iran,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] with quality certificate No. ISO9001:2008 and production license No. 0227500) were rubbed within a 10 cm radius of the infusion site (without any massage or manipulation of the infusion site).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] With the onset of infusion, sesame oil was topically rubbed every 6 h (4 times in 24 h).

Similar to the present study, Nekuzad <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a study to investigate the effect of external use of sesame oil in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced phlebitis, in which the rate of phlebitis in the intervention group was reported to be 10%,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] which is less than that in the present study. This is probably due to continuous administration of high concentration of amiodarone over 24 h, which has a molecular weight of 643.3 and contains 37% iodine.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] However, in Nekuzad <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, chemotherapy medications were administered with a different protocol, and thus, the type and duration of drug contact with vein were different, which can explain the difference in phlebitis rate.</p><p>In the first 10 min, from the first 10 min to 6 h and 10 min, from 6 h and 10 min to 24 h and 10 min, and from 24 h and 10 min to 30 h and 10 min after catheterization, the incidence rates of phlebitis in the control group (liquid paraffin) were 0, 55.6%, 50%, and 0, respectively, and in the entire 30 h and 10 min after catheterization, the incidence rate of phlebitis was estimated at 77.8%. The present study results showed a significant statistical relationship between the two groups in terms of contracting phlebitis. These results are consistent with the results obtained by Nekuzad <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and thus confirm the effect of sesame oil on phlebitis. Boyce <italic>et al</italic>. reported the incidence of amiodarone-induced phlebitis as 67%.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, the phlebitis scale used to assess the severity of phlebitis in Boyce <italic>et al</italic>.'s study was different from that in the present study, and this rate was less in the control group compared to that in the present study (77.8%).</p><p>In a study by Junying <italic>et al</italic>. entitled &#x0201c;MEBO (Moist Exposed Burn Ointment) for treating skin injury and phlebitis caused by extravasation of chemotherapeutic drugs,&#x0201d; 72.2% of patients in the sesame group were reported to have healed after 3 weeks, while only 33.4% healed in the control group.[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In a study by Cho <italic>et al</italic>. entitled &#x0201c;Successful combined treatment with total parenteral nutrition fluid extravasation injuries in preterm infants,&#x0201d; sesame oil was shown to have therapeutic effects on phlebitis.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Results of these studies confirm the anti-inflammatory effects of sesame oil in the treatment of venous damages. Thus, it can be concluded that in addition to preventive effects, sesame oil has therapeutic effects on phlebitis.</p><p>The present study results showed increasing severity of phlebitis with time in the sesame oil group, especially in the period from 6 h and 10 min to 24 h and 10 min, when the highest dose of amiodarone (540 mg) was administered, phlebitis severity was the highest. In the intervention group, phlebitis grade 1, 4, or 5 did not occur in the entire 30 h and 10 min, and 61.1% did not contract phlebitis.

In a similar study, the mean phlebitis score in the intervention group was 0.1, and was less than that in the control group.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] The present study results showed increasing scores of phlebitis with time in the control group. In a similar study, the mean score of phlebitis in the control group was 1.9.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Boyce and Yee reported various grades of phlebitis among patients.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In the present study, the grades of phlebitis were not examined for different amiodarone protocol times. From the first 10 min to 6 h and 10 min, and from 6 h and 10 min to 24 h and 10 min, a significant difference was observed in terms of phlebitis scores between the two groups. In line with the present study results, this difference was also reported by Nekuzad <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In the present study, catheter survival was higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Minimum and maximum times for the incidence of phlebitis in the sesame oil group were 18 and 28 h, respectively, and in the liquid paraffin group were 2 and 18.5 h, respectively. These results show that use of sesame oil delays the onset of phlebitis induced by peripheral intravenous infusion of amiodarone in the intervention group. In line with the present study results, in Nekuzad <italic>et al</italic>.'s study, time of development of phlebitis in the intervention group had been delayed compared to the control group.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Results of a study conducted by Sharifipour <italic>et al</italic>. to assess the topical effects of sesame oil on severe corneal alkali burn in rabbits showed that the application of topical sesame oil can delay rupture of the cornea in severe alkali burn, with 29.6 days in the sesame oil group and 25.6 days in the control group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01).[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>According to the results, topical use of sesame oil is recommended to reduce progress of amiodarone-induced phlebitis, particularly because sesame oil is plentiful in Iran, has no side effects, and is economical.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>A<sc>CKNOWLEDGMENTS</sc></title><p>We hereby thank the Deputy Research and Technology of Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences for funding this study, and Research number is 92-570.
