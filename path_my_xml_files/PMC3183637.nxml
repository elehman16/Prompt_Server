However, several subsequent randomized controlled trials targeting similar BG levels[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] showed no mortality benefit but a significant risk of hypoglycemia with IIT. The Normoglycemia in Intensive Care Evaluation-Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation (NICE-SUGAR) study, the largest trial of IIT to date, compared IIT to keep BG 4.5-6.0 mmol/L (81-108 mg/dL) with CIT to keep BG levels 10 mmol/L or less (&#x0003c;180 mg/ dL).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The study found that a BG target of &#x0003c;10 mmol/L (&#x0003c;180 mg/dL) resulted in lower mortality than did a target of 4.5-6.0 mmol/L (81-108 mg/dL). More recently, the COIITSS study investigators found that IIT did not improve survival in patients with septic shock who were treated with hydrocortisone.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] As a result, the pendulum of BG control in many ICUs swung back to less strict goals. With all the recent trials, it remains unclear what constitutes an optimal level of BG in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to identify the optimal BG target for glycemic control in critically ill patients that is associated with survival benefit with the least hypoglycemia risk.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Setting</title><p>This is a single-center study conducted in the 21-bed medical surgical ICU in a tertiary care academic center in King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The ICU is run as a closed unit by critical care board-certified intensivists 24 h/7 days. The ICU admits more than 1000 patients per year. Our nurse/patient ratio is approximately 1:1.2.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Study design</title><p>We carried out a cohort study nested within a randomized controlled trial that compared IIT versus CIT in a mixed population of medical/surgical critically ill patients. Details of the original study are published elsewhere.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] In brief, the clinical trial compared IIT to keep the BG level between 4.4-6.1 mmol/L (80-110 mg/dL) with CIT to keep the BG level 10-11.1 mmol/L (180-200 mg/dL). Patients received insulin infusion according to predesigned protocols to achieve these targets. BG measurements were done using either arterial or whole capillary blood via a bedside glucose analyzer. BG measurements were obtained every 1-4 h according to the protocol. If the patient developed hypoglycemia, then the BG was checked every 20 min. The mean BG for each patient was calculated by averaging the daily mean BG levels. That single value was assigned for each patient and was used for subsequent analysis. Hypoglycemia was defined as BG &#x0003c;2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL). The original study was approved by the institutional review board (ref. 7.0/RC 107-02, National Guard Health Affairs) and registered at the Current Controlled Trials registry (ISRCTN07413772) and found no mortality benefit of IIT compared to CIT.</p><p>For the current study, all patients from the original study (<italic>N</italic> = 523) were included in the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Data collection</title><p>We extracted the following data from the main database which was used for the original study: patient's demographics, body mass index (BMI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] admission category (postoperative vs. nonoperative), history of diabetes, history of sepsis, traumatic brain injury, admission BG level, vasopressor therapy (defined as the use of any vasopressor infusion except dopamine &#x0003c;5 mcg/kg/min), mechanical ventilation, serum creatinine, platelet count, bilirubin, International Normalization Ratio (INR), partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio (PaO<sub>2</sub>:FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio), and Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Study endpoints were ICU mortality, hospital mortality, and rates of hypoglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Patients were divided into six groups of equal numbers based on average BG levels. Patients in group 1 had BG of &#x0003c;6 mmol/L while patients in groups 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 had a BG level of 6.0-6.3, 6.4-7.1, 7.2-8.6, 8.7-10.3, and &#x02265;10.4 mmol/L, respectively. Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or median with interquartile ranges, unless otherwise indicated. Differences between the six groups were assessed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test. A <italic>P</italic>-value equal or less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. Adjustment for differences in baseline characteristics was done for age, history of diabetes mellitus (DM), inclusion BG, randomization to IIT vs. CIT, sepsis, creatinine, APACHE II score, INR, and admission category (postoperative vs. non-post-operative). The results were expressed as adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). The cohort of patients was also analyzed using 0.1 mmol increments in the mean BG. For each value of BG, the aOR of ICU mortality for all the patients with BG levels above that value was compared to that of all patients below that value, adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics as above. We then used the same methodology to identify a threshold below which the rate of hypoglycemia was increased. Statistical analyses were carried out using the Statistical Analysis Software (SAS, release 8; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> shows the baseline characteristics of the patients included in this study.

The threshold of &#x0003c;6.1 mmol/L (&#x0003c;110 mg/dL) is associated with a significant hypoglycemia risk with no survival benefit over slightly less BG [&#x0003c;8.1 mmol/L (&#x0003c;110 mg/dL)]. Our data also shows that the threshold of 10-11.1 mmol/L (180-200 mg/dL) is associated with increased mortality.</p><p>In contrast, the Glucontrol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] and NICE-SUGAR[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] studies used lower targets for the conventional insulin therapy group [&#x0003c;10 mmol/L (&#x0003c;180 mg/dL)]. The latter study showed that this target resulted in lower mortality than did a target of 4.5-6.0 mmol/L (81-108 mg/dL).</p><p>As per the nature of RCTs, the comparisons are held between two separate levels of BG and therefore it remained unclear whether intermediate levels of BG represent better targets. In our study, we were able to examine a continuum of BG levels, and as a result we were able to identify the association of mortality and hypoglycemia at different levels of BG. Our study shows that a target of 4.5-6.0 mmol/L may also not be the optimal BG target and calls for an intermediate target for BG control in critically ill patients [&#x0003c;8.1 mmol/L (&#x0003c;146 mg/dL)]. This level appears to represent a level that combines the least mortality and hypoglycemia risk. Unfortunately, none of the existing RCTs examined this level. Yet, several authors have called for a similar target to ensure the safety of BG control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] The Surviving Sepsis Campaign recommended this level of BG control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>Our results are in agreement with the results of other observational studies that attempted to identify a BG threshold above which hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality. Finney <italic>et al</italic>. found that patients who had most of their BG measurements above 10 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) had increased mortality. He suggested that the BG threshold for increased mortality lies between 8.0-10.0 mmol/L (144-180 mg/dL).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Our study should be viewed in light of its strengths and limitations. One of the strengths of the study is the design, being a nested cohort study within a randomized controlled trial. As such, the data were collected prospectively, standardized IIT and CIT protocols were used, and in-services were given to the medical and nursing staff to ensure the safeguards against the development of hypoglycemia. In terms of limitations, the study is a post-hoc, monocenter study and of observational nature. In addition, the allocation to IIT versus CIT was randomized in the original RCT and as such the allocation in the current nested cohort study is not randomized.</p><p>In summary, our study showed that a target BG level of &#x0003c;8.1 mmol/L (&#x0003c;146 mg/dL) in critically ill patients may be adequate. This target would likely be associated with less risk of inadvertent hypoglycemia compared to other suggested targets. This finding needs to be validated in a prospective randomized controlled trial.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil,</p></fn><fn
