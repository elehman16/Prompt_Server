Non-traditional settings such as sports clubs offer opportunities to widen access. Involving people who are not medically trained to promote screening could optimise acceptability.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We developed two interventions to explore the acceptability and feasibility of urine-based sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening interventions targeting men in football clubs. We tested these interventions in a pilot cluster randomised control trial. Six clubs were randomly allocated, two to each of three trial arms: team captain-led and poster STI screening promotion; sexual health adviser-led and poster STI screening promotion; and poster-only STI screening promotion (control/comparator). Primary outcome was test uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Across the three arms, 153 men participated in the trial and 90 accepted the offer of screening (59%, 95% CI 35% to 79%). Acceptance rates were broadly comparable across the arms: captain-led: 28/56 (50%); health professional-led: 31/46 (67%); and control: 31/51 (61%). However, rates varied appreciably by club, precluding formal comparison of arms. No infections were identified. Process evaluation confirmed that interventions were delivered in a standardised way but the control arm was unintentionally &#x02018;enhanced&#x02019; by some team captains actively publicising screening events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Compared with other UK-based community screening models, uptake was high but gaining access to clubs was not always easy. Use of sexual health advisers and team captains to promote screening did not appear to confer additional benefit over a poster-promoted approach. Although the interventions show potential, the broader implications of this strategy for UK male STI screening policy require further investigation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS</kwd><kwd>MEN</kwd><kwd>INTERVENTION STUDIES</kwd><kwd>GONORRHOEA</kwd><kwd>SCREENING</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Background</title><p>Men's uptake of chlamydia screening within the English National Chlamydia Screening Programme (NCSP) has been substantially lower than that reported in women.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Among all 15-year-old to 24-year-old participants in the NCSP between July and September 2013, only 30% of tests were returned by men.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Evidence suggests that although women of reproductive age bear the majority of adverse health consequences of chlamydial infection,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> the inclusion of men in screening efforts can be effective in reducing the population burden of infection,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>

We do not report 95% CIs for the primary outcome by arm, nor conduct testing to compare arms, because there were only two clubs per arm and variability between clubs was substantial so that precision is low. The analysis of outcomes was not blinded to intervention arm.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Club recruitment</title><p>We identified all potentially eligible amateur clubs in appropriate geographical areas from the Amateur Football Combination listings available on the internet.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Eligibility requirements</title><p>We assessed each football club's eligibility by telephone discussion with the club manager or secretary. Clubs were considered eligible if they had working toilet facilities, private/team changing rooms and a minimum of two teams with 11 or more men aged at least 18&#x02005;years old; and at least one home match (match played at the participating club) during the 3-month study period. We offered each club &#x000a3;1000 as reimbursement of their participation costs.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Prior to randomisation, we divided clubs into three pairs.

The pairs of clubs were then allocated to one of three study arms by the lead study statistician by random permutation. Clubs (and thus participants) were unblinded directly following study arm allocation. It was not feasible that clubs or investigators be blind to the intervention type during implementation or evaluation.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Team captain and health adviser recruitment</title><p>During the recruitment phase, the trial coordinator explained to the club contacts that two of the participating clubs would be randomly allocated to a captain-promoted screening intervention and so all participating clubs needed to have at least one captain willing to promote the screening intervention among two teams in each club.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Health adviser selection</title><p>Based on our preclinical qualitative work,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> we recruited a male health adviser to deliver our STI screening promotion.

The design enabled us to report accurate measures of uptake as, unlike many published community and non-healthcare-based screening evaluations, we measured the number of men to whom the interventions were offered. Urine-based STI screening was acceptable irrespective of how it was offered. The additional support of team captains and sexual health advisers in the form of a short verbal explanation of the rationale and process for STI screening, followed by handing a kit directly to each man, did not result in greater uptake than simply making the test kits available on the day, supported by an explanatory poster.</p><p>Although implementation of the interventions was straightforward, the poster-only arm was unintentionally promoted by some team captains who encouraged men to participate in the research via their regular team information emails. We were dependent on club fixtures and subject to last-minute match cancellations, which meant that we were unable to deliver the interventions to as many players as planned and we did not achieve our intended sample size. The interventions began late in the match season, and although we were confident that extending the recruitment phase would have enabled us to reach our intended sample size, this was unfeasible as no further matches were scheduled until after the 4-month match break. We found a greater than anticipated variability between clubs in the acceptability of screening, which limited our ability to estimate acceptability under any single intervention and reduced precision in our estimate of overall acceptability.</p><p>Although many different forms of &#x02018;outreach&#x02019; screening have been described, very few focus exclusively on men, despite research indicating that male patterns of sexual healthcare access differ from those of women.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

A recent random probability sample survey of young UK men suggests that men who do and do not play football are at similar risk of STIs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The same survey also reported that just over half of men who play football at least once a month would find the venue in which they play an acceptable setting to access self-testing kits,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> reflected in the uptake of testing within this pilot study.</p><p>Our approach appears to be broadly acceptable and feasible to young football players, team captains and football clubs. However, several clubs were uncontactable and others did not respond.</p><p>Although the poster-only arm was unintentionally enhanced due to the enthusiasm of the captains in this arm, their strategy for enhancement required minimal effort at no additional cost. Should this type of screening be implemented more widely, we would expect captains to forewarn their players of the screening activity even if they had no further role in promotion of screening.</p><p>We did not detect any new <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> or <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> infections, but this was not unexpected given the estimated population prevalence.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Adopting a male-focused approach to screening may have been an important factor in high uptake, and factors related to the role of setting and collective screening within groups of men who know each other deserve further study. Although we have developed a simple, feasible and acceptable approach to male STI screening and operationalised it within football clubs, given men's reported preference for traditional healthcare settings,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> a clearer view of the public health benefits of this approach is needed before we can be certain of its wider impact.
