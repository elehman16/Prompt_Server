After sampling, the subjects were randomly assigned to study and control groups. Then, cognitive behavioural intervention was administered in study group during 60 days.

To manage and succeed in this regard, training students with motivation is needed, as they are the generation making the future. When this point is not taken into close consideration, the great human forces that found a country will be wasted. Education without interest and motivation has no products. In fact, motivation is the key element and a predictive factor for the students&#x02019; learning and has a high impact on their learning.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] One of the educational investments in any society is the students whose motivation plays a pivotal role in development and progression of a society. Medical sciences students, especially nursing students, form a group in which motivation is essential. A diminished motivation in nursing students, who are involved in human's life, has numerous impacts on public health through the problems it causes for the nurses themselves leading to resources waste.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Research showed that only 13.7% of the medical sciences students have appropriate motivation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Rouhi <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on educational motivation and its association with some factors in medical sciences students, showed lower a moderate motivation in 46.9% of the students that needed close attention of educational authorities.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Research shows that a decrease in motivation or lack of motivation in nursing students is one of the major causes for nursing students and staff's turnover.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] About 15-20% of nursing students annually leave their education in the world, which results in a shortage in nursing personnel and negatively affects educational and professional motivation of other nursing students.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Research shows that nursing programs are one of the most expensive high educational programs that impose a high financial burden to educational system and put the health services in shortage of nursing forces.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Based on research, 30% of the nursing students study nursing with no motivation.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Dehbozorgi indicated that lack of educational motivation is one of the causes for students&#x02019; dropout, and stated that lowered motivation in education not only causes academic decline and financial resources waste but also results in students&#x02019; hopelessness and disappointment and predisposes them to psychological problems and social corruptions.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Various studies reported that proper work function is associated with having motivation, and the individuals with adequate motivation in their education and profession are more successful, and it consequently results in their job satisfaction.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] With regard to the importance of motivation in formation of academic achievement, progression and job satisfaction as well as nursing students&#x02019; self- confidence, and the pivotal role of nursing graduates in public health, the existence of high educational motivation in this group is of great importance. A review on the research on educational motivation in Iran shows that the researchers mostly focused on the association between this variable and academic achievement,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and some were on formation of motivation through making changes in educational environment,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] but they ignored the students as the major factor in formation of motivation. It seems that to increase educational motivation, promotion of teachers&#x02019; professional function and their familiarization with different educational motivation theories, improvement of learning and studying methods among the students and empowerment of supervisors&#x02019; role, educating study skills, holding suggestions and complaints sessions for the students and application of various psychotherapy treatments can all play an efficient role.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] One of the psychotherapy methods that can be applied in educational issues and their progression and focuses on clients&#x02019; psychological aspects is cognitive behavioral treatment that is a method, based on formation of responses through mental but not physical effects. This method is adopted by psychologists and other health staff to promote individuals&#x02019; positive and efficient changes and relieve their emotional suffers as well as discussing several behavioral, social and mental problems. Cognitive behavioral therapists diagnose and treat the problems, resulted from personal illogical thinking, wrong inferences, abnormal thoughts and defective learning.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Therefore, with regard to the important role of psychiatric nurses in preservation and promotion of individuals&#x02019; mental health and as this group can conduct psychotherapy including cognitive behavioral interventions,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] the present study aimed to investigate the effect of cognitive behavioural intervention on the motivation for academic achievement of the nursing students, with respect to key role of nursing students in improvement of quality and quality of health care, and consequently, individuals&#x02019; and public health to prevent waste of resources and costs, and achieve socio- economic development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a quasi- experimental two- group, three- stage, before- after and one- month- after intervention field study that was conducted in nursing and midwifery school of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2014 after approval of ethics committee. In this study, cognitive behavioral intervention was the independent variable and educational motivation the dependent variable. Study population comprised 120 semesters 3, 4, 5 and 6 female nursing students. Inclusion criteria were female students, no diagnosed mental disorders or diseases, no chronic or acute physical diseases, not attending to similar research projects and not being a conditioned student in the previous semesters. Subjects&#x02019; mental and physical health was either confirmed by cooperation of counseling office in nursing and midwifery school, or by asking the subjects already attending similar research. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects. Exclusion criteria were dissatisfaction to cooperate with the study due to any reasons at any stage of the study, incorrect questionnaire completion and not attending in two sequential sessions. Sampling was random stratified, and the subjects were assigned to study and control groups through random allocation. Firstly, the list of female students studying in years 2 and 3 during school year 2012-2013 was inquired from vice- chancellery for education. To conduct the sampling through random stratified sampling, firstly the study population was divided into some sub- groups (semesters 3, 4, 5 and 6). Then, the subjects were selected from each sub-group based on its size. One hundred and twenty female students were selected (<italic>n</italic> = 30 from semester 3; n = 30 from semester 4; n = 30 from semester 5 and n = 30 from semester 6. The number of subjects in each sub- group was 25% of all subjects (<italic>n</italic> = 16). After selection of the subjects in each sub- group, the subjects were randomly (draw lotto) assigned to study and control groups in such a way that the selected numbers were considered as study group.</p><p>A two-section questionnaire was adopted to collect the data. The first section was on subjects&#x02019; demographic characteristics (including age, semester, average, marital status, family income and present residing status). The second section included Persian version of Academic Motivation Scale that has been designed to investigate the type of students&#x02019; educational motivation. This scale has been designed by Walrand (1992) and investigates three sub- scales of external motivation, internal motivation and lack of motivation. It has 27 items as a self-report tool, scored in a seven- point Likert's scale (never = 1, always = 7), and the subjects should select one answer, associated to the reason for their going to university. Scores lower than 114 show poor educational motivation, scores between 114-148 show moderate and scores over 148 show high educational motivation. With regard to its reliability, Walrand reported Cronbach alpha between 0.83-0.86. Cronbach alpha of internal consistency was not in this spectrum just for external motivation (&#x003b1; =0.62). Reliability index, obtained by clinical trial method for sub- scale of educational motivation was reported between 0.71-0.83 during one month. Bohrani (2005) reported the reliability of this scale was &#x003b1;=0.88 through test re-test method, showing its high reliability. Warlrand confirmed factor analysis and seven- item structure of the scale that shows its validity.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] The questionnaires were completed in three time points of before, after and one month after intervention by the subjects.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Confidentiality of the data was also guaranteed. After stratified sampling and random allocation of the subjects into study and control groups, the subjects were called through phone, briefing sessions were held by the researcher's supervisor and counselor, and after giving the subjects explanations, they signed a consent form. Then, cognitive behavioral therapy program was coordinated with the students in study group through phone calls. It included 8 ninety- minute weekly sessions including a 10-minute brake and 15 minutes to review previous home assignments (the work shit). In the present study, through a review over previous studies, automatic thoughts prevention educations, cognitive reconstruction, stress management, time management and communications management were adopted. Researcher conducted the sessions with co-operation and supervision of a counseling expert who attended in three sessions. Control group just received an educational pamphlet to be familiarized with automatic thoughts and the way to cope with them. To answer the students&#x02019; questions and follow up, they were given a contact number. The collected data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical tests (independent t- test, repeated measures AVOVA) through SPSS18.</p><p>To define and compare subjects&#x02019; demographic characteristics including age (independent <italic>t</italic>-test), educational semester (Man-Whitney), average frequency (Man-Whitney), marital status (Chi-square test), income status (Man-Whitney) and frequency of residential status (Chi-square), related statistical test were used. Independent <italic>t</italic>-test was used to define and compare subjects&#x02019; educational motivation mean scores between two groups before intervention. For after intervention, independent <italic>t</italic>-test and ANOVA were used. For intragroup comparison, paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used and for comparison in each group of study and control before, after and one month after intervention, repeated measures ANOVA was adopted.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Ethical considerations</title><p>
