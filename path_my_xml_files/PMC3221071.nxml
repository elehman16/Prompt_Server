Well-nourished children perform well in school, grow into healthy adults and, in turn, give their children a better start in life. Malnutrition, however, continues to be a significant problem, especially among children who can not fend adequately for themselves. Either due to various diseases or due to excessive indulgence in <italic>Karshyakara Nidanas</italic> pathological changes occur in the body, leading to manifestation of <italic>Karshya</italic>; in such situations, <italic>Brumhana</italic> therapy is indicated. This study was planned to evaluate the drug <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> for its <italic>Brumhana</italic> effect in children. A total 121 children were enrolled in the study, of which 111 completed the full course of treatment. The children were randomly separated into three groups;, groups A (<italic>Ashwagandha ghrita</italic>), B (<italic>Ashwagandha granules</italic>), and C (Placebo). The improvement was maximum in group A, i.e., the subjects receiving <italic>Ashwagandha Ghrita</italic>. However, childhood is a period of growth and therefore all the children responded to the therapy to some extent. There was good relief of the chief complaints and a trend for improvement was seen in supplementary parameters also.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Ashwagandha ghrita</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Ashwagandha granules</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>balya</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>brumhana</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acharya Charaka has described the many features of <italic>Samyak Brumhana</italic>, in which <italic>Bala</italic> is the first one to be mentioned.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] The term <italic>Bala</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] literally means power, strength, might, vigor, force, or vitality. Charaka has also stated that the maintenance of health entirely depends upon the <italic>Bala</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Acharya Sushruta[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] says that a patient whose <italic>Bala</italic> has been extremely reduced becomes incapable of being treated. Thus, in a broad sense, <italic>Bala</italic> can be described as the inherent or acquired[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] strength that aids in the maintenance of health and the sustenance of life. Every human is born with a potential for a certain amount of strength,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] and this can be realized through regular physical exercise and healthy living.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] It is vital to understand the various aspects of <italic>Bala</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] so that the inborn potential can be fully realized. From the above it can be inferred that <italic>Bala</italic> is the power to exercise control over the harmful activities of Dosha that resides in every <italic>Dhatu</italic> of the body.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] The state of an individual's <italic>Bala</italic> can be understood through two <italic>Lakshanas</italic>: the first is <italic>Upachaya</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] which means the build, stability, and compactness of the body, and second one is <italic>Shakti</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] which refers to the capability to do hard work. Brumhana is the most commonly used word for <italic>Bala</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] All the classical writers in general, and Dalhana[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] in particular, have defined <italic>Brumhana</italic> as the enhancer of the bulk of the body. The <italic>Upachaya</italic> type of <italic>Bala</italic> mainly comprises <italic>Somatmaka</italic> properties like <italic>Snigdha, Shukla, Drava</italic>,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] etc., by virtue of which the body exhibits stability and compactness, which is nothing but <italic>Brumhana</italic>. With regard to <italic>Brumhana, Charaka</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] described a clear-cut method of treatment that is intended to impart qualitative and quantitative improvement to the bodily elements. In <italic>Ashtanga Hridaya</italic>, while commenting on <italic>Guru Guna</italic>, Hemadri descrbes it as the quality which imparts <italic>Brumhana</italic> to the body; from this it is again clear that <italic>Brumhana</italic> possesses predominantly <italic>Guru Guna</italic>. In this study an effort is made to study <italic>Brumhana</italic> and <italic>Balya</italic> effect. The study was planned to clinically evaluate <italic>Ashwagandha Ghrita</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] and <italic>Ashwagandha granules</italic> for their <italic>Brumhana</italic> and <italic>Balya</italic> effect.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>The drugs</title><p>Two preparations of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic>, a drug known for its <italic>Brumhana</italic> action, were selected for the study; the dose, grouping, <italic>Anupana</italic>, etc. are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Drug, dose and grouping</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="Ayu-31-355-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Criteria for selection of children</title><p>Children between 3 years and 12 years, irrespective of caste, religion, sex, occupation etc. and those having classical symptoms of <italic>Krisha (Shuska Sphig-Udar-Greeva, Dhamani-Jal-Darshana</italic>, and <italic>Sthula Parva</italic>) or, according to modern terminology, aerobic capacity, body composition (as assessed by skin-fold thickness), and muscular strength were selected from out patient department of Kaumarabhritya, Institute for Post Graduate Teaching and Research in Ayurveda,Gujarat Ayurved University, Jamnagar.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Criteria of exclusion</title><p>Children having any complications (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B, or other viral diseases) chronic illness, hereditary disease, lower than 3<sup>rd</sup> degree of malnutrition, etc. were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Investigations</title><p>Routine blood, urine, and stool examinations were carried out in all patients to rule out any illness.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Criteria of assessment</title><p>In Ayurveda the following parameters were taken into consideration to select the children in need of <italic>Brumhana</italic> therapy: <italic>Shuska Sphik-Udar-Greeva, Dhamani Jala Darshana, Sthula parva</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] etc. (or, in modern terminology, aerobic capacity, body composition, and muscular strength.</p><p>To assess the aerobic capacity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>], the children were instructed to perform a modified method of <italic>pranayama</italic> and chest circumference was measure in <italic>Puraka, Kumbhaka</italic> and <italic>Rechaka</italic> states of respiration.

Group C, the placebo-treated group, showed 16.99% improvement. This shows that the <italic>Ashwagandha Ghrita</italic> is more effective than <italic>Ashwagandha granules</italic> and placebo.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study two pharmaceutical forms of <italic>Ashwagandha</italic> were used: a <italic>Ghrita</italic> form and a granule form. To rule out any placebo effect a separate placebo group was also maintained in the study. All children were exposed to natural surroundings and uniform care and advised to follow a uniform diet pattern. As shown above, the <italic>Ashwagandha Ghrita</italic>&#x02013;treated group showed better results in all the parameters.</p><p>All the selected children were advised a simple method of <italic>Pranayama</italic>. On analysis, we found that the both the test drug formulations produced some improvement, i.e. had a beneficial effect, but the <italic>Ghrita</italic> form showed better performance, viz, in <italic>Puraka, Kumbhaka</italic>, and <italic>Rechaka</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>] levels.</p><p>The benefit documented is due to increase in inner strength and ventilation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>] The drug contains natural steroids that enhances the protein synthesis, and lipophilic activity that allows it to penetrate the cell membranes. An increase in the capacity of internal organs too could be seen, with the increase in the power of lungs probably caused by increased amounts of alveolar line protein of lungs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>] To put it another way, <italic>Ashwagnadha</italic> contains alkaloids and steroids and <italic>Ghrita</italic> has <italic>Yogavahi</italic> &#x00026; <italic>Samsakaranuvarti</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>] properties, and these are all responsible for the increase in body mass. It is well known that the neck and the abdomen are preferred sites for fat deposition and that is why a highly significant result was achieved by <italic>Ashwagandha Ghrita</italic>. The buccal pad of fat is also a site of fat deposition and that is why a highly significant result was achieved by all the groups. More protein content is found in <italic>Ghrita</italic> preparation and particularly with anoloids[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>] which are believed to interact with the liver protein synthesis activity and thus influence many modular proteins. The drug <italic>Ghrita</italic> contains phospholipids and fatty acids,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>] which may have promoted increased protein synthesis. This may have been responsible for the increase in skin-fold thickness and resulted in disappearance of <italic>Dhamani Jala Darshana</italic>. Likewise, the improvement in the buccal pad of fat. This itself proves the therapeutic efficacy of the formulation.</p><p>The parameters adopted from modern aspect to assess the <italic>Brumhana</italic> effect were physical activity, muscle strength and endurance. This may influence the improvement in muscle tone, strength &#x00026; activeness &#x00026; thus reduces the weakness of the muscles. Improved performance of physical activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>] was found in all the children due to daily exercise related activities. Features such as weakness and muscle cramps were markedly reduced, because of increased muscular ability, and it was observed in the present study that group A showed greater improvement than groups B and C. In a nut shell, muscle strength and endurance exercise improves muscle tone and it results into firmness of muscle.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the results of this study indicate a significant <italic>Brumhana</italic> effect in group A. The inference here is that in <italic>Krisha</italic> children (<italic>Shushka Sphik-Udar-Greeva</italic> and <italic>Dhamani-Jal-Darshana</italic>), it is better to use the drug in <italic>Ghrita</italic> form for better clinical response.</p><p>Childhood is a period of growth and <italic>Brumhaniya</italic> drugs potentiate and increase the plumpness of body, as is evident from the significant improvement in most of the parameters in the present study. It may be difficult to give a definite conclusion here based on clinical significance alone due to difference in these data. Group A showed a better response than group B, which clearly indicates the superiority of <italic>Ashwagandha Ghrita</italic> as far as <italic>Brumhana</italic> activity is concerned.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><article-title>Agnivesha.
