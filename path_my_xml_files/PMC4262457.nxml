Postural sway was assessed before and after the training during standing on a force-plate with eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC).

Balance control systems integrate inputs from the motor cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia, as well as feedback from visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive systems to maintain upright posture. When properly functioning, this multi-level neural control system produces stable balance and gait <xref rid="pone.0114731-Hausdorff1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-ShumwayCook1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. However, maintenance of balance, even under constant environmental conditions, involves continuous postural adjustments that appear as irregular fluctuations in the center of pressure (COP) displacements recorded from a balance platform <xref rid="pone.0114731-Collins1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114731-Manor1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In the past, these fluctuations were considered to be &#x02018;noise&#x02019; and not integral to COP metrics. Thus, quantitative studies of balance focused on average sway or COP parameters, ignoring temporal information. Recent research has demonstrated that COP fluctuations convey important information. In fact, COP dynamics are highly &#x0201c;complex;&#x0201d; i.e., they contain non-random fluctuations that exist across multiple temporal and spatial scales <xref rid="pone.0114731-Costa1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Peng1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Complexity-based measures of COP dynamics, including entropy or fractal-based metrics, may therefore be informative outcomes for characterizing age-related decline and frailty <xref rid="pone.0114731-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, fall risk <xref rid="pone.0114731-Costa2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and neuromuscular disorders <xref rid="pone.0114731-Hausdorff1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Manor1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Hausdorff2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. This dynamical systems perspective of postural control is also aligned with a growing interest in evaluating multimodal interventions to reduce fall risk, and for complexity-based metrics to assess intervention-related changes in balance system dynamics.</p><p>Tai Chi is a multi-component mind&#x02013;body exercise that is grounded in the holistic model of traditional Chinese medicine. The explicit goals of targeting multiple physiological, motor, and cognitive processes and integrating their dynamics makes Tai Chi particularly well-suited as a multimodal intervention to enhance balance within a systems biology framework <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wayne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Tai Chi integrates balance, flexibility, and neuromuscular coordination training with a number of cognitive components including relaxation, focused body awareness, imagery, and multi-tasking, that together may result in benefits above and beyond conventional, single modality exercise <xref rid="pone.0114731-Burgener1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114731-Wayne3" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. A recent Cochrane review of 159 randomized trials evaluating both exercise and non-exercise interventions reported that Tai Chi trials had a pooled relative risk ratio of 0.71 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.87) for falls <xref rid="pone.0114731-Gillespie1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These results are supported by other systematic reviews which conclude that Tai Chi directly reduces fall risk <xref rid="pone.0114731-Harmer1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> and/or positively impacts factors associated with falling including the fear of falling <xref rid="pone.0114731-Sattin1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, clinical measures of balance <xref rid="pone.0114731-Manor2" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114731-Judge1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, musculoskeletal strength <xref rid="pone.0114731-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Judge1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> and flexibility <xref rid="pone.0114731-Jacobson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Lan1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>The effect of Tai Chi on postural control in older adults, however, is less clear. Whereas some studies report reductions in the average speed or magnitude of COP fluctuations beneath the feet when standing <xref rid="pone.0114731-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, others report no change <xref rid="pone.0114731-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114731-Tsang2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> or even increases <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Pluchino1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> in these parameters after Tai Chi training. This is surprising, as postural instability, as evident by excessive or uncontrolled sway, has been identified as one of the key risk factors that lead to falls in many balance-impaired populations <xref rid="pone.0114731-Kenney1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114731-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. However, an increase in bodily sway could represent a more dynamic, resilient, and adaptive postural control system; for example in Parkinson&#x02019;s disease an increase in sway may represent an increase in the range of stability and improvement in postural control <xref rid="pone.0114731-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Therefore, better measures of postural control are needed that can quantify the non-linear, dynamic characteristics of postural stability <xref rid="pone.0114731-Lipsitz1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>.</p><p>We have proposed that the impact of Tai Chi on postural control may be better characterized by quantifying its effects on the degree of complexity associated with system output (i.e., COP dynamics) than by traditional sway parameters <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wayne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wayne2" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Manor3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> MSE (multiscale entropy) is one measure of physiologic complexity that is largely independent of traditional metrics and appears to be sensitive to aging and disease <xref rid="pone.0114731-Costa3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This study performs exploratory analysis of the impact of long- and short-term Tai Chi training on postural control characterized by both MSE and traditional COP measures in a sample of non-randomized Tai Chi expert and randomized Tai Chi na&#x000ef;ve healthy older adults. Based on our earlier studies, we predicted that: 1) Tai Chi experts would exhibit greater COP complexity compared to age and gender matched Tai Chi-na&#x000ef;ve older adults; 2) Tai Chi-na&#x000ef;ve older adults randomly assigned to 6 months of Tai Chi training would exhibit increased COP complexity after training, as compared to a usual care control; and 3) Complexity-based COP measures would be more sensitive to long- and short-term exposure to Tai Chi than traditional sway measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Design</title><p>We employed a hybrid study design that included a two-arm randomized clinical trial (RCT) along with an additional observational comparison group. The RCT evaluated the short-term (6 months) effects of Tai Chi training on healthy community-dwelling older adults. A group of age-matched Tai Chi experts was compared to the randomized Tai Chi and control groups at baseline to evaluate the potential longer-term effects of Tai Chi, and to compare the impact of short- vs. long-term training on balance and functional outcomes.

The Institutional Review Board at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) approved this study. The study protocol was first approved in October of 2010. The randomized trial component of this study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01340365). Registration was initiated prior to the start of recruitment, but administrative reassignment of the study staff resulted in a 7-week delay wherein 4 participants were randomized.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Randomized trial design</title><p>A total of 60 healthy older adults, aged 50&#x02013;79, were randomized to receive 6 months of Tai Chi training in addition to usual health care, or to usual health care alone (control group). Study participants randomized to usual care were offered a 3-month course of Tai Chi as a courtesy following the trial. Randomization was stratified by age (50&#x02013;59 y, 60&#x02013;69 y, 70&#x02013;79 y) and utilized a permuted-blocks randomization scheme with randomly-varying block sizes. Randomization was performed by the study statistician.

Participants in the Tai Chi group received 6 months of Tai Chi training in addition to usual care. All Tai Chi interventions were administered pragmatically at one of five pre-screened Tai Chi schools within the Greater Boston area that met specific guidelines described elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wayne1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Fischer1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Instructors were asked to teach using the same Tai Chi style, approach and protocols employed for non-study, community participants. Study participants were asked to attend, on average, two classes per week over the 6 month intervention. They were also asked to practice a minimum of 30 minutes, two additional days per week. All schools provided DVDs or printed materials to facilitate home practice. In total, participants were asked to engage in 72 hours of training over the 6 month intervention. Attendance at Tai Chi classes was recorded by instructors and home practice was tracked using a weekly practice log. Participants that reported attending a minimum of 70% of all classes and completing 70% or more of prescribed home practice between each study visit were considered compliant or &#x02018;per protocol&#x02019;. Adverse events were monitored via forms provided in the participant packet requesting participants to detail the event as well as notifying the study team within 24 hours. Additionally, all Tai Chi schools were given adverse event forms for reporting pre-specified events that occurred during class or at their school.

For a given COP time-series, a complexity index, C<sub>I</sub>, was calculated from multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis. Briefly, MSE utilizes Sample Entropy (SampEn) to quantify the degree of irregularity within a time-series across multiple time scales <xref rid="pone.0114731-Costa2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. To do so, a coarse-graining procedure is used, which averages sequential data points to produce multiple new time-series, each with a characteristic time scale. At time scale 1, no coarse-graining occurs and the original N samples are used to calculate SampEn. This metric characterizes irregularity by calculating the negative natural logarithm of the conditional probability that sequences similar for <italic>m</italic> points will remain similar if one more point is added to the sequence. Similar points have amplitudes which fall within a percentage, <italic>r</italic>, of the time-series standard deviation of each other. In our study we used <italic>m</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;2 and <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15. At each subsequent time scale factor (&#x003c4;) in the MSE algorithm, averages of &#x003c4; points are taken within non-overlapping windows to create a new time-series of length N/&#x003c4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0114731-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). At each time scale, &#x003c4;, SampEn is calculated to produce an MSE curve (i.e., SampEn versus &#x003c4;). Using this output, C<sub>I</sub> was derived by calculating the area under the curve. Since the area under the curve is based on SampEn, a larger area or C<sub>I</sub> represents greater irregularity over a range of time scales and thus higher complexity. As explained below, the range of scales used to calculate C<sub>I</sub> varied based on the direction of sway (AP vs. ML) and comparison (long-term or short-term Tai-Chi training). Therefore, we present all complexity results as the complexity index divided by the range of MSE scales for a particular sway direction and comparison. This represents the average C<sub>I</sub> per MSE scale. We denote this as C<sub>I</sub>/R(&#x003c4;), where R(&#x003c4;) represents the range of MSE scales. Normalizing the reported complexity allows comparison across both sway directions and conditions.</p><fig id="pone-0114731-g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0114731.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the course-graining procedure for multiscale entropy.</title><p>x<sub>i</sub> represents the original time-series samples. y<sub>j</sub> represents the coarse-grained samples at the indicated scale.

We then selected the specific IMF combination to be used for analyses based on a statistical comparison between groups prior to treatment, using an approach similar to Wei et al. <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wei1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Briefly, Wei and colleagues performed statistical tests to choose IMFs that best discriminated young and elderly participants with known differences in balance, and then used these IMF combinations to test the effect of stochastic resonance on the complexity of balance in the elderly group. Similarly, to test our hypothesis that Tai Chi experts would exhibit higher complexity than age-matched controls, we made the a priori assumption that young adults would have higher COP complexity than older adults, and that Tai Chi would restore age-related COP decline. We therefore identified the IMF combination for this hypothesis by comparing the young group and randomized older adult Tai Chi na&#x000ef;ve group at baseline. The IMF combination that best distinguished, statistically, the young group from the randomized older adults group was chosen. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114731-t001">Table 1</xref> provides a summary of the statistical comparison between these groups at baseline for the IMFs which best distinguished them in each sway direction (AP and ML). We speculate that choosing the IMFs in this manner may identify the time scales of a healthy postural control system since literature shows that young adults generally show superior postural steadiness relative to elderly <xref rid="pone.0114731-Prieto1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. These IMFs were subsequently selected for the long-term Tai Chi comparison between Tai Chi experts and age-matched controls of COP complexity. To test the hypothesis that Tai Chi na&#x000ef;ve subjects who participated in 6 months of Tai Chi training would improve their complexity relative to age-matched controls, we made the a priori assumption that short-term Tai Chi training would have qualitatively similar effects as long-term training. We thus compared the Tai Chi experts and randomized subjects at baseline, and used the IMF combinations that statistically best distinguished the Tai Chi experts from the randomized group. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0114731-t002">Table 2</xref> provides a summary of the statistical comparison between these groups at baseline for the IMFs which best distinguished them. In other words, we contend that selecting the IMF combination leading to COP complexity values that best distinguish these two age-matched groups (Experts Vs. Na&#x000ef;ve) may be most sensitive to a change in the complexity of postural control within the Na&#x000ef;ve group following exposure to short-term Tai-Chi. These IMF combinations were used to compare COP complexity of randomized subjects assigned to Tai Chi against the controls assigned to usual care across their three visits. In both long- and short-term comparisons, we used a two-sample t-test to produce the p-value statistic used for this analysis. All of the comparisons used for IMF selection were done independently for AP and ML directions under the eyes-open condition. The statistically selected time-series of a particular IMF combination was then analyzed using MSE as described above.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0114731-t001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0114731.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Details of the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and MSE scales used for the long-term Tai-Chi comparison between Na&#x000ef;ve and Expert groups.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0114731-t001-1" xlink:href="pone.0114731.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">COP Direction</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">IMFs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristic IMF Frequencies (Hz)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MSE Scales</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MSE Scale Range</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Young Complexity<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt102">a</xref>

The group difference and adjusted means for a participant with mean age were estimated. Trends in balance measures over the 24-week intervention were compared between na&#x000ef;ve participants randomized to Tai Chi or usual care using a random-slopes model with shared baseline. All longitudinal analysis were conducted according to the intention-to-treat paradigm. The model included fixed effect of time, time&#x000d7;treatment, age, and time&#x000d7;age and random participant-specific intercepts and slopes with unstructured covariance. The shared baseline assumption, enforced by omitting a treatment main-effect term, properly reflects the true state of the population sampled prior to randomization and has the advantage of adjusting for any chance differences at baseline in a manner similar to ANCOVA. A similar model with visit treated as a categorical term was also fit to explore possible non-linearity in the time profiles. As above, treatment-group differences and adjusted means for a participant with mean age were estimated as well as their 95% confidence intervals. Residual diagnostics were used to test assumptions of data normality, and in a small number of cases where non-normality was detected, log-transformation was employed. Log-transformation had only minor impacts on statistical results and yielded equivalent inference, thus only non-transformed results are presented. Associations between percent changes in traditional and complexity-based measures of balance vs. dosage of Tai Chi training, and functional measures vs. Tai Chi training dosage were estimated by linear regression.

This challenge has led to extensive efforts to improve our understanding of the complex physiology underlying age-related decline of postural control, to identify interventions to reduce the risk of falling in older adults, and to develop markers to accurately measure the short- and long-term impact of interventions targeting balance and fall risk. Mounting evidence suggests that Tai Chi is a promising intervention for reducing falls, especially in older (transitionally) frail and neurologically impaired adults that are at high risk of falling <xref rid="pone.0114731-Gillespie1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Tousignant1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-TaylorPiliae1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. However, less is known about Tai Chi&#x02019;s impact on healthy adults that are at a lower risk for falling, the relevance of measures of sway for evaluating intervention-related impacts on postural control, and the mechanisms through which Tai Chi may reduce future fall risks.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study represents the first randomized trial evaluating the impact of Tai Chi on complexity-based measures of postural sway. Our main finding is that complexity measures may provide a complementary, alternative and perhaps more discriminating metric for characterizing postural sway during quiet standing and the impact of complex mind-body interventions such as Tai Chi on balance. Among healthy adults, long-term exposure to Tai Chi training was generally associated with increased sway complexity. Intent-to-treat analyses did not indicate a significant effect of shorter-term (6 month) exposure to Tai Chi training on sway complexity or function. However, post-hoc analyses indicated positive and significant associations between hours of exposure to Tai Chi training and increases in sway complexity and functional performance. In combination with prior research linking enhanced complexity with health (discussed below), these findings suggest that MSE may be a sensitive maker for characterizing the benefits of Tai Chi to postural control during quiet standing in healthy adults. In contrast, traditional measures of sway did not reflect obvious effects of either long- or short-term Tai Chi training. In fact, although trends were not statistically significant, the majority of traditional sway outcomes increased with exposure to Tai Chi. Increased sway in many, but not all (see below), populations has been associated with increased fall risk <xref rid="pone.0114731-Kenney1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114731-Rubenstein1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. Our findings suggest that these traditional sway metrics may be relatively insensitive to the effects of Tai Chi in healthy active older adults, and may also require alternative interpretations.</p><p>The findings in the current study parallel those of a pilot observational study evaluating the effects of 24 weeks of Tai Chi for individuals with peripheral neuropathy. Tai Chi training significantly increased MSE-derived complexity of standing COP dynamics, and complexity indices were associated with improved plantar sensation and physical function <xref rid="pone.0114731-Manor3" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>.

Some studies report reductions in the average speed or magnitude of COP fluctuations <xref rid="pone.0114731-Guan1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wu3" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>, others report no change <xref rid="pone.0114731-Chen1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0114731-Tsang2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and similar to the trends we observed in this study, some studies have reported increases <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Pluchino1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> in traditional sway parameters after Tai Chi training. Of note, the effects of conventional therapies on COP metrics have been variable, sometimes increasing following interventions <xref rid="pone.0114731-Lima1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. Some of this variability may result from the use of testing conditions that vary from quiet standing to more provocative challenges to balance. It is also possible that this reported variability in the effects of Tai Chi on traditional sway parameters, and perhaps also the insensitivity in response to Tai Chi we observed in the present study, reflects a diversity of strategies for postural control and associated reductions in fall risks. A hallmark study by Wolf and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wolf2" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref> compared the effect of 15 weeks of computerized balance training to Tai Chi on standing postural sway and fall risk in older frail adults. Balance training, but not Tai Chi, reduced the average magnitude and velocity of sway. Under certain conditions, average sway magnitude was actually greater following Tai Chi training. Interestingly, however, the risk of falling was significantly reduced only in the Tai Chi group (adjusted RR 0.51 vs. 0.98 for Tai Chi and balance training, respectively). Wolf and colleagues <xref rid="pone.0114731-Wolf1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> suggested that Tai Chi-related changes in fall risk may be due to factors other than average sway characteristics. They also suggested that the inherent aim of Tai Chi training might not be to reduce sway, but rather to provide corrective skills and improve confidence for managing postural instability. Other studies also support that Tai Chi may increase the limits of stability within which individuals are comfortable <xref rid="pone.0114731-Pluchino1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Gyllensten1" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Tsang3" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Finally, it is possible that trends towards higher sway may be related to reduced musculoskeletal rigidity, as evidence supports that Tai Chi training reduces muscle co-contraction, and increases flexibility <xref rid="pone.0114731-Gatts1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Manson1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. This could produce beneficial effects in conditions such as Parkinson&#x02019;s disease <xref rid="pone.0114731-Li2" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. This perspective is indirectly supported by studies of individuals with ligament laxity and hypermobility (Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) who exhibit markedly greater COP sway ranges when compared to healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0114731-Rigoldi1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>. The same study also reported that complexity based metrics of COP (approximate and sample entropy) were markedly lower in the hypermobile group, interpreted as a lower level of integrated postural control. Together, these results suggest that the non-linear measures we explored here, which focus on quantifying the moment-to-moment control of postural sway during relatively unchallenged quiet standing conditions, may afford unique and complementary insight into Tai Chi&#x02019;s effect on mechanisms of postural control that are not well-captured by traditional measures.</p><p>There is growing evidence to suggest that greater complexity of sway is associated with higher levels of function and health. One recent study <xref rid="pone.0114731-Kang1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> evaluated the COP dynamics from 550 participants (avg. 77.9 yrs) whose frailty phenotype (not frail, pre-frail, or frail) was determined using standard criteria. Complexity of COP dynamics was quantified using MSE. Compared to the non-frail, MSE of COP was lower in pre-frail and frail groups (p&#x0003c;0.002). Although traditional linear measures of balance (root mean square amplitude of sway) were also associated with frailty, statistical models indicated that only MSE independently predicted frailty status after accounting for other physiologic determinants of balance such as age, vision, lower extremity strength, peripheral neuropathy, and frontal-executive cognitive function. MSE apparently quantifies an aspect of frailty not captured by other measures.</p><p>Complexity-based analyses of COP have been shown to be sensitive indicators of pathology. Cavanaugh et al. <xref rid="pone.0114731-Cavanaugh2" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref> used approximate entropy (ApEn) to examine changes in postural stability in 27 collegiate athletes following cerebral concussions (all underwent baseline testing prior to their athletic season and their injury). COP dynamics were also measured in a cohort of age-matched healthy non-athletes. None of the athletes with concussions exhibited any indications of postural instability using standard testing. However, ApEn values, a measure similar to SampEn, following concussions generally declined, whereas ApEn values remained stable for healthy subjects. Complexity markers are now being considered as part of a post-concussion assessment protocol <xref rid="pone.0114731-Cavanaugh1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>A number of studies have shown that the complexity of COP time series declines with age <xref rid="pone.0114731-Duarte1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Costa2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Collins2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Thurner1" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. For example, Costa et al. <xref rid="pone.0114731-Costa2" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> evaluated short-term COP dynamics in 15 healthy young adults (avg. 27 y), 22 healthy elderly adults (avg. 75 y), and 22 elderly fallers (avg. 74 y). For sway velocity measures, complexity indices in both the AP and ML plane were significantly different for all three groups. In the current study, we did not observe any significant age or treatment&#x000d7;age effects on complexity. This may reflect a lack of association between MSE measures of sway and aging, or it may reflect a bias in our study sampling design. Because our eligibility criteria for Tai Chi na&#x000ef;ve older adults was quite narrow with respect to acceptable comorbidities and use of medications, our sample reflects a very healthy adult population. As the number of individuals that met our eligibility criteria decreased with age, those in the oldest stratified age group (70&#x02013;79 yrs) were more likely to represent extremely healthy individuals, whereas those on our younger group (50&#x02013;59 yrs) that met our eligibility criteria were more likely to be of average health. This interpretation is supported by our TUG data. Average TUG scores for our 60&#x02013;70 and 70&#x02013;80 y group were 6.1 and 6.2 seconds; in comparison, normative data for ambulatory adults in these two age groups is 8 and 9 seconds. Due to this bias, our ability to evaluate the direct effects of age on COP complexity, as well as how age may impact response to Tai Chi is partially limited.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>There are a number of strengths and limitations to this study. One strength is our hybrid design and our ability to compare long- and short-term training of Tai Chi. Multiple prior cross-sectional studies have compared older Tai Chi experts vs. older Tai Chi na&#x000ef;ve adults with respect to traditional measures of balance and function <xref rid="pone.0114731-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0114731-Hakim1" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. However, to our knowledge, our study is the first to compare the effects of short-term Tai Chi training to long-term training, using both traditional and novel measures of postural control, and employing a prospective randomized trial design with identical protocols to our cross-sectional study. Our hybrid design also has important limitations. Samples for both our cross-sectional comparisons and our RCT were small, and could have resulted in type II errors. Additionally, as with any cross-sectional study, comparisons between Tai Chi experts and Tai Chi na&#x000ef;ve may be confounded by differences between groups other than exposure to Tai Chi. While linear models that included potential confounders (e.g., BMI, exercise activity) suggested an independent effect of long-term Tai Chi even after these factors were taken into account, other factors, including training in other mind-body exercises (qigong) and martial arts could not be fully accounted for. For these reasons, caution should be used when attributing any cross-sectional differences solely to the effect of long-term Tai Chi training. The lack of an active exercise control in our RCT also leaves open the possibility that the effects we observed were primarily due to psychosocial interactions. Future studies comparing Tai Chi vs other exercise controls on complexity measures of sway will be informative. Future comparative studies should also consider combining detailed measures of physiological processes known to impact postural control with complexity based measures. This approach would facilitate the understanding of relative contributions of specific physiological processes and their relationship to specific IMFs, and thus the pathways through which interventions like Tai Chi impact balance. Finally, in this exploratory study, we did not make statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons, which increases the likelihood that we observed some positive treatment related effects simply due to chance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study represents the first evaluation of the utility of complexity-based measures of postural sway for characterizing the impact of short- and long-term mind-body exercise training, namely Tai Chi. Multiscale entropy offers a complementary approach to traditional COP measures for characterizing sway during quiet standing, and may be more sensitive to the effects of Tai Chi in healthy adults. Future appropriately powered studies should explore how complexity vs. traditional measures of sway correlate with validated measures of functional performance and help predict critical public health outcomes including long-term risk of injurious falls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0114731.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><p>
