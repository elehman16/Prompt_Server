The Diabetes and Antenatal Milk Expressing (DAME) trial will establish whether advising women with diabetes in pregnancy (pre-existing or gestational) to express breast milk from 36&#x02005;weeks gestation increases the proportion of infants who require admission to special or neonatal intensive care units (SCN/NICU) compared with infants of women receiving standard care. Secondary outcomes include birth gestation, breastfeeding outcomes and economic impact.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>Women will be recruited from 34&#x02005;weeks gestation to a multicentre, two arm, unblinded randomised controlled trial. The intervention starts at 36&#x02005;weeks. Randomisation will be stratified by site, parity and diabetes type. Women allocated to the intervention will be taught expressing and encouraged to hand express twice daily for 10&#x02005;min and keep an expressing diary. The sample size of 658 (329 per group) will detect a 10% difference in proportion of babies admitted to SCN/NICU (85% power, &#x003b1; 0.05). Data are collected at recruitment (structured questionnaire), after birth (abstracted from medical record blinded to group), and 2 and 12&#x02005;weeks postpartum (telephone interview). <italic>Data analysis:</italic> the intervention group will be compared with the standard care group by intention to treat analysis, and the primary outcome compared using &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> and ORs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Research ethics approval will be obtained from participating sites.

One such strategy is to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding from birth in these infants, given that early exposure to cow's milk protein increases the incidence of both type 1 (juvenile onset) and later onset type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref> However, infants of women with diabetes are at high risk of not being exclusively breastfed for a number of reasons. Studies have found generally that women with diabetes are less likely to breastfeed than other women, and likely to breastfeed for a shorter duration,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref> although one study has found that where breastfeeding is encouraged and supported, women with diabetes can be just as successful as women without diabetes.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></p><p>Lactogenesis II, the onset of copious milk production, usually occurs 30&#x02013;40&#x02005;h after birth.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Women with diabetes experience up to a 24&#x02005;h delay in lactogenesis II compared with women without diabetes,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;24</xref> as do women with glucose intolerance, increasing their infants&#x02019; risk of receiving infant formula.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Women with diabetes are also at risk of other comorbidities, most commonly obesity.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>

<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and/or admission to special and neonatal intensive care units (SCN/NICU) further decreases the likelihood of establishing breastfeeding.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>Since infants of women with diabetes are at increased risk of hypoglycaemia,<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> they require blood glucose monitoring and are often admitted to the SCN. If infants are hypoglycaemic and their mother is unable to provide a sufficient volume of expressed breast milk in addition to breastfeeding, they may receive supplementation with infant formula or intravenous glucose. This has led to a practice whereby some women with diabetes in pregnancy are being advised to express breast milk before their infant's birth.</p><sec id="s1a"><title>Current practice</title><p>Increasing numbers of maternity providers are encouraging pregnant women with diabetes to express and store breast milk (colostrum) in the last weeks before their expected delivery date,<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33&#x02013;38</xref> so that breast milk is available in the postpartum period, thereby possibly avoiding infant formula if neonatal hypoglycaemia needs management with supplementary formula feeding. Some organisations have implemented guidelines for antenatal expressing of colostrum,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> and in a recent book for consumers, there is a section entitled &#x0201c;Getting a head start: expressing milk before your baby is born&#x0201d; (ref.41, p.57). This practice presupposes that establishing a supply of colostrum prebirth might ameliorate: (1) the number of infants of women with diabetes who receive infant formula or intravenous glucose if supplementary feeding is required to treat neonatal hypoglycaemia (stored colostrum could be used); (2) the delay in lactogenesis II in women with diabetes and (3) the number of infants of women with diabetes admitted to the SCN. These recommendations for practice have not been investigated and are therefore theoretical, and there is very limited evidence regarding the safety or efficacy of encouraging antenatal expressing of breast milk.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>The evidence</title><p>A retrospective cohort study from the UK included 94 women, and found that infants of women with diabetes who expressed were born 1&#x02005;week earlier on average (37.1&#x02005;weeks (SD 2.6), compared with 38.2&#x02005;weeks (SD 2.2), p=0.06), and were more likely to be admitted to the SCN.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> We conducted a pilot study in 2007 that also provided some evidence, and provided the baseline data to undertake the proposed randomised controlled trial (RCT).<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> We recruited 43 women with diabetes in pregnancy who agreed to undertake antenatal expressing (35% of those eligible agreed to participate when invited) and we conducted a concurrent audit of clinical outcomes in a group of infants of similar women (with diabetes in pregnancy) to provide &#x02018;control&#x02019; data. Women in the expressing pilot completed a demographic questionnaire, were then taught how to express colostrum and encouraged to do so for 10&#x02005;min twice daily from 36&#x02005;weeks gestation. They were advised on the safe storage of colostrum, which they froze for their baby's use after birth. Women kept a diary documenting their expressing and completed telephone interviews at 6 and 12&#x02005;weeks postpartum. We found that 30% of infants in the pilot were admitted to SCN compared with 17% of &#x02018;control&#x02019; infants, and that reasons for admission to SCN were similar in the two groups.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Intravenous glucose use was 14% for pilot infants and 8% for control infants (RR=1.77; 95% CI 0.63 to 4.96). There was no evidence of any fetal compromise based on cardiotocographs (CTGs) undertaken after the first expressing episode. Women recorded blood sugar levels (BSLs) following their first three expressing episodes. Although the median BSLs were normal and suggested no evidence of hypoglycaemia at a group level, 10% (2/20) of women had a BSL &#x0003c;3.5&#x02005;mmol/L after the first expressing episode, and seven women (27%; 7/29) reported they experienced tightenings or Braxton Hicks contractions as a result of antenatal expressing, and one ceased the intervention for this reason.</p><p>The amount of colostrum women obtained varied according to number of expressions, length of time between onset of expressing and birth and the time spent expressing, with a median of 14&#x02005;days expressing and 40&#x02005;mL (range 5&#x02013;310&#x02005;mL) obtained. Although some women found expressing difficult (31%), the intervention was positively received overall, and 95% (38/40) of women would express antenatally again if the practice was proven beneficial. More infants in the pilot received exclusive breast milk during their postpartum hospital stay (37%) compared with the &#x02018;control&#x02019; group (27%; RR=1.38; 95% CI 0.82 to 2.31).</p><p>In January 2010, we conducted a telephone survey of 48 tertiary and large metropolitan and regional maternity hospitals across Australia providing care for 109&#x02005;465 births per year and found that 30 of these services (63%; 65&#x02005;478 births) recommend antenatal milk expressing.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Of these, 21 (70%) recommended antenatal expressing primarily to women with diabetes in pregnancy (although the practice is also being recommended to women with other high-risk pregnancies), and 11 (37%) had a policy or guideline for antenatal milk expressing. Across the 11 services with a policy or guideline for antenatal milk expressing, the mean gestation recommended for start of expressing was 36&#x02005;weeks (range 30&#x02013;37&#x02005;weeks).

A system designed and administered by the Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics Unit at Murdoch Childrens Research Institute is accessed by the internet to ascertain women's allocation.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The intervention</title><p>Women randomised to the intervention will <italic>receive all standard advice and care</italic> (guided by existing hospital protocols) <italic>as well as</italic> receiving instructions on the intervention. They will be taught how to hand express colostrum (see online supplementary file 1). Women will be encouraged to express twice daily for <italic>no more</italic> than 10&#x02005;min until being admitted to hospital to give birth, unless any concerns arise which indicate that the intervention should cease (see below).</p><p>Women will be provided with written and verbal instructions on the safe storage and transportation of colostrum (see online supplementary file 1). Expressed colostrum will be labelled with the woman's hospital medical record number and kept in syringes in her home freezer. Women will be asked to bring the frozen colostrum in an &#x02018;esky&#x02019; (cold storage box) when they are admitted for the birth. Women will be provided with all the equipment they require for this intervention: syringes (2 and 5&#x02005;mL), small eskies, ice pack and specimen bags, labels with medical record number and diaries to document each episode of expressing.</p><p>A dedicated freezer will be available at each trial site for storage of antenatally expressed frozen colostrum. Midwifery and neonatal staff will receive education about the trial and be informed as to where to store the frozen expressed breast milk.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Ensuring maternal and fetal well-being</title><sec id="s2f1"><title>Surveillance in hospital</title><p>Women in the intervention group will undertake an expressing episode under CTG surveillance at the time they are taught expressing (immediately after randomisation). If a woman requires further CTGs during their pregnancy care she will be asked to do one of her expressing episodes during those CTGs, as the uterus may become more sensitive to the resultant oxytocin surge with advancing gestation. The protocol for subsequent CTGs and expressing will be identical to that of the initial expressing episode, that is, preliminary CTG, express for 10&#x02005;min, then continue the CTG for 20&#x02005;min postexpression. The CTG must be reactive prior to starting expressing. Immediate discontinuation of expressing will occur if there are any signs of fetal compromise (fetal tachycardia, reduced variability, late decelerations), or if there is excessive uterine activity (either a hypertonic contraction (one lasting longer than 90&#x02005;s), or tachysystole (&#x0003e;5 contractions per 10&#x02005;min period)). Each participating centre will follow their existing protocol for management of fetal distress, including availability of acute tocolysis and on-site obstetric support.</p></sec><sec id="s2f2"><title>Surveillance at home</title><p>Women will be advised of precautions related to expressing in the antenatal period and informed that if they have concerns regarding any of these issues they should telephone the study midwife, or the emergency department/birth suite of their relevant hospital after hours. Instructions will be given regarding the importance of:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Noting normal fetal activity prior to expressing.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reporting any complications after expressing, such as excessive uterine activity, vaginal blood loss, decreased fetal movements or signs of hypoglycaemia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Measuring BSLs after the first three episodes of expressing, to ensure that the expressing is not causing hypoglycaemia (which can occur with breastfeeding).<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> A consultant endocrinologist will advise the research team on maternal diabetes care as needed, and assist with interpretation of relevant outcomes.</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Standard care</title><p>All women with pre-existing or GDM are seen by a diabetes educator for management of their diabetes. Additionally, all women discuss breastfeeding with midwives during pregnancy, and at all sites women can ask to see a lactation consultant in the antenatal period if they wish. No site can participate in the trial if they recommend that women express colostrum in the antenatal period.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Management of neonatal hypoglycaemia</title><p>The intervention being tested is not aimed at preventing hypoglycaemia; however, in practice the aim of many clinicians who advise antenatal milk expressing for this group is to avoid the use of formula for supplementary feeding if/when neonatal hypoglycaemia occurs. Based on our pilot data, approximately half of the admissions to SCN or NICU will be for neonatal hypoglycaemia.<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> We will measure the incidence and duration of neonatal hypoglycaemia; however, it is not expected that encouraging women to express prior to birth could of itself prevent neonatal hypoglycaemia.</p><p>Existing guidelines for management of newborn infants at risk of hypoglycaemia, including infants of women with diabetes in pregnancy, will be followed. While there may be slight variations in guidelines by trial site, for the purposes of data analysis neonatal hypoglycaemia is defined as a true blood glucose (TBG) &#x0003c;2.6&#x02005;mmol/L as measured on a blood gas analyser (or portable point of care TBG analyser) or in the laboratory. Sites whose guidelines for management of newborn infants at risk of hypoglycaemia are too different from this are not eligible to participate in the trial, and site guidelines are reviewed by the trial neonatologist prior to a decision about any site's suitability for inclusion. Although bedside testing with a glucometer is possible (providing BSLs), this method is not accurate at low blood glucose levels, when a TBG is mandatory. Prompt, standardised and accurate blood glucose measurement of TBG is optimal,<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> and in the trial will eliminate measurement bias in either trial arm. A portable point of care TBG analyser will facilitate prompt, accurate TBG measurement at the bedside without separation of mother and baby&#x02014;crucial in supporting early breastfeeding.</p><p>Stratification by site ensures that any slight variation in infant glucose management will not affect trial outcomes. Regardless of group assignment, mothers will breastfeed their infants, and express their milk postpartum if required. The first response to hypoglycaemia (as per existing clinical guidelines at the two primary trial sites, RWH and MHW) is a prescribed volume (30&#x02013;60&#x02005;mL/kg/day of supplemental feed of expressed breast milk or infant formula, or glucose gel (0.5&#x02005;mL/kg of 40%)) massaged into buccal mucosa. Hypoglycaemia unresponsive to supplemental feeding triggers admission to SCN/NICU, more frequent, larger supplemental feeds, further glucose gel or intravenous glucose therapy, to achieve normal TBGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Adherence to the study protocol and intervention fidelity will be monitored.

Because our pilot data suggested potential harm, we chose the primary hypothesis to test safety. We are also powered to test the listed secondary outcomes.</p><sec id="s2j1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>As aforementioned, when we designed the trial originally, we included only women with diabetes in pregnancy who required insulin, and our sample size calculations were based on estimates of this group. With that population we needed an estimated sample size of 658 women (329 in each group) based on 80% power (&#x003b1; 0.05), and allowing 5% loss to follow-up. This allowed the detection of an increase in the proportion of infants of women (requiring insulin in pregnancy) who are admitted to SCN or NICU in the primary hospital admission following birth, from 20% in the control group to 30% in the intervention group. This estimate was derived from the pilot and audit data presented above.</p></sec><sec id="s2j2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p>This sample size also allows detection of:
<list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>A difference in exclusive breastfeeding at 3&#x02005;months of 12% (40% in the control group compared with 52% in the intervention group; assuming the infants in the intervention achieve the same rate as the statewide data and as per our pilot, ie, 52%; requires n=254);</p></list-item><list-item><p>A difference in the mean duration of pregnancy (38&#x02005;weeks in the control group compared with 37&#x02005;weeks in the intervention group; requires n=184; means, SDs derived from Soltani study<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and</p></list-item><list-item><p>A difference in exclusive breastfeeding during initial hospital stay of 12% (25% in the control group compared with 37% in the intervention group).</p></list-item></list></p></sec></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Sample size revision May 2012</title><p>Recruitment to the trial as per the original criteria started in July 2011. In May 2012, it was agreed to amend our inclusion criteria to include all women with diabetes in pregnancy. This was due to two factors (A) the slow recruitment rate due to smaller numbers of eligible women than anticipated, and (B) expert advice from outside the research group recommending that the external validity of the trial would be increased if the criteria were broadened to also include women with diabetes in pregnancy who did not require insulin.</p><p>The change of inclusion criteria meant that a baseline rate of admission to the SCN or NICU would be 17% rather than 20% as per our original sample size calculations (based on a review of all 2011 outcome data for women with diabetes in pregnancy at the RWH). We undertook various recalculations to address this. Regarding the sample size with the altered baseline:
<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>To detect 10% absolute difference (as in the original calculation) we would need 289 per group&#x02014;this would be a decrease in sample size&#x02014;which none of the team considered optimal;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To detect a 50% relative increase to 25.7% would need 379 per group, that is, 758 (100 more than current sample of 658)&#x02014;again this is not ideal as the study is not funded for this and we did not use this difference in our original calculations;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Or we could maintain current sample size (658) and describe the study power to detect a 10% absolute difference.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The final option was chosen, that is, we agreed to maintain the current sample size and assume increased power to detect 10% absolute difference. Allowing for 5% loss to follow-up, the original sample size of 658 would provide 625 women at primary outcome measurement. This would detect a change in primary outcome from 17% to 27% with a power of 85%. All the original secondary outcome comparisons described above will be maintained given the sample size has not altered.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>Outcome variables</title><sec id="s2l1"><title>Primary outcome</title><p>Proportion of infants admitted to SCN or NICU.</p></sec><sec id="s2l2"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><list list-type="alpha-upper"><list-item><p>Proportion of infants receiving exclusive breast milk at 3&#x02005;months of age;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Gestational age at birth;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Proportion of infants receiving exclusive breast milk during initial hospital stay;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Cost of the intervention to hospitals and to women and cost-effectiveness against breastfeeding outcomes;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Women's views and experiences;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Fetal well-being associated with expressing (assessed by CTG at initial then subsequent opportunistic CTG episodes); antenatal expression episodes, timing and volumes collected (intervention group only); time to lactogenesis II.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2l3"><title>Potential explanatory variables</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Reasons for SCN/NICU admissions;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hypoglycaemia treatments in maternity or SCN/NICU including glucose gel, intravenous glucose, glucagon, hydrocortisone;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Length of time until three consecutive infant TBG levels &#x02265;2.6&#x02005;mmol/L;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maternal blood glucose levels following first three expressing episodes;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maternal morbidity that could be related to expressing, for example, premature labour.</p></list-item></list></sec></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Data collection</title><sec id="s2m1"><title>Maternal and infant</title><p><italic>Demographic data</italic> (including age, education, marital status, ethnic background, smoking) will be collected by questionnaire at recruitment, prior to randomisation.</p><p><italic>Obstetric/neonatal medical outcomes</italic> will be abstracted from the medical record following the birth by researchers blinded to group allocation.</p><p><italic>Other outcome data</italic> will be collected by telephone administered questionnaire at 1&#x02013;2 and 12&#x02005;weeks postpartum.
