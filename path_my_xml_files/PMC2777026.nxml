The study demonstrated that this strategy with long detection reduced the number of overall interventions (appropriate and inappropriate), without undermining effective ICD therapy. Moreover, patients treated with this algorithm did not exhibit increased adverse effects (such as increased syncopal episodes) but, on the contrary, HF hospitalization was found to be significantly lower compared with Control.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Self-terminating ventricular tachyarrhythmias in primary prevention non-ischaemic heart failure patients</title><p>The comparison of the two groups with different detection settings allowed to provide some fundamental information on the natural history of VA in this patient sub-group.</p><p>These data have been obtained not only by an inter-group comparison, but also through an intra-group analysis inside the Protect group by discriminating between the shorter FVT episodes, which would have been hypothetically detected within NID 12/16, and the more prolonged episodes that reached 30/40 NID. This distinction allowed to confirm the very similar VA profile between the two groups, thus emphasizing that a dramatic reduction of the incidence of detected and treated VA can be obtained by setting a long 30/40 NID.</p><p>In fact, the great majority of true VT and FVT (more than 90%), which in the Control arm entered the treatment window, were found to self-terminate within 30 beats in the Protect arm, and, more importantly, in the Protect group, only one-third of VF actually reached 30 beats, thus necessitating shock therapy.</p><p>The concept that long detection offers the possibility for VA to terminate spontaneously is not a novel one and has been previously raised, mainly in patients treated with single or dual chamber ICDs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C10">10</xref></sup> The simple additional detection delay of mean 3.3 s present during charge in the shock therapy group in PainFREE Rx II<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C4">4</xref></sup> allowed to observe that a high proportion of FVT (34%) would terminate spontaneously in the 3 s time interval following 18/24 NID.

More recent studies performed on large numbers of heterogeneous patients with LV dysfunction and ICD indication observed that standardized ICD programming, that included long detection, effectively reduced shock-related morbidity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C8">8</xref></sup></p><p>The present study found that appropriate ICD interventions were significantly lower for the Protect group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001), and happened to be virtually one-tenth of the number of interventions in the Control group.

A series of cost-effectiveness studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C24">24</xref></sup> demonstrated that lowering the cost of an ICD would improve the incremental cost-effectiveness of device therapy. Focusing on CRT, a series of studies have provided varying estimates of the cost-effectiveness of CRT-P and CRT-D relative to medical treatment,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C25">25</xref></sup> but the incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-P vs. CRT-D remains not well defined. A reduction in the incremental cost of CRT-D vs. CRT-P, as obtained in our experience by simpler CRT-D devices, may substantially improve the incremental cost-effectiveness of CRT-D vs. CRT-P. The important 60% reduction of HF hospitalization observed in the Protect group, combined with an upfront cost reduction of CRT-D devices by roughly 30&#x02013;40%, may determine an improvement in cost effectiveness that could be the basis for promoting a more homogeneous implementation of current guidelines on CRT-D, trying to overcome current inequalities in the &#x02018;real world&#x02019;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C27">27</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This is a prospective, multicentre, controlled, parallel study. The major limitation is that treatment assignment was not randomized, but it was centrally based with availability of the first or second type of device mainly determined on the basis of regional device allocation policy. This centralized treatment assignment modality was even dictated by difficulties to obtain a full echonomical support for a randomized study. It is worthwhile to consider, however, that the participating Centers were all regional referral Centers for device implant and that the experience in CRT implantation between Centers enrolling Protect vs. Control patients was found to be equivalent, both in terms of volume, success rate of implants, as well as mean number of years of experience in CRT device implant. For the above-mentioned reasons, no major bias was observed in the study, nonetheless the non-randomized nature of the study could not permit to exclude the presence of minor selection biases.</p><p>Data on quality of life were obtained only in a minority of the study population, and no statistical evaluation was therefore possible.</p><p>Finally, the comparison with the Protect (30/40 NID) group was performed against Control group utilizing 12/16 and not 18/24 NID; though this latter NID has recently shown to be effective and safe in ICD recipients,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP247C8">8</xref></sup> the present study was started at a time when NID was conventionally programmed at 12/16.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with non-ischaemic HF and conventional primary prevention indication for a CRT-D, a simplified CRT-D with full shock capability, and pre-set long detection window (30/40 NID) determined a dramatic reduction of ICD interventions without either jeopardizing ICD therapy capabilities or entailing increased morbidity. Further studies confirming that the effectiveness of this simplified and cheaper strategy in HF primary prevention ischaemic patients could allow a wider diffusion and availability of this life-saving device therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>Funding to pay the Open Access publication charges for this article was provided by Medtronic Italia.</p><p><bold>Conflict of interest:</bold> M.G., C.M., A.P., M.L., S.I., A.C., E.L., F.R., M.B. and G.B. had nothing to be declared, V.B. and A.D. are Medtronic employees.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="EHP247C1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Vardas</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name><name><surname>Auricchio</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Blanc</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Daubert</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name><name><surname>Drexler</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Ector</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Gasparini</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Linde</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Morgado</surname><given-names>FB</given-names></name><name><surname>Oto</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Sutton</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Trusz-Gluza</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><collab>European Society of Cardiology</collab><article-title>Guidelines for cardiac pacing and cardiac resynchronization therapy: The Task Force for Cardiac Pacing and Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy of the European Society of Cardiology.
