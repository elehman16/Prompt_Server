<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There is strong evidence that CRC survivors would benefit from meeting recommendations for physical activity (ie, 150 min per week of moderate intensity physical activity); these recommendations are derived from epidemiological observations of relationships between physical activity and cancer survival,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> and evidence of cause and effect derived from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) about the benefits of physical activity on psychosocial domains, such as quality of life, fatigue, anxiety and depression.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref></p><p>Evidence suggests, however, that most CRC survivors are not meeting the recommended level of physical activity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;16</xref> Furthermore, the provision of rehabilitation to promote and support behaviour change among cancer survivors is not standard practice in the UK or indeed, elsewhere.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Integrating rehabilitation into standardised models of care to support cancer survivors to increase their engagement in physical activity, as well as how best to provide this model of care, remains a key public health challenge.</p><p>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) may be an appropriate model to aid recovery from cancer and associated treatments<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> because (1) physical activity is the cornerstone of CR, (2) CR is evidence-based and draws on theories of behaviour change, (3) CR multiprofessional teams have the expertise required to monitor physical activity to a wide variety of patients including cancer survivors, and (4) CR is widely available throughout the UK and is considered a standard practice in the care of cardiac patients.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref></p><p>An aim of the CRIB (Cardiac Rehabilitation In Bowel cancer) study was to assess whether CR is a feasible and acceptable model of rehabilitation to aid the recovery of CRC survivors (ie, examine intervention implementation potential). As far as we know, this study is novel in that it aims to test CR for a different (ie, not people with cardiovascular disease (CVD)) patient group (ie, CRC survivors). We undertook a pragmatic pilot RCT, which included an embedded qualitative study. A description of the study protocol has been published.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In this article, we describe and report data that directly addresses the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention (ie, CR) for postsurgical CRC survivors. The study consent rate can be used as a proxy for likely demand of CR if it was to be implemented in practice. Reasons for declining to participate provides an indication of barriers to up-take of CR by CRC survivors, the number of adverse events provides an indication of the safety of CR for this group of cancer survivors and intervention adherence can be used to estimate likely use of CR by CRC survivors. Thus, in this article, we report these trial parameters. The results of the evaluation of cancer and exercise training and the embedded qualitative study about people's (CRC survivors, people with CVD, cancer and cardiac clinicians) perceptions of CR for CRC survivors are also reported. We aim to describe and report data that directly address the feasibility and acceptability of trial procedures, as opposed to the intervention, separately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial methods</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009284F1">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref> shows participant flow through the study.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015009284F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow chart (CR,cardiac rehabilitation; CRC, colorectal cancer).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2015009284f01"/></fig><sec id="s2a1"><title>Participants</title><p>People with CRC were recruited from three UK hospitals with CR facilities and considered for inclusion if they were 18&#x02005;years old and over and had been diagnosed with primary CRC and were in the recovery period postsurgery (they could still be receiving adjuvant therapy).

One of the key reasons why CR was chosen for patients with CRC is that physical activity (our proposed primary outcome for the full trial) is the cornerstone of CR. The investigator completed a referral form and sent it on to the CR service. A member of the cardiac multidisciplinary team (eg, cardiac physiotherapist or nurse) then contacted the patient and invited them to attend a CR clinical/risk stratification assessment to determine whether the patient was able to safely exercise from a cardiac clinical perspective. Patients who were deemed safe to exercise were then given a date to start CR, which comprised exercise classes and cardiac-specific education sessions.

Indeed, CRC survivors believed that a benefit of rehabilitation was peer support with support coming from people with CVD as well as other CRC survivors attending CR. Traditionally, peer support has been defined as support provided by people with the same disease.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Shared experience of the disease and experiential empathy is seen as crucial to the giving and receiving of support.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> This study challenges the assumption that peer support for people with cancer can only arise from shared experience of the same disease.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Rather, our study suggests that people with CRC can obtain peer support from people with CVD in the context of rehabilitation. That peer support is not disease-dependent, opens up the possibilities of rehabilitation for mixed disease patient groups. Moreover, our study raises the prospect of redefining peer support, so that it is not exclusively confined to shared experience of a specific disease; a finding also noted by a recent review of self-management support interventions for men with long-term conditions.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Demand</title><p><disp-quote><p>To what extent is a new idea, program, process, or measure likely to be used (i.e., how much demand is likely to exist?)</p></disp-quote></p><p>If the consent rate is a proxy for level of demand by CRC survivors for CR if it were to be implemented in practice, then based on this trial, 31% of CRC survivors are likely to take up the offer of CR should this service be offered to them. This would mean that demand by CRC survivors would be 12% less than the number of people with CVD who attended CR in 2011&#x02013;2012 (43%) in the UK.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Given that CR for people with CVD is a well-established service that has been audited by the British Heart Foundation (a UK charity) since 2004, a rate of 31% engenders optimism that up-take among CRC survivors would eventually match attendance rates among people with CVD. Other physical activity intervention trials report recruitment rates ranging from 8% to 98%,<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34&#x02013;39</xref> suggesting that demand for physical activity interventions by CRC survivors are highly variable and appear to be unrelated to intervention mode (ie, counselling, home-based exercise prescription, exercise classes). Our study found barriers to participation were protracted recoveries from surgery and ongoing treatments. Other studies have also reported medical conditions as a reason why eligible participants do not participate.<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> These barriers are likely to impact demand on rehabilitation. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that recruitment rates and barriers for involvement in research and patient use of an actual service are not directly comparable.</p><p>Motivation is a key construct in theories of behaviour change and has been associated with higher levels of physical activity among CRC survivors.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> According to self-determination theory, internalisation of the value (the benefits) of the outcomes of physical activity is likely to lead to greater persistence in being physically active.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> Demand for a physical activity intervention such as CR is therefore likely to increase as the benefits of physical activity for CRC survivors become more widely known. Recent studies, however, indicate that provision of lifestyle advice, including the benefits of physical activity is low,<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43&#x02013;46</xref> which suggests that demand for CR (and indeed other physical activity interventions) may remain suboptimal until evidence of the benefits of physical activity are conveyed to CRC survivors. Educational efforts on the benefits of PA for patients with CRC have the potential to improve demand and uptake of this type of intervention. The evidence is strong<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;10</xref> and growing, and demand is likely to continue to increase, as health professionals and patients alike become aware of that.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implementation</title><p><disp-quote><p>To what extent can a new idea, program, process, or measure be successfully delivered to intended participants in some defined, but not fully controlled, context?</p></disp-quote></p><p>This was a pragmatic trial and a major strength and advantage of pragmatic trials is the testing of already existing services in real-world settings. It is very different therefore to an explanatory trial where the intervention is tightly controlled and managed by the investigating team. Pragmatic trials therefore provide relatively strong evidence about the potential for implementation. To the best of our knowledge, there are few pragmatic trials of a physical activity intervention for people with CRC.</p><p>The study suggests that CR physiotherapists can receive additional training in cancer and exercise and that they can support CRC survivors to exercise safely. Indeed, no adverse events were reported during the trial, suggesting that CR for CRC survivors is safe. Moreover, the qualitative study suggests that postsurgical CRC survivors welcome support to increase their level of physical activity from trained healthcare professionals. Thus, CR physiotherapists may be a particularly appropriate group of professionals to deliver a physical activity intervention to cancer survivors. In the UK, physiotherapists are registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) and will have successfully completed a HCPC-approved programme in physiotherapy (offered as 3-year or 4-year undergraduate degrees and 2-year postgraduate levels at various UK universities). The training involves both periods of theory and clinical experience gained by meeting and working with patients. The theory part of the course covers anatomy, physiology, physics and pathology. CR physiotherapists are experienced in prescribing exercise for patients with a range of conditions.</p><p>Intervention adherence refers the extent to which participants randomised to the intervention group follow specific treatment therapy instruction as per intervention protocol and can therefore be a useful proxy for implementation. The study suggests that two-thirds of CRC survivors will complete a 12-week CR programme, and the main reason CRC survivors are unable to start or stop attending CR will be poor physical health. Nevertheless, CR attendance by CRC survivors who are able to partake in the intervention is likely to be high.

It is likely therefore that were this service to be offered to CRC survivors then additional resources such as employment of additional staff (eg, a physiotherapy assistant) would be required. We anticipate that the overall additional costs are likely to be modest; for instance, the overall cost for of an 8-week, physiotherapy-led exercise intervention in deconditioned cancer survivors in the early survivorship period (the PEACH trial) conducted in Ireland was &#x020ac;196 per participant, including the salaries of the clinicians, overheads and equipment costs.<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Adaptation</title><p><disp-quote><p>To what extent does an existing idea, program, process, or measure perform when changes are made for a new format or with a different population?</p></disp-quote></p><p>The study suggests that existing CR can perform with a different population (ie, CRC survivors) and that physiotherapists do not need to adapt the exercise class to support CRC survivors. The study suggests that exercise prescriptions are for individuals and not the disease per se. Indeed, the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> expert panel's recommendations for aerobic, resistance and flexibility exercises for cancer survivors are the same as the age-appropriate physical activity guidelines for the general population with several alterations if required.

Given that multidisciplinary teams are emerging in cancer care,<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>
<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> the notion of integrating CR within existing cancer service pathways may increasingly become acceptable.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Expansion</title><p><disp-quote><p>To what extent can a previously tested program, process, approach, or system be expanded to provide a new program or service?</p></disp-quote></p><p>A comparison of studies of coronary heart disease and the post-treatment needs of CRC survivors suggests that there is reasonable justification for expanding CR to include CRC survivors. Four qualitative studies of patients&#x02019; experiences of needs after coronary artery bypass grafting<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54&#x02013;57</xref> and a case note review of needs of 521 patients surgically treated for CRC cancer<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> and a population-based cohort study including 522 people with CRC<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> indicate that people with CVD and people diagnosed with CRC experience similar problems including pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression, worry, appetite loss, sexual problems, sleep disturbance, and work and financial-related difficulties and express a need for information about medication and self-management. Thus, the rehabilitation needs of people with CVD and CRC survivors are likely to be similar, suggesting that a common rehabilitation programme may be appropriate. Moreover, CR may be particularly relevant for people with CRC since the estimated prevalence of CVD is 59% at 5&#x02005;months postdiagnosis and 16% develop de novo CVD within 36&#x02005;months after treatment.<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> In addition, common comorbid conditions in CRC survivors include congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> which again may be managed by rehabilitation.</p><p>Pointing out the similarities in post-treatment experiences is not to deny that there are, of course, disease-related differences among different patient groups. For example, CRC survivors can experience physical discomfort and bowel function problems and urinary tract infections and need advice about abdominal pain and stoma care,<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> which are almost certainly likely to be problems that are not experienced by those with CVD unless they have comorbidities. The study, however, suggests that CR physiotherapists did not feel competent providing specific CRC-related advice and support such as stoma care. Rather than expanding CR to provide CRC-specific advice and support, the existing cancer care team could continue to provide cancer support to address CRC survivors&#x02019; cancer-related needs, but there would need to be closer links between CR and cancer care.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Limited efficacy</title><p><disp-quote><p>Does the new idea, program, process, or measure show promise of being successful with the intended population, even in a highly controlled setting?</p></disp-quote></p><p>We did evaluate outcomes but focused on examining the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.

<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Thus, the success of a future trial of the CR for CRC survivors may depend on the extent to which those in poorer health and consequently in greatest need of rehabilitation participate.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>A key strength of this study lies in its purpose to test feasibility and acceptability in a pragmatic pilot trial with embedded qualitative study prior to undertaking any large-scale, costly future trial of the intervention. The decision to explore the acceptability and feasibility of the CR model&#x02014;an already evidence-based and established rehabilitation model&#x02014;for people with cancer is significant within the context of the current healthcare climate and the need for effective resource use and cost savings wherever possible. It is possible, however, that some of the perceptions of CR for postsurgical CRC survivors presented here represent a select cohort who were already motivated to, and interested in, being part of a physical activity intervention They may, for example, already have held positive views towards behaviour change, and in particular change in physical activity as a core component of their recovery. In addition, the interviews were conducted by the investigators involved in collecting baseline and follow-up measures from CRC survivors, which may have influenced the extent to which participants were willing to be critical. Nevertheless, these investigators were not involved in the direct care of participants and in particular, they were not involved in delivering the intervention (ie, CR) and so participants may have been more candid about their views of the intervention itself. The generalisability of our findings, however, is limited because the pilot was small scale involving only 3 out of a possible 312 CR programmes throughout the UK<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>
<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> and involving only small numbers of CR and CRC healthcare professionals and people with CRC and CVD.
