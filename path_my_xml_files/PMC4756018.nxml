flexor (DCF) muscles exercise on pain, Neck Disability Index (NDI), and neck and shoulder
postures in patients with chronic neck pain. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-eight patients
with chronic neck pain were randomly assigned into either the general strengthening
exercise (GSE) group or the DCF activation group as control and experimental groups,
respectively. All exercises were performed three times per week over 4 weeks. NDI and
numeric rating scale (NRS) score for pain were determined and radiological assessment of
neck-shoulder postures (head tilt angle [HTA], neck flexion angle [NFA], and forward
shoulder angle [FSA]) was performed before (baseline), 4 weeks after, and 8 weeks after
exercise in order to directly compare the exercise effects between the groups. [Results]
In the DCF group, the NDI, NRS score, and neck-shoulder postures (analyzed by uisng HTA,
NFA, and FSA) were significantly improved. [Conclusion] DCF activation exercise was
effective to alleviate pain, recover functions, and correct forward head posture in the
patients with neck pain. Hence, it might be recommended in the rehabilitation of patients
with chronic neck pain.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Deep cervical flexor</kwd><kwd>Forward neck posture</kwd><kwd>Neck pain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Minor damages accumulated in the neck due to chronic posture and sudden muscular
contraction can further lead to shrinkage of muscles that are not commonly being utilized,
thereby inducing mechanical dysfunction and chronic pain<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. A previous study reported that approximately 70% of patients with
chronic neck pain exhibit decline in muscular strength and endurance of the
sternocleidomastoid and deep cervical flexor (DCF) muscles<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. The DCF muscles consist of the longus colli and longus capitis
muscles, which play important roles in maintaining posture control and stability of the
neck<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the comparison of muscular
activation levels, the deep longus colli and longus capitis muscles were less activated than
the superficial sternocleidomastoid and longus capitis muscles<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, maintaining the muscular strength of the DCF muscles is
critical for controlling neck posture and stability<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Continuous imbalance between the superficial and deep neck muscles causes the head to
position further forward from the body (i.e., forward head posture). The forward head
posture is one of the common postural deformities observed in patients with chronic pain in
the neck and shoulder<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. In this posture,
the central line of the head moves toward the front so that further weights could be loaded
on the neck, thereby exacerbating projection of the acromion or cervical lordosis and
resulting in serious changes in joints between the neck and head<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>DCF exercise has been known to alleviate neck pain, to help maintain proper neck and
shoulder postures, and to be effective for deep, rather than superficial, cervical
muscles<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Chiu et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that implementation of DCF exercise
more significantly suppressed the increase in pain level in patients with neck pain than in
those without exercise. Similarly, Jull et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> addressed that rehabilitation program, including DCF exercise,
effectively alleviated headache in patients. Other studies further investigated the effects
of DCF exercise on chronic neck pain and proper postures<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As aforementioned, more than one study reported that DCF exercise might be effective to
alleviate neck pain and maintain proper postures. Most of these studies were conducted on
subjects belonging to specific age groups or only assessed the exercises rather than further
monitor their clinical effects. Hence, this study aimed to prospectively compare the effects
of DCF exercise on the correction of forward head posture, chronic neck pain, and functional
assessments and those of general strengthening exercise (GSE) in order to generate clinical
outcomes for the DCF muscle and to provide useful clinical outcome for rehabilitation
exercise for chronic neck pain.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>In this study, 30 patients who visited the S rehabilitation exercise center, located in
Gwang-ju City, between May 2014 and June 2014 with a complaint of neck pain were enrolled.
This study was approved by the hospital, and all the participants provided written informed
consent. The following subjects were selected for the study: 1) subjects with neck pain; 2)
subjects with a Neck Disability Index (NDI) score of &#x0003c;15 points whose symptoms could not
be exacerbated by muscular strength exercise; 3) subjects who had been experiencing neck
pain for more than 3 months; 4) subjects who had never undergone surgical treatments; 5)
subjects who were not receiving medications; and 6) subjects who could not maintain blood
pressure at increments of 4&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg (i.e., second-stage pressure) from the initial 20&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg,
during the head-neck flexion examination<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Prior to the study, the participants were fully informed regarding
the study procedures and provided written consent for participation.</p><p>The DCF group consisted of six men and eight women (mean &#x000b1; SD: age, 46.7&#x000b1;4.2&#x02005;years; height,
164.3 &#x000b1; 6.78&#x02005;cm; weight, 67.8 &#x000b1; 7.7&#x02005;kg), and the GSE group consisted of seven men and seven
women (45.4 &#x000b1; 5.1&#x02005;years, 166.4 &#x000b1; 4.3&#x02005;cm, and 69.2 &#x000b1; 4.5&#x02005;kg).</p><p>The subjects was recruited by an independent researcher and then randomly assigned into two
groups by using a statistical program. The DCF and GSE groups (15 patients per group) were
compared in the study. Each exercise was implemented three times per week for 4 weeks. The
NDI, numeric rating scale (NRS) score for pain, and radiological assessment parameters of
neck-shoulder postures (i.e., head tilt angle [HTA], neck flexion angle [NFA], and forward
shoulder angle [FSA]) were analyzed before (baseline), 4 weeks after, and 8 weeks after
exercise in order to compare exercise effects between the groups. During the study, two
subjects dropped out (one per group); hence, 28 participants were enrolled for the final
analysis.</p><p>DCF activation exercise aimed to strengthen the upper neck deep flexor muscles (i.e.,
longus capitis and longus colli). The superficial sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene
muscles were kept relaxed while performing flexor muscle training for the neck and head<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>. The pressure biofeedback device
(Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback, Chattanooga Group, Chattanooga, USA) was positioned on the
back head, and then flattened cervical lordosis was confirmed by using the visual feedback
obtained via the dials of the device. First, the air bag under the neck was inflated to
20&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, and then the subject presses the bag slightly with slight increments of pressure
through the sensor dial (i.e., 2&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg; up to 30 mmHg), contraction was maintained for about
10&#x02013;15 seconds. This was repeated 10 times with 3&#x02013;5 rest periods per session<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the GSE, conventional isocratic and gradual exercise were adopted. In the present
study, the exercise for the muscles surrounding the neck, suggested by Axen et al.<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, was slightly modified. In particular, by
using an exercise band and a ball, isometric exercise was provided for the first 2 weeks.
Then, gradual exercise was performed in the next 4 weeks. The exercise was maintained toward
the front, both sides, and backward for 10 seconds in order to contract the muscles
surrounding the neck, followed by a rest period. Ten sessions were performed. Five different
stretching postures were performed with straight and fixed positions. Neck stretching, neck
bending over, neck bending to both sides, and neck rotation were repeated 3&#x02013;5 times for 10
seconds. Stretching exercises were repeated three times<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>The study results were analyzed by using SPSS version 18.0 for Windows. The
repeated-measures analysis of variance and independent t test were performed to compare
effects before and after exercise, and clinical effects between the groups, respectively.
The significance level <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> was set at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Changes in NDI showed significant decreases before, 4 weeks after, and 8 weeks after

exercise or GSE for 4 weeks; and then, relevant parameters were assessed before, 4 weeks
after, and 8 weeks after exercise in order to monitor the effects of these exercises on neck
pain, functional status, and neck-shoulder postures via prospective comparisons. The results
indicated that in both exercise groups, neck pain, NDI, and changes in neck-shoulder
postures were considerably improved after 4 weeks of exercise. Furthermore, in the DCF
group, these parameters were more significantly affected by the DCF exercise than the GSE
after 8 weeks of follow-up.</p><p>Recent reports regarding neck pain demonstrated that the strengthening exercise for DCF
muscles successfully improved neck and shoulder postures, and reduced symptoms in long-term
follow-up<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a study of 40 patients with chronic neck pain, Jull et al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that DCF exercise had more
favorable effects on pain and functional improvements than simple neck bending exercise.
Similarly, Lee et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that DCF
exercise alleviated pain, and improved neck and shoulder postures in female high-school
students. Moreover, Dusunceli et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>
implemented physical therapy, extension exercise, and DCF exercise for patients with neck
pain. In the 12-month long-term follow-up, the authors found improvement in pain and
functional disability in patients who performed DCF exercise.</p><p>In the present study, HTA was significantly reduced after 4 weeks of exercise in both the
GSE and DCF groups. To note, after 8 weeks of follow-up, the effect of DCF exercise on HTA
was more significant than that of GSE. Although these results are somewhat different from
the results of the study of Szeto et al.<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>,
which assessed postures using a video camera at a distance of 1.5&#x02005;m. However, the trend in
the reduction was similar between the studies. Furthermore, albeit both exercises improved
NFA and FSA after 4 weeks of exercise, the effects of DCF exercise were more pronounced than
those of GSE at the final follow-up. These results are in agreement with those of other
previous studies that assessed angles of head/neck positions in response to chronic neck
pain by using a goniometer<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. A few
similar domestic studies are worth mentioning. Choi and Hwang<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup> analyzed head-spine and head rotation angles by using radiography
for groups of patients who underwent either posture correction alone or posture correction
in conjunction with the exercise program. The authors reported that the group of patients
who underwent both posture correction and an exercise program significantly reduced neck
angles. They found noticeable improvement in the forward head postures of the students.
Results herein and in the previous studies might be because the sling exercise program
stimulated deep cervical muscles, thereby inducing activation and positively influencing
neck-shoulder postures.</p><p>In the present study, NDI and NRS, which represent functional status, were improved by both
exercises after 4 weeks of follow-up. By contrast, after 8 weeks of exercise, a more
significant improvement was observed in the DCF group than in the GSE group. Jull et
al.<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup> compared the effects of the DCF
exercise and those of strengthen exercise for neck muscular strength on NDI and neck pain.
In their study, no significant difference was observed in pain alleviation, yet a noticeable
difference in NDI was found. Chiu et al.<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>
implemented DCF exercise for patients with neck pain for 6 weeks and found a significant
reduction in NDI. The above-mentioned results are in good agreement with the results of the
present study, showing that DCF exercise improved NDI after 8 weeks of follow-up. In
addition, a number of previous studies have demonstrated that DCF exercise relieved neck
pain and improved functionality in subjects with diverse occupations<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>DCF exercise, applied in the present study, has been reported to be an exercise/examination
method that is characterized by low loading and induces proper postures and activation of
deep, instead of superficial, muscles<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.
This method bends the head instead of the neck so that the deep longus colli and longus
colli muscles are activated as opposed to activation of the superficial muscles, including
the sternocleidomastoid and anterior scalene muscles. Hence, normal neck postures and
arrangement are recovered<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. In clinical
practice, patients with neck pain are common; however, relaxation or strengthening of
superficial muscles only has achieved short-term effects and limited to maintaining
effective posture correction and mitigation of symptoms<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>As society ages, the current interests in health and well-being have never been higher. In
parallel with this, the number of patients with neck pain, a typical musculoskeletal
disorder, has been continuously increasing. Hence, developing effective rehabilitation
exercises are critical to cope with this problem. Therefore, the present study confirmed
that DCF exercise for patients with chronic neck pain was more effective than GSE in terms
of recovering normal posture and arrangement, and reducing pain and NDI via decreases in
neck and shoulder angles. Thus, it might be clinically significant as a rehabilitation
exercise therapy for patients with neck pain in relation to their postures. However, this
study has several limitations. First, owing to the limited sample size, generalization of
the results for the entire patient population with neck pain is difficult. Furthermore, the
follow-up periods were relatively short. In the future, a long-term follow-up study with a
larger number of patients who are under well-controlled conditions might be warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Boyd-Clark</surname><given-names>LC</given-names></name><name><surname>Briggs</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Galea</surname><given-names>MP</given-names></name></person-group>: <article-title>Muscle spindle distribution, morphology, and density in
