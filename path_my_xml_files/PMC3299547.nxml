We studied the pharmacokinetics (PK) of this novel compound in subjects with mild-to-moderate inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This open-label, crossover, single-center trial was conducted in 12 subjects with IBD who were allocated to one of the two single intravenous (IV) bolus sequences of iron isomaltoside 1000: 100 mg followed by 200 mg, or vice-versa. PK variables were analyzed according to a single-compartment model.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The concentration-versus-time relationship for isomaltoside-bound iron (IBI) and total iron (TI) showed first-order kinetics with small deviations from dose-linearity. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values in h * &#x003bc;g/mL for IBI following 100 mg and 200 mg doses were 888 and 2141 respectively, and for TI following 100 mg and 200 mg doses, the AUC values were 1010 and 2319 respectively. The corresponding maximum serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) values in &#x003bc;g/mL were 35.6 and 68.6 for IBI, and 37.3 and 71.1 for TI. The half-life (T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub>) values for IBI and TI were between 20.8&#x02013;23.5 hours. The apparent volume of distribution (V<sub>D</sub>) ranged from 3.0&#x02013;3.5 L. Only approximately 1% of the doses administered were excreted in the urine. No serious adverse event (SAE) was reported. One subject was withdrawn after the 100 mg dose due to abdominal pain and flushing.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>At the administered doses, iron isomaltoside 1000 showed first-order PK, and did not raise safety concerns in patients with IBD.

Iron supplementation can generally be accomplished by the oral or intravenous (IV) routes; however, in IBD patients approximately 90% of the ingested iron is not absorbed, passes the sites of intestinal inflammation, and induces local oxidative stress at sites of active inflammation. Therefore, the IV route is preferable for iron supplementation in IBD patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-6-043">2</xref></p><p>Iron isomaltoside 1000 (Monofer<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Pharmacosmos A/S, Holbaek, Denmark) is a new chemical structure developed by complexing ferric hydroxide with isomaltoside 1000. Isomaltoside 1000 is a chemical modification of isomaltooligosaccharides with a mean molecular weight of 1000 Da, consisting predominantly of 3&#x02013;5 glucose units. In contrast to dextrans, isomaltoside 1000 is linear and unbranched, with a low immunological potential &#x02013; hence, a test dose is unnecessary. Iron isomaltoside 1000 contains strongly-bound iron within an iron&#x02013;isomaltoside matrix formulation, with little risk of free iron toxicity.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dddt-6-043">3</xref></p><p>The primary objective of this trial was to provide pharmacokinetic (PK) data for isomaltoside-bound iron (IBI), transferrin-bound iron (TBI), and total iron (TI) in subjects with an established diagnosis of IBD after IV bolus injection of iron isomaltoside 1000, including the potential contribution of urine excretion to the elimination of IBI from plasma. The secondary objective was to assess the tolerability and safety of iron isomaltoside 1000 in this patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was conducted at a single center in Denmark (PhaseOneTrials A/S) in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and complied with International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements. Prior to commencement, the trial protocol and/or other relevant documents were approved by the Independent Ethics Committee. Before each subject was admitted to the trial, written informed consent was obtained from the subject according to Danish regulatory and legal requirements.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Trial design, outcomes, and eligibility criteria</title><p>This was an open-label, crossover, single center, PK trial of iron isomaltoside 1000 given as IV bolus doses of 100 mg or 200 mg to subjects with IBD.</p><p>Inclusion criteria were the following: mild-to-moderate IBD (colitis ulcerosa or Crohn&#x02019;s disease) for at least 3 months, aged 18&#x02013;70 years, <italic>s</italic>-ferritin &#x0003c;800 &#x003bc;g/L, transferrin saturation &#x0003c;30%, life expectancy beyond 12 months, hemoglobin (Hb) levels from 8.9&#x02013;15.3 g/dL in male patients, and Hb levels from 8.9&#x02013;13.7 g/dL in female patients. Exclusion criteria were the following: patients with severe IBD or surgery within the last 8 weeks, noniron deficiency anemia, iron overload or hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis, previous hypersensitivity to iron dextran or monodisaccharide complex, history of multiple allergies, liver cirrhosis or hepatitis, acute or chronic infections, rheumatoid arthritis, pregnancy or breastfeeding, active bleeding, planned elective surgery during the study where significant blood loss was expected, and participation in any other clinical study within 3 months prior to screening.</p><p>The duration of the trial period for each individual subject was a maximum of 7 weeks and consisted of nine visits: Visit 1 (Day &#x02013;14 to Day &#x02013;3, screening), Visit 2 (Day &#x02013;1, randomization; Day 0, baseline and dosing), Visit 3 (24 hours postdose), Visit 4 (48 hours postdose), Visit 5 (72 hours postdose), followed by a washout period of 28 days, Visit 6 (Day &#x02013;1, rehospitalization and Day 0, baseline and dosing), Visit 7 (24 hours postdose), Visit 8 (48 hours postdose), and Visit 9 (72 hours postdose and treatment termination visit). Visit 9 was also to be carried out in withdrawn subjects who had received at least one dose of iron isomaltoside 1000. Blood samples for PK assessments were drawn at the following time points: &#x02212;30, 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, and 45 minutes, and at 1, 1.5, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours.</p><p>Iron isomaltoside 1000 was administered twice to each subject as a single IV bolus dose, with a minimum dose interval of at least 4 weeks. The first six subjects were allocated to group 1 (100 mg/200 mg), and the next six subjects were allocated to group 2 (200 mg/100 mg). Iron isomaltoside 1000 was administered at an injection rate of 50 mg iron/min for both doses. For safety reasons, dosing of individual subjects was performed with 30-minute intervals.</p><p>TI and TBI were measured in plasma and urine, and IBI was estimated as the difference between the two. The PK parameters were estimated according to a single-compartment model, and included maximum serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>); time to C<sub>max</sub> (T<sub>max</sub>), calculated serum concentration at time 0 (C<sub>0</sub>) obtained by back-extrapolation to time 0 of the log-linear regression at the 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour sample points, area under the serum concentration-time curve from injection to last measurable data point (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;end</sub>), area under the serum concentration-time curve from injection to infinity (AUC<sub>inf</sub>); the elimination constant (K<sub>e</sub>) derived from each dosing episode profile by log-linear regression at the 12, 24, 48, and 72 hour sample point, T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> derived from K<sub>e</sub>, and apparent V<sub>D</sub> derived from C<sub>0</sub>. Urine was sampled accumulatively during four time intervals following each dosing event: 0&#x02013;8, 8&#x02013;24, 24&#x02013;48, and 48&#x02013;72 hours.</p><p>The safety parameters included laboratory tests (hematology, biochemistry, and urine analyses), physical examination, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature), electrocardiogram (ECG), incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), and adverse drug reactions (ADRs).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Analytical methods</title><p>IBI in human serum was analyzed by Unilabs A/S ( Copenhagen, Denmark) (a GCP- and ISO17025-accredited laboratory), by means of differentiation method. The TI content was determined by Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GFAAS) system with Zeeman background correction delivered by Varian (now Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The content of TBI was determined by photometry on an automated Advia 1650 Chemistry System delivered by Bayer HealthCare (now Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Munich, Germany). Subtracting the Advia result from the GFAAS result yielded the content of IBI, assuming that no free iron was present and that amounts of ferritin were negligible, so that the only iron forms present in plasma were TI, TBI, and IBI. The interassay precision (coefficient of variation) of the GFAAS and Advia quality control samples ranged between 7.6%&#x02013;10.2% for the GFAAS analysis, and between 1.0%&#x02013;1.1% for the Advia analysis. The mean inaccuracy ranged between &#x02013;1.1%&#x02013;6.9% for the GFAAS analysis and between &#x02013;1.7% and &#x02013;3.2% for the Advia method. The GFAAS method was used to measure the total quantity of iron in serum samples after acid digestion (65% HNO<sub>3</sub>) at 115&#x000b0;C followed by the addition of Triton-X-100 to obtain a tenfold dilution. A linear calibration curve was achieved by the principles of standard addition by programming the GFAAS instrument to automatically add different concentrations of iron standard to human serum containing 43.57 &#x003bc;mol/L. The added iron standard was prepared by spiking water with iron isomaltoside 1000 to a concentration of 69.56 &#x003bc;mol/L, followed by dilution to the added concentration.</p><p>The concentration of IBI in urine was also analyzed by means of a differentiation method based on the same laboratory methods as for serum iron determination: GFAAS for TI, and Advia for TBI. The quality of the method for determination of IBI was satisfactory. The interassay precision (coefficient of variation) of the GFAAS and Advia quality control samples ranged between 1.1%&#x02013;6.9% for the GFAAS analysis, and between 0.2%&#x02013;0.4% for the Advia analysis. The mean inaccuracy ranged between &#x02013;1.8% and 14.9% for the GFAAS analysis and between 1.4%&#x02013;4.1% for the Advia method.</p><p>GFAAS analytical method was used to measure the total quantity of iron in urine samples after dilution and addition of Triton-X-100. The instrument is linear-calibrated, using Titrisol-spiked calibrators produced by Unilabs A/S. The calibration curve ranged from 0.0&#x02013;10.1 &#x003bc;mol/L. For determination of TBI in urine by ADVIA method, Fe<sup>3+</sup> was first separated from transferrin under acidic conditions, then reduced to Fe<sup>2+</sup> with ascorbic acid and finally combined with Ferrozine, to give a chromogenic complex which absorbs at 571/658 nm.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical methods</title><p>The crossover design &#x02013; with a washout period in between the two exposures to different doses of iron isomaltoside 1000 &#x02013; created a pairing of results that was utilized during the analyses.

However, based on data on <italic>s</italic>-iron concentrations from a previous trial (data on file) the coefficient of variation (CV) of the mean C<sub>max</sub> was expected to be in the range of 5%&#x02013;7% in 12 subjects.

A sample size of 12 subjects was therefore decided.</p><p>Primary PK endpoints, AUC<sub>0&#x02013;end</sub> and C<sub>max</sub>, were log-transformed and analyzed in a mixed linear normal model, with treatment and visit as fixed effects and subject as random effect.

Thirty-one events were classified as related to trial drug (ie, ADRs), and 12 as unrelated. One subject was withdrawn from the trial due to an ADR after the first dose (100 mg) of iron isomaltoside 1000. Among the 11 ADRs experienced by this subject, two were graded as severe in intensity (abdominal pain and flushing). Despite this, the symptoms were not suggestive of an acute anaphylactic reaction; this subject was initially treated with antihistamine and glucocorticosteroid to prevent any progression of the acute reaction and/or a potential delayed allergic reaction. The subject was followed up and all ADR symptoms were resolved. No other subjects experienced severe ADRs. No clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters or vital signs were reported. Among all the AEs, three were local irritations and two of these were considered ADRs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Anemia is the most common systemic complication of IBD, and has considerable impact on quality of life. In a recently-published guideline on the diagnosis and management of anemia and iron deficiency in IBD, authors argued that IV iron appears to be more effective, better tolerated, and improves the quality of life to a greater extent than oral iron supplements.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dddt-6-043">2</xref> The PK data obtained from this study can be considered valuable in this patient cohort, who may benefit from iron isomaltoside 1000.</p><p>The concentrations of IBI in plasma and urine were derived from concentrations of TI and TBI, assuming that no free iron was present and that the amount of ferritin was negligible so that the only iron forms present in plasma were TI, TBI, and IBI.

The PK parameters for IBI were close to that of TI, which implies that TI may be a good surrogate for IBI. Recent in vitro studies document that the tightly-bound iron isomaltoside 1000 matrix formulation contains a very low level of free iron.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dddt-6-043">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-6-043">10</xref> The fact that low-molecular-weight iron dextran had higher free iron in these experiments highlights the differences between these compounds.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dddt-6-043">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dddt-6-043">10</xref></p><p>For both TI and IBI, the shape of the log-transformed concentration-versus-time curves were compatible with first order PK, which is consistent with the PK of iron-dextran for iron doses up to 500 mg,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-6-043">11</xref> and with ferumoxytol for iron doses up to 4 mg/kg after a single IV dose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-6-043">8</xref> This did not appear to be the case for ferric-gluconate<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-6-043">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dddt-6-043">7</xref> nor for iron-hydroxide sucrose complex<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-6-043">12</xref> both of which saw a fast initial drop during the first 4&#x02013;6 hours, followed by a slower elimination rate.</p><p>For both IBI and TI, a more than twofold increase was observed in the mean AUC and C<sub>max</sub> for the 200 mg dose, compared to the 100 mg dose, which was a deviation from dose-linearity and correlates with PK of ferumoxytol,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-6-043">8</xref> which likely represents the capacity-limited elimination from plasma to the reticuloendothelial system (RES) described previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-6-043">13</xref> The V<sub>D</sub> based on apparent initial concentration ranged from 3.0&#x02013;3.5 L. This corresponds roughly to the plasma volume (normally 40&#x02013;50 mL/kg), and is comparable to the other IV iron preparations except ferric gluconate, for which a V<sub>D</sub> at steady-state reached 6.7 L in one study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-6-043">6</xref> This indicates that practically all IBI is contained in plasma before being eliminated by RES.</p><p>The PK analysis was done assuming a one-compartment model with first-order PK, the model also used for a single-dose study of ferumoxytol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-6-043">8</xref> Other authors used a two-compartment model for PK of iron-carbohydrate complex; for repeated-dose ferumoxytol<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dddt-6-043">9</xref> and for ferric gluconate,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dddt-6-043">7</xref> however, both one- and two-compartment methods described the data accurately. For carbohydrate-bound iron, a one-compartment model makes sense from the physiological viewpoint. According to the literature, IV iron compounds are eliminated from plasma by the RES, which splits the compound into iron and carbohydrate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-6-043">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dddt-6-043">13</xref> Once sequestered by RES, the complex cannot be restored in the circulation, thus the RES is not a &#x0201c;compartment&#x0201d; as there is no return of the complex from RES to plasma. Rather, RES should be considered as the elimination system for the complex.</p><p>However, two compartments may be considered for TI: plasma (central compartment) and RES (peripheral compartment) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-6-043">Figure 2</xref>). RES is also an elimination pathway for TI, which is then either bound to intracellular storage proteins (eg, in the liver), or transported to bone marrow for hematopoiesis. Other elimination methods include urine excretion, and loss due to blood sampling. Although iron contained in storage proteins and iron incorporated into erythrocytes returns to plasma, this process is not part of the model since it is unlikely to occur before practically all iron has been eliminated from plasma, following a single administration of iron isomaltoside 1000. TBI is not considered a separate compartment for TI, since it is contained in the central compartment (plasma). Based on the ratio between AUCs for TBI and TI, 10%&#x02013;16% of iron administered as IBI returns to plasma from the RES compartment, under the assumption that all measured TBI originates from the iron isomaltoside complex. Despite the theoretical presence of the RES compartment, the shape of the concentration-time curve for TI suggests that plasma and RES behave as a single compartment for the purposes of PK.</p><p>The elimination T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> for IBI and TI for the 100 mg dose was 20.8 and 23.2 hours respectively, which is slightly shorter than T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> for iron dextran, which was approximately 30 hours,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11-dddt-6-043">11</xref> slightly longer than for ferumoxytol, which was approximately 16 hours for a 250 mg dose<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-dddt-6-043">8</xref>, and significantly longer than the T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> for iron-sucrose complex,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-6-043">12</xref> ferric carboxymaltose, and ferric gluconate.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-6-043">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-dddt-6-043">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-6-043">14</xref> The T<sub>&#x000bd;</sub> should be taken into account when selecting the dose frequency. The observed mean T<sub>max</sub> values for IBI and TI ranged from 27&#x02013;38 minutes. By comparison, T<sub>max</sub> values for TI after bolus injection of ferric carboxymaltose were 16 minutes after a bolus injection and 20, 60, and 72 minutes following a 15-minute infusion of 500, 800, and 1000 mg respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15-dddt-6-043">15</xref></p><p>Urine excretion was negligible (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-dddt-6-043">Table 3</xref>). The average amount excreted was 0.9% of the injected dose following administration of the100 mg dose (range: 0.6%&#x02013;1.1%) and following the 200 mg dose the urine iron excretion was 1.1% of the dose administered (range: 0.7%&#x02013;1.4%). This indicates that renal elimination of iron associated with IV administration of iron isomaltoside 1000 is negligible, and this has two clinical implications: (1) that iron administered as iron isomaltoside 1000 is almost entirely confined to the organism and can be used for hematopoiesis; and (2) no impact of renal failure on the elimination of TI is expected. By comparison, the calculated proportion of ferric gluconate excreted in the urine was 2.4% and 2.3% after IV infusions of 62.5 mg and 125 mg, respectively.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dddt-6-043">6</xref> For iron sucrose, the urine excretion of iron is more important and corresponds to 5% during the first 4 hours postdose.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-6-043">12</xref></p><p>The iron loss due to plasma sampling was not taken into account.

Despite this, the symptoms were not suggestive of an acute anaphylactic reaction; the patient was initially treated with antihistamine and glucocorticosteroid to prevent any progress in the acute reaction and/or a potential delayed allergic reaction. The subject was followed up and all ADR symptoms were resolved.</p><p>There was no correlation between dosage and the number of ADRs or their severity. From the reported ADRs and their severity (excluding the withdrawn subject) it was not possible to correlate ADRs to C<sub>max</sub> or AUC from the different dosages. There were too few reported ADRs, and from the review in the investigator&#x02019;s brochure there was no obvious relationship between either of the kinetic factors mentioned.</p><p>Overall, iron isomaltoside 1000 (100 mg and 200 mg) given as an IV injection not exceeding 50 mg iron/minute showed, as expected, a first-order kinetic profile for both IBI and TI, and was also shown to be safe in the administered doses in this IBD-diagnosed patient group. The compound has been given at single doses from 100 mg to as high as 1800 mg to patients with either chronic kidney disease or chronic heart failure suffering from iron-deficiency anemia.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16-dddt-6-043">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17-dddt-6-043">17</xref> Based upon the current study, TI can be used as surrogate for IBI in future PK studies with such high doses of iron isomaltoside 1000.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments and disclosure</title><p>KN, HA, and LLT are employed by the Sponsor, Pharmacosmos A/S.
