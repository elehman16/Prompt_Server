To address these critical questions, we conducted a post hoc meta-analysis of data from 9 clinical trials of desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/d in patients with MDD. The key objective of this post hoc analysis was to assess the time point at which a statistically significant improvement was observed in depressive symptoms during treatment with desvenlafaxine or placebo.

Statistically significant improvement in depressive symptoms based on HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total score with desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d compared with placebo was observed after 1 week of treatment. Among individual studies included in the analysis, a treatment effect on the HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total score was observed as early as week 1 in 1 desvenlafaxine trial<sup><xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and at week 2 or later in all other positive trials.<sup><xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>Treatment guidelines state that antidepressant medications should be given an &#x0201c;adequate trial,&#x0201d; which is generally considered to be use of an adequate antidepressant dose for 4 to 8 weeks in duration.<sup><xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> If improvement in symptoms (commonly defined in clinical trials as &#x02265;20% change from baseline in depression scale scores<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup>) is not observed at 2 to 4 weeks, a dose increase is recommended.<sup><xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Meta-analyses have shown that the onset of antidepressant effect can occur as early as 1 to 2 weeks of treatment,<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> and the current analysis indicates that the mean time course of treatment effect with desvenlafaxine 50 and 100 mg/d in a clinical trial population is consistent with that of other antidepressant drugs examined. In meta-analyses of data from clinical trials of duloxetine, HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total scores separated from placebo at week 2,<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> and analyses of HAM-D<sub>17</sub> Maier subscale showed a significant difference from placebo at week 1 for duloxetine and escitalopram.<sup><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> In an analysis of 20 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor trials, a significant difference versus placebo on various rating scale scores was observed at week 1.<sup><xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Although knowledge of mean time course of response to a specific antidepressant treatment may be useful in managing patient expectations and monitoring early improvement, it is important to bear in mind that patients will show individual patterns of response. A 2-week time frame is commonly used for assessing early improvement in clinical trial populations, but a substantial number of patients who do not meet criteria for early improvement at week 2 may nonetheless go on to achieve remission with no change in treatment.<sup><xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>In the current analysis, early improvement in symptoms of depression (&#x02265;20% reduction from baseline in HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total score at week 2) was significantly associated with both a greater probability of remission at week 8 and shorter time to remission. Patients who had a 20% or greater reduction in depressive symptoms (as measured by HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total score) after 2 weeks of treatment, regardless of treatment assignment, had approximately 5 times greater odds of achieving remission at week 8 compared with patients who did not show 20% improvement at week 2. Previously published studies for antidepressant treatment of MDD have reported that patients with early improvement on the HAM-D<sub>17</sub>, MADRS, or Beck Depression Inventory are more likely than those without early improvement to be responders or remitters later in treatment.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> In the current analysis, early improvement was predictive of later treatment outcome among patients treated with either active treatment or placebo. Few previously published analyses of the association between early improvement and later depression outcomes have included placebo groups. In a meta-analysis of 41 antidepressant trials, the positive predictive value of early improvement was similar for predicting remission in placebo and active treatment groups, but for predicting response, positive predictive value seemed to be lower for the placebo group.<sup><xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In the current analysis, greater numbers of desvenlafaxine-treated patients versus placebo-treated patients met the early improvement threshold, and numerically greater proportions of early improvers treated with desvenlafaxine versus placebo went on to achieve response and remission. However, the odds of remission after early improvement did not differ significantly between treatment groups. The association between early improvement and time to response has also been previously examined, and&#x02014;as in this analysis&#x02014;early improvement in depressive symptoms was associated with shorter time to response.<sup><xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> This analysis extends that finding to demonstrate that early improvement significantly predicts time to remission.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first analysis of data from randomized controlled trials that examined the clinical and demographic features that might be associated with early improvement in depressive symptoms. In an open-label study that assessed relationships between brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations and response to duloxetine treatment, higher baseline BDNF concentrations were observed in patients who showed improvement in symptoms at week 2, although BDNF concentrations at baseline did not differ in eventual remitters versus nonremitters.<sup><xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The influence of baseline demographic or clinical characteristics was not examined in that trial. In a naturalistic study of female inpatients receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy, most of whom also received psychoactive medications, early improvers were older than those without early improvement and were less likely to have comorbid disorders.<sup><xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, after controlling for age, severity of depressive symptoms, and treatment duration, early improvement in depressive symptoms predicted remission regardless of whether patients had, or did not have, medical comorbidities. In the current analysis, other than assignment to desvenlafaxine treatment, the only baseline factors that were predictors of early response to treatment were baseline depression scale scores and race.</p><p>The main limitations of this analysis are related to its post hoc nature and the fact that the studies included were not designed to assess the speed of improvement in depressive symptoms. Indeed, these findings are limited by the timing of the assessments because the earliest time point available for assessment of improvement was 1 week. Furthermore, the value of the week 1 assessment for the desvenlafaxine 100-mg/d group was limited by the use of the 50-mg titration dose during the first week. Although the patients assigned to 100 mg/d may not have received the full 100-mg/d dose before the week 1 assessment, however, they did receive the 50-mg dose over that period, which showed statistical separation at week 1. In addition, although the studies analyzed were similar in design, there were differences among them in planned treatment duration and population characteristics. The examination of predictors of early improvement was limited to the inclusion of only those demographic and clinical characteristics that were collected in the pooled studies and thus available for analysis. Finally, inclusion and exclusion criteria in all studies were designed to select a patient population that was generally healthy with a primary diagnosis of MDD. Given that clinically significant comorbid conditions are common in patients with MDD,<sup><xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> these results may not generalize to a wider MDD patient population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Statistically significant improvements from baseline in depressive symptoms were observed as early as 1 week after treatment initiation with desvenlafaxine 50 or 100 mg/d versus placebo. Early improvement in HAM-D<sub>17</sub> total score at week 2 predicted remission at week 8 and was associated with a shorter time to remission. In addition, lower baseline depression scale scores were associated with a significantly greater probability of early improvement. These findings suggest that clinicians may be able to use depression rating scale scores early in treatment as a guide to inform later treatment with desvenlafaxine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="jcp-37-555-s001.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e754" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="jcp-37-555-s002.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e755" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="jcp-37-555-s003.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e756" position="anchor"/><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="jcp-37-555-s004.docx" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e757" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Kathleen M.
