During intensive care unit (ICU) stay, complications such as self-extubation exit of life-saving catheters and asynchrony between patient and ventilator, sternum instability, and the need for surgical revision of the sternal wound may increase.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The wide range in reported incidences of delirium (3%&#x02013;52%) was explained by the different study designs and different methods of assessing delirium.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] There is evidence to support inflammation in the pathogenesis of delirium in both peripheral and central tissues with C-reactive protein (CRP) as a marker for infection and inflammation.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Postcardiac surgery sedation protocols reduce stress response and provide anxiolysis.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The pain, agitation, and delirium guidelines recommend using dexmedetomidine or propofol instead of benzodiazepines therapy in ICU patients developing delirium.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Dexmedetomidine is highly selective and potent central alpha 2-receptor agonist which binds to transmembrane G protein-binding adrenoreceptors and has no activity on the g-aminobutyric acid system.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Dexmedetomidine has opioid-sparing effects by decreasing central nervous system sympathetic outflow. Dexmedetomidine is unique among sedatives used in the ICU because it produces sedation and analgesia without causing respiratory depression.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>The incidence of pain is up to 50% in medical and surgical patients at rest and up to 80% during common care procedures in ICU patients. The continuous use of opioids as analgesics in up to 90% of mechanically ventilated patients may lead to drug and metabolite accumulation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>This study was designed to compare dexmedetomidine with morphine and midazolam-based regimen after cardiac surgery at equivalent levels of sedation and analgesia to decrease the incidence of postoperative delirium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Methods</title><p>After approval by the institute ethics committee and registration with the ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03078946), this study was conducted in Ain Shams university hospitals, from March 2013 to April 2015, on 60 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery under general anesthesia, at least 60 years old, ASA physical status I and II, 70&#x02013;100 kg body weight, and height 160&#x02013;180 cm. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>Patients were not admitted to the study if any of the following criteria were present: (1) patient's refusal, (2) allergy to any drugs of the study, (3) history of drug or alcohol abuse, (4) history of uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension, (5) history of chronic pain or daily intake of analgesics within 24 h before surgery, and (6) impaired kidney or liver functions.</p><p>Patients were randomly allocated into either of the two groups, A and B postoperatively.</p><p>Group A (30 patients) received a loading dose of 1 &#x003bc;g/kg dexmedetomidine (Precedex; Hospira, Precedex 200 mcg/2 ml, Hospira. Inc, Lake Forest, USA) diluted in 100 ml 0.9% saline infused over 10 min immediately postoperative, followed by continuous infusion of 0.2&#x02013;0.7 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Group B (30 patients) received morphine in a dose of 10&#x02013;50 &#x003bc;g/kg/h as an analgesic (Morphine Sulphate ampoule; 10 mg/1 ml, Misr Co. Egypt) with midazolam in a dose of 0.05 mg/kg up to 0.2 mg/kg (Dormicum ampoule containing 15 mg/3 ml, Roche; USA) repeated as needed. Titration of the study medications infusions included interruption (4 h) and reduction aimed to maintain light sedation (Richmond agitation-sedation scale [RASS] &#x02212;2 to + 1) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This study was designed to be a randomized double-blind parallel clinical trial, in which the patients and the investigators were blinded to the given treatment. Randomization was done using computer-generated number table of random numbers in a 1:1 ratio and conducted using sequentially numbered, opaque, and sealed envelope. The study drugs were prepared by the ICU residents not involved in any other part of the study.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Richmond agitation-sedation scale</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-12-190-g001"/></table-wrap><p>Upon arrival at the ICU, a standardized protocol for postoperative care was implemented for all patients. Infusion rates for all sedative protocols were titrated to achieve and maintain light sedation (RASS &#x02212;2 to +1) before extubation and (RASS 0) after extubation. All patients were extubated when deemed clinically appropriate according to local protocols. Because of their specific pharmacologic properties (i.e., respiratory depression), patients were weaned off propofol or midazolam infusions before extubation, whereas patients receiving dexmedetomidine were extubated while still on the medication and were kept on the maintenance infusion as deemed clinically necessary for a maximum of 24 h.</p><p>Initial assessment and stabilization of both patient groups include clinical examination, hemodynamics (invasive blood pressure, heart rate [HR], and drains), activated clotting time, electrocardiography, chest X-ray, and arterial blood gases including sodium and potassium. All patients were allowed to take 200 &#x003bc;g fentanyl and 5 mg midazolam immediately on admission. Electrocardiography, chest X-ray, arterial blood gases including sodium and potassium, kidney function, coagulation profile if valve surgery or bleeding occurred, liver function if delirium occurred and CRP quantitative titer were daily performed at 7 a.m.</p><p>Delirium was monitored and reassessed up to a maximum of 7 days after surgery and the assessment takes place in two steps: first, the level of consciousness must be assessed using the RASS. If the patient appears to have a RASS score &#x02265;3, then evaluation of delirium using the confusion assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) can be performed. The CAM-ICU includes the assessment of 4 different features: acute change or fluctuating course of mental status, inattention, altered level of consciousness, and disorganized thinking. CAM-ICU is considered positive when features 1 and 2 and either 3 or 4 are present.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] The CAM-ICU was performed once daily before midday, independent of additional analgesia or sedation. Abnormal or delirious behavior was recorded every shift by the bedside nurse (nurse:patient ratio 1:1) and reviewed by the research team. The number of delirium days was determined by following delirious patients until 7 days after surgery. Patients were considered delirium free when they were free of delirium for &#x0003e;24 h and alive.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Group A</title><p>Dexmedetomidine was diluted in 5% dextrose, given through a separate line and infusion device clearly marked &#x0201c;DO NOT BOLUS.&#x0201d; Intensive care staff were familiar with the unique characteristics of dexmedetomidine sedation, particularly the state of &#x0201c;rousable sedation&#x0201d; where patients respond promptly to verbal stimuli or light touch.

Third, inability to compare cost in these trials because drug-related cost was not well-defined provided that dexmedetomidine is currently much more expensive than commonly used drugs (for example, propofol).

No significant differences between the two groups for the outcome measures, except HR, which was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Meanwhile, Barletta <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a retrospective, cohort study of 100 patients to determine the impact of dexmedetomidine on analgesic requirements after coronary artery bypass graft surgery or valvular surgery and found that the dexmedetomidine resulted in reducing opioid needs in patients after cardiac surgery versus those receiving propofol, but this did not reduce durations of mechanical ventilation, using a fast-track cardiovascular recovery unit model.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Partially consistent with these results, a study by Eremenko <italic>et al</italic>., performed on 55 cardiovascular surgery patients to compare the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and propofol for short-term controlled sedation and analgesia in the early postoperative period after cardiac surgery and concluded that dexmedetomidine induced less sedation level and more often provided retrograde amnesia with the same duration of mechanical ventilation and awakening rate compared to propofol. Dexmedetomidine provided its own analgesic effect and shortened the length of patient's stay in ICU. Bradycardia was noted more frequently in dexmedetomidine group while arterial hypotension, general malaise and delirium were noted more frequently in propofol group.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>On the contrary to this study, Maldonado <italic>et al</italic>. found that dexmedetomidine had opioid-sparing effects due to a significant reduction in fentanyl and total morphine-equivalents compared to midazolam in the postoperative period and partially consistent with this study as no significant difference in fentanyl and total morphine-equivalents was seen between dexmedetomidine and propofol patients.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Our study presented several limitations. First, the small size of this study raised the possibility that these results were confounded by unobserved imbalance in the baseline characteristics of the two groups. The second limitation was that this single-center design was a potential limitation of the trial with a possible bias by institutional standards of care. The third limitation was that our trial lacked power to show a significant reduction in mortality. Even though the reduction in morbidity in small surgical population gave a remarkable value for this relatively simple intervention, it will need further evaluation in a larger multi-center study. The fourth limitation was that time to hospital discharge, an important outcome due to its economic implications and affected by the presence of postoperative pain should be taken in consideration in further randomized clinical trials.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using dexmedetomidine versus morphine and midazolam for analgesia and sedation in adult cardiac surgery significantly reduced the length of stay in ICU and significantly did not cause significant bradycardia or hypotension in dexmedetomidine group with no significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative delirium, CRP, duration of intubation and mechanical ventilation, and the amount used of analgesics and sedatives in both groups.</p><p>The research team suggested that these results of this work justified the conduct of a larger size, double-blinded randomized controlled trial including patient's aged 60 years or more, determining other inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha and CD64), using of high-sensitivity immunosorbent assay for evaluation of CRP and allowing use of dexmedetomidine up to 1.5 &#x003bc;/kg/h &#x0003e;24 h, incorporating cost-effectiveness and quality of life analyses.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"
