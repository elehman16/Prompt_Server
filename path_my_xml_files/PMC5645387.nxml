The aim of this study was to achieve higher rate of HBsAg loss through extended PegIFN treatment. 98 patients with HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2,000&#x02009;IU/ml and HBV DNA&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x02009;IU/ml were randomized to receive PegIFN&#x003b1;-2b or continuing NA therapy for 60 weeks. At the end of treatment (EOT) and end of follow-up (EOF), only patients who switched to PegIFN&#x003b1;-2b achieved HBsAg loss (32.6%) and HBsAg seroconversion (27.9% and 25.6%). Patients who switched to PegIFN&#x003b1;-2b also achieved higher HBeAg seroconversion rates (65.1%) and HBeAg loss (81.4% and 90.7%) than those who continued NAs treatment. On-treatment HBsAg declines predicted the responses at EOT, and HBsAg declines at post-baseline times predicted the responses at EOF. The rates of responses were not increased through extended PegIFN&#x003b1;&#x000a0;treatment. For patients with low HBsAg and HBV suppression with NAs, switching to PegIFN&#x003b1;-2b significantly increased the rates of HBsAg loss and HBsAg seroconversion.

The current antiviral treatments for CHB include nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) and peginterferon (PegIFN) alfa. NAs can effectively suppress the HBV viral loads and reduce HBV-related morbidity and mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. However, the virological and clinical relapse rates are high after cessation of treatment; so long-term treatment is required<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. PegIFN alfa can induce viral suppression in approximately 25% of patients but is associated with additional side effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Currently, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss within a finite duration of therapy is considered a &#x0201c;functional cure&#x0201d; but is difficult to obtain through current antiviral approaches. Thus, a therapy leading to HBsAg loss with the aim to end treatment is highly desirable.</p><p id="Par3">Previous studies have reported that the serum HBsAg level is related to intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, and serum HBsAg lowered to an undetectable level may indicate that intrahepatic cccDNA has been eradicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. In addition, a reduction in the serum HBsAg level predicts serological and clinical outcomes and treatment responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Hence, HBsAg loss is the ideal endpoint for antiviral therapy. Unfortunately, the incidence of HBsAg loss is low with the currently available CHB treatments, at 10% to 12% for those patients receiving long-term follow-up treatment with both peg-IFN and NAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. As PegIFN alfa and NAs have different and complementary routes of action, the therapeutic approach of combining both drugs might be a good option for the treatment of CHB. Adding PegIFN to entecavir (ETV) significantly increased the reductions in HBsAg, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), and HBV DNA and led to more sustained responses after ETV discontinuation, thereby preventing relapse after stopping NAs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. In one prospective study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, HBeAg-positive CHB patients who had received ETV for 9&#x02013;36 months were randomized1:1 to switch to PegIFN alfa-2a or to continue with ETV for 48 weeks. The results showed that patients achieved virological suppression with ETV and that switching to a finite course of PegIFNalfa-2a significantly increased the rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss. Interestingly, the combination of HBeAg loss and HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;IU/ml at the time of switching was associated with high rates of HBeAg seroconversion (33.3%) and HBsAg loss (22.2%) following PegIFN alfa-2a therapy. In contrast, HBsAg levels&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;IU/ml were associated with the lowest rate of response. Unfortunately, the number of patients with HBeAg loss and HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;IU/ml were limited, and the treatment duration of PegIFN treatment was only 48 weeks. Several studies have demonstrated the potential benefit of extending the interferon treatment duration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. However, extending the PegIFN treatment duration did not show superiority over 48 weeks of PegIFN monotherapy in one randomized controlled study; patients who achieved HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;IU/ml after 24 weeks of PegIFN alfa-2a showed satisfactory outcomes after the withdrawal of PegIFN alfa-2a treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, all of above studies testing alternate optimization strategies were conducted on overall treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients and did not take into account NA-experienced patients. In some studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, patients with HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;IU/ml showed high rates of HBeAg seroconversion and HBsAg loss, although these studies were not performed in separate cohorts of patients with HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2,000&#x02009;IU/ml and HBV DNA&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x02009;IU/ml. In addition, the extension of PegIFN treatment was not performed, although longer treatment durations may lead to higher rates of HBsAg loss. Finally, these previous studies did not feature long-term follow-up after the cessation of the treatment or comparison with NA treatment alone.</p><p id="Par4">The aim of the current study was to prospectively evaluate whether the extension of switching to PegIFN from a stable NA regimen leads to a high loss of HBsAg in CHB patients with HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2,000&#x02009;IU/ml and HBV DNA&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x02009;IU/ml by nucleos(t)ide analogues.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient characteristics</title><p id="Par5">A total of 146 CHB patients with at least 2 years of prior NA exposure, HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2,000&#x02009;IU/ml and serum HBV DNA levels&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x02009;IU/ml were enrolled.

Previous studies have reported that the serum HBsAg level has some relationship with intrahepatic cccDNA, and serum HBsAg at an undetectable level may indicate that intrahepatic cccDNA has been eradicated<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. HBsAg loss with or without seroconversion to anti-HBs antibodies is considered a functional cure and an endpoint where antiviral treatment can be stopped for CHB patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Recently, more studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> have reported that switching treatment from NAs to PegIFN may induce higher rates of HBsAg loss. CHB patients who achieved virological suppression by ETV and switched to PegIFNalfa-2a for 48 weeks showed significantly increased rates of HBsAg loss (8.5%). Additionally, patients with HBsAg levels&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;IU/ml by ETV showed a high likelihood of HBsAg loss (22.2%) (OSST trial)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. In another study, 33.3% of patients receiving sequential therapy with ETV and PegIFNalfa-2a achieved HBsAg loss<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. Recently, 15.91% patients attained HBsAg loss in the PegIFN&#x003b1;-2a group than in the ETV monotherapy group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. In this study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, NA-experienced patients with virological suppression and HBsAg levels&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1,500&#x02009;IU/ml achieved higher HBsAg loss (32.6%, 41.67%) and HBsAg seroconversion (27.9%) after switching to PegIFN alfa-2b for 60 weeks than those who continued treatment with NAs (0%). The rate of HBsAg loss in this study was higher than that in the previous trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Extending PegIFN treatment duration (60 weeks) in this study may be an important factor for the observed superiority over 48 weeks PegIFN therapy in the previous trials. Indeed, the current study provides evidence to support the previous results that patients on long-term NAs can achieve significantly higher rates of HBsAg loss after switching to a finite course of PegIFN alfa. This finding is also consistent with previous reports showing that patients with a lower HBsAg level represent excellent candidates for the addition of PegIFN therapy and that a lower HBsAg level is associated with a high probability of HBsAg clearance and a good long-term prognosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>.

The rate of HBeAg seroconversion is another important parameter for antiviral treatment of CHB. In a recent study, the rate of HBeAg seroconversion was 65.1% and HBeAg loss was 90.7% at the EOF. In one study on the efficacy of PegIFN in treatment-experienced Chinese patients, the HBeAg loss and HBeAg seroconversion rates were greater than 60%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>.However, only 51.5% and 47% patients achieved HBeAg loss and seroconversion, respectively, after 48 weeks of PegIFN alfa treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. These results confirm that NA treatment-experienced patients with HBV DNA fully suppressed and HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2,000&#x02009;IU/ml have a greater chance of HBeAg seroconversion and HBeAg loss. However, in an ETV sequential combination therapy with PegIFN study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, patients with a baseline HBeAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;200&#x02009;S/CO and HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;1,000&#x02009;IU/ml and an HBsAg decline at week 12&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.5 log10&#x02009;IU/ml achieved the highest rate of HBeAg seroconversion (92.31%) and HBsAg loss (83.3%). In terms of these numbers, this study showed no extra superiority of switching from PegIFN alfa monotherapy compared to simultaneous combination therapy. Recently, more evidence has shown that sequential combination therapy with late &#x0201c;add-on&#x0201d; PegIFN alfa to ongoing NA treatment might be more beneficial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>. Sample size and the criteria of patient entry are important influential factors that we must not neglect when comparing studies.</p><p id="Par18">Recently, HBsAg levels and HBsAg declines have been considered to be an important factor associated with the response to PegIFN in CHB patients<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

An HBsAg decline was obvious in patients in the PegIFN switch group, and the degree of HBsAg decline was reduced after the end of PegIFN treatment. In particular, the decline in HBsAg among patients with no HBsAg loss was significantly slower than that in patients with HBsAg loss during the entire observation period. Our investigation of factors associated with treatment responses showed that only the decreases in HBsAg levels at all observation points were significantly associated with HBsAg loss in patients who received PegIFN switch treatment.

The reasons were pointed out by EASL 2017 Clinical Practice Guidelines, as follow: The therapy of switching to PegIFN a from NAs increase cost and side effects, which should be carefully assessed in each individual patient weighing up all potential advantages and disadvantages. The evidence for superiority is lacking, and there are still many unresolved issues with respect to patient selection, timing, as well as the duration of switching strategy, which may be addressed in future studies.</p><p id="Par21">Regarding safety, PegIFN switching was generally well tolerated without unexpected adverse effects. The safety profiles of PegIFN alfa-2a monotherapy were similar to those reported previously in other PegIFN and NAs sequential therapy studies. No unexpected adverse effects were reported.</p><p id="Par22">There were some limitations to this study. First, the number of patients evaluated for treatment efficacy was relatively small. Second, HBV genotype data were not collected due to the low HBV DNA levels at baseline; thus, the impact of genotype on responses could not be ascertained. Previous studies have suggested that HBsAg kinetics and rates of HBeAg seroconversion vary by HBV genotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. Third, the NA drugs used were varied. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether switching to PegIFN from a stable NA regimen leads to high loss of HBsAg in CHB patients with HBsAg&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;2,000&#x02009;IU/ml and HBV DNA&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;20&#x02009;IU/ml.

In the future, large-scale and prospective studies are required to identify the switching strategies for patients receiving different antiviral therapies.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, this study suggested that patients who have low HBsAg levels, despite sustained HBV DNA suppression on long-term therapy with a potent NA, have a higher rate of HBsAg loss and seroconversion and are more likely to experience HBeAg clearance by switching to PegIFN alfa-2b than from continuing NA monotherapy. In particular, the HBsAg decline should be taken into consideration to guide therapy decisions on switching to PegIFN alfa-2b.
