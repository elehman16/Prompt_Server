and muscular topography for elderly females. [Subjects and Methods] Twenty-six females
older than 65&#x02005;years were divided into the dynamic band exercise (DBE; n=13) group and the
Static band exercise (SBE; n=13) group. Each participant performed 12 weeks of elastic
band exercises. Physical abilities were measured by leg extension power, sitting trunk
flexion, closed eyes foot balance, and time to get up. Changes in muscle topography were
evaluated with Moire measurement equipment for the chest, abdomen, and lumbar region. All
results were compared before and after 12 weeks of exercise. [Results] Changes in physical
ability were significantly increased in both groups. The scores for the muscular
topography of the chest, abdomen, lumbar region, and all body parts was significantly
improved in both groups for closed eyes foot balance. There were more improvements in the
DBE group. [Conclusion] Two types of static and dynamic elastic band exercises effectively
changed the physical fitness and muscle topography of elderly females. Therefore, to
increase the effects of exercise, dynamic band exercises are considered useful. Because
band exercises are simple, they can be used to maintain the health of elderly people.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Band exercise</kwd><kwd>Physical ability</kwd><kwd>Muscular topography</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Korea has an aging society (proportion of elderly population accounting for 7%) and is
about to have an aged society (proportion of elderly population accounting for 14%). This
trend of an aging population is increasing the social burden of medical costs for the
elderly in Korea. Furthermore, Korea has a lagging medical system that is focused on
treatment rather than proactive prevention<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Sarcopenia and decreased bone density are furthered in elderly people due to their
increasing age and lack of physical activity. These factors create unstable posture, which
contributes to further declines in balancing ability. Resistance exercises are highly
effective for improving the muscular endurance of the lower limbs and walking function
because they not only improve the muscle strength, which has been weakened due to aging, but
also help to recover the lost sense of balance<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. For elderly people, it is appropriate to exercise intensity and
various angles according to physical strength level during muscular resistance exercise and
elastic band exercise to minimize impact on exercise<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. Furthermore, the elastic band is also very useful because it
improves the strength of the elderly and minimizes the adaptation and injury to the exercise
during muscular resistance exercise<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>.
However, cross-sectional studies have been unable to fully explain the causality of their
results, and their limitation is that the effect of intervention does not last for a long
period due to factors such as the formal approach to exercise.</p><p>Elastic band exercises<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup> are reported to
improve muscle strength and require various energy levels suitable for avoiding boredom and
maximizing effects. This study implemented exercise static band exercise (SBE) and dynamic
band exercise (DBE) for 12 weeks. The results caused changes in physical fitness, walking
ability, or twisted spine or muscles were examined with three-dimensional contour lines to
identify the state of imbalance, discomfort in the upper and lower muscles, degree of
attachment of the curved spine, and muscle disorders. Moire topography<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> was used to identify the subtle degree of twist in the body,
any imbalances and their causes. A sustainable and efficient resistance exercise method was
suggested based on the analysis. Therefore as bands are relatively cheap and safe, the main
purpose of this research was to investigate the differences in band exercise type on the
muscle topography and general physical fitness characteristics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study randomly selected females between 65 and 80&#x02005;years of age who usually do not
exercise and were registered for health management at the Y welfare center located in I
city. A total of twenty-six females were selected and divided into a group of 13 individuals
who were to perform SBE (age: 70.00&#x02005;years; height: 153.85&#x02005;cm; weight: 57.495&#x02005;kg) with
elastic bands and a group of 13 individuals who were to perform DBE (age: 72.92&#x02005;years;
height: 151.61&#x02005;cm; weight: 57.495&#x02005;kg) with elastic bands. Before each of the participants
started in this study they each signed a consent form after a verbal explanation and reading
an explanation form.</p><p>Yellow elastic bands (1.0&#x02005;kg of resistance for 40&#x02005;cm of extension) and red elastic bands
(1.6&#x02005;kg of resistance for 40&#x02005;cm of extension) recommended for the elderly and females by
Hygenic Corporation were used. Yellow elastic bands had low elasticity and were used from
weeks 1 through 4; during that time, the subjects repeated the same movement 10 times. After
adapting to the exercise, the movements were repeated 15 times using the yellow bands during
weeks 5 through 8. The movements were performed 10 times using red elastic bands with
intermediate intensity from weeks 9 through 12. The SBE group performed all exercises with
both the lower body in place, while the DBE group stepped to the music. They had to maintain
heart rate ranging 80&#x02013;100 bpm until week 4 and 90&#x02212;110 bpm after week 5 until week 12. The
SBE group had to perform the following; shoulder press, shrug, front raise, lateral raise,
biceps curl, triceps extension, kick back, bent over row, seated row, chest press, leg
press, squat, good morning, abdominal curl, pelvic lift, and crunch.</p><p>To examine physical fitness, measurements were conducted using Helmas III (NH-3000G,
Korea). Leg extension power (LEP) of both legs, Leg extension power of the left leg (LEPL),
and Leg extension power of the right leg (LEPR) were measured in the sitting position.
Elasticity was measured in the sitting position with the legs straight. Balance was measured
in the single leg stance with eyes closed. Measurements of all items were performed three
times. The average of the three measurements was calculated and input as the measured value.
Measurements were performed before and after the program. To examine muscular topography, a
Moire topography system (Green Moire Technology Co., Republic of Korea, Model: ASKLEPIOS)
was used for three-dimensional profiling. Regarding the conditions of imaging and reading,
the camera and screen were placed within 153&#x02005;cm of the individual, and the camera and light
source were placed within 51&#x02005;cm of the individual. Under these conditions, when there was a
46-mm height gap in the surface of the human body, the Moire patterns were represented by
contour lines. Eight items (horizontality of the pattern of the upper scapula, state of the
scapula, lordosis and kyphosis of the thoracic vertebrae, horizontality of the pattern of
the lower scapula, the number of contour lines of both back areas below the lower scapula,
state of the hip, the number of contour lines of the upper hip, and horizontality of the
pattern of the upper hip) were measured according to the reading reference table for the
musculoskeletal system. Then the manufacturer defined check points were used from the
readying reference table, and the in-depth readying reference table. Scores were given based
on grades, and the highest possible score was 100<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. Averages and standard deviations were calculated using SPSS version
20.0 for statistical tests based on the measurement results, with a significance level of
p&#x0003c;0.05. A two-way repeated ANOVA was conducted to verify differences between the SBE and
DBE groups before and after the 12-week exercise program. This study was designed to improve
the physical fitness of the elderly, and they were fully aware of the purpose of the study
and participated voluntarily.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The results of all test items, leg extension power right, leg extension power left, sitting

training increases the basal metabolic rate of the elderly, improves insulin sensitivity,
and increases neuromuscular functions. Because they are characterized by effects that reduce
various risk factors related to loss of muscle mass, resistance exercise and DBE are
strongly recommended<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. As the aging of the
body continues, body functions and physical fitness decline, including balance, muscle
strength, elasticity, and agility; this decline is the major cause of falls for the
elderly<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Improvements in LEP of the
elderly improve balance and walking ability. In this study, leg left and right extension
power were measured separately and together before and after exercise. The SBE and DBE
groups showed significantly improved results (p&#x0003c;0.05). The balance indicator related to
leg extension power and sitting trunk flexion and the walking ability indicator time to get
up were also significantly improved. Therefore, the study results confirmed that exercise
that improves leg extension power which may be effective to increase balance and walking
ability<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, as one ages,
muscle strength decreases and muscle imbalances occur, negatively affecting posture of the
elderly. Consequently, the functions of the viscera, muscles, and bones decrease, thus
affecting metabolism and blood supply and prompting aging<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition, when muscles are weakened by aging, the volume of the
entire body generally declines and the body becomes smaller. When either side of the muscle
declines in function for any body part, the entire muscle loses balance, which triggers
changes in posture.</p><p>There are musculoskeletal and neurological factors that affect balance control and muscular
topography. These factors are strongly associated with one another in terms of effects.
Therefore, proper exercises using joints, muscle strength, and elasticity are required for
sound human body dynamics<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. This study
attempted to induce changes to enhance muscle strength and elasticity. Analysis of the
effects of exercise on muscular topography showed that each individual body part and the sum
of all body parts, including the chest, abdomen, and lumbar region, demonstrated significant
changes and improvements (p&#x0003c;0.05). Kim et al.<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup> conducted a program involving sling exercises and stretching and
reported that changes were observed in muscular topography of the entire body, including the
chest, lumbar region, and all body parts, through the analysis of changes in body fat mass,
muscle mass, and bone density. Park et al.<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup> reported that continued training, such as qigong exercise or
stretching, can create positive changes in muscular topography. Therefore, enhancement of
muscle strength and elasticity through band exercise is confirmed to be useful for
effectively improving muscular topography. Exercises consisting of very simple movements
cause the elderly to lose interest in the activity. The introduction of active and diverse
changes and exciting movements will engage them in physical activity and encourage continued
participation<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>. It was confirmed that
the band exercises were highly effective for changing the muscular topography by enhancing
muscle strength and elasticity, however, it must be noted that this study did not use a
control group as other previous studies have already shown the effectiveness of elastic band
exercises in comparison with control groups<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup>. As there were no significant differences
between the exercise types, the exercise with the lower intensity should be recommended as
it may be safer for the older female population. In addition, auditory stimulation caused by
music during exercise influences cardiopulmonary capacity. Exercise speed and heart rate
