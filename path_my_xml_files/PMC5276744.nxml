movement and horseback riding therapies on emotion and brain activation in patients with
cerebral palsy. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty-two right-handed patients with cerebral
palsy (18 male, 14 female) whose ages ranged from 8 to 48&#x02005;years participated in this
experiment. Their cerebral palsy levels ranged from 1 to 3. The participants were assigned
to one of three groups according to the experimental conditions: an assisted aquatic
movement therapy group, a horseback riding therapy group, or a control group.
Electroencephalograms, the Feeling Scale and the Felt Arousal Scale were examined as
dependent variables. [Results] Analysis of self-reported data demonstrated a significant
positive improvement in the emotions of participants in the assisted aquatic movement
therapy group in comparison with the control group. With regard to the
electroencephalogram analysis, the results of this study showed increased alpha power in
the assisted aquatic movement therapy group compared with the horseback riding and control
groups. [Conclusion] The results of this study suggest that professionals can consider
assisted aquatic movement therapy as an effective therapeutic intervention for the
improvement of mental health and brain activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Assisted aquatic movement</kwd><kwd>Horseback riding</kwd><kwd>Brain activation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is recognized as a relatively permanent disorder of body movement and
posture as a consequence of brain lesions, primarily arising in early infancy<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>. In general, patients with CP have some or
serious difficulty controlling their body movements. Therefore, assisted movement therapy
has been widely applied in rehabilitation and therapeutic programs for patients with CP.
Notably, assisted movement therapy has been shown to be an effective means to promote muscle
symmetry<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, improve walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>, enhance the mobility of upper
extremities<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>, promote range of movement
in joints, and decrease spasticity in individuals affected with CP<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>. In addition to assisted movement therapy, horseback riding
therapy (HRT) has also been proposed as an effective intervention to boost the health and
well-being of patients with CP<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><sup>)</sup>. Research
has indicated several physical and psychological benefits of HRT including improvement of
gross motor skills<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>, balance and
posture<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>, and muscle symmetry<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>, increased movement economy<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>, and reduction of anger<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>, respectively.</p><p>However, there is a paucity of prospective studies concerning emotional and cognitive
concerns with an emphasis on the psychophysiological approach for therapeutic interventions
in CP. The use of psychophysiological methods is assumed to provide direct evidence of
emotion-related responses that may not be obtained from self-report or questionnaire
measures. To date, no study has demonstrated emotional responses in relation to therapeutic
interventions, including assisted aquatic movements and horseback riding, using a
psychophysiological approach. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the
psychophysiological effects of assisted aquatic movement and horseback riding therapies in
patients with CP. It is expected that alpha power would be higher in groups incorporating
assisted aquatic movement and horseback riding therapies than in a control group.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty-two right-handed patients with CP (18 male, 14 female) whose ages ranged from 8 to

from the Gyongnam CP centers in South Korea. All participants were randomly assigned to one
of three groups according to the experimental conditions: an assisted aquatic movement
therapy group (AATG; n=10), a horseback riding therapy group (HRTG; n=11), or a control
group (CG; n=11). Each group was equivalent in terms of the levels of CP, which were
classified by the gross motor function classification system for cerebral palsy (GMFCS)<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. All participants were given 30 US dollars
as compensation. Two participants were wheelchair users. All participants signed informed
consent forms prior to the experiment in accordance with the ethical standard of the
Declaration of Helsinki.</p><p>EEG: The instruments to record EEG data included an eight-channel QEEG system (Model:
LXE5208, Poly G-I, Laxtha Inc., South Korea), an elastic cap (Electro-Cap International,
Inc., Eaton, OH, USA) designed according to an international 10&#x02013;20 electrode placement
system<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and a Grass resistance meter
(Model: EZM5AB) to control impedance levels.</p><p>Feeling Scale (FS): The FS proposed by Hardy and Rejeski was administered to assess
affective valence at specified times with respect to the AATG and CG<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This scale measures valence in feelings on the two
dimensions of pleasure and displeasure using a single 11 point scale. In this scale, 0 is
considered neutral, 0 to &#x02212;5 represents bad feelings, and 0 to +5 indicates valence towards
good feelings.</p><p>Felt Arousal Scale (FAS): Along with the FS, the FAS suggested by Svebak and Murgatroyd was
administered to determine perceived activation with respect to AAT<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>. This is a single-item scale with 6 points, where 1
represents low arousal and 6 represents high arousal, respectively. Both the FS and FAS are
considered reliable and valid measures of changes in feelings and have been widely used in
affective and mood-related research in exercise settings<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Upon arriving at the testing area, participants were seated comfortably in a chair and
provided with an explanation about the experimental procedure and the administration process
of the FS and FAS. However, the participants were kept unaware about the purpose of the
experiment because knowledge of it could influence the results of the FS and FAS. For the
pretest, participants removed all types of electronic devices and metallic goods and
reported their feelings using the FS and FAS. Next, head circumference was measured, an EEG
cap was wired, electrodes were attached using EEG gel, and the impedance resistance level
was maintained below 5 k&#x003a9; by an expert researcher and two assistants. The reference
electrode was attached to the left earlobe, and the ground was attached to Fpz. The sampling
rate was 256&#x02005;Hz samples/sec. The baseline resting EEG was recorded for 2&#x02005;min with the eyes
open and 2&#x02005;min with the eyes closed from the left (Fp1, F3, C3, and P3) and right hemisphere
(Fp2, F4, C4, and P4) scalp sites before and after AAT. The posttest EEG data were recorded
after applying assisted aquatic movement therapy for 50 minutes. The FS and FAS were
administered before and after and assisted aquatic movement therapy. Similar procedures for
administering the FS, FAS, and EEG measurement were followed for the HRTG and CG as well.
The interval between pretest and posttest measures was also kept at 50 minutes for the HRTG
and CG. The intervention for the AATG consisted of warming up for 10&#x02005;min (i.e.,
dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, lateral bending right and left, lifting the legs toward the
head while floating on the water, pronation, and supination), assisted aquatic movement
therapy for 30&#x02005;min (i.e., floating on the water using buoyancy, floating on the water in a
sitting posture and walking backward and forward, walking right and left backward and
forward, on the pool bottom in the water while wearing a weight suit, putting numbers on a
wall using a buoyancy ring, and playing ball-catching and throwing game with instructor),
and cooling down for 10&#x02005;min (i.e., cooldown with Watsu basic movement exercise, one and two
leg offering, accordion, rotating accordion, near and far leg rotation, over grip rotation,
stillness, and follow movement), while the intervention for the HRTG consisted of a warm-up
(5&#x02005;min), slow increase in speed up (5&#x02005;min), 110 m/min walking (30&#x02005;min), slow decrease in
speed (5&#x02005;min), and cooldown (5&#x02005;min). The control group was asked to watch a movie for 50&#x02005;min
between pre- and posttests. The participants were allowed to terminate the experiment at any
time if they experienced pain or overexertion.</p><p>EEG data were analyzed using the TeleScan (CD-TS-3.1, Laxtha, South Korea) software
program. Electrooculography (EOG) was automatically removed by the TeleScan EOG removal
program. Each epoch was screened to exclude those in which the amplitudes exceeded &#x000b1; 100 &#x000b5;V.
The window was set to 256 (1&#x02005;s duration) with Fast Fourier transform (FFT) overlap of 60%,
and band-pass filters between 0.1&#x02005;Hz and 30&#x02005;Hz were applied to the moving window. The epoch
length was 240 s. The average spectral power density (absolute power) was calculated as the
mean amplitude of spectral lines of the theta (3.5&#x02013;7&#x02005;Hz) and alpha (8&#x02013;13&#x02005;Hz). Eyes open and
eyes closed data were averaged before inclusion in the analysis.</p><p>Analysis of covariance was conducted to measure differences among groups for emotion and
brain activation at each testing point. Age was taken as a covariate. Group (2) &#x000d7;test (2)
ANOVAs with repeated measures on the last factor were conducted for the FS and FAS,
respectively. For all analyses, PASW version 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used,
and the significance level was set at &#x003b1;=0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Analysis of the FAS data revealed significant main effects for group (F(2, 80)=8.28,

patients with CP. This result is in line with a study by Dorval et al.<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup> indicating that physical activities in an aquatic
environment for nine months resulted in significant improvement in emotional development in
individuals with cerebral palsy. In contrast, the present study showed a positive effect of
AAT on emotional states with a 30-min treatment period. Thus it demonstrated that acute
assisted aquatic movement therapy, rather than long-term aquatic therapy, may be sufficient
to improve the emotional state of patients with CP. As an explanation for this finding, it
may be that AAT provides an opportunity for patients with CP to experience an increase in
limb mobility with less pain, which presumably improves their enjoyment and comfort in
exercising. This notion is supported by previous research. For example, Lai et al.<xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><sup>)</sup> offered aquatic therapeutic exercises as a
treatment intervention for children with CP and found that the subjects reported higher
posttest scores on the Physical Activity Enjoyment Scale in comparison with participants in
their control group.</p><p>With regards to the EEG analysis, the results of this study showed an increased alpha power
in the AATG as compared with that in the HRTG and CG. A possible interpretation of this
finding is that alpha power in the AATG increased due to the improved emotions induced by
the aquatic intervention, which enabled patients with CP to perform exercise or movement
(walking and standing without limping or pain) in the water that they cannot do on land.
Thus, AAT may provide patients with CP a comfortable feeling and a positive emotional
boost.</p><p>Our results demonstrated that alpha power in the HRTG was lower than that in the AATG.
Decreased alpha power in the left, central, and right frontal brain areas has been
associated with negative emotional states<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. The condition of CP is characterized by motor dysfunctions and
neurological disorders due to lesions in certain brain areas. Specifically, with respect to
patients with CP, Sajedi et al.<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>
demonstrated decreased resting alpha activity in relation to increased motor dysfunctions.
Thus, it can be assumed that decreased alpha power in the frontal regions in the HRTG could
possibly be an EEG characteristic linked with negative psychological states in subjects with
CP.</p><p>In addition, the lower alpha power in the HRTG relative to the AATG may be the result of
fear of falling during the horseback riding intervention. Patients with CP are particularly
characterized by weak muscles<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>,
decreased bone density, and poor neuromuscular coordination<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>, which contribute to decreased postural balance and body
control<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><sup>)</sup>. Horseback riding relies
heavily on motor skills including coordination and balance and good postural control<xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is likely that participants in the
HRTG experienced difficulty in maintaining their balance while riding horseback, possibly
inducing a fear of falling that further resulted in diverting their attention from enjoyment
of the activity to maintaining their postural balance on the horse&#x02019;s back.</p><p>In conclusion, data from the self-reported and psychophysiological measures provided
evidence that assisted aquatic movement therapy helped to improve emotional feelings and
mood states in patients with CP. These findings suggest that professionals in a therapeutic
setting can consider assisted aquatic therapy as an effective intervention for the
improvement of mental health and increased psychological wellness for these patients.
Indeed, further studies need to explore the chronic effect of assisted aquatic therapy on
emotional well-being, using a psychophysiological approach, while providing different types
of exercises with various intensities and durations in an aquatic environment for
individuals diagnosed with CP. Limitations of this study were that the ages of the subjects
in the three groups were not equivalent and that each AAT and HRT was done only one time in
this study. In this regard, since all the participants in this study were patients, it would
have been difficult to control attendance and maintain the physical and mental conditions of
the patients if the experiment was taken longer. Considering these limitations, this study
focused on examining the effect of acute AAT and HRT. Future investigations should overcome
these limitations by assessing affective responses in relation to the implementation of
assisted aquatic therapy in children, adolescents, and older populations, respectively.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Bax</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Goldstein</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenbaum</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>Executive Committee for the Definition of Cerebral Palsy:
