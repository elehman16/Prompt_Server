The key pathogenetic mechanisms of insulin resistance progression are free fatty acids metabolism impairment and enhanced activity of plasminogen activator inhibitor 1. Both free fatty acids and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 are recognized as risk factors for coronary heart disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 included 65 non-diabetic myocardial infarction patients and group 2 enrolled 60 diabetic myocardial infarction patients. The control group consisted of 30 sex- and age-matched volunteers. The concentration of serum free fatty acids, glucose, C-peptide, and insulin were measured on the 1st and 12th days of the study. All the patients had their postprandial glycemia, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations measured 2 hours after a standard carbohydrate breakfast containing 360 kcal (protein 20 g, carbohydrate 57 g, and fat 9 g).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Free fatty acids levels in group 1 and in group 2 exceeded the control group values by 7-fold and 11-fold, respectively. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 concentration was 2.5-fold higher in group 1 and 4.6-fold higher in group 2 compared to the control group on the 1st day from the myocardial infarction onset. In addition, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 concentration was significantly reduced in both groups on the 12th day from the myocardial infarction onset; however, it did not achieve the control group values.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Increased postprandial glucose level, insulinemia, and elevated levels of free fatty acids and plasminogen activator inhibitor are associated with myocardial infarction-associated progression of insulin resistance.

The presence of basal and postprandial hyperglycemia in MI patients was considered to be an independent risk factor for adverse events according to the results of clinical studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2-dmso-6-293">2</xref> The authors noted a high number of in-hospital complications and high case fatality rate in patients with MI and associated hyperglycemia during a long-term period. According to several studies, postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels are more informative than basal levels, particularly in cases without obvious IR manifestations, and the detected analyte can be used for IR identification.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6-dmso-6-293">6</xref> However, postprandial insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly higher in both case groups compared to healthy subjects, but only slightly differed within the case groups. The presence of IR in patients included in the study was confirmed by the low QUICKI index. The severe IR was reported in the case of combined pathology, and moderate IR degree was reported in cases with diabetes absence.</p><p>Reduced sensitivity to insulin also affects lipid metabolism; initially FFA metabolism. Although we found a statistically significant increase in FFA levels in both groups of patients who suffered from acute MI, the results were more evident in patients with a history of diabetes. FFA concentration remained high in the early recovery period after MI. Resistance to the antilipolytic effect of insulin in adipocytes may be one of the causes for the elevation of FFA concentration in MI patients.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dmso-6-293">9</xref> First, FFA becomes a substrate for triglyceride and atherogenic lipoprotein formation. Second, it prevents insulin binding to hepatocytes, increasing susceptibility to IR. Excessive FFA buildup in the liver leads to their abnormal metabolism. As a result, lipid metabolites (ceramides, diacylglycerides, and triacylglycerides) accumulate in hepatocytes causing the impairment of the insulin signaling pathway and, thus, the glucose transport to the cells and, as a consequence, its increase in blood.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dmso-6-293">9</xref> Altering hepatocytes by IR leads to a decrease in glycogen synthesis, activation of glycogenolysis, and gluconeogenesis enhancing hyperglycemia.</p><p>Metabolic abnormalities in myocardium cells under ischemic conditions are hypothesized to be an alternative mechanism resulting in blood FFA elevation during MI progression. FFAs are traditionally recognized as a main metabolic resource for myocardium. FFA oxidation provides two-thirds of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for the heart. The intensity of FFA transport to the heart cells is determined by their plasma concentration. Under myocardial ischemia conditions, FFA accumulates in blood due to the shift in biological oxidation to anaerobic glycolysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dmso-6-293">9</xref> The inhibition of insulin reception, accompanied by a decrease in the utilization of myocardium energy substrate and by accumulation of FFA in the blood, enhances the IR development, and is considered to be a negative lactacidosis effect. Moreover, the transport of fatty acids or ketone bodies into the heart and diaphragm determines the sharp drop in insulin sensitivity, according to obtained experimental data.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-dmso-6-293">9</xref> Apparently, elevation of blood FFA levels in cases of acute myocardial infarction is associated not with myocardial ischemia alone, but also with the impaired insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, which is a result of an abundance of FFA in circulation. A direct positive correlation between postprandial insulin level and FFA concentration and a negative correlation between the QUICKI index and FFA level verified this hypothesis.</p><p>Regarding classical ideas, coronary artery thrombosis and plaque formation are the causes of MI occurrence. Thrombus formation is regulated by the fibrinolytic system, which prevents luminal occlusion. According to the results of recent studies, the enhanced activity of a key component of the fibrinolysis system, PAI-1, is considered not as a risk factor of atherosclerosis and MI only, but also as an IR marker.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-dmso-6-293">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dmso-6-293">3</xref> Moreover, previous experimental studies demonstrated that proinflammatory factors (interleukin-6 and CRP) could induce PAI-1 production. PAI-1 activity increase is regarded both as a risk factor for coronary atherothrombosis and MI and as a trigger for IR development. Alessi et al investigated hyperinsulinemic obese patients with the genotype associated with increased PAI-1 transcription, confirming a high risk of MI development.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dmso-6-293">3</xref> T2DM obese patients had elevated PAI-1 levels; however, PAI-1 level reduction was detected in this group after the administration of drugs improving insulin sensitivity in tissues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10-dmso-6-293">10</xref> One of the explanations for this phenomenon was obtained in an observational study that suggested the PAI-1 role in the regulation of insulin reception. PAI-1 is able to block insulin signaling in adipocytes; exposure of adipocytes to high insulin concentrations was accompanied by increased PAI-1 expression in these cells.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-dmso-6-293">4</xref> PAI-1 gene-knockout mice demonstrated the increased ability of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake compared to conventional mice.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13-dmso-6-293">13</xref> Our study reported increased PAI-1 concentration in both groups of patients; moreover, T2DM resulted in an increase of PAI-1 in the in-patient period. At the same time, there was a decrease in PAI-1 level in the early rehabilitation period after MI that led to a reduction of PAI-1 inhibiting influence and to normalization of fibrinolytic activity in both groups of patients. However, steadily high PAI-1 levels may indicate the risk of recurrent coronary events in patients with prior MI. Certain case-control studies found that high PAI-1 levels can be used to identify groups at high risk of CHD and T2DM.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-dmso-6-293">3</xref> Therefore, first, an increase in PAI-1 level is associated with thrombophilia in MI patients. Second, PAI-1 level may help diagnose IR since there is negative correlation between PAI-1 level and IR occurrence that was verified by a low QUICKI index.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus, the results of this study show that MI progression is accompanied by insulin resistance development. The increase in FFA and PAI-1 concentrations is more informative regarding impaired sensitivity to insulin in MI as compared to postprandial glucose and insulin levels. High concentrations of FFA in MI patients seem to not only reflect the degree of myocardial ischemia but also to take part in hyperglycemia and IR development involving the sympathoadrenal system. The hyperactivation of the latter due to pain results in a more intensive lipolysis and excess FFA release. PAI-1 being the main regulator of the fibrinolytic system is also involved in the process of impaired insulin-receptor interaction and IR development in MI patients. Measuring metabolic markers of IR can be of high prognostic value for the risk stratification of acute coronary events and the choice of further treatment strategy. High levels of FFA and PAI-1 in MI still present in a stable patient&#x02019;s condition can be a theoretic rationale for the use of IR markers as one of the risk criteria for T2DM and as a solution to the issue of more effective secondary prevention.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this
