HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have been used extensively since 1996. Due to the structural similarities of most PIs, emergence of resistance to one PI often translated into cross-resistance to other PIs. This underscores the need for novel, potent PIs with distinct resistance profiles leading to minimal cross-resistance to other PIs. Tipranavir (TPV) is a potent, highly selective, nonpeptidic HIV PI. TPV plus low-dose ritonavir (TPV/r) [used in combination with other antiretroviral (ARV) drugs] was approved by the US FDA in 2005 for the treatment of HIV infection among treatment-experienced patients with PI-resistant virus.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]</p><p>A study of &#x0003e;100 highly PI-resistant clinical isolates (with a greater than a 10-fold increase in the concentration that produces 50% inhibition [IC<sub>50</sub>] to an average of more than six other PIs) demonstrated that 90% of these isolates remain susceptible to TPV. Only 8% and 2% of the isolates were shown to be moderately resistant and highly resistant, respectively, to TPV.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] These laboratory observations have been confirmed in several clinical trials, including RESIST (Randomized Evaluation of Strategic Intervention in multidrug reSistant patients with Tipranavir),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] Study 1182.51,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and Study 1182.52,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] underlining the important role that TPV/r plays as a potent and efficacious treatment option for treatment-experienced patients.</p><p>Darunavir (DRV) is the newest PI approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, with accelerated approval in 2006 for use in PI-resistant, treatment-experienced adults and in 2008 for use in treatment-na&#x000ef;ve adults.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] DRV is a potent nonpeptidic HIV-1 PI. DRV has been shown to be an efficacious, safe, and well tolerated component of ARV regimens for triple-class (PI, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NNRTI], nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTI]), treatment-experienced patients who switched regimens in the prospective Darunavir Outcomes Study,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and in treatment-experienced patients undergoing early salvage therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] Since multiple mutations in the HIV protease are generally necessary for the virus to demonstrate significant resistance to DRV or TPV, these drugs exhibit a high genetic barrier to the emergence of novel resistant strains.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]</p><p>The POTENT (PrOspecTive EvaluatioN of Tipranavir vs. Darunavir in Treatment Experienced Patients) trial compared the safety and efficacy of TPV/r versus DRV plus low-dose ritonavir (DRV/r) when each was combined with an optimized background regimen (OBR) in triple-class-experienced, HIV-infected patients with resistance to more than one PI. This head-to-head comparison of these two PIs in the same patient population was intended to provide data to help clinicians choose the appropriate ARV therapy for treatment-experienced patients.</p><p>The initial inclusion and exclusion criteria for patient enrollment in POTENT presented a challenge to study enrollment, given the availability of novel therapeutic agents, including raltegravir and maraviroc, at the time POTENT was attempting to recruit patients. Significant efforts to increase enrollment into the trial, including relaxing the enrollment criteria, did not result in improvements in patient recruitment. As a result, the POTENT trial was prematurely terminated. While the number of patients included in the trial and follow-up time are insufficient to draw definitive conclusions, these data provide short-term virologic and immunologic responses when initiating TPV/r or DRV/r combined with a novel agent such as raltegravir in this treatment-experienced patient population. In this brief report, we describe observed safety and efficacy data of the two study treatment arms with a focus on the concomitant use of novel agents as part of the OBR among treatment-experienced patients with multidrug-resistant HIV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p>The research was carried out in compliance with the POTENT protocol, the principles laid down in the Declaration of Helsinki (1996 Version), in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Harmonized Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. Participation in the POTENT trial was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of each center involved in the study. This clinical study enrolled patients at 56 study sites in ten countries. The complete names and addresses of the centers (and their corresponding IRBs) that enrolled patients in the POTENT trial can be found in table SI of the supplemental digital content (SDC), <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://links.adisonline.com">http://links.adisonline.com/DRZ/A4</ext-link>.

Eligible patients were randomized to TPV/r or DRV/r, each combined with an investigator-selected OBR, with a planned follow-up treatment period of 50 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participants</title><p>The inclusion criteria consisted of (i) signed informed consent; (ii) verification of triple-class treatment history with a minimum of 3 months duration for each class; (iii) documented viral resistance to more than one PI; (iv) OBR containing at least two active agents; (v) plasma viral load (VL) &#x02265;500 ;copies/mL; and (vi) baseline laboratory values demonstrating reasonable organ system function. A CD4+ cell count &#x02265;50 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> at screening was initially required, but this criterion was removed by a protocol amendment.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included (i) prior use of TPV or DRV; (ii) virtual phenotypic resistance to TPV or DRV; (iii) female patients who were pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning to become pregnant; (iv) patients with unresolved or unstable AIDS-defining illnesses; (v) active substance abuse; and (vi) use of agents with contraindications listed in the product monographs of TPV, DRV, or ritonavir. Patients who were unresponsive to treatment (VL decrease &#x0003c;1 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL after 12 weeks of treatment) or who at or after week 24 had a VL &#x0003e;400 copies/mL on two consecutive visits (at least 2 weeks apart) were to be removed from the study and initiate alternative ARV therapy in an attempt to establish better control of their HIV disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Description of Procedures or Investigations Undertaken</title><p>The POTENT trial was designed to enroll and treat 800 HIV-1-infected, antiretroviral-na&#x000ef;ve patients who were to be randomly assigned (1 : 1) to one of the following open-label treatments: (i) TPV/r (500/200 mg twice daily); or (ii) DRV/r (600/100 mg twice daily). Both agents were administered in combination with other available ARVs selected by the investigator based on patient history and virtual phenotype screening results. The randomization lists were prepared by Boehringer Ingelheim, Inc., in cooperation with the contractor (Almac Clinical Technologies, Yardley, PA, USA) of the interactive voice response system in an automated fashion using validated randomization software (RS PMX&#x02122; CTM version 3.3.0, Rockwell Automation Solution GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). Patient randomization was stratified based on their background regimens, which were sorted according to their inclusion of zero, one, or two new classes of agents, and the resistance characteristics of the patient&#x02019;s virus to TPV/DRV (sensitive/sensitive, partially sensitive/sensitive, sensitive/partially sensitive, partially sensitive/partially sensitive) at initial screening. Access to the randomization lists was under the control of a central administrator (telephone/computer randomization). Patient enrollment commenced on 20 September 2007, and continued until trial closure on 1 July 2008.</p><p>The primary endpoint of POTENT was time to virologic failure using VL &#x0003c;50 copies/mL to determine virologic response and VL &#x02265;500 copies/mL to define virologic rebound. The key secondary endpoint was treatment response at week 48. Other secondary endpoints included (i) changes from baseline in CD4+ cell count and viral load at each study visit; and (ii) new clinical events indicating AIDS progression or death.</p><p>HIV VL was determined by the COBAS&#x000ae; AmpliPrep/COBAS&#x000ae; TaqMan&#x000ae; HIV tests (Roche Molecular Systems Inc, Branchburg, NJ, USA). The baseline VL was the geometric mean of the last two pretreatment VL determinations. CD4+ cell counts were assayed at the Covance Central Laboratory Service (Princeton, NJ, USA). The baseline CD4+ cell count was the mean of the last two pretreatment measures. Baseline samples for HIV genotyping were assayed in real-time using the virco&#x000ae; VirtualPhenotype&#x02122; method (VIRCO Lab Inc, Titusville, NJ, USA).</p><p>Adverse events (AEs) were monitored throughout the trial, were listed as non-serious or serious in accordance with the pre-established study criteria, and serious AEs were reported to the local Clinical Monitor as soon as the study personnel became aware of them.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>As a result of the early termination of POTENT due to poor patient enrollment, statistical tests were not applied to the observational data that were collected.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Despite efforts to improve enrollment, including amending the protocol to ease the entry criteria, only 40 of the planned 800 patients (5%) were randomized over an 8-month recruitment period.

Of the six patients in the TPV/r group who interrupted treatment, three were for loss of efficacy when they experienced increased viral loads on treatment, following initial drops on treatment.

While data from the trial are insufficient to assess the primary and secondary endpoints in a statistically rigorous manner, they do provide observational data that demonstrated short-term virologic and immunologic benefits in highly treatment-experienced patients initiating either TPV/r or DRV/r in combination with an OBR.</p><p>Patients treated with a TPV/r- or DRV/r-containing regimen experienced similar safety and efficacy outcomes over the limited observation period in this small cohort of triple-class-experienced, HIV-infected patients who had previously not responded to other PIs. However, it should be noted that some of the clinical challenges with TPV treatment include compliance due to higher pill burden, and long-term side effects of this medication, both of which were difficult to measure in this study due to the low patient numbers, and the limited follow-up period.</p><p>The novel integrase inhibitor raltegravir was the most commonly used new agent in constructing a new OBR in the POTENT trial. In a recent subgroup analysis of a 48-week study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] in treatment-experienced patients with drug-resistant HIV, raltegravir was compared with placebo, each arm in combination with an OBR that included TPV. In patients whose HIV was sensitive to TPV by genotypic or phenotypic assays, the combination of raltegravir plus TPV/r in the OBR demonstrated &#x0223c;30&#x02013;33% better response rates (HIV RNA &#x0003c;50 copies/mL at week 48) than patients taking placebo. In the same study, patients who first used DRV in combination with raltegravir demonstrated &#x0223c;22% better response rate at week 48 than the placebo group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] This long-term improvement in virologic control demonstrated the viability of regimens that combine nonpeptidic PIs and novel class agents such as the integrase inhibitors. In another recent study of triple-class-experienced patients,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] raltegravir in combination with OBR was demonstrated to have a robust and sustained antiviral effect through 96 weeks of treatment. Patients experienced mean changes in VL of -1.6 and -1.38 log<sub>10</sub> copies/mL at 48 and 96 weeks, respectively. Additionally, 68% of patients had VLs &#x0003c;400 copies/mL and 55% had &#x0003c;50 copies/mL at 48 weeks. At 96 weeks, 55% and 48% of patients had VLs &#x0003c;400 copies/mL and &#x0003c;50 copies/mL, respectively.</p><p>The observational data from the POTENT trial demonstrated virologic and immunologic outcomes that indicate successful treatment with regimens containing TPV/r plus raltegravir. Both treatment arms (TPV/r and DRV/r) demonstrated good short-term efficacy and safety. The observed changes from baseline in VL were similar in both treatment groups. At week 24, all patients achieved a VL &#x0003c;400 copies/mL, with all but one patient (in the TPV/r arm) achieving a VL &#x0003c;50 copies/mL. In addition, similar increases in CD4+ cell counts were observed in both treatment arms. Finally, the rates of serious AEs were similar between the two arms (0% and 10% for TPV/r and DRV/r, respectively). This information supports current treatment guidelines and re-emphasizes the clinical imperative of selecting active, potent agents when attempting to construct viable regimens in this patient population.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge and thank all the patients, care providers, and investigators who participated in the POTENT study for their commitment to this project.
