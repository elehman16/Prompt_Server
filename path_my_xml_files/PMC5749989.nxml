This study explored whether facial interpretation bias modification (FIBM), a similar paradigm designed to shift emotional interpretation (and/or perception) of faces would transfer to: (i) self-reported symptoms and (ii) a battery of cognitive tasks. In a preregistered, double-blind randomized controlled trial, healthy participants received eight online sessions of FIBM (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;52) or eight sham sessions (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;52). While we replicate that FIBM successfully shifts ambiguous facial expression interpretation in the intervention group, this failed to transfer to the majority of self-report or cognitive measures. There was, however, weak, inconclusive evidence of transfer to a self-report measure of stress, a cognitive measure of anhedonia, and evidence that results were moderated by trait anxiety (whereby transference was greatest in those with higher baseline symptoms). We discuss the need for work in both larger and clinical samples, while urging caution that these FIBM training effects may not transfer to clinically relevant domains.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>facial interpretation</kwd><kwd>cognitive bias modification</kwd><kwd>translational research</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Council Career Development Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/K024280/1</award-id></award-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Medical Research Foundation Equipment Competition Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C0497</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>December, 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Highlights</title><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>&#x02014; Facial interpretation bias modification (FIBM) was studied.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02014; FIBM induced a substantial positive bias, alongside no change in a control group.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02014; FIBM effects did not appear to transfer to the majority of outcome measures.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02014; Inconclusive evidence of transfer to measures of stress response and anhedonia.</p></list-item><list-item><p>&#x02014; This FIBM task may not be an efficacious intervention in affective disorders.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s2"><label>1.</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Although a number of proven psychological and pharmacological treatments for mood disorders are available, worldwide, access to these treatments remains limited. In the UK, for instance, public treatment for depression is plagued by wait lists, high costs or side effects [<xref rid="RSOS170681C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], and treatments indicate response rates of only around 50% [<xref rid="RSOS170681C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Thus, there is a need for effective interventions that are inexpensive, quick and easy to deliver. It is here that cognitive bias modification (CBM) may hold promise. CBM generally consists of a short task that serves to train individuals to shift towards (a positive) or away from (a negative) cognitive processing bias [<xref rid="RSOS170681C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Negative cognitive biases are associated with the tendency to attend to and interpret ambiguous or neutral information in a negative manner. Such biases are thought to be critical to the onset, maintenance and recurrence of anxiety disorders and depression (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS170681C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). A meta-analysis of previous work has also argued for a relationship between negative cognitive biases and past, current and future depressive symptoms [<xref rid="RSOS170681C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The emerging field of CBM posits that through the modification of these biases it may be possible to intervene prior to the onset of depression or prevent the risk of subsequent depressive episodes for individuals in remission [<xref rid="RSOS170681C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>A newly developed CBM task design (described here as FIBM) that targets the interpretation (and/or perception) of emotional facial expressions (happy versus sad) via an online training procedure [<xref rid="RSOS170681C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] represents a promising candidate. The ability to recognize and comprehend emotion in facial expressions is critical for social functioning and is disrupted in depression (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), but is also relevant to the non-depressed population (e.g. interpreting ambiguous facial expressions as negative rather than positive will have a negative impact on one's mood regardless of the presence of an affective disorder; e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]). Although the misinterpretation of facial expressions has been shown in social anxiety [<xref rid="RSOS170681C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], this FIBM task focuses on inducing a positive bias for happy versus sad faces relevant to depression (e.g. compared with happy versus threatening faces, which might be used in a comparable paradigm for anxiety). A number of studies have shown that it is possible to shift cognitive biases (and induce positive changes in mood) in both healthy (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]) and dysphoric individuals (which often goes undiagnosed [<xref rid="RSOS170681C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Indeed, using this FIBM task, Penton-Voak <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] showed increased perception of happiness (versus sadness) in ambiguous facial expressions, which was retained for at least two weeks, as well as some evidence for increased positive affect in healthy adults, and Dalili <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] showed that the task generalizes to non-trained facial stimuli. In theory, a positive bias in the perception of ambiguous emotional expressions should lead an individual towards a more favourable assessment of daily social interactions, and this positive framework (or &#x02018;schemata&#x02019;, [<xref rid="RSOS170681C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]) should ultimately carry over into their mood and other areas of cognition across both healthy and patient populations (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]). However, these more comprehensive &#x02018;transfer&#x02019; effects for reducing depressive symptoms have yet to be extensively studied.</p><p>Previous studies on the therapeutic effects of CBM, which can be used to target attentional (attention bias modification, ABM) or interpretive (interpretation bias modification, IBM) cognitive biases, have been mixed. Clinical studies on depression are limited but have shown ABM to be an effective tool for reducing negative biases and the risk of recurrence in patients with remitted depression [<xref rid="RSOS170681C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and both ABM [<xref rid="RSOS170681C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and IBM [<xref rid="RSOS170681C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] to reduce symptoms in individuals with sub-threshold depression. Following two weeks of ABM, Yang <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] also reported symptom reduction in individuals with moderate&#x02013;severe depression, which was maintained at three- and seven-month follow-up, and Beevers <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] found that both placebo and active CBM lead to similar depression reductions over the course of a one-month period with some evidence of transfer effects to other cognitive processes. However, Everaert <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] found that single-session dot-probe training similar to that used in the clinical studies did not successfully modify attentional biases or transfer to an interpretation bias task. Meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy of both ABM and IBM in depression have also failed to show clear evidence of changes in depressive symptomatology [<xref rid="RSOS170681C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS170681C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], though there is presently a much larger body of work considering ABM. Many of these reviews criticize the current body of CBM research for showing small effects of bias modification, running training over too few sessions (e.g. insufficient training &#x02018;dose&#x02019;), and neglecting to look at transfer effects. Our present study aims to address these shortfalls in assessment of our novel intervention through comprehensive, well-powered tests of transfer effects using a preregistered design that limits analytical flexibility and post hoc hypothesizing.</p><p>We had three specific aims. Firstly, we aimed to replicate findings by Penton-Voak <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] in order to evaluate the efficacy of this FIBM task in inducing a positive cognitive bias. As outlined above, altering negative cognitive biases may be critical in treating affective disorders yet the clinical potential of CBM remains unclear. There is a long literature showing the misinterpretation of faces in depression (as well as other mood and anxiety disorders, e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]), which this FIBM task specifically targets. Moreover, this task is inexpensive, as well as quicker and easier (simple to use by virtue of only requiring a single choice, not dependent on reaction time and can be completed online) than many bias modification alternatives. Given this, we chose to assess this FIBM task in a healthy sample as proof of concept. Studies such as these are imperative for understanding a technique's potential prior to considering it in a clinical population. Secondly, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this FIBM task to improve subjective mood symptoms. Thirdly, we aimed to assess the ability of FIBM to transfer to a battery of cognitive tasks, including a dot-probe task commonly used in CBM studies [<xref rid="RSOS170681C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as well as validated cognitive measures of anhedonia [<xref rid="RSOS170681C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and stress reactivity [<xref rid="RSOS170681C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The latter was adopted because it may be that cognitive biases are most prominent when the individual is under stress (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]). If an intervention claims to have an effect on mood, it should also successfully shift to these other measures, which have also been argued to index mood state [<xref rid="RSOS170681C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS170681C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Our design, hypotheses and statistical analyses were registered online prior to data collection.<sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN1">1</xref></sup> We predicted that the double-blind randomized controlled FIBM would induce a positive bias in the intervention group, whereas there would be no change in a control (sham-FIBM) group. Critically, we also predicted that training effects would generalize across a battery of self-report and cognitive processing outcome measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s3"><label>2.</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><label>2.1.</label><title>Sample screening</title><p>All participants (recruited from the UCL Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience subject database) had normal or corrected-to-normal (glasses/contact lenses) colour vision, English as their first language and the ability to give written informed consent.

Balance points were used to establish the success of the procedure in modifying the perception of ambiguous emotional expressions [<xref rid="RSOS170681C21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The baseline balance point was estimated at the end of the first block using the formula: ([number of faces categorized as happy/45]&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;15), rounded to an integer. This was then used to tailor personal feedback to each participant in the training phase. In the intervention arm, participants were given feedback using a balance point shifted two places from their baseline (e.g. if their baseline balance point was 6, they were trained to 8). In the placebo arm participants were simply trained to reinforce their own balance point (e.g. if their baseline was 6, they were trained to 6). Finally, the test phase (identical to the baseline phase) measured whether training had changed the interpretation of the emotional face stimuli. The baseline and test comprised 45 trials each, where every face in the morph sequence was presented three times and in a random order.

The easy task required fewer key presses with the participant's dominant index finger while the hard task required more key presses with their non-dominant little finger. Participants first completed three &#x02018;hard task&#x02019; calibrations, where they were given 21&#x02009;s to make as many key presses as possible (to fill a bar on the screen).

Threat blocks, during which participants were told they would be at risk of an unpredictable shock (non-contingent on task performance), were counterbalanced with safe blocks, where participants were told they were safe from unpredictable shock.</p></sec><sec id="s3d5"><label>2.4.5.</label><title>Task structure</title><p>Participants were asked to press the space bar as quickly as possible (using their dominant hand) in response to frequent &#x02018;go&#x02019; stimuli (&#x02009;=&#x02009;), and inhibit their response to infrequent &#x02018;no-go&#x02019; stimuli. These stimuli were presented for 250&#x02009;ms with a 1750&#x02009;ms inter-stimulus interval. Eight blocks lasting 104&#x02009;s were presented (alternating between threat and safe). Each block was preceded by a 3&#x02009;s cue which stated either, &#x02018;YOU ARE NOW SAFE FROM SHOCK!&#x02019; or &#x02018;YOU ARE NOW AT RISK OF SHOCK!&#x02019;. In each testing session, participants received a total of three shocks (not including those administered in the work-up); one shock was sent in the first, second and fourth threat blocks.

Bayes factor analysis revealed all models including the group&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;time interaction (barring the DSI (AIR)) to be worse than the model of time; we can, therefore, accept the null hypothesis that FIBM did not have an effect on the BDI, STAI, PANAS, AIEO or DSI (frequency).

However, there was weak evidence in frequentist analyses of the EEfRT data. Simple effects show that this was driven by changes in both groups over time, albeit with weaker evidence for change in the intervention group (control: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,101</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22.76, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; intervention: <italic>F</italic><sub>1,101</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.14, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.045).

Bayes factor analysis revealed the time model as the winning model, however, this was only 2.31 times better than the group&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;time interaction model indicating no definitive evidence in favour of either model.</p><p><italic>Exploratory post hoc analysis:</italic> The effect of baseline trait anxiety and BDI on the omnibus interaction or FIBM across training for the intervention group, and the effect of baseline balance point and the omnibus interaction for the intervention group.</p><p>As participants were recruited from a healthy sample, it was possible that those in the intervention group already had a positive bias and so FIBM could not push them further. In order to see whether the effect of the manipulation was modulated by individual differences in baseline depression or anxiety symptoms, baseline BDI (intervention: <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9.08, s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.73, range&#x02009;=&#x02009;30; control: <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9, s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.99, range&#x02009;=&#x02009;34) and trait anxiety (intervention: <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;49.31, s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.69, range&#x02009;=&#x02009;17; control: <italic>M</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;50.48, s.d.&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.2, range&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) were added as a covariate to omnibus interactions of interest for the FIBM group and then broken down into constituent correlations. There was strong evidence that the effect of the manipulation interacted with trait anxiety for the stress-SART (time&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;threat&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;trait anxiety interaction, <italic>F</italic><sub>1,48</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.322, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009). This was driven by reduced stress-potentiated inhibition following FIBM only in those with higher trait anxiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS170681F3">figure&#x000a0;3</xref><italic>c</italic>, <italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.365, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;52, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008). This suggests that FIBM only reduced cognitive measures of negative affect in those with higher levels of trait anxiety (indeed, it may have had the opposite effect in those with low trait anxiety), providing evidence that these results were moderated by trait anxiety. There was no clear evidence of an interaction between the BDI and any outcome measure (all <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.229).</p><p>In a second post hoc analysis, we explored possible correlations between the first acquired balance point and the manipulation on our effects of interest (calculated as a baseline subtracted from post-training contrast).

In accordance with our first hypothesis, FIBM successfully induced (and replicated) a substantial positive bias in the intervention group, alongside no significant change in the control group. However, counter to our hypotheses, FIBM failed to transfer to the majority of outcome measures. Indeed, Bayesian analyses enabled us to accept the null hypothesis that FIBM had no effect on most measures. Nevertheless, for two measures, one self-report measure of stress impact and one cognitive measure of anhedonia, FIBM showed inconclusive effects that were in the predicted direction.</p><p>FIBM did not influence most self-report measures (BDI, STAI, PANAS, DSI (frequency) or AIEO score) at follow-up. This contrasts with a number of previous findings showing CBM-induced changes in mood using different techniques (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]), though is similar to meta-analytic results considering alternative CBM tasks [<xref rid="RSOS170681C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="RSOS170681C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There was weak evidence of omnibus interaction for the DSI AIR measure, suggesting that post-FIBM daily events were perceived as less stressful. While it should be noted that this effect would not withstand correction for the multiple comparisons used in this paper, the Bayesian analyses, for which multiple comparison correction is less of an issue, do nevertheless provide weak evidence in favour of this effect. There was also some evidence for a correlation between the first acquired FIBM balance points and state anxiety over time, indicating that those in the intervention group with a lower balance point at baseline (i.e. higher negative bias) showed a greater reduction in state anxiety post-training (which was not shown in the sham group). This provides some evidence for the efficacy of the paradigm; however, the difference between the intervention and sham slopes was not significant, so strong inferences should not be drawn.</p><p>The dot probe is a common paradigm in CBM research [<xref rid="RSOS170681C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but transfer effects were not apparent in this study. Moreover, the dot probe showed a significant main effect of time indicating poor reliability over multiple testing sessions (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]). This unreliability might plausibly explain the mixed positive and null FIBM findings using the dot-probe paradigm with repeated measures designs. In future, exploring alternative outcomes for the dot probe which have better reliability than traditional scores may be useful (e.g. calculating trial level bias scores [<xref rid="RSOS170681C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]). In line with well-replicated findings, we found a difference in accuracy while under threat versus safe in the stress-SART, though this did not also differ between groups. The EEfRT has previously shown differences between individuals with anhedonia and healthy controls [<xref rid="RSOS170681C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and although there was a hint towards a similar effect of decreased anhedonia post-FIBM, this was seen alongside changes in both groups over time and evidence for the effect was inconclusive.</p><p>This proof of concept study only considered effects in healthy individuals. Although, as such individuals are clearly amenable to training, and may indeed possess sub-threshold symptoms, we also explored the possibility that results were moderated by symptoms in some individuals. An interaction with baseline trait anxiety was seen in the Stress-SART, indicating that transfer effects were observed in higher anxiety individuals only. The lack of a transfer effect to the Stress-SART may therefore be a result of the healthy sample used in this study. Notably this task was not among those in which a weak effect was observed, although the clear shift in biases on the training task suggests that our whole sample was amenable to FIBM. Future work in clinical populations will help disambiguate this. In fact, a reasonable parallel to the effects observed in this study may be working memory training, which does not transfer well to untrained cognitive operations in healthy samples [<xref rid="RSOS170681C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], but shows promise as a tool for general cognitive improvement in impaired populations (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]).</p><p>Further research is also needed to clarify the tentative self-report stress and cognitive effort effects observed here. One possibility, for example, is that this paper is underpowered to detect transfer effects. We powered the study for 50% of the effect size of the modification effect, and indeed, comprehensively replicated this effect. However, any effect size of <italic>transference</italic> to both cognitive and self-report measures is unknown. Given the complexity of any mechanism by which a computerized training task could shift perception of faces and then influence behaviour, it seems highly plausible that the transference effect size is considerably smaller than 50% of the training effect. As such, future work in a larger sample is warranted. One counter-argument to this is that if the effects are so small that they require large samples to detect then they are likely to be too small to be meaningful. However, at a population level even tiny effects can be meaningful (e.g. small effects in cancer intervention studies which may translate to meaningful impact at the population level [<xref rid="RSOS170681C58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]). Given the large impact and cost of mood disorders on the one hand, and the relatively low cost of providing FIBM training on the other, clarifying whether even small effects exist is probably worthwhile.</p><p>Another explanation for our lack of effects is that while one week was sufficient to induce a change in bias, it may not be long enough to observe corresponding changes in mood. For instance, improvements in mood may only occur as the individual learns how to interact with and respond to the world within the new, more positive cognitive framework [<xref rid="RSOS170681C59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] and this process takes longer than a week. However, counter to this argument is that Munaf&#x000f2; <italic>et al</italic>. (2016, personal communication) showed no effects on some measures of mood at six-week follow-up. Although a substantial FIBM effect was observed, it is possible that training at home (versus in laboratory) may have affected the strength of effects. It may also be that the tasks selected in this study were too far removed from the process of disambiguating facial expressions. We chose these tasks, which have been shown to be disrupted in depression, precisely because they are so different. Specifically, if transfer of effects occurs then it should shift other processes that are sensitive to depression. However, perhaps tasks closer to the underlying process being targeted would be more successful. In fact, it may be that, as face perception is disrupted in social anxiety [<xref rid="RSOS170681C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], we may have seen transfer to measures related to social anxiety as opposed to depression. Another possibility is that FIBM will not transfer to any of the measures because the balance point shift in the intervention group is driven by a generic learning effect. As training was executed by giving participants correct/incorrect feedback, it is possible that participants were simply learning the &#x02018;correct&#x02019; answer rather than actually changing their interpretation. Our observed weak effects in the right direction argue against this possibility, as does prior evidence of transfer to unlearned faces [<xref rid="RSOS170681C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], but it is nevertheless worth considering if these effects fail to replicate. Finally, it should be noted that this FIBM task has been shown to transfer to other tasks measuring facial interpretation [<xref rid="RSOS170681C22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. We did not attempt to replicate this effect here, as we were interested in transfer to other, clinically meaningful tasks. However, in retrospect replication of this effect in this sample would have been a valuable positive control.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study suggest that the clinical potential of this FIBM technique should be approached with caution. Our study contributes to a body of findings that have failed to show clear positive effects of multi-session FIBM on symptoms of mood and anxiety disorders (e.g. [<xref rid="RSOS170681C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="RSOS170681C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Specifically, we add to these findings by largely showing no transfer effects to some measures of common self-reported mood disorder symptoms and a battery of cognitive processing measures, which have previously been associated with anhedonia [<xref rid="RSOS170681C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and stress response [<xref rid="RSOS170681C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Although previous studies have been criticized for their failure to show effects due to a small effect of CBM [<xref rid="RSOS170681C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], this study has shown a lack of transfer effects despite a substantial bias modification in a healthy sample. Unless the weak effects in this paper replicate in larger, clinical samples, we posit that the FIBM task considered may not be an efficacious intervention in affective disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>CBM supplement; Figure 1; Figure 2; Figure 3</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx" xlink:href="rsos170681supp1.docx" orientation="portrait" id="d35e1624" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1"><label>1</label><p>Protocol for the current study: <uri xlink:href="https://osf.io/65a4y/">https://osf.io/65a4y/</uri>.</p></fn><fn id="FN2"><label>2</label><p>A demonstration version of the cognitive bias modification task can be seen at: <uri xlink:href="https://bertmichael.firebaseapp.com/">https://bertmichael.firebaseapp.com/</uri>.</p></fn></fn-group><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was approved by UCL Ethics Committee 1764/001.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Data accessibility</title><p>The data have been deposited in an external repository: <uri xlink:href="https://osf.io/7uzwx/">https://osf.io/7uzwx/</uri> [<xref rid="RSOS170681C60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>S.E.P., I.P.-V., M.R.M. and O.J.R. developed the study concept.
