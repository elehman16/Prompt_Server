Patients included in this study were informed about the procedure in their own language, and a written informed consent was taken from all of them.</p><p>Sixty American Society of Anaesthesiologist-3 patients with rheumatic mitral stenosis with valve area of 0.8&#x02013;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> in the age group of 15&#x02013;45 years, of both genders, scheduled for elective balloon mitral valvotomy were included in the study. Patients with Wilkin's score &#x0003e;10, pregnant and lactating mothers, patients with anticipated difficult airway, patients with a history of bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, liver disease, and renal disease, patients with a history of allergies to drugs, and patients with congestive cardiac failure and hemodynamic instability were excluded from the study.</p><p>A complete preanesthetic examination was done before the procedure.</p><p>In preprocedural assessment patient's vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate were noted. Cardiovascular and respiratory systems were thoroughly examined, and routine and specific investigations were noted. Hemoglobin total white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urine routine, X-ray chest P-A view, echocardiography (ECG), and two-dimensional ECG reports were noted.</p><p>In patients above 35 years of age, additional fasting blood sugar, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine were advised.</p><p>Preprocedural starvation of 6 hours was confirmed.</p><p>Patients received no preoperative medication before coming to catheterization laboratory. Patients were informed to communicate about any discomfort during the procedure. Baseline anxiety score was noted on arrival to the laboratory. This was graded as &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; for none or minimal signs of anxiety such as agitation, sweating, tearing, or verbal expression by the patient. A score of &#x0201c;1&#x0201d; for moderate and &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; for severe anxiety. They were positioned on table and an infusion with intravenous fluid was started. Monitoring included pulse oximeter, ECG, respiratory rate, and PaCO<sub>2</sub> values and oxygen at 6 L/min was supplemented via Hudson's mask. Arterial blood sample was sent before administration of sedation for PaCO<sub>2</sub> value.</p><p>Group 1 patients received intravenous fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg and midazolam 0.02 mg/kg as a loading dose followed by infusion of injection fentanyl 1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and injection midazolam 15 &#x003bc;g/kg/h. Group 2 patients received injection sufentanil 0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg and injection midazolam 0.02 mg/kg as a loading dose followed by infusion of injection sufentanil 0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/h and injection midazolam 15 &#x003bc;g/kg/h.</p><p>The area was prepared and draped, and the area was infiltrated with long-acting local anesthetic agent (bupivacaine) by the cardiologist. Femoral puncture was done 10 min after starting the infusion. Infusion rates were adjusted by increasing or decreasing the rate to maintain an objective sedation score of 2&#x02013;3 according to Ramsay sedation scale. If the level of sedation progressed to a score of more than 4 infusion was tapered till the patient's level of sedation came back to 3. Bolus dose of 1 ml was given if the patient complained pain or discomfort.</p><p>Cardiovascular parameters (heart rate and blood pressure) and respiratory parameters (oxygen saturation and respiratory rate) and sedation score were monitored throughout the procedure. Arterial blood sample was sent for PaCO<sub>2</sub> value during the procedure.</p><p>All complications or undesirable events requiring interventions were watched for. Respiratory variables such as oxygen desaturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%), hypercarbia (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;45 mmHg), respiratory rate (&#x0003c;8/min), airway obstruction, and snoring were watched for. Other events looked for were excessive pain or distress, restlessness or inappropriate movements, excessive sedation, and loss of consciousness by the patient. Furthermore, noted were any &#x0201c;reruns&#x0201d; that were required due to patients&#x02019; inability to lie still during the procedure, especially during transseptal puncture and balloon dilatation. The other major complications noted were the cessation of procedure or the need for induction of general anesthesia. All technical- and procedure-related complications were documented.</p><p>The infusion was stopped at the end of the procedure, and arterial blood sample was again sent for PaCO<sub>2</sub> value.</p><p>At conclusion of the procedure, the cardiologist was asked to give a visual analog score (VAS) on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 will be referred to cases where the procedure had to be abandoned or general anesthesia induced due to inappropriate sedation and 10 referred to cases where the patient was fully cooperative in all respects. One hour after arrival in the recovery room or Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (ICU), the patient was also asked to state a VAS for overall satisfaction with the anesthetic management. The patients&#x02019; satisfaction was assessed by asking the patient about recall of their comfort level, of painful or unpleasant events during the procedure. They were then asked to grade VAS from 0 to 10, 0 being as the worst experience, they have ever had and 10 being a good experience and they would undergo it again if needed.</p><p>Patient's discharge score was assessed at the end of 2 h using modified Aldrete scoring system.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The mean percentage of patient experiencing pain in fentanyl group 12 (4) reported in the previous study.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] We considered 32% decrease in the incidence of pain in sufentanil group to be clinically superior.</p><p>With power of study 80% and type 1 error of 5%, sample size was calculated as 20 in each group and to compensate for the dropouts, a sample size of 30 participants per group was chosen.</p><p>Computer-generated randomization method was used to divide the patients into two groups (<italic>n</italic> = 60).</p><p>The results were analyzed using Student's paired and unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test and Chi-square test.

invasive procedure and does not require general anesthesia. Furthermore, the patient's cardiological condition makes it a high-risk procedure if general anesthesia is to be given. Procedure generally is not painful, but discomfort and pain can occur during insertion of catheters and dilatation of tract, septal puncture, and balloon dilatation. Furthermore, the patient will experience discomfort from lying still on an uncomfortable table. Patient immobility is extremely important, especially during transseptal puncture and balloon dilatation. Hence, sedation with drugs which will alleviate patient's anxiety, fear associated with the procedure and at the same time will maintain patient's hemodynamic condition is required. Conscious sedation provides analgesia, anxiolysis, amnesia, and sedation so as to make the procedure comfortable.</p><p>Fentanyl and sufentanil are short-acting narcotic analgesics. They have a short context-sensitive half-life which is defined as the time required for 50% decrease in drug concentration after stopping infusion. Hence, these drugs can be given by continuous infusion technique. We have chosen to give drugs by continuous infusion as it reduces the total amount of drug used, provides better control over hemodynamic parameters, and ensures rapid recovery.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>In our study, sufentanil was found to be a better analgesic compared to fentanyl as evidenced by the number of bolus doses required, VAS score of patients&#x02019; opinion, and incidence of pain or pain-related movements during the procedure. Phitayakorn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared continuous infusions of fentanyl and sufentanil for outpatient anesthesia and found that intraoperatively administered sufentanil proved to be a better postoperative analgesic than intraoperatively administered fentanyl. Fewer patients in the sufentanil group complained of pain.</p><p>Bailey <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] studied the analgesia with fentanyl and sufentanil and found significant elevation of pain threshold in sufentanil group. Pain threshold returned to control values 180 min after sufentanil but only 90 min after fentanyl.</p><p>The degree of sedation was assessed using Ramsay sedation scale. The quality and control of sedation were found to be similar in both the groups.</p><p>Phitayakorn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] compared continuous sufentanil and fentanyl infusions for outpatient anesthesia (D and C) and found that level of consciousness (sedation) was more or less similar in both the groups.</p><p>Kalenda and Scheijgrond[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] did a comparative study of anesthesia with sufentanil and fentanyl analgesia in undergoing carotid and vertebral angiography and found that patients in sufentanil group were more rapidly awake, lucid than after fentanyl analgesia.</p><p>Kugler <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] studied the hypnotic effect of fentanyl and sufentanil. They found that rapid eye movements during wakefulness and slow eye movements during sleepiness showed no reliable differences between fentanyl and sufentanil.</p><p>Joshi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] compared the analgesic efficacy of fentanyl and sufentanil for chest tube removal after cardiac surgery and found that the sedation scores remained low in both groups, and patients remained alert.</p><p>The major goal of outpatient anesthesia should be to allow the patient to leave the hospital as quickly as possible. This involves not only a return to near normal preoperative mental and motor functioning but also minimization of uncomfortable side effects such as pain.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] This necessitates use the of an anesthetic that will have a short duration of action which will ensure early discharge of the patient. This was done using postanesthesia discharge scoring system developed by Aldrete.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The discharge score was tested 2 h after the procedure.</p><p>In our study, we found that sufentanil had a statistically significant percentage of patients with a higher discharge score than fentanyl. However, even in fentanyl group, discharge score was never &#x0003c;16 which means that quick recovery is possible even in patients who are given fentanyl. Phitayakorn <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] have compared the continuous infusions of fentanyl and sufentanil for outpatient anesthesia. They found significant differences between time to awakening (appropriate response to verbal commands), time to ambulation, and time to discharge home. Time in the main hospital recovery room was shorter in sufentanil group, but the difference was only 9 min which is probably clinically not significant.</p><p>Monk <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] studied the pharmacological properties and therapeutic use sufentanil and found that intravenous sufentanil produces anesthesia equivalent to fentanyl and recovery tends to be more rapid after sufentanil.</p><p>Ethuin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] studied the pharmacokinetics of long-term sufentanil infusion for sedation in ICU patients and found that rapid distribution and elimination process are responsible for rapid reversibility of sedation with sufentanil maintained after long duration infusion.</p><p>In our study, we compared the respiratory effects of two drugs in terms of respiratory rate, partial pressure of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), and arterial oxygen saturation. There was no significant fall in respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation in both the groups. PaCO<sub>2</sub> values in sufentanil group remained higher than the fentanyl group, but it was within normal limits.</p><p>Baily <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] compared the differences in magnitude and duration of respiratory depression with fentanyl and sufentanil, using end-tidal carbon dioxide and ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses to CO<sub>2</sub> rebreathing. Magnitude and duration of respiratory depression occlusion pressure response were significantly less with sufentanil compared to fentanyl. Ventilatory and occlusion pressure responses returned to control values earlier in sufentanil group compared to fentanyl.</p><p>Kuglar[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] compared the hypnotic effect of fentanyl and sufentanil and found that sufentanil acts more powerfully on respiratory regulation compared to fentanyl. Periods of apnea occur more frequently with sufentanil but can be interrupted by external psychophysiological stimulation.</p><p>Ethuin <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in their study found that sufentanil suitable only for intensive-care patients with a short stay in ICU. Respiratory depression during spontaneous breathing is not significant.</p><p>Charlot <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] in their study found that respiratory depression required naloxone for two patients with fentanyl.</p><p>With respect to heart rate, there was no significant difference in both the groups. However, mean arterial pressure showed a significant fall in fentanyl group compared to sufentanil. This suggests better hemodynamic stability with sufentanil.</p><p>Monk <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in their study found that sufentanil maintains hemodynamic stability better than other opioids.</p><p>Charlot <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] studied pharmacokinetic parameters of fentanyl and sufentanil in supratentorial neurosurgery and found that baseline heart rate and arterial blood pressure were lower and more stable with sufentanil than fentanyl.</p><p>Lange <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] compared the cardiovascular responses, speed of anesthetic induction with sufentanil-oxygen and fentanyl-oxygen for coronary artery surgery and found a significant increase in blood pressure during incision, sternotomy, or sternal spread in fentanyl group. Hypertension occurred more frequently in fentanyl group, whereas hypertension never occurred in sufentanil group.</p><p>In our study, we also monitored for the airway complications during the procedure such as oral airway placement, snoring, or any jaw thrust or mass ventilation required. Chest rigidity due to opioids was also watched for.</p><p>To assess the excessive sedative effect of drugs, patient's responsiveness to oral commands; fall in oxygen saturation to &#x0003c;90% was also monitored.</p><p>Other complications such as excessive pain or distress, restlessness or inappropriate movements, any resume that was required due to patients required to lie still, and need for induction of general anesthesia were also noted.</p><p>None of the patients in both the groups had any airway complications or complications due to excessive sedation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we found that sufentanil is better than fentanyl with respect to analgesia and recovery from the effects of sedation. Both the drugs fentanyl and sufentanil are suitable for conscious sedation for balloon mitral valvotomy with respect to sedation and effects on cardiorespiratory drugs. However, sufentanil is an expensive drug; it is not cost-effective for continuous infusion technique.</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tucker</surname><given-names>PA</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferguson</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Harlan</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaos</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Massumi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Balloon mitral valvuloplasty: Clinical experience at the Texas Heart Institute</article-title><source>Tex Heart Inst J</source><year>1992</year><volume>19</volume><fpage>270</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15227453</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="webpage"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Assadi</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lange</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name></person-group><source>Percutaneous balloon mitral valvoplasty</source><date-in-citation>Last accessed on 2014 Sep 14</date-in-citation><comment>Available from: <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.emedicine.medscape.com/article/1839677">http://www.emedicine.medscape.com/article/1839677</uri></comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>American Society of Anaesthesiologist task force on sedation and analgesia by non anaesthesiologists.
