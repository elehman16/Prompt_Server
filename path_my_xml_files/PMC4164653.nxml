Experimental and clinical data document a large interindividual variability in nocebo responses, however, data on psychological, biological or genetic predictors of nocebo responses are lacking. Thus, with an established paradigm of behaviorally conditioned immunosuppressive effects we analyzed possible genetic predictors for nocebo responses. We focused on the genetic polymorphisms in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (<italic>COMT</italic>) gene (Val158Met) and analyzed drug specific and general side effects before and after immunosuppressive medication and subsequent placebo intake in 62 healthy male subjects. Significantly more drug-specific as well as general side effects were reported from homozygous carriers of the Val158 variant during medication as well as placebo treatment compared to the other genotype groups. Val158/Val158 carriers also had significantly higher scores in the somatosensory amplification scale (SSAS) and the BMQ (beliefs about medicine questionnaire). Together these data demonstrate potential genetic and psychological variables predicting nocebo responses after drug and placebo intake, which might be utilized to minimize nocebo effects in clinical trials and medical practice.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by a grant of the German Research Foundation (FOR 1328; SCHE 341/17-1; SCHE 341/17-2; URL: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dfg.de">www.dfg.de</ext-link>).

The development of adverse side effects after placebo intake has been reported for a variety of medical conditions, and patients in the placebo arms of these clinical trials often discontinued pill intake explicitly because of symptoms that were attributed to the medication <xref rid="pone.0107665-Mitsikostas1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107665-Rief2" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Nocebo responses, similar to placebo responses, are mediated through specific and interrelated mechanisms across different medical conditions and physiological systems <xref rid="pone.0107665-PachecoLpez1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Nocebo responses are steered by patient expectations towards possible unwanted side effects of a treatment or medication, which in turn can be induced by an inappropriate doctor-patient communication and/or patients information systems such as drug information leaflets <xref rid="pone.0107665-Rief3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107665-Colloca1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

These nocebo-induced side effects are not only of relevance for clinical trials, but also play a major role in drug discontinuation in clinical practice, thereby negatively affecting treatment efficacy as well as patient adherence and compliance <xref rid="pone.0107665-Enck1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107665-Rief3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107665-Rief4" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107665-Benedetti1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Since experimental and clinical data document a large interindividual variability in nocebo responses, one of the major challenges in this research area is to identify psychological and/or biological predictors for nocebo responses.</p><p>Genetic variation had been identified that might predict placebo responses. The Met allele of a genetic polymorphism (Val158Met) in the catechol-o-methyltransferase gene (<italic>COMT</italic>) was associated with increased placebo responses in patients with irritable bowel syndrome <xref rid="pone.0107665-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Previously, functional polymorphisms in the monoamine oxidase gene (rs6323 G-allele at <italic>MAOA</italic>) and the <italic>COMT</italic> (Met allele at Val158Met) predicted reduced placebo responses in depression <xref rid="pone.0107665-Leuchter1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. However these data were not significant. Moreover, a link between polymorphisms of genes of the serotonergic system, amygdala activity and social anxiety has been reported <xref rid="pone.0107665-Furmark1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. More recently, the major degrading enzyme of endocannabinoids FAAH (fatty acid amide hydrolase) has been found to induce higher placebo analgesia for FAAH Pro129/Pro129 homozygotes <xref rid="pone.0107665-Pecia1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. However, data on genetic variables predicting nocebo responses are lacking. Psychological predictors for nocebo responses such as anticipatory anxiety for the experience of visceral pain <xref rid="pone.0107665-Elsenbruch1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, the trait pessimism for inducing unpleasant feelings after pill intake <xref rid="pone.0107665-Geers1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> and a tendency towards somatization, as well as a higher somatosensory awareness and amplification <xref rid="pone.0107665-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107665-Barsky2" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> have been identified.</p><p>In a model of learned immunosuppressive placebo effects in healthy humans, we were able to identify biological and psychological predictor variables for the learned inhibition in cytokine release <xref rid="pone.0107665-Ober1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Thus, employing this well-established paradigm of behaviorally conditioned immunosuppressive effects, the aim of the present study was to identify possible genetic predictors for nocebo responses. We focused on the <italic>COMT</italic> Val158Met polymorphism (rs4680) since it has been investigated most extensively <xref rid="pone.0107665-Grossman1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The valine (Val) form catabolizes dopamine three to four-times more efficiently than the methionine (Met) form <xref rid="pone.0107665-Lachman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Homozygotes for the Met variant showed a more pronounced placebo response in patients with irritable bowel syndrome compared with individuals of the other genotype <xref rid="pone.0107665-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. A possible association between reported nocebo effects and the <italic>COMT</italic> Val158Met polymorphism has never been investigated before.</p><p>The presented results are part of a study program on behavioral conditioning of immune functions <xref rid="pone.0107665-Albring1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The unique advantage of the conditioning model employed here, is the ability to analyze intra-individual nocebo responses, after intake of an immunosuppressive medication during the acquisition phase of the conditioning procedure as well as after placebo intake during the evocation phase. Psychological, immunological and neuroendocrine parameters were analyzed and drug specific and general side effects were assessed before and after medication or placebo intake respectively and the three <italic>COMT</italic> genotypes were analyzed with respect to their experienced side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by the local ethics committee for human investigations of the University Hospital Essen and follows the rules stated in the Declaration of Helsinki.

Thus, the significantly increased reported specific and general treatment side effects in Val158/Val158 homozygous carriers during drug (<italic>Medication</italic> intake) and &#x0201c;<italic>Placebo</italic>&#x0201d; treatment is not due to distinct physiological responses to the treatments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Clinical and experimental data on psychological, biological or genetic variables predicting placebo responses are rare; data on genetic variables predicting nocebo responses are lacking. With an established model of learned immunosuppression we focused on the catechol-O-methyltransferase (<italic>COMT</italic>) Val158Met polymorphism and analyzed an association of reported drug-specific and general side effects during medication and placebo intake of the <italic>COMT</italic> genotypes. Our results demonstrate significantly more drug-specific as well as general side effects in homozygous Val158 carriers during medication and placebo treatment compared to the other genotypes. These differences in nocebo responses were not due to treatment specific changes in psychological (anxiety) or biological (cardiovascular, immunological) parameters since allele carriers did not differ in these variables. In addition, homozygous Val158/Val158 carriers displayed significantly higher scores in the somatosensory amplification scale (SSAS) and the BMQ (beliefs about medicine questionnaire) compared to the other genotype groups.</p><p>Together these data suggest that <italic>COMT</italic> Val158Met, specifically the Val158/Val158 genotype, is a potential genetic marker for nocebo responders. This is primarily true for the specific model employed here, in which healthy male subjects received a short-term treatment during the <italic>Medication</italic> period with an immunosuppressive drug, the calcineurin inhibitor CsA. Whether and to what extent this is a generalizable phenomenon and transferable to other drugs and/or patient populations needs to be investigated <xref rid="pone.0107665-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0107665-Furmark1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107665-Rakvg1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. However, the Val158/Val158 group reported the most pronounced CsA-specific as well as general side effects analyzed with the GASE scale not only during medication intake. These genotypes also reported twice as many specific side effects after taking fourteen placebo capsules during the &#x0201c;<italic>Placebo</italic>&#x0201d; treatment compared to the intake of the drug CsA. In addition, Val158/Val158 homozygous carriers showed a significantly more pronounced disposition to identify natural occurring somatic and visceral sensations as being very strong, unpleasant and harmful, which was measured with the SSAS. These results seemed to be independent of treatment-specific effects during medication or placebo intake, since homozygous and heterozygous Val158 allele carriers did not differ with respect to their drug levels, cardiovascular or immunological parameters analyzed before and after <italic>Medication</italic> or &#x0201c;<italic>Placebo</italic>&#x0201d; condition. Thus, together with the data showing that the <italic>COMT</italic> polymorphism predicted placebo responses in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and depression <xref rid="pone.0107665-Hall2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107665-Wray1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, these observations militate for a role of <italic>COMT</italic> in nocebo responses also for other physiological systems and diseases. Please note that the Met158 allele was associated with increased placebo responses in patients with irritable bowel syndrome <xref rid="pone.0107665-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. So potentially both <italic>COMT</italic> alleles display opposite sides of the coin pertaining to placebo/nocebo response.</p><p>The reason for the increased sensitivity for treatment specific and general side effects in the Val158/Val158 homozygotes observed in this study is unclear. The non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism at <italic>COMT</italic> (Val158Met; rs4680 <xref rid="pone.0107665-Lotta1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>) leads to a functional consequence. COMT harboring Val158 catabolizes dopamine three to four-times more effectively than the Met158 form <xref rid="pone.0107665-Lachman1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This leads to significantly lower concentrations of prefrontal dopamine in Val158/Val158 carriers compared to the other genotypes. This different availability of prefrontal dopamine seems to affect reward and information seeking behavior <xref rid="pone.0107665-Lancaster1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107665-Doll1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> in general, but also predicted placebo responses in patients with irritable bowel syndrome, with more pronounced placebo responses in patients carrying the Met158 allele homozygously <xref rid="pone.0107665-Hall1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107665-Hall2" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. A possible relationship between a smaller amount of available dopamine in the prefrontal cortex (Val158/Val158 individuals) and a more pronounced nocebo response was also reported in a study with cancer patients, where patients of the Val158/Val158 genotype experienced more pain than the other two genotypes and required higher doses of morphine <xref rid="pone.0107665-Rakvg1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Under experimental conditions however, Met158/Met158 individuals reported a higher sensitivity towards experimental pain <xref rid="pone.0107665-Zubieta1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0107665-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>.</p><p>In order to ensure that higher rates of nocebo effects measured in Val158/Val158 homozygotes are not caused through another factor, we carefully controlled a range of possible interfering variables. These measures revealed that participants did not differ in sociodemographic variables, as well as psychological characteristics, which could have affected an increased experience of side effects, such as trait anxiety and physical characteristics (physical activity, BMI). Additionally, there were no group differences in cardiovascular parameters which could have been indicators of an increased stress reaction to the experimental procedure or medication intake. Moreover, CsA levels in whole blood as well as IL-2 concentrations in culture supernatant, as an indicator of the immunosuppressive effect of CsA, were monitored with no difference between the three genotype groups which could have explained the increased CsA-specific and general side effects.</p><p>The ability to analyze intra-individual nocebo responses after intake of an immunosuppressive medication during the acquisition phase of the conditioning procedure as well as after placebo intake during the evocation phase is certainly a unique advantage of the model employed here. However, there are also a number of limitations within this study. Firstly, our findings are limited due to the small number of volunteers included in the genetic analyses, which only included young and healthy males and have to be thus interpreted with caution. The sample size is not sufficient to detect small sized effects, which may bear the risk of type 2 errors, i.e., the risk to miss existing group differences due to low statistical power. Future studies in larger samples should consider multiple factor statistical models of potentially moderating or even mediating effects of sociodemographic or additional psychological or genetic variables. Secondly, the information material and systematic procedure of analyzing adverse side effects could have let to an increased number of reported side effects, compared to a &#x0201c;free recall&#x0201d; procedure, as the documentation itself is affecting the occurrence of side effects <xref rid="pone.0107665-Rief3" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Subjects in this experiment were regularly informed about common CsA side effects and also received information material, as well as a standard questionnaire for specific and general side effects (GASE). Lastly, further psychological characteristics such as neuroticism, coping style, personality, as well as decision making should be included in future studies, in order to detect their potential effects on the response towards medication.</p><p>In summary, the identification of psychobiological and/or genetic predictor variables in order to minimize nocebo effects is of essential relevance for clinical practice and trials. Future studies have to confirm the reported personality and genetic predictor variables for nocebo responses for different drugs, different physiological systems and end organ functioning. If nocebo responders could be conveniently classified by genetic or psychological predictor variables, these individuals could receive a &#x0201c;personalized treatment&#x0201d;, such as the usage of a &#x0201c;contextualized informed consent&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0107665-Wells1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. The recognition of placebo and nocebo responders will be invaluable for estimating the real drug effects, as placebo responders will contribute to an underestimation of drug effects, whereas nocebo responders will lead to an overestimation of adverse unwanted side effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0107665.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
