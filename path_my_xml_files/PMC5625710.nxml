The treatment regimen is ivermectin (IVM) in combination with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or albendazole (ALB). In Ghana, MDA has been undertaken since 2001. While the disease has been eliminated in many areas, transmission has persisted in some implementation units that had experienced 15 or more rounds of MDA. Thus, new intervention strategies could eliminate residual infection in areas of persistent transmission and speed up the lymphatic filariasis (LF)-elimination process. This study, therefore, seeks to test the hypothesis that biannual treatment of LF-endemic communities will accelerate the interruption of LF in areas of persistent transmission.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">A cluster randomised trial will be implemented in LF-endemic communities in Ghana. The interventions will be yearly or twice-yearly MDA delivered to entire endemic communities. Allocation to study group will be by clusters identified using the prevalence of LF. Clusters will be randomised to one of two groups: receiving either (1) annual treatment with IVM&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALB or (2) annual MDA with IVM&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALB, followed by an additional MDA 6&#x000a0;months later. The primary outcome measure is the prevalence of LF infection, assessed by four cross-sectional surveys. Entomological assessments will also be undertaken to evaluate the transmission intensity of the disease in the study clusters. Costs and cost-effectiveness will be evaluated. Among a random subsample of participants, microfilaria prevalence will be assessed longitudinally. A nested process evaluation, using semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and a stakeholder analysis, will investigate the community acceptability, feasibility and scale-up of each delivery system.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">It is expected that this study will add to the existing evidence on the need for alternative intervention strategies for the elimination of LF in Ghana and in other African countries that are facing similar challenges or are at the beginning of their LF-elimination programmes.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p id="Par4">ClinicalTrials.gov, ID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03036059">NCT03036059</ext-link>.

It affects 120 million people in 73 countries where 1.46 billion people are at risk of acquiring the infection through infectious mosquito bites. In 2000, the World Health Organisation, in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies and endemic country governments, launched the Global Programme to Eliminate LF (GPELF). Ivermectin (IVM) in combination with diethylcarbamazine (DEC) or albendazole (ALB) remain the drugs available for the large-scale control of LF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. These drugs only temporarily clear microfilariae (mf) without killing all adult worms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and it is assumed that a reduction in population mf load will lead to a simultaneous reduction, or even interruption, of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is, therefore estimated, that five to six rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) are required to eliminate the disease. From 2000 to 2014, LF MDA included a cumulative total of 5.62 billion treatments delivered to more than one billion people at least once [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Many countries including Ghana have since undertaken between 8 and 15 consecutive annual rounds of MDA in several implementation units without interrupting transmission. In Ghana, where the MDA coverage rates have been more than the required 65%, 29 sentinel sites with persistent residual infections have been identified, with microfilaria prevalence rates of above 1% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] revealed high prevalence of LF (13% antigen prevalence and 4.6% mf prevalence) in two communities in a district with persistent LF transmission. In these communities, individuals positive for LF were treated and followed at 3-month intervals for 1&#x000a0;year. The results showed a decline in prevalence after treatment, followed by an increase 6&#x000a0;months after treatment (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Number of positives and parasite loads at different time points (Unpublished data &#x02013; de Souza)</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Dec 2014 (pre treatment)</th><th>3&#x000a0;months post treatment</th><th>6&#x000a0;months Post treatment</th><th>9&#x000a0;months Post treatment</th><th>12&#x000a0;months Post treatment</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ICT positives</td><td>48</td><td>17/48 (35.4%)</td><td>26/48 (54.2%)</td><td>23/33 (69.7%)</td><td>15/30 (50%)</td></tr><tr><td>mf positives</td><td>17/48 (35.4%)</td><td>4/48 (8.3%)</td><td>4/48 (8.3%)</td><td>3/33 (9.1%)</td><td>2/30 (6.7%)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

</p><p id="Par36">With the failure to interrupt the transmission of LF in some areas following the recommended years of MDA, alternative and effective MDA regimens and strategies are needed if the GPELF is to achieve the goals of global elimination. Simonsen and colleagues, therefore, recommended treatment to be given at shorter intervals &#x02013; perhaps every 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Further, a study reported that in villages which were hyperendemic for onchocerciasis, after some 14&#x000a0;years of biannual treatment with IVM, no <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti</italic> could be detected, while in adjacent villages a prevalence of around 3% was found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The elimination of onchocerciasis in some countries in the Americas has been attributed to the use of twice-yearly treatment regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Even though there are no studies that explicitly compare the effects of once yearly versus twice-yearly treatment in onchocerciasis control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], this provides some evidence that biannual treatment may be effective in the control of LF in areas with persistent transmission. In Ghana, the onchocerciasis programme undertakes twice-yearly treatment with IVM in onchocerciasis (river blindness) hyper-endemic districts and it is believed that the use of twice-yearly treatment in these onchocerciasis endemic districts may have contributed to the absence of LF in these districts. However, there is the absence of data to ascertain these observations, since onchocerciasis treatment started in 1996, 4&#x000a0;years prior to the mapping of LF prevalence in the country. Other drugs, such as DEC, have also been shown to have marked effects on mf reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. However, research to test alternative treatment regimens (including single, high doses of ALB or biannual treatment schedules) have been recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], and concrete evidence is required to inform policy and the need for alternative strategies.</p><p id="Par37">Reviewing the literature using PubMed, Web of Science, Google and other online journals, revealed that there is a lack of information on the use of the twice-yearly treatment strategy for the control of LF. A number of studies have proposed the need for twice-yearly treatment for the control of LF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. From these studies, it is clear that increasing the MDA frequency is a considerable global research priority. Two randomised control trials in Mali [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] that assessed the dosage and frequency of treatment for LF control have been identified, and have shown the usefulness of increased dosage and frequency of IVM and ALB in suppressing <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> microfilaraemia levels in populations. These, together with the evidence from onchocerciasis studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and anecdotal reports indicate the benefits of the increased treatment frequency. These studies however have limitations in the number of participants randomized and focused on LF control in the general endemic population, compared to the current study in areas with persistent transmission, that face the additional challenge of potential drug resistance by <italic>W. bancrofti</italic>, as a result of the prolonged period of treatment. The impacts of the interventions have also not been assessed in the vectors, especially when different vector species exhibit different transmission processes. This current study will, therefore, assess the impact, feasibility and acceptability of the twice-yearly treatment for the control of LF in both human and vector populations, and will be useful in the implementation of the twice-yearly treatment in countries in Africa that are yet to start MDA or are at the early stages of their implementation programmes.</p><p id="Par38">To advance knowledge for the control of LF in areas with persistent transmission, the trial proposed herein will address the following questions: (1) Can a twice-yearly treatment with IVM and ALB eliminate residual LF infections in areas with persistent transmission? and (2) Can the implementation of the twice-yearly treatment accelerate the interruption of transmission of the disease in these areas? This study will test the hypothesis that biannual treatment of LF-endemic communities will accelerate interruption of LF in areas of persistent transmission in Ghana.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Study aims and objectives</title><p id="Par39">The primary objective of this trial is to interrupt the transmission of LF with a twice-yearly treatment with IVM and ALB. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of the twice-yearly treatment on transmission of parasite in areas of persistent transmission and evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a twice-yearly treatment versus the current yearly treatment based on IVM and ALB. The study will also include process and economic evaluations to assess the feasibility and implementation of the twice-yearly treatment, which will guide scale-up similar interventions in other settings in Africa.

A community cluster randomised trial in different settings in Ghana will evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of twice-yearly and yearly MDA. The primary outcome is the prevalence of LF. This outcome is selected because it is the prevalence of LF that determines the level of on-going transmission (both parasitological and entomological) and the need to implement Transmission Assessment Surveys and stop MDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Allocation to study group will be by villages, identified through programme reports, and by disease-control officers in the study districts.

Individuals will have the opportunity to ask questions for which answers will be provided by the research team.</p><p id="Par54">Consent for the intervention will be provided at the community level with the option for individuals to opt out. Community drug distributors (CDDs) used by the NTDP will number all houses and update their community registers through coordination with the chiefs and village elders. Using a random number generator in Excel, households will be selected until the sample size for each village is attained. Subsequently, households selected for inclusion into the study will be visited by field staff, for consenting and recruitment into the study. In each household visited, written informed consent to conduct the household-level questionnaire will be sought from the household head. Individual-level consent will be sought from selected individuals, 18&#x000a0;years old and above (either for themselves or their children) and written assent sought from children aged 12&#x02013;17 years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Survey procedures</title><p id="Par55">At each house, household heads will be interviewed to collect information on household characteristics and other information during household visits. Data on sex, age, occupation, participation in previous MDAs and duration of residence will be recorded. Information on mosquito nets or other barriers present in the house will also be recorded.</p><p id="Par56">CDDs will update their treatment registers with a full record of all individuals who have received treatment. To augment these data, population-based coverage surveys, using multistage clustering sampling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], will be carried out among a random subsample of communities. In each cross-sectional survey, 100-&#x003bc;l finger-prick blood samples will be collected (from selected individuals) during the day and tested for circulating filarial antigen (CFA) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strips (FTS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Individuals positive for LF antigen will be followed for night-blood collection, for mf detection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To enhance the sensitivity of microfilaria detection, the nucleopore filtration method using 1&#x000a0;ml of blood will be employed. Two-milliliter venous blood samples will be collected in heparinised capillary tubes at night between 9&#x000a0;p.m. and 2&#x000a0;a.m., and used in the nucleopore filtration method. The night collection will be done between these periods because <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> shows nocturnal micofilariae level periodicity, which peaks within 9&#x000a0;p.m. to 2&#x000a0;a.m. Arrangements will be made with the study participants on the timing for the blood collection. Ten percent of all samples will be evaluated for quality control by a supervisor.</p><p id="Par57">IgG4 antibody testing using the Wb123 assay will be used in a subset of study participants (individuals positive for LF antigen and children aged 5&#x02013;10 years), and the results evaluated together with the antigen and microscopy results. The evaluation of the test in individuals positive for LF antigen is done to identify new from existing infection, while the selection of children 5&#x02013;10 years is done to assess the usefulness of the antibody testing for Transmission Assessment Surveys, used for determining the criteria for stopping MDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, while the presence of IgG4 may reflect exposure to infective parasite (antibody responses develop before patent infection and, as such, positive responses may be suggestive of recent filarial exposure), antibodies take a long time (sometimes years) to normalise after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and detection of antibody response in populations that have been treated only shows that these have been exposed at some point. Pilot assessments in a limited population of individuals treated with IVM and ALB pointed to implementation and interpretation challenges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The inclusion of the Wb123 assay in the study thus provides an opportunity to further evaluate its usefulness when undertaking impact/evaluation assessments. As such, the usefulness of this test on the overall outcome will be considered carefully in the data analysis.</p><p id="Par58">In addition, samples will be stored (for up to 10&#x000a0;years) for future studies at the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR), including the detection of potential drug-resistance alleles and genome sequence analysis to investigate the genetic structure of <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> populations. All members of the study teams will be appropriately trained in the study objectives and procedures. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) will be developed, used to guide all field and laboratory activities. Supervisors will make regular visits to the field to monitor the activities.</p><p id="Par59">Future use of the samples for purposes not specified in the Information Document for Participants will have to be approved by the Ethics Committee/Review Boards in Ghana which approved this study.

However, in order to mitigate the high dropout rates during follow-ups, participants will be compensated for the time lost for working during the days they are participating in survey activities, with an amount of 7 Cedis (equivalent to US$1.61). They will also be contacted at 14 days and 7 days prior to follow-up, in order to ensure their availability.

The difference between the study groups is the frequency of treatment provided (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The MDA will be implemented in all communities as part of the ongoing NTDP. In Ghana, MDA started in the year 2000 as part of the GPELF. Treatment with 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg IVM&#x02009;+&#x02009;400&#x000a0;mg ALB is provided annually by trained CDDs. Every year, the national team organises training for regional, district, subdistrict supervisors, CDDs and their supervisors. They are also taken through their roles and responsibilities. The programme targets all eligible individuals aged 5&#x000a0;years and above in all endemic districts and communities. The strategies follow the door-to-door Directly Observed Treatment (DOT) strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. This study will follow the exact MDA strategy used by the NTDP and no modifications other than the frequency of treatment will be made. All treatments will be undertaken through the systems established by the NTDP. Further, the onchocerciasis programme in Ghana undertakes twice-yearly treatment with IVM in hyperendemic areas, and the twice-yearly treatment in LF-endemic areas will be an extension of the onchocerciasis program.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Drug dosage and schedule</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Arms</th><th>Assigned interventions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Control group</td><td>400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg ivermectin&#x02009;+&#x02009;400&#x000a0;mg albendazole tablets given every year for 2&#x000a0;years</td></tr><tr><td>Expanded frequency group</td><td>400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/kg ivermectin&#x02009;+&#x02009;400&#x000a0;mg albendazole tablets given every 6&#x000a0;months for 2&#x000a0;years</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

Ivermectin for the control of elephantiasis and onchocerciasis is donated to national disease elimination programmes for free. At the London Declaration in 2012, the World Health Organisation (WHO) together with pharmaceutical companies and donors committed to: &#x02018;Sustain, expand and extend programmes that ensure the necessary supply of drugs and other interventions to help eradicate Guinea worm disease, and help eliminate by 2020 lymphatic filariasis, leprosy, sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis) and blinding trachoma&#x02019;. As such, the drugs used by the Ghana Neglected Diseases Programme of the Ghana Health Service, are procured through the systems established by the WHO. As such every year, depending on the target population to be treated, the NTDP formally requests the supply of drugs from the WHO. The WHO facilitates the supply of the IVM and ALB for LF-elimination programmes. A joint mechanism and a set of forms have been developed to facilitate the process of application, review and reporting. The request forms are signed by the NTD programme manager to formally endorse the request for the drugs, and submitted to the WHO country office, with electronic copies to PC_JointForms@who.int and the concerned regional focal point, no later than 15 August of the year preceding the year for which medicines are intended to be used (e.g. at the latest by 15 August 2017 for implementation of preventive chemotherapy in 2018) but at least 6&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;8&#x000a0;months before the planned intervention(s) to allow time for reviewing and approval of the request, placing order, drug manufacturing and shipment to the country.

After the RPRG&#x02019;s approval the request is submitted to the WHO Headquarters (WHO HQ) in Geneva which proceeds to order the shipment after satisfying themselves regarding the approved request. The WHO HQ is responsible for the procurement process. The drug company, after receiving the request, ships the consignment from door to door, i.e. from the factory to the Central Medical Stores (CMS) in Ghana. Countries need to provide tax exemptions for the shipment before the drugs are shipped to the country. In Ghana, the WHO office facilitates the tax exemption process and receives the consignment of drugs on behalf of the programme and then hands over the consignment to the program.</p><p id="Par73">Once the country takes over the drugs in the CMS, a distribution list for regional distribution and a request are sent to the Head of the CMS who proceeds to distribute the drugs to the Regional Medical Stores which then distribute the drugs to the districts, then to the subdistricts and then eventually to the CDDs who do the house-to-house distribution of drugs during the MDAs. Below the regional level, disease-control officers take charge of the drugs and their distribution to the next level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Cluster randomisation</title><p id="Par74">Randomisation will be stratified by the prevalence of LF (as determined in the baseline surveys). The randomisation sequence generation will be undertaken by an independent statistician using computerised random-number generation.

With an average household size of six and the frequency of under 5&#x000a0;years being 14.3%, 45 households will be randomly selected in each cluster and five eligible household members recruited into the cross-sectional surveys. Owing to the nature of the interventions, participants will not be blinded to their group randomisation. However, the identity of the study groups will remain hidden until the completion of community sensitisation and randomisation in order to eliminate participation bias. Further, the laboratory technicians conducting the parasitological examinations and the statistician responsible for analysis will be blinded to the group assignment.

For example, if the dice is rolled and the number is 5, then the fifth house will be selected. Upon selection, the household head will be approached, the study explained and consent sought. If a household refuses participation or household members are absent, a different household will be selected as a replacement.

The room will then be sprayed with pyrethrum insecticide (RAID insecticide), commonly found on the Ghanaian market) and left for about 15&#x000a0;min, after which the white sheets will be inspected for any dead or knocked down mosquitoes.

Both the presence and intensity of <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> mf will be assessed at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#x000a0;months post treatment. Information on covariates that influence <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> mf transmission in humans, such as use of bed nets, will be measured at each of these endpoints.</p><sec id="Sec23"><title>Analysis strategy</title><p id="Par103">Each of our study outcomes, i.e. prevalence and intensity of <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> mf, will be considered separately during the analysis. Loss to follow-up was taken into consideration during our sample size calculation. Therefore, regardless of the number of incomplete observations, we expect to end up with no less than 58 complete observations per community at the end of the study.</p><p id="Par104">A panel of individual line plots for the study participants would be used in the assessment of within-person variability. Since the assumptions of likelihood are violated by the effect of within-group and within-subject clusters in longitudinal data, in assessing the transmission dynamics of LF infection, the measured covariates will be regressed separately on both the prevalence and the intensity of infections using a quasi-likelihood method, i.e. generalised estimating equations, which uses an association matrix instead of the diagonal matrix employed by the generalised linear models. As part of the model validation, the point-referenced residuals of the provisional models will be assessed for spatial autocorrelation. The results of this assessment would help to determine if unmeasured/unobserved factors in the study areas play relevant roles in the transmission dynamics of LF infections. Using classical geostatistical concepts, our final model would be adjusted for both the effects of the measured and unobserved factors.</p><p id="Par105">For entomological endpoints, infection rates will be determined, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and LAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] methods. The results will be analysed using the poolscreening software by Katholi and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par106">The findings and data from this study will be used to develop a mechanistic model, which describes the variability in treatment responses in populations. This will be implemented into an already available and well-established transmission dynamic model for LF (LYMFASIM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], which will then be used to systematically explore the consequence of twice-yearly treatment on the long-term impact of MDA and elimination prospects. LYMFASIM simulates the spread of <italic>W. bancrofti</italic> in a human community and the impact of control measures, with the advantage of accounting for a variety of parameters specific to the population of interest and output predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Process evaluation</title><p id="Par107">A key study objective is to understand the process and structures that support the delivery of twice-yearly MDA to guide its scale-up in Ghana and elsewhere in Africa. Therefore, there will be continuous monitoring of all the implementation processes to determine whether the interventions are being implemented appropriately. The monitoring data will also help to determine what needs to change for the intervention to make an impact on the outcome variables to be measured. This would allow for the documentation of all changes that may occur during the implementation process to aid decisions on the scaling up of interventions. The process evaluation will be done using qualitative data collection techniques to generate data to complement the quantitative data to be generated through baseline, midline and end-line surveys as well as provide contextual information to enhance proper interpretations of study results.</p><p id="Par108">Qualitative evaluation will seek to identify and describe key assumptions and conditions underlying the implementation, sustainability and scaling up of the different strategies and delivery systems. The focus of the evaluation will centre on whether CDDs can be utilised for the effective delivery of chemotherapy for control of LF and what factors influence the use of CDDs, including what type of incentives, if any, should be given. Investigation will focus on: (1) community acceptability, which will be assessed using FGDs and in-depth interviews (IDIs) and (2) feasibility, including a situation and stakeholder analysis of the structural, organisational and management factors that enhance or constrain effective implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. A series of FGDs will be conducted with community members, CDDs and local health officials, to better understand the acceptance and implementation of the interventions, using predefined and structured topic guides. IDIs will be carried out with a range of actors and opinion leaders in order to understand the process and constraints of the different delivery systems. The number of IDIs will depend on when theoretical saturation is reached, but they will include members of the district, regional and national health teams.</p><p id="Par109">FGD participants will be randomly selected from adults aged 18&#x000a0;years and above in each community. It is hoped that a maximum of four FGDs will be conducted in each community, made up of two each of male and female groups. In communities, where there are six or more drug distributers, they will constitute a discussion group; or else in-depth interviews will be conducted with them. Also, FGDs will be conducted with local health officials from the health facility nearest to the study communities. Again, where the numbers are less than six; in-depth interviews will be conducted with them individually.</p><p id="Par110">In-depth interviews will be conducted with two staff each from the district, regional and national health directorates. The selected individuals will be those who are involved in the LF control/elimination programme in one way or another. The place where FGDs and IDIs will be conducted will be left to the convenience of the participants, but with no, or very minimum, interruption during the discussion session. In-depth interviews will also be conducted at a place convenient to the respondent; however, the privacy of the respondent will be ensured.</p><p id="Par111">FGDs and interviews will be digitally recorded, with notes additionally taken, transcribed and translated. Transcripts will be imported into MAXQDA (VERBI GmbH), coded by two independent coders, and analysed using content analysis to identify emerging themes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Following descriptive analysis, patterns and linkages among views, experiences and behaviours of participants will be explored. The collected data will provide important contextual information and a basis for evaluating the generalisability of the study findings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Cost analysis</title><p id="Par112">The cost will be estimated as the sum total of expenditures incurred on each treatment arm. An ingredients approach will be used for the collection of cost data, and by consultation of the LF programme accounting system. Standardised frameworks will be used, capturing fixed and recurrent costs incurred at community levels. For the analysis, the cost will include only expenses directly related to the treatment activities. All costs including both cash and in-kind contributions will be used to estimate financial and economic costs of the alternative treatment strategies (annual versus biannual treatment) and delivery systems (through CDDs). Financial costs will reflect the unit cost of the drug distribution and the resources required for its delivery in terms of the actual expenditures incurred. The economic costs will reflect the opportunity cost of all the resources (financial or in-kind contributions) utilised during the intervention. For example, the time spent by health personnel involved in the intervention will represent an economic cost since the personnel are already receiving a salary and may not receive additional income as part of their involvement in the intervention. The financial and economic costs to be assessed will include the direct financial costs, opportunity costs, advocacy, mobilising the community, training of community volunteers and payments made to community volunteers for drug distribution. Other indirect costs, such as expenses made on the surveillance procedures, will not be included in the analysis. It is also important to note that the actual costs of the drugs will not be included in the analysis since these are donated for free to the NTDP. The determination of capital costs will be based on the useful life of equipment including motorbikes, vehicles and other assets. Capital costs will be annuitised using a discount rate of 3% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. The costs will also be classified under provider and society-related costs. The provider costs relate to the costs borne by the public health system in providing the intervention, while the societal costs refer to the wider direct and indirect costs not only to the provider but also to the household in terms of their lost time and income. The cost will be analysed in terms of the overall treatment effectiveness, thus providing information on the cost of the intervention strategy and its effectiveness. The cost will also be analysed based on the volume of treatments distributed, thus enabling the determination of cost functions. The treatment interventions will provide protection against LF for a number of months, and the duration of protection offered will have cost implications as it will determine when the next intervention needs to be delivered. Our preliminary data (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) reveal a rise in mf prevalence 6&#x000a0;months after treatment, and thus providing twice-yearly treatment will provide constant protection to the community. To allow greater comparability between the interventions arms the standardised costs of protecting one person for a full year IVM&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALB will be calculated. An important aspect of the cost analysis in terms of programme implementation will be the scale-up of the biannual treatment in other endemic areas with persistent transmission. As such, itemised costing and sensitivity analysis will be undertaken to enable the estimation of the costs of scaled up implementation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title><p id="Par113">The study (Version 1.2 dated 6 April 2017) was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of the Ghana Health Service (GHS-ERC: 04112/2016).

The LF Control Programme uses community volunteers for education and drug administration. This approach will be intensified. After the study, community durbars will be organised to present the results of the study and educate members on the importance of control activities. Education will be reinforced based on locally generated data. The input of a cultural epidemiologist will be particularly relevant in this case, and one of the study investigators has been involved in developing programs that address social and cultural challenges to diseases control. The outcomes of the study will be communicated in local languages in order for the communities to understand the information being provided. The local media plays a significant role in the dissemination of information, and will be used in engaging the communities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par140">The persistent transmission of LF, following years of treatment, represents an important challenge to the LF-elimination programme in Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and necessitates the need for additional, alternative strategies in order to achieve the elimination goals. In this study, it is assumed that all community members will actively take part in the MDA programme, in order to achieve high therapeutic coverage. While the selection of study participants is entirely voluntary, it is hoped that many non-compliant individuals will enrol in the study and actively participate in MDA programmes. Poor compliance has been reported in one hotspot district in Ghana [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>], and our observations from previous studies in the districts suggest that many infected individuals are generally non-compliant with treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. An important reason given for non-compliance is the lack of information or inadequate information provided prior to the surveys and treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Studies in one hotspot district have also reported low coverage and inaccurate data following MDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. As such, the selection of study subjects will rely on intensive public education activities, informing the study communities on the importance of participating in epidemiological surveys and taking part in MDA. With effective compliance, twice-yearly treatment in high-endemic areas may be considered in reducing the duration of MDA to achieve interruption of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. As such, extensive social mobilisation activities will be undertaken as part of the study.</p><p id="Par141">The hotspot districts having received over 15&#x000a0;years of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the LF prevalence in study communities may be low, and thus this represents a challenge to assessing the impact of the intervention. Given sufficient budgetary allowance, the ideal would have been to screen many communities, out of which the study communities would be selected. However, this is not possible within the funding available for the study, and it is assumed that moderate infection prevalence will be obtained in order to evaluate the impact of the intervention.</p><p id="Par142">At the end of this study, it is expected that firm recommendations of the twice-yearly treatment with IVM&#x02009;+&#x02009;ALB on speeding the elimination of LF as a public health problem and achieving the aims of the GPELF, will be made. The impact of twice-yearly versus yearly community treatment in reducing parasitological and entomological LF transmission indices will be determined, and the cost-effectiveness and community acceptability of twice-yearly treatment in reducing LF transmission will also be determined.</p><sec id="Sec31"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par143">This trial is currently recruiting participants in study communities for parasitological assessments.
