Of 6 cardiovascular studies, 4 implemented cardiovascular risk scores, and 3 reported no impact on physician behaviour outcomes, such as prescribing and referral, or patient outcomes, such as reduction in serum lipid levels. 2 studies examined CPRs in decision-making for patients presenting with chest pain and reduced inappropriate admissions.

The next stage is validation, where the final derived CPR is evaluated first in a similar clinical setting (internal validation), followed by different clinical settings (external validation). If in following these stages predictive accuracy is established, then the final stage of evaluation is to test the impact of using the CPR in clinical practice, ideally in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) for relevant clinical outcomes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>

Implementation has been restricted to a few clinical domains mainly musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and respiratory, and certain CPRs have undergone multiple evaluations, for example, the Ottawa ankle rule. Of 18 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 10 demonstrated an improvement in primary outcome with CPR use when compared to usual care. Approximately half these successful studies focused on changing physician behaviour in ordering imaging for patients presenting with ankle, knee and neck musculoskeletal injuries.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>
<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Four studies with a positive impact on the study's primary outcome successfully implemented post-RCT measures to maintain the impact through both passive (posters) and active strategies (retention of computerised CDSS).<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>

<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Studies that reduced antibiotic prescription rates invested significant time before CPR implementation in assessing acceptability to clinicians, and also integrated the CPR into the clinical work flow through computerised clinical decision support or point-of-care reminders.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> The importance of this type of impact analysis preparation in adequately addressing barriers to implementation, and in integrating the CPR into the clinical workflow has been highlighted.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In this review, 12 studies considered barriers to implementation and/or gauged the acceptability of the CPR to clinicians prior to impact analysis. However, only four studies integrated the CPR into clinical work flow using either computerised CDSS or point-of-care reminders.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>

<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>The perceived seriousness of the target condition may also affect implementation of CPR. For instance, the impact of the Canadian CT head rule was evaluated in the diagnostic pathway of intracranial bleeding following minor head injury.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This CPR has 100% sensitivity, and though implemented by an experienced CPR research group, this CPR did not impact on CT imaging rates.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In a parallel process evaluation, clinicians&#x02019; reported unease with certain components of the rule, and fear of missing a high-stakes diagnosis as reasons for not adopting the CPR.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></p><p>Overall, adherence with CPR use during implementation varied considerably between studies ranging from 57% to 100%. Reasons for non-adherence, established through process evaluation, related to fear of missing the diagnosis, preference for own clinical judgement, and patient request for further investigation or management.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Comparison with existing literature</title><p>Previous CPR reviews relevant to inpatient and paediatric settings reported issues around the variability of methodological quality in conducting CPR studies and a paucity of impact analysis studies.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> The issue of methodological quality has recently been addressed with the publication of two standardised reporting guidelines for CPR derivation and validation studies, and systematic reviews of CPRs.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>
<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> These publications will have an important role to play in standardising CPR research and in promoting robust validation of CPRs which should then be prioritised for evaluation in future impact analysis studies.</p><p>CPRs, which demonstrate improvements in the process of care and/or patient outcomes, should then be considered for inclusion in relevant clinical guidelines to facilitate dissemination into clinical practice. A recent survey which examined the use of CPRs in clinical practice by GPs in the UK reported that GPs most often used cardiovascular, depression, fracture and atrial fibrillation CPRs.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> CPR use was dictated by perceived clinical utility, familiarity and local policy requirements. In a supplementary review of clinical guidelines, very little interguideline consistency was found to guide clinicians in terms of which, if any, of these tools to use in practice.<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> Prioritising the evaluation of a few adequately validated CPRs with proven predictive accuracy in relevant clinical settings would add significantly to this evidence base and facilitate, if appropriate, the inclusion of certain CPRs into future clinical guidelines.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications for clinical practice and research</title><p>CPR research is a relatively new methodological discipline and a challenging area of research.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the conduct of this review, several uncontrolled before&#x02013;after impact analysis studies were retrieved. While these studies have a role in contributing to the overall evidence base, they are not a substitute for carefully conducted RCTs in determining the effectiveness of CPRs on clinically relevant outcomes.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In this review, the majority of included RCTs focused on physician behaviour or process of care as the primary outcome. This is not surprising considering how challenging it is to demonstrate differences in patient outcomes, requiring much larger sample sizes which significantly increase running costs.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> In addition, contextual issues which exist between countries, due to differences in healthcare delivery, healthcare systems and incentives, render process of care outcomes difficult to generalise.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>Certainly, CPR impact needs to be considered early in the development phase of any new CPR. For instance, Irish research shows high levels of GP referrals to symptomatic breast units.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Recent research efforts have focused on the development of a breast cancer CPR for use in primary care to aid these referral decisions.<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> However, although this CPR underwent methodologically robust development and demonstrates good predictive accuracy it is unlikely its use will impact on referral rates. This is due largely to the existence of a low-risk threshold for referral driven by a combination of factors including patient expectation, media interest and fears of medicolegal ramifications for clinicians if a diagnosis is missed. So when considering an impact analysis RCT in this clinical domain, these contextual issues would need to be addressed in tandem with validation and impact analysis studies.</p><p>Certain clinical domains have seen a proliferation of CPR research, particularly musculoskeletal and cardiovascular conditions. The publication of several carefully conducted impact analysis trials for CPRs relating to knee, ankle and neck injuries is largely due to one Canadian research group, while historically, the availability of large UK population data sets facilitated the development of cardiovascular prognostic CPRs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;18</xref>
<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>

However, certain CPRs, such as the Ottawa ankle and knee rules, are appropriate for use in clinical practice, and have a role in reducing unnecessary imaging rates. Future research should focus on conducting RCTs of broadly validated CPRs with consideration of contextual and local implementation factors.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Pertinent issues include how best to integrate the CPR into clinical workflow, and the potential benefits of embedding CPRs as part of computerised clinical decision support.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Study limitations</title><p>Although this review was conducted systematically, and multiple resources searched to retrieve relevant articles, electronic searches were limited to 30 preselected journals, and as a result it is possible that relevant studies were not retrieved. In addition, this search was last updated in December 2013. However, to the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to analyse, in detail, CPR impact analysis studies relevant to primary care. The broad definition of primary care used for this review led to the inclusion of impact analysis studies conducted in the emergency room setting. This was necessary to account for the variation in primary care services and access internationally. Studies that implemented CPRs as part of a broader guideline, protocol or decision aid were excluded. Finally, due to the heterogeneous nature of the included studies, meta-analysis was not possible.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s6"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Impact analysis of CPRs in primary care has, to date, focused on a small number of CPRs in a limited number of clinical domains.
