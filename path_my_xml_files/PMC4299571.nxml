The effectiveness of community mobilisation through women&#x02019;s groups and health facility quality improvement, both aiming to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, was assessed by a cluster randomised controlled trial conducted in rural Malawi in 2008&#x02013;2010. In this paper, we calculate intervention cost-effectiveness and model the affordability of the interventions at scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Bayesian methods are used to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the community and facility interventions on their own (CI, FI), and together (FICI), compared to current practice in rural Malawi. Effects are estimated with Monte Carlo simulation using the combined full probability distributions of intervention effects on stillbirths, neonatal deaths and maternal deaths. Cost data was collected prospectively from a provider perspective using an ingredients approach and disaggregated at the intervention (not cluster or individual) level. Expected Incremental Benefit, Cost-effectiveness Acceptability Curves and Expected Value of Information (EVI) were calculated using a threshold of $780 per disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) averted, the per capita gross domestic product of Malawi in 2013 international $.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The incremental cost-effectiveness of CI, FI, and combined FICI was $79, $281, and $146 per DALY averted respectively, compared to current practice. FI is dominated by CI and FICI. Taking into account uncertainty, both CI and combined FICI are highly likely to be cost effective (probability 98% and 93%, EVI $210,423 and $598,177 respectively). Combined FICI is incrementally cost effective compared to either intervention individually (probability 60%, ICER $292, EIB $9,334,580 compared to CI). Future scenarios also found FICI to be the optimal decision. Scaling-up to the whole of Malawi, CI is of greatest value for money, potentially averting 13.0% of remaining annual DALYs from stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths for the equivalent of 6.8% of current annual expenditure on maternal and neonatal health in Malawi.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Community mobilisation through women&#x02019;s groups is a highly cost-effective and affordable strategy to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality in Malawi. Combining community mobilisation with health facility quality improvement is more effective, more costly, but also highly cost-effective and potentially affordable in this context.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s12962-014-0028-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cost-effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Affordability</kwd><kwd>Community mobilisation</kwd><kwd>Women&#x02019;s groups</kwd><kwd>Quality improvement</kwd><kwd>MaiKhanda</kwd><kwd>Scale-up</kwd><kwd>Future scenarios</kwd><kwd>Malawi</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Maternal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], perinatal and neonatal mortality in Malawi remain high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Community and health facility-based interventions are needed to reduce these deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] in Malawi and other high-burden countries in order to achieve millennium development goals four and five [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The MaiKhanda cluster randomised controlled trial (cRCT) in Malawi showed that combining community mobilisation through women&#x02019;s groups (CI) and health facility-based quality improvement (FI) reduced neonatal mortality by 22% (95% CI: &#x02212;40%, +1%; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.057) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The community intervention on its own reduced perinatal mortality by 16% (95% CI: &#x02212;28%, &#x02212;3%; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.020); no significant effects of FI on its own were observed on neonatal, perinatal or maternal mortality or of CI and FICI combined on maternal mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Given resource constraints in Malawi and other low-income settings where these interventions might be appropriate, policymakers need to know their cost-effectiveness and affordability relative to available alternative interventions. In this article we determine the cost-effectiveness and affordability of the community and facility-based interventions, both on their own (CI, FI), and in combination (FICI), as implemented by MaiKhanda in three central region districts of Malawi between 2007 and 2010.</p><p>We used a similar approach to costing as in other, similar trials with women&#x02019;s groups as one of the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. In evaluating the benefits, we focus on the primary outcomes of the interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], extending the analysis reported in the trial paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] by taking into account all of the cRCT-measured effects on stillbirths, neonatal deaths and maternal deaths, irrespective of statistical significance. We determine the probability that each intervention is cost-effective at a range of Willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold values ($ per DALY averted), including the per capita gross domestic product (GDP) of Malawi, and calculate the Expected Value of Perfect Information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] to determine whether reducing uncertainty in the cRCT effect parameters is worthwhile. We complement our cost-effectiveness analysis with analyses of affordability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] in relation to the number of potential beneficiaries in Malawi and available government and donor budgets for the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>In any cost-effectiveness analysis it is important to consider the alternatives being compared, perspective, time-horizon and discounting, component parts of the measures of the costs and effects of the intervention, and how all of these could vary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Each of these is detailed below, along with details of how uncertainty surrounding measures was assessed. This section finishes with details of the mathematical and statistical analyses undertaken and outcome measures reported. Our reporting conforms to the CHEERS statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study setting</title><p>Malawi is a low-income, predominantly rural country in the rift valley of south-eastern Africa. It had an estimated population of 16.4 million people in 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita was estimated at $779.8 in purchasing-power-parity adjusted international dollars for 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Female literacy was estimated at 67.6% in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and female life expectancy at birth at 54.8 in 2012 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The MaiKhanda trial was located in three central region districts of Malawi: Lilongwe, Kasungu and Salima, and involved the randomisation of health facility catchment populations (clusters) to either, both or none of the interventions, in a two-by-two factorial design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Alternatives compared</title><p>Each intervention is described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Briefly, the community mobilisation intervention (CI) involves participatory women&#x02019;s groups mobilising communities around maternal and neonatal health, using volunteer facilitators supported by programme staff. The groups follow an &#x02018;action cycle&#x02019;, adapted from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], to identify and prioritise maternal and neonatal health problems, decide upon locally appropriate solutions, advocate for, implement and evaluate the solutions. 729 groups were set up, facilitated by 81 volunteers (who received bicycles, monthly bicycle maintenance allowances and supervision from 9 salaried MaiKhanda staff). Each group met monthly for an average of 16 times and strategies adopted included bicycle ambulances, vegetable gardens, health education, village savings and loans, and bednets.</p><p>The health facility quality improvement intervention (FI) involves &#x02018;breakthrough series collaboratives&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A quality improvement team was set up in each health centre in order to share quality improvement ideas within and across facilities and implement them within their facilities in action periods. The intervention included training staff in quality improvement techniques, implementing change packages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] focused on obstetric and newborn care, conducting death reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], leadership training and specific additional protocol-based <italic>in situ</italic> clinical trainings. No new staff were recruited and no additional financial resources were provided to the facilities as part of the intervention evaluated in the trial.</p><p>The interventions were implemented in addition to current Government of Malawi Ministry of Health (MoH) practice in maternal and neonatal health. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the CI, FI and FICI interventions, were therefore calculated relative to &#x02018;current practice&#x02019;, which was assumed to be equal in intervention and control areas.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Perspective</title><p>Cost effectiveness is calculated from the provider perspective. In any future scale-up of the intervention throughout Malawi, this will likely be the MoH. Given that the MoH relies significantly on donor funding, we have taken account of potential future trajectories for donor funding in our assessment of the affordability of the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Costs</title><p>Women&#x02019;s groups are a community intervention for which resource use can only be meaningfully identified at the community level. Therefore economic costing guidelines, which have been developed for individual-level variation in resource use, need to be adapted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In our case, both interventions were implemented for each intervention arm as a whole, not cluster-by-cluster, meaning that it was not possible to identify cluster-level variation in resource use.</p><p>The main source of economic cost data were the financial accounts of MaiKhanda, the Malawian non-governmental organisation (NGO) implementing the interventions. Costs were also incurred by overseas implementing partners: the US-based Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) and the UK-based Women and Children First (WCF). Key informant interviews and project documents were used to assist in the conversion of accounting costs to economic costs. We were unable to cost health worker&#x02019;s time, therefore our costing of the FI is not a full economic-costing. For reasons stated in the discussion we believe it still reflects the replicable costs of implementation. Research costs, which were collected via a separate accounting system and therefore easily separable, are excluded for the purposes of this analysis. Project accounts were used to identify staff, material and capital costs directly associated with setting up and implementing the CI and FI interventions. We also identified joint (programme) costs, which could not be directly allocated to either intervention or to the other trial activities (stakeholder engagement, monitoring and evaluation, process evaluation, and research). A proportion of joint costs each year was allocated to the CI and FI interventions using joint cost allocation rules, which were arrived at through discussion with key informants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Capital costs were annualized over the expected lifespan assuming constant linear depreciation.</p><p>Costs were converted to 2013 values using the Malawi consumer price index and to international dollars using the implied 2013 purchasing-power parity conversion factor for GDP (1 INT$&#x02009;=&#x02009;105.8 Malawi Kwacha) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Costs incurred in Pounds Sterling (GBP; &#x000a3;) and United States Dollars (USD, $) were also converted into 2013 international dollars.</p><p>Not all external staff costs were available from accounting systems. Key informants were interviewed to estimate the costs of external experts using either their annual salary when applicable, or using the daily rate (averaged over the study period) of each named expert involved with the trial, the number of stays, and duration of each visit. External costs estimated in this way amounted to 607&#x000a0;days and are reported separately due to the different degree of accuracy compared to staff costs for which programme accounts data was available.</p><p>As intervention costs could not be disaggregated by trial cluster or arm, the cost of the combined FICI arm had to be estimated from the costs of the FI and CI interventions, both implemented across two arms. We assumed conservatively no economies of scope, in the sense that the cost of FI in the FI only arm was equal to the cost of FI in the combined FICI arm; and similarly for CI. In practice, when FICI costs are doubled to pertain to the same size population as FI and CI (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), this is equivalent to assuming that the cost of the combined intervention is the sum of the two. In the trial analysis this is likely to be an accurate reflection of reality, because the CI and FI teams worked across trial arms. Our implementation design did not allow us to investigate possible cost savings that may arise from complementarity when implementing both interventions outside a trial setting.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>

The effects of the CI, FI and FICI interventions on maternal, neonatal and perinatal mortality have been previously reported as odds ratios (OR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The trial did not collect data on individual-level covariates except mortality. In this paper we use cluster-level totals of births, stillbirths, neonatal deaths and maternal deaths, along with cluster-level covariates (district and urban/rural cluster stratification and intervention designation of the clusters (CI, FI, FICI, control) to determine overall effects on stillbirths and neonatal deaths combined (baby mortality), and maternal deaths (mother mortality) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These were modelled in separate logistic regression equations and combined to give an overall measure of effect.</p><p>Due to the two-by-two factorial nature of the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], we first modelled the effects of two-arm CI vs. two-arm &#x02018;no CI&#x02019; and two-arm FI vs. two-arm &#x02018;no FI&#x02019;, and then modelled the effects of one-arm FICI vs. one-arm control. The results of each model were saved in order to compare CI, FI and FICI in one cost-effectiveness analysis.</p><p>We converted the OR of CI, FI and FICI effects on baby and mother mortality obtained from the models to &#x02018;deaths averted&#x02019; using the control area mortality rate and the number of live births, assumed to be 54,000 in each of the four arms. The number of births is an approximation because the population under surveillance was about 10-15% of the total population living in the intervention area.</p><p>The number of deaths averted was then converted to Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted.

Costs were collected over a period of 4.6&#x000a0;years from May 2006 to December 2010. Activities in the two years before the start of the trial period in October 2008, included hiring and training research and implementation staff, developing and piloting the interventions, and introducing the interventions into village communities through the traditional leadership hierarchy. All costs incurred in 2006 were classified as start-up costs. When scaling up the intervention many of the activities conducted during this period, such as intervention design, would not be replicated. As such, only those start-up activities relevant to the intervention implementation, such as the purchase of vehicles and equipment and the hiring and training of staff to run the intervention, are included in the scale-up model. In 2007 50% of costs were classified as start-up because intervention implementation and the trial baseline period began in July 2007. Between July 2007 and December 2010 recruitment and training costs were classified as maintenance costs, with all other intervention-associated costs classified as implementation costs. The economic costs for all start up, maintenance and implementation activities required to replicate the intervention at scale, have been included in this model.</p><p>As recommended by the WHO, we go on to model cost-effectiveness over a 10-year time horizon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Start-up costs from 2006 and 2007 are included in year one costs of the model. Maintenance costs for activities such as the regular recruitment and (re)training that would be required throughout an intervention, were annualised and included for each of years one to ten. Implementation costs for the 2007&#x02013;2010 implementation period were annualised by dividing their total by the length of the trial period &#x02013; the period when the effects were measured (2.25&#x000a0;years), and included for each of years one to ten. The trial period length was used to align costs with effects. Effects were also annualised by assuming the same effect per year as estimated over the 2.25&#x000a0;years of the trial period. Annualisation of costs and effects enables us to model cost-effectiveness over time horizons different to the observed trial period. We then applied the 3% annual discount rate recommended by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], to the total costs for years two to ten. In sensitivity analysis, the time horizon was varied from 5 to 20&#x000a0;years, to reflect short-term and longer-term decision-making time frames, and to explicitly model the effect of intervention duration on the spread of setup and capital expenditure (among other fixed costs). The discount rate on costs was varied between 0% and 10% to reflect a plausible range of scenarios. Future effects (health benefits) were discounted at 2% and varied from 0% to 3% in different sensitivity analyses. It is likely that the discount rate for health benefits would be lower than the discount rate for costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], especially if the ($ per DALY) cost-effectiveness threshold increases in future, in-line with expected per-capita GDP growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

This was done using the following estimates of the available budget for maternal and neonatal health (MNH) in Malawi. In 2010, annual per capita expenditure on health in Malawi was $228.7 in constant 2013 international dollars, and the total population was 15,013,694 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The percentage of total health expenditure spent on maternal and neonatal health was estimated to be 11.95% in 2010 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Multiplying these figures yields an estimate of $410,354,347 for the total expenditure on MNH in Malawi in 2010. This estimate frames the available budget for affordability calculations.</p><p>To estimate the cost of scaling-up each intervention to the whole of Malawi we multiplied the annualised cost by a ratio of the total population of mothers and babies (estimated from the total population and the crude birth rate) to the population of mothers and babies covered in the trial, for that intervention. We then present affordability as a percentage of total annual MNH expenditure. 2010 was used for these analyses due to data availability, especially for estimation of DALYs averted from current practice interventions.

Sensitivity analyses varying the time horizon between 5, 10 and 20&#x000a0;years, the annual cost discount rate between 0%, 3% and 10%, and the annual effects discount rate between 0%, 2% and 3% found, at the $780 per DALY threshold, FICI to have the highest probability of cost-effectiveness in all scenarios (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). This varied from 73.8% probability of cost effectiveness (EIB: $286,587,031; 5&#x000a0;years, 0%, 3%) to 94.9% probability of cost effectiveness (EIB: $1,654,218,349; 20&#x000a0;years, 10%, 0%; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The ICER of FICI compared to CI (the threshold value at which FICI becomes the optimal decision) ranged from $103 to $322 across the 27 scale-up scenarios (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). FI was dominated in all scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This analysis measured and compared the cost-effectiveness of the MaiKhanda interventions, relative to current practice and to one another. We used novel methods to consider the whole of the estimated distributions of the effects of the interventions on maternal mortality, neonatal mortality and stillbirths from the trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We estimate the community intervention to be most cost-effective, with an ICER of $79 per DALY averted compared to current practice alone. This is followed by the combined FICI intervention with an ICER of $146 per DALY averted compared to current practice, and the facility intervention with an ICER of $281. Comparing all three, the community intervention is the optimal decision at WTP thresholds below $292 per DALY averted. Above this, including at the per capita GDP per DALY averted &#x02018;highly cost-effective&#x02019; threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] of $780 the FICI intervention is cost-effective.</p><p>At $56,807,699 per year for the whole of Malawi, FICI is considerably more expensive than CI at $27,729,225. Either amount, at 13.8% and 6.8% of the current MNH budget (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), respectively represents significant expenditure for Malawi. Given the continuing high burden of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity in Malawi and the observed cost-effectiveness of interventions such as CI and FICI an increase in the total MNH budget is clearly required. This could be achieved either via increased government funding following increased economic growth or more efficient tax collection in Malawi, or via expanded donor interest and funding. If additional funds are not forthcoming reallocation of MNH funding away from current activities likely to be less cost-effective than CI or FICI should also be considered.</p><p>Our EVI analyses suggest further research is worthwhile to resolve remaining uncertainties surrounding the CI or FICI decision. At the $780 per DALY WTP threshold, the EVI of $11,708,726 is not significantly different from the cost of the trial at $13,538,490 (note this includes the research costs of $2,597,487). It is clear that the CI (in addition to current practice) is cost effective compared with current practice only. Therefore, unless the WTP threshold is very&#x000a0;low, there is no need to invest in additional research to resolve the remaining uncertainties surrounding this decision. Delays in implementing CI at this stage are more likely to result in benefits&#x000a0;foregone, in particular neonatal deaths and stillbirths. The facilities intervention was dominated by the community intervention and the combined intervention, suggesting money would be better spent first on scaling up the community intervention and then the combined intervention.</p><p>Using natural history counterfactuals, as recommended by WHO for estimating the cost-effectiveness of current interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we estimate the cost-effectiveness of &#x02018;current practice&#x02019; interventions to be roughly $51 per DALY averted (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for assumptions and calculations). This is less than our estimates (looking at the same three mortality outcomes only) of the cost-effectiveness of the community intervention ($79 per DALY) and substantially less than the combined intervention ($146 per DALY) or the facility intervention ($281 per DALY).</p><p>However, the most cost-effective interventions are likely to have already been funded to bring down the mortality rates to their 2010 level, and more intensive and expensive interventions are usually required to reduce mortality rates further. Therefore the community intervention in particular can be said to be comparatively cost-effective and indeed fares well when compared to the interventions currently included in the Essential Health Package (EHP) in Malawi (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and recommended to improve maternal and neonatal health in Africa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Also, assuming, based on the estimated mortality rates in 2010 that there were 2,892,134 DALYs from maternal deaths, neonatal deaths and stillbirths remaining, it can be deduced that the CI, FI and FICI interventions could have prevented 13.0%, 3.8% and 14.5% of these remaining DALYs if scaled-up throughout the whole of Malawi (see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref> for sources and calculations). Compared to the additional 6.8%, 7.1% and 13.8% respective additional expenditures on MNH the CI, FI and FICI interventions could entail (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) this represents a particularly good investment for the CI.</p><p>Whether fiscal space is available to invest in the MaiKhanda interventions depends on competing budget priorities and projections. It will also depend on donor priorities given that 60% of health expenditure in Malawi was donor-funded between 2002&#x02013;2006 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and an estimated 89% in 2013&#x02013;2014 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Our future projections for scale-up to the whole of Malawi indicated that at the $780 per DALY cost-effectiveness threshold FICI is likely to be the optimal decision, and at thresholds lower than $103, CI is likely to be optimal (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p><p>We hope that including analyses of affordability based on recent expenditure on MNH as well as cost-effectiveness with comparison to the EHP will make our study useful for policy makers in Malawi and help them to decide whether investment in and scale-up of the MaiKhanda interventions are worthwhile. To aid decision-makers we have determined cost-effectiveness in relation to a range of $-per-DALY thresholds, with a focus on the per capita GDP of Malawi, recommended by WHO to represent &#x02018;highly cost-effective&#x02019; interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Although there are alternative methods of threshold setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], we believe this threshold to be valid and perhaps more reflective of the current EHP than the more arbitrarily-set threshold of $150-per-DALY (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. We also hope our study will be useful for researchers, particularly because we have been transparent with our data, methods and assumptions to enable replication and use of our results.</p><p>Our study has three important limitations. Firstly, we were not able to capture cluster-level variation in resource use because the interventions were not delivered cluster-wise but taking all randomised clusters as one intervention area. Therefore we were not able to take account of the correlation between costs and effects at the cluster level. We are aware of recent recommendations for cost-effectiveness analysis of cRCTs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] that draw attention to the clustering of costs. However, these recommendations are of limited relevance to us because the recipient of the MaiKhanda interventions was the community or health facility, not the individual mother or child. Identifying individual-level resource use would not be conceptually meaningful (nor possible) in our situation in which many members of the study population never participated in a women&#x02019;s group nor had contact with a health facility.</p><p>Secondly, our cost analysis adopted a limited intervention provider perspective. We did not include related health sector costs, such as the costs of increased care-seeking that may result from a combined &#x02018;pull&#x02019; of the supply side intervention (FI) and &#x02018;push&#x02019; of the demand side intervention (CI). However, the trial found no significant differences in utilisation of health services for childbirth across arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] <sup>supplementary figure</sup>; data on antenatal or postnatal care was not collected. Providing cover for staff attending the Quality Improvement (QI) workshops was not considered. Given chronic staff shortages in Malawi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] it is very unlikely that absent staff would be covered. Importantly, the effect on mortality of staff brought in to cover absent staff would also remain unknown. Neither did we include potential cost savings that may arise in particular in the FI intervention as a result of a reduction in staff attrition. It is possible that the time health workers spent on the quality improvement activities of FI whilst at work in their health facilities could be spent on other, more effective, activities. This is an area for further research and we are not aware of any existing economic evaluations of similar interventions with time use data that explored this question. Donations and volunteer inputs were also not included. However, these were minimal, such as limited drug and equipment donations to a few facilities. The community intervention relied on volunteer women&#x02019;s group facilitators as an integral part of the intervention and defining characteristic of the MaiKhanda trial. Given costs were prospectively collected, the only major source of uncertainty in our cost estimates was the allocation of joint costs to each intervention. Based on the agreement of the donor and the partner organisations implementing each intervention, we chose an equal allocation of joint costs for FI and CI based on the equal &#x02013; proportional to implementing staff number &#x02013; allocation of office space and equal use of administrative staff and joint programme resources. Joint costs were 46% of CI and 53% of FI costs, therefore introducing, say, +/&#x02212; 5 percentage points uncertainty in the allocation rule would result in the total cost estimates for each intervention varying by +/&#x02212;2.3% and +/&#x02212;2.7% respectively. Assuming symmetrical uncertainty and that each intervention would have an equal (proportional to need) joint cost allocation as per the implementing programme partner&#x02019;s agreement, the ICERs for each intervention &#x02013; which as a ratio of the expected value of two uncertain parameters have no uncertainty themselves - would remain unchanged.</p><p>Thirdly, our analysis is likely to present an underestimate of the full effects of the interventions. In particular, estimating the effects on maternal and neonatal morbidity was beyond the scope of this study. Moreover, the community intervention could empower women and other members of the community, and improve a variety of areas of quality of life including those related to physical and psychological health, social relationships and the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The facility intervention could improve staff morale, motivation and empowerment and reduce staff attrition. Both interventions could also improve links between communities and health facilities. Measurement of all of these potential benefits were also beyond the scope of the current study due to its resource constraints, although small sample sub-studies on many of these measures were undertaken [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>We also made a number of assumptions within our analyses. The international travel and salary costs of the external technical experts that contributed to the community and facility interventions have been included as recurring costs throughout the modelled time horizons. From the perspective of the MoH these costs may be determined less necessary if local experts could be used instead at lower cost. However, as per the trial, local experts may not be available, and even if available they might steer the interventions in a different direction, which could result in different effects as well as lower costs. We have also assumed that the costs and effects of each of the interventions increase proportionally with any scale-up of the interventions. Further research is needed on how the costs (and effects) of the interventions may change at scale. For the costs, economies-of-scale are possible via a number of mechanisms including decreases in unit prices when increased quantities of equipment and materials are purchased, and cost-sharing resulting from the MoH or other NGOs sharing activities in any scale-up. However, given that the interventions are mainly reliant on human resources (55% and 49% of the community and facility intervention cost, respectively), such economies-of-scale may not be significant. How the process of scaling-up affects staff deployment should nevertheless be investigated. Variations in prices by region of the country may also be important when estimating scale-up costs. Health effects may not be independent of scale, especially if the population coverage and density of the interventions is not kept at the same level as the cRCT in the scale-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Complex interventions such as the MaiKhanda community and facility interventions are also unlikely to be replicated in exactly the same way. Although processes and function should be standardised to some extent, exact content will depend on local context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], meaning costs and effects of any scale-up are likely to be different to the trial-based estimates we have used.</p><p>As with any cost-effectiveness results our results should be considered along with other health system goals such as equity and acceptability to stakeholders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Information on equity of distribution and acceptability of the interventions to different stakeholders remains unavailable, although an on-going study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] is investigating the equity of the distribution of the effects of the women&#x02019;s group intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] in Malawi. Future research to refine our assumptions and address some of the limitations of our study would be worthwhile. A cost-effectiveness analysis of all women&#x02019;s group trials and potential scale-up as reported in Prost <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] is in progress.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Community mobilisation through women&#x02019;s groups is, according to these analyses, both cost-effective and affordable, compares well with current interventions in Malawi and could avert a large proportion of DALYs caused by stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths considering the proportion of the budget it would require. When combined with facility quality improvement it is highly cost-effective and affordable, and at a per capita GDP threshold the combined intervention warrants scale-up throughout Malawi. Additional research could reduce the remaining uncertainty surrounding this decision and assist decision-makers in similar settings that could also benefit from these interventions.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12962_2014_28_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>
