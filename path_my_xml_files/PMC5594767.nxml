Ethical committee clearance and written consent taken. The patients were randomly divided into two equal groups to the Ropivicaine group (Group R) and to theBupivicaine group (Group B). Parameters observed were onset and duration of sensory and motor block, maximum sensory level achieved degree of motor blockade, two segment regression, and haemodynamic changes.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The development of sensory block was faster with Isobaric Ropivicaine (12.1 &#x000b1; 4.9 minutes) as than isobaric Bupivicaine (13.94 &#x000b1; 4.52 minutes) but the difference was not statistically significant. Onset of Grade III Motor block was longer with Isobaric Ropivicaine (8.51 &#x000b1; 3.39 minutes) as compared to isobaric Bupivicaine (8.51 &#x000b1; 3.39 minutes), but the difference was not statistically significant. Time of Complete Sensory Regression was significantly shorter with Isobaric Ropivicaine (212.69 &#x000b1; 27.31 minutes) with statistical significance. Time to complete motor recovery was significantly shorter in Ropivacaine group (253.38 &#x000b1; 27.13 minutes)as compared to Bupivacaine group (258.55 &#x000b1; 35.81min), with statistical significance.

Increasing trend toward ambulatory surgery is an important part of that. Repair of inguinal hernia is a superficial surgery without much complexity, which can be completed in 60&#x02013;90 min and does not have many intra- and post-operative complications. Hence, it is an ideal procedure for outpatient setting.</p><p>The ideal anesthetic for ambulatory surgery should produce rapid and smooth onset of action, intraoperative analgesia and amnesia, good surgical condition, and short recovery period free of side effects.</p><p>Spinal anesthesia is traditionally popular regional anesthesia technique. It can provide rapid onset, good intraoperative, and immediate postoperative analgesia at minimum cost. Complications of general anesthesia are avoided, and recovery is early with minimal alteration in cognitive psychomotor function which helps in early discharge.</p><p>Low incidence of transient radicular pain with bupivacaine made it the drug of choice for ambulatory spinal anesthesia. However, longer duration of action and potential for cardiotoxicity is the limiting factors to consider bupivacaine as an ideal drug for ambulatory spinal anesthesia.</p><p>Ropivacaine is a new amino amide group of local anesthetic drug. Bupivacaine is a racemic mixture of S and R isomers, whereas ropivacaine is a pure S-enantiomer. S-enantiomer is less cardiotoxic,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] whereas R isomer is more arrhythmogenic. Ropivacaine has consistently demonstrated an improved safety profile over bupivacaine with a reduced central nervous system and cardiotoxic potential, with a wide clinical utility at different doses.</p><p>With this background, we compared the clinical efficacy of isobaric ropivacaine 0.75% (7.5 mg/cc) with of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% (5 mg/cc) intrathecally in elective inguinal hernia repair surgeries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>S<sc>UBJECTS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>After obtaining approval from the Ethical Committee, eighty patients were chosen who were scheduled to undergo elective inguinal hernia surgeries under spinal anesthesia at a tertiary care hospital. The duration of this study was 2 years. Written informed consents were taken. The inclusion criteria were American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status I to III, age 18&#x02013;65 years. Patients were excluded if they had a history of drug allergy, patient refusal, coagulation disorder, patient on anticoagulant therapy, skin infection at the site of block, patients with neurological deficit, or abnormalities of the spine.</p><p>This prospective randomized study was designed to compare 2 ml (15 mg) of 0.75% isobaric ropivacaine with 2 ml (10 mg) of 0.5% isobaric bupivacaine for subarachnoid block with respect to level, duration, and sensory blockade along with hemodynamic stability and side effects.</p><p>A thorough preanesthetic checkup was performed 1 day before surgery. All patients kept nil per oral for 12 h before surgery. The procedure to be performed was explained and informed consent was obtained. In the preoperative room, pulse and blood pressure were recorded. All the patients were premedicated with injection glycopyrrolate 0.008 mg/kg intramuscularly 30 min before surgery. After securing an intravenous line, 500 ml of Ringer's lactate was given as preload. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of forty patients each by a computer-generated randomization chart.</p><p>

</p><p>After the patient was shifted to operation theater, standard monitors such as pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood pressure, and 3-lead electrocardiogram were connected. Injection midazolam 1 mg was given intravenously. Spinal anesthesia was then given under strict aseptic precautions with spinal needle 25 G in sitting position at L<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;L<sub>4</sub> space with the hub of spinal needle facing cephalad. The patient was kept in sitting position for 2 min and then made supine. After noting the time of induction, the sensory and motor effects were checked every 3 min for the first 15 min, then every 5 min up to 30 min. The surgeon was allowed to start surgery when T<sub>10</sub> level was attained. Patient was monitored for pulse, blood pressure every 3 min for the first 15 min, then every 5 min up to 30 min, and then at 10 min interval subsequently.</p><p>Duration from intrathecal injection to attain T<sub>10</sub> level, highest sensory level, two-segment sensory regression, and regression to T<sub>10</sub> dermatome were noted. Motor block onset, highest scale of motor block, and time to complete motor block resolution were noted.</p><p>Sensory block was assessed by pinprick method.</p><p>Motor block was assessed by Bromage scale as follows: Grade 0: none (no motor blockade); Grade 1: partial (just able to move the knees); Grade 2: almost complete (able to move the feet only); and Grade 3: complete (unable to move the lower extremities).</p><p>To judge the quality of anesthesia, patient was assessed for feeling of sensation during the operation and was graded as: no sensation throughout the operation: excellent; sensation on manipulation of sac but no pain: good; mild pain during operation but no need of analgesia: fair; and pain and need of analgesia: poor.</p><p>If the pain was severe enough that the patient did not allow surgery to continue, then rescue analgesia was given with injection ketamine 0.5 mg/kg intravenously. These patients were included in the study. General anesthesia was given to patients not responding to injection ketamine. Data of these patients were taken up to induction of general anesthesia.</p><p>Postoperatively, patients were monitored every 15 min for recession of motor and sensory effects. The times to reach discharge criteria were noted. Discharge criteria were following: no breathing difficulties, stability of hemodynamic parameters, ability to walk, full orientation to time and place, ability to drink without nausea or vomiting, voluntary micturition, and no more than slight pain.</p><p>All patients were watched for side effects such as hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#x0003c;20% of baseline value), bradycardia (pulse rate &#x0003c;50/min), high spinal (&#x0003e;T2), decreased respiratory rate (&#x0003c;8/min), and SpO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;90%.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-3"><title>O<sc>BSERVATION AND</sc> R<sc>ESULTS</sc></title><p>In this prospective randomized study, eighty patients aged 18&#x02013;65 years of ASA Grade I to III undergoing elective inguinal hernia repair were studied after being given spinal anesthesia with either 2 ml of isobaric ropivacaine 0.75% (7.5 mg/cc) and 2 ml of isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% (5 mg/cc) with respect to the efficacy of both drugs, onset and regression of sensory and motor blockade, alteration of hemodynamic parameters, side effects, and time to attain discharge.</p><p>Sample size was determined by power analysis.

The abdominal muscle relaxation was excellent with no disturbing muscle strain in patients of both the groups who underwent lower abdominal surgeries.</p><p>McNamee <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Kallio <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Boztug <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Mantouvalou <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and Singh <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] all found that duration of motor block was significantly shorter in ropivacaine group than bupivacaine group, with statistical significance, which was similar to our findings.</p><p>Although the time to achieve discharge criteria was relatively shorter in Group R, none of the values were statistically significant which was similar to findings of Boztug <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] who compared isobaric ropivacaine 0.5% and isobaric bupivacaine 0.5% for intrathecal anesthesia in outpatient surgeries and found that the first ambulation, first urination, and discharge times were similar between the two groups.</p><p>We did not note any significant differences between the two groups regarding hemodynamic variables, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Danelli <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] noticed no difference in clinical hypotension requiring ephedrine administration in sixty women undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia with either isobaric ropivacaine or isobaric bupivacaine, which further supports our study findings.</p><p>Limitations of our study are that we have not included the drug serum levels at various intervals since our study was based on clinical parameters monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>S<sc>UMMARY AND</sc> C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>We summarize that in patients undergoing elective hernia repair surgeries, on comparing intrathecal isobaric ropivacaine 0.75% with isobaric bupivacaine 0.5%.</p><p>

</p><p>Thus, we conclude that intrathecal administration of isobaric ropivacaine (0.75%) 15 mg provides similar quality of spinal anesthesia but of significantly shorter duration, maintaining similar hemodynamic stability, and discharge criteria without significant adverse effects when compared to isobaric bupivacaine (0.5%) 10 mg. These properties of ropivacaine can be used for day-care surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-10"
