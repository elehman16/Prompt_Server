Anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics are not exempt from adverse effects such as allergies and chronic gastritis, and they are not without cost. The association between low-level laser and auricular acupuncture can be an alternative when conventional drugs are contraindicated. Among its advantages, we can mention the low risk of side effects, low cost and simplicity of application. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of low-level laser at auriculotherapy points in reducing postoperative pain in lower third molar surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>Ninety bilateral, symmetrical lower third molar surgeries will be performed in 45 healthy patients. Each patient will be their own control, through a split-mouth crossover study. One side of the mouth will be randomly chosen and, immediately after surgery, will be treated with low-level laser. After 21 days, the contralateral side will be operated on with low-level laser simulation used postoperatively. This regimen (laser application or not) will be repeated at 24 and 48 h after surgery. All patients will be requested to take analgesics (acetaminophen) if they have pain, i.e. in case of pain. Neither the surgeon nor the patients will know the assigned treatment. The primary variable will be postoperative pain assessed using a Visual Analog Scale, and the secondary variables will be trismus, edema, local temperature, dysphagia, presence of infection and painkiller ingestion. These variables will be assessed at baseline, 24 h, 48 h and 7 days after surgery. Blood samples for systemic inflammatory cytokine (TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8) analysis will be assessed at baseline and 24 h after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Some authors believe that using a wavelength of 633 to 670 nm is a good option for laser therapy in the field of acupuncture. This wavelength can penetrate biological tissue to a depth of about 3 mm. However, for auriculotherapy points, the stimulus (mustard seeds, needles 1 to 2.5 mm) does not penetrate so deeply. For this reason, we chose a laser wavelength of 660 nm (red wavelength).</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=02657174&#x00026;Search=Search">NCT02657174</ext-link>, registered on 11 January 2016.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-016-1540-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Auriculotherapy</kwd><kwd>Laser</kwd><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>Postoperative</kwd><kwd>Third molar surgery</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2016</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Third molar surgery is the most common surgical procedure in dentistry. The postoperative period of third molar surgery is usually accompanied by pain, trismus and swelling, and controlling these symptoms is essential for patient comfort. An inflammatory reaction followed by phlogistic symptoms are common and compromise the quality of life of patients during the first 3 days after surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], and about 63 % of patients feel intense pain during the first day after surgery, with greater intensity 3&#x02013;5 h after the end of anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Among complications after this type of surgery are alveolar osteitis (dry socket) abscess, fever, reactive lymph node pathology and fever, among others already mentioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The need for a comfortable postoperative recovery and a rapid return to daily activities has increased the importance of controlling postoperative inflammation, especially with respect to pain and edema. Currently, control of pain and inflammation is conducted with corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Anti-inflammatory drugs are often prescribed preventatively and in the postoperative period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, some studies have shown adverse reactions to NSAIDs, such as gastrointestinal disorders (erosions, ulcers, dyspepsia) with serious bleeding complications, increased cardiovascular complications, kidney failure and platelet alterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some studies have discussed the value of auriculotherapy with low-level laser, as well as the benefits of biomodulation in the inflammatory process, working mainly on symptoms such as pain and swelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some studies have shown that traditional acupuncture is able to interfere with the regulation of both systemic (e.g., interleukin (IL)-10, IL-4) and pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-1&#x003b2;, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x003b1;)) in some diseases such as asthma and rhinitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In turn, third molar surgery increases the level of interleukins, especially IL-6, after surgical trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This surgical procedure is considered the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; in pain studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] but the behavior of systemic inflammatory markers has not been evaluated after auriculotherapy following third molar extraction.</p><p>Acupuncture is an integral part of a system called Traditional Chinese Medicine. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) it stimulates certain points that are distributed throughout the body&#x02019;s surface using needles, moxibustion, electricity, laser or acupressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. It has been used for many years in several areas of health, but further studies are needed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Auriculotherapy or ear acupuncture is one of the acupuncture modalities. Auricular acupuncture can be defined as a system of diagnosis and treatment based on normalization of dysfunctions in the body by stimulating points located on the ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], or a therapeutic intervention where stimuli to the external ear are used to relieve health problems in various parts of the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Auricular therapy can be understood from two perspectives: ancient auricular acupuncture and modern ear acupuncture. The first is based on the stimulation of acupuncture points in the auricle that are connected to the meridians of the body. It is used primarily for the resolution of pain (Chinese School). The second is Paul Nogier&#x02019;s School, which presupposes a somatotropic organization, representing the whole body in the human ear (European School) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. There are several propositions for the theoretical foundations of auriculotherapy. Among them, we can mention the neurological theory, the embryological theory, microsystems, the energy theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the hormonal basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In 1982, the WHO developed a working group aiming to standardize research and clinical uses of auriculotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. It intended to establish classification criteria, location and therapeutic value of the points. Despite its efforts, there are still many discrepancies between the two schools described above.</p><p>There is only one clinical study to date that evaluates the effect of laser therapy to auricular points for pain reduction in dentistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and there are no randomized controlled clinical trials that validate the effectiveness of auriculotherapy associated with low-level laser to control pain, swelling and postoperative inflammation. In this study, the authors describe a protocol designed to evaluate the application of helium-neon laser or sham to auriculotherapy points after third molar surgery to reduce pain and inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Nove de Julho University (UNINOVE), number #1100869. This study had all necessary consent approved by Nove de Julho University Ethical Committee for any patients who will be involved in the study, including an Informed Consent Form that patients will need to sign to participate. The study is in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients who accept participation will sign the Informed Consent Form after verbal (by HSF) and written explanation of the study. The sample will comprise 45 healthy patients of both genders aged from 18 to 28 years who require surgical removal of bilateral symmetrical lower third molars. Patients will undergo two surgeries with a 21-day interval between them in a split-mouth crossover design. The surgeries will be performed by the same surgeon in the Dental Clinic at Nove de Julho University, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil, from June 2016 until February 2017.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The sample size was calculated (G* Power software version 3.1.9.2) by a <italic>t</italic> test for paired groups, since we have two groups (right side and left side) on the same patient.

To decide the side of intervention, we will randomize into 45 blocks (1:1) of 90 surgeries designed as A or B. This corresponds to 45 blocks, either AB or BA. As the study will be performed in a double-blind manner, neither the patient nor the operator will know which treatment will be applied in each of the two surgeries.

The main rationale for conducting this study is for the reduction of postoperative anti-inflammatory drug and analgesic use because of the frequency of adverse effects associated with their use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Extraction of third molars is considered the best model for assessing acute pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and has been used for a long time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. To avoid bias, the two surgeries (experimental side and control side) should be performed as closely as possible; however, a time interval between surgeries is necessary to avoid distortions in patient&#x02019;s judgement of their pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to have control variables: surgical technique, tooth position and variables inherent to the surgeon. Additionally, the surgical technique should be standardized as much as possible in order to cause comparable surgical trauma. The incision should also be standardized, as should the osteotomy and odontosection.</p><p>Some specific techniques are proposed to evaluate tooth position. The Winter and the Pell and Gregory techniques are the most common. Despite the Winter technique being simpler and more easily reproducible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], it does not consider adequate parameters for the standardization of symmetry between the sides. The Pell and Gregory technique is more complete [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. It evaluates the tooth depth position in the vertical direction (relative to the occlusal plane and in relation to the neck of the adjacent second molar) and the horizontal (as it evaluates the position of the tooth in relation to the ramus of the mandible). In order to classify the position of a tooth, a panoramic radiograph is usually sufficient. Teeth should be as symmetrical as possible. The variables inherent to the surgeon, such as length of professional experience, manual dexterity, and level of training, can be controlled when only a particular surgeon performs all surgeries. Moreover, the split-mouth technique allows the patient to be their own control, thus reducing variation between individuals. In this case, it eliminates factors such as subjectivity of pain, inflammatory response, degree of mouth opening, elasticity of the buccal mucosa, size of the oral rhyme and anatomical variations between the experimental and control groups, because the experimental and placebo treatments are performed on the same person. Also, regarding the similarity of procedures to minimize differences between interventions, the device will remain connected on one side and turned off on the control side, so that neither the patient nor the surgeon will know to which side it is really being applied. This is an important issue because the device emits sound during its operation. Because of this, we asked the company which manufactures the laser to silence the device. For its use, one researcher will apply the laser, and yet another one will measure the variables (pain, trismus, edema, local temperature, dysphagia and presence of infection by means of systemic temperature measurement and assessing the degree of lymphadenopathy).</p><p>A red diode laser with a wavelength of 660 nm (&#x000b1;10 nm) will be used. It has been proved that a wavelength of 650 to 950 nm can penetrate biological tissue to a depth of 3 mm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. However, some authors believe that a wavelength of 633 to 670 nm is the best option for laser therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. For acupuncture, it would be necessary to use a wavelength that achieves greater depth, since the acupuncture needle is 15 to 70 mm long, thus in this case a 810-nm (near-infrared) laser would be more appropriate. However, for auriculotherapy points, the stimulus (mustard seeds, needles 1 to 2.5 mm) does not penetrate tissue so deeply, so the 660-nm laser (red wavelength) seems sufficient for our study. For this reason, we chose the lower wavelength 660-nm laser.</p><p>It has been shown that the irradiance required to achieve the same effect as an acupuncture needle must be greater than 1.3 W/cm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Other authors indicate radiant exposure of 0.001 J/cm<sup>2</sup> to 10 J/cm<sup>2</sup> or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One of the reasons for choosing auriculotherapy is for convenience of application as with it there is no need for the introduction of an intra-appliance tip orally (Pages-Escobar, 2010; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]).</p><p>The auricular points were chosen based on the Chinese School [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], as suggested by Oleson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This study followed the Standards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) recommendations, a new, specific protocol for acupuncture studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Postoperative pain will be our primary variable, so it is very important to measure it properly. Patients will always take the same medication regardless of which side has been operated on. Acetaminophen will be given to patients because it is a safe and potent analgesic for acute soft tissue pain, showing no inferiority when compared with NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Although the mechanism of action of acetaminophen has not yet been fully elucidated, it is known that, as with NSAIDs, it is sufficient for peripheral pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The selection of acetaminophen was based in the parameters recommended by the WHO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. All patients will be advised to take only acetaminophen in case of pain. At the relevant moment, they will be encouraged to write down the day, time and pain intensity at the time they decided to take the medication. In case of severe pain, they will be instructed to contact the surgeon and begin a regimen of codeine plus acetaminophen. If the parameters for selecting the appropriate analgesics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] is are not adhered to, the effect of the treatment could be masked, and could bias the data, as reported in other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p><p>For pain measurement, a VAS will be included as the main instrument for assessing the patients&#x02019; experience of pain. This scale is graduated in centimeters, which allows the use of parametric tests, which in turn improves accuracy of data analysis. Infection parameters (systemic disease) will also be evaluated. Such patients will be excluded from the study, but accounted for and described according to the CONSORT statement. The anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics have been classically used for treating pain after third molar surgeries, but they are not exempt from adverse effects, such as allergies and chronic gastritis. The association between low-level laser and auricular acupuncture may be a low-risk alternative to abolish the need for, or reduce the quantity of, these postoperative medications.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Trial status section</title><p>This trial has not initiated patient recruitment at the time of submission.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1540_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>SPIRIT 2013 Checklist: Recommended items to address in a clinical trial protocol and related documents* (DOC 123 kb)</p></caption></media></p></sec></app></app-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>IL</term><def><p>Interleukin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ISAAPs</term><def><p>International Standard of Auricular Acupuncture Points</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LA</term><def><p>Local anesthetic</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NSAID</term><def><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-&#x003b1;</term><def><p>Tumor necrosis factor alpha</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS</term><def><p>Visual Analog Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WFAS</term><def><p>World Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion Societies</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Not applicable</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>The laboratory fase of this project (cytokines) &#x000a0;will be supported by S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP), grant #2015/20535-1, S&#x000e3;o Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP).</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>Supporting data are available at ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02657174.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>HSF has made substantial contributions to study conception and acquisition of data.
