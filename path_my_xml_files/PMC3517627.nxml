According to national and international guidelines, one main goal of asthma therapy is to control airway inflammation, and thereby increase control of symptoms <xref rid="pone.0051139-Global1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. A number of effective therapies for managing airway inflammation are available, both inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2 agonists have been shown to improve lung function, decrease rescue bronchodilator use, increase asthma-specific quality of life, and decrease asthma-related healthcare utilization.</p><p>Despite their therapeutic efficacy, the use of controller medications falls short of the levels recommended by guidelines. Studies examining corticosteroid adherence amongst patients with difficult-to-treat asthma in clinical settings have shown nonadherence, either partial or full, in up to 70% of patients with an active controller prescription <xref rid="pone.0051139-Gamble1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0051139-Milgrom1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Studies of the impact of nonadherence on outcomes have been made difficult by the relatively low frequency of asthma exacerbations and related events such as oral CS use, emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. Additionally, the episodic nature of asthma can lead to intermittent ICS use, with increases in use in the context of worsening control potentially even suggesting reverse causation.</p><p>Data from the 2005 National Asthma Survey (NAS), including medication use, symptoms, and healthcare utilization for patients with physician-diagnosed asthma, show that 27% of patients whom guidelines would deem eligible for a controller medication do not have an active prescription. Medication nonadherence occurs in patients with a wide range of disease severities <xref rid="pone.0051139-Gamble1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, and interventions which increase patient adherence to therapy have been shown to be beneficial with regard to important clinical parameters such as lung function, rescue bronchodilator use, asthma-specific quality of life, and asthma-related healthcare utilization <xref rid="pone.0051139-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In one of the few papers to quantitate the impact of nonadherence in asthma, Williams and colleagues estimated that every 25% increase in adherence was associated with a 11% reduction in the risk of asthma exacerbation. Furthermore, the authors estimated that almost 25% of severe asthma exacerbations could be prevented with improved ICS adherence <xref rid="pone.0051139-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>For healthcare decision makers, it would be valuable to quantify the effects of improved adherence to, and expanded prescription of, controller therapies for asthma, especially in the general asthmatic population. While the strongest form of evidence would come from a clinical trial, no existing trials address these questions directly. In cases such as this one, mathematical models can provide insight by exploring scenarios where actual trials are unfeasible because of limitations in time or resources, ethical constraints, or other factors.</p><p>We have constructed a model of asthma that is designed to simulate the effects of therapeutic interventions on subsets of the general asthmatic population. This model is one of several components of the Archimedes Model of healthcare, a computational model designed to help decision makers examine the implications of population-scale interventions in chronic diseases, including cancer, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and diabetes <xref rid="pone.0051139-Eddy1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0051139-Schlessinger1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. In this report, we describe how we constructed, calibrated, and validated the asthma model. We then demonstrate a use of this model by exploring the implications of expanded prescription of, and improved adherence to, controller medications amongst a representative subset of the US population with asthma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The Archimedes Model is a stochastic simulation model which incorporates substantial anatomic, physiologic, clinical, and administrative detail.

The simulated population incorporated clinical data from the SOCS study population including history of controller medication use and unscheduled care encounters in previous year, and pulmonary function measures and rescue medication use patterns observed during the trial&#x02019;s run-in period. The simulation&#x02019;s target population was derived from individual-level data from the SOCS trial, randomly sampled with replacement to include 300 individuals drawn from the 164 SOCS participants. While each virtual patient&#x02019;s physiological and behavioral features were calibrated with respect to this target population, the stochastic nature of the calibration process meant that if the same SOCS individual were calibrated multiple times, each copy of the person would have a different parameterization. Moreover, because of the simulation&#x02019;s stochastic nature, a calibrated person simulated multiple times would not be expected to experience the same series of outcomes during each simulation. Therefore, while the model captured the overall distribution of risk in the SOCS population, simulated individuals would not be expected to reproduce the specific outcomes of each individual in the SOCS trial. Accordingly, we assessed the correspondence between the simulated and real patients at a population, rather than an individual, level. The run-in and active treatment periods of the SOCS trial, as previously described, were then simulated and the results were aggregated by treatment arm. Treatment parameters were tuned iteratively over a succession of SOCS simulations with a goal of matching the treatment failure rates observed in each of the original SOCS trial&#x02019;s treatment arms. In these simulations, treatment failure was defined as a patient's pulmonary function dropping below the threshold at which he or she would normally seek immediate care from his or her personal physician. Rescue inhaler-use rates were included as a secondary calibration target.</p><p>To validate the model&#x02019;s predictive utility, we simulated the population and treatment protocols of the SLIC trial <xref rid="pone.0051139-Lemanske1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> using the ICS and LABA models developed by calibration to SOCS, again with data obtained from the NHLBI BioLINCC website. This simulation&#x02019;s target population was derived from individual-level data from the SLIC trial, randomly sampled with replacement to include 300 individuals drawn from the 175 SLIC participants. As with our simulated SOCS population, the parameterization of each simulated SLIC patient was unique. The run-in and active treatment periods of the SLIC trial, as previously described, were then simulated and results were aggregated by treatment arm. Simulation results were compared to the treatment failure rate and rescue inhaler use rate observed in SLIC.</p><p>To assess its utility as a forecasting tool, we used the model to investigate three idealized treatment scenarios in a general, nationally representative population of asthma patients based on the National Asthma Survey (NAS) <xref rid="pone.0051139-National1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Our target population was based on a weighted sample of 4,930 NAS patients with an active history of controller and/or relief medication use, as described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0051139-t001">Table 1</xref>. For each patient in the target population, rates of unscheduled doctor and ED visits, hospital stays, controller medication use, and rescue inhaler use were taken directly from NAS. Pulmonary function measures and rescue inhaler use patterns were imputed from the SLIC and SOCS datasets. For patients taking a controller medication, adherence was estimated by comparing self-reported use rates to daily or twice-daily use, as recommended by guidelines. As a sensitivity analysis for our ICS model, the population was simulated three times, with three different ICS effect sizes.

This has led to the recent emergence of pragmatic trials in asthma <xref rid="pone.0051139-Price1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which use observational approaches to test efficacy in larger heterogeneous populations and may provide data relevant to a larger proportion of real-world patients <xref rid="pone.0051139-Ware1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. In this report, we propose an alternative approach to evaluating population-level interventions in asthma which uses a model initially based on clinical trial data and then applied to modeled real-world populations derived from survey data, which rely largely on data self-reported by patients.</p><p>Using such an approach based on the validated Archimedes Model, we were successful in calibrating the asthma model&#x02019;s prediction of ICS and LABA effects to match the treatment failure rates observed in the SOCS trial and found that, using these treatment effect models, the asthma model successfully predicted the outcomes reported in the SLIC trial. Having developed a model that accurately predicted the clinical effects of ICS and LABA, two widely used controller medications, we then applied that model to a population derived from the National Asthma Survey to quantify the effects of increasing prescriptions to guideline-recommended levels, increasing adherence, or both, on the frequency of important markers of asthma control and healthcare utilization, including rescue bronchodilator use, unscheduled care visits, ED visits, and hospitalizations.</p><p>As reported, we observed that improvements in medication adherence and prescription could lead to significant improvements in asthma outcomes. Interestingly, the overall increase in the rates of controller use were comparable under the OP and EO scenarios, giving us the opportunity to assess the relative effectiveness of these different strategies for increasing controller use rates. While the two strategies were comparable with regard to reductions in rates of reliever use and unscheduled doctor visits, on a per-use basis it appears that improving patient adherence to controller therapy is substantially more effective at preventing ED visits and hospital stays than expanding prescriptions. This may indicate that clinicians have already successfully provided an asthma controller to many of the patients at highest risk for serious asthma exacerbations, but that further improvements in adherence could bring about significant improvements in control and lead to significant savings in both cost and healthcare utilization in the population in general. Additional gains could be expected if both prescribing and adherence were optimized. However, the feasibility of substantially improving adherence must be considered; while the expanded prescription/observed adherence scenario shows the smallest overall benefit of the three strategies, it is perhaps the most feasible, as it targets the fewest people and assumes no changes in adherence behaviors, rather relying on changing the prescription norms among physicians.</p><p>These data are the result of a model, rather than an observational or controlled study; thus, there are limitations. To improve confidence in the model for populations of patients with asthma, the model&#x02019;s predictions should be compared to a broader portfolio of clinical studies. While there have been advances in making the data from clinical trials publicly available, limited access to the sort of individual-level clinical trial data used herein is a significant obstacle. Along these lines, the simulation is also subject to the limits of our modeling assumptions and training data. Any biases in the NAS, SOCS, or SLIC data, will be expressed by the model. Further, any feature (such as pulmonary function) that is not included in major asthma surveillance datasets can be included only by imputation across datasets, as performed here, and can lead to substantial uncertainty in results. Thus, additional validation efforts are needed.</p><p>In conclusion, mathematical models can play the important role of integrating evidence collected during clinical trials and other primary investigations, and extending these specific observations to explore their implications in a broad range of patient populations. We have demonstrated that the Archimedes asthma model can be calibrated to capture the outcome rates observed in clinical trials, and that these results can be extended to investigate asthma morbidity in general populations. Our simulation predicts that closing adherence and prescription gaps among asthma patients in the United States could prevent as many as nine million unscheduled doctor visits, four million ED visits, and one million asthma-related hospitalizations each year. Future applications include the cost effectiveness of different treatment strategies, assessing the comparative effectiveness of novel therapies and the implications of changes in treatment guidelines. Thus, mathematical models combining aspects of clinical trial and real-world data can help provide insight into the comparative effectiveness of novel therapies and the public health implications of changes in treatment guidelines.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0051139-Pleis1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
