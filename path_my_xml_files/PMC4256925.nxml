Medical schools traditionally adopt a skills-based approach to such training but creative engagement with the arts has also been effective. A novel arts-based approach may help medical students develop empathic understanding of patients and thus contribute to medical students&#x02019; transformative process into compassionate doctors. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an arts-making workshop on medical student empathy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This was a mixed-method quantitative-qualitative study. In the 2011&#x02013;12 academic year, all 161 third year medical students at the University of Hong Kong were randomly allocated into either an arts-making workshop or a problem-solving workshop during the Family Medicine clerkship according to a centrally-set timetable. Students in the arts-making workshop wrote a poem, created artwork and completed a reflective essay while students in the conventional workshop problem-solved clinical cases and wrote a case commentary. All students who agreed to participate in the study completed a measure of empathy for medical students, the Jefferson Scale of Empathy (JSE) (student version), at the start and end of the clerkship. Quantitative data analysis: Paired t-test and repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare the change within and between groups respectively. Qualitative data analysis: Two researchers independently chose representational narratives based on criteria adapted from art therapy. The final 20 works were agreed upon by consensus and thematically analysed using a grounded theory approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The level of empathy declined in both groups over time, but with no statistically significant differences between groups. For JSE items relating to emotional influence on medical decision making, participants in the arts-making workshop changed more than those in the problem-solving workshop. From the qualitative data, students perceived benefits in arts-making, and gained understanding in relation to self, patients, pain and suffering, and the role of the doctor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Though quantitative findings showed little difference in empathy between groups, arts-making workshop participants gained empathic understanding in four different thematic areas. This workshop also seemed to promote greater self-awareness which may help medical students recognize the potential for emotions to sway judgment. Future art workshops should focus on emotional awareness and regulation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Medical humanities</kwd><kwd>Empathy</kwd><kwd>Art</kwd><kwd>Reflective writing</kwd><kwd>Family Medicine</kwd><kwd>Medical student</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Within medical training, some argue that empathy is unnecessary or should be carefully balanced with objectivity and etiquette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Many others feel that empathy complements and facilitates successful clinical consultations and quality of care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The debate often revolves around the relative importance that is placed on doctors being astute diagnosticians and treatment providers or whether they should be able to establish meaningful relationships with patients. Given the limited time within medical education, treating patients is often given precedence over attending to patients. Although empathy can be introduced at all stages of a medical career, medical school provides a secure base as medical student empathy predicts future doctor-patient empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Alongside the necessary medical training, many medical students see empathy as a desirable trait for themselves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>In order for empathy to be viewed as an essential component of medicine, medical schools have to ensure adequate time for it in the curriculum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], include it as a criterion for assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and provide faculty role models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To this end, several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of teaching students the emotional aspects of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Karkabi, Cohen and Castel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] demonstrated that showing fine art paintings that depicted suffering, writing short stories and engaging in discussion helped family doctors achieve a new perspective on their patients. Other creative approaches to teach empathy within medical education include acting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], narrative writing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], visual journaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], poetry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], and guided museum visits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>By creating art and poetry in response to patient situations, practitioners can come to a personal and intimate understanding of various illness experiences, as well as, expanded perceptions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Within medical training and professional development, reflections on the arts encourage multiple perspectives that can help to provide insight and awareness as to how a patient experiences pain and suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Introducing an arts-based approach to exploring empathic understanding of patients can facilitate medical students&#x02019; transformative process into compassionate doctors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study adopted a mixed method approach to answer the research questions: (1) How does an arts-based activity affect medical student empathy and (2) What other impacts does an arts-based activity have on medical students?</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical approval</title><p>Ethical approval was obtained from the Human Research Ethics Committee for Non-Clinical Faculties at The University of Hong Kong (Ref. No. EA150811).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>The target subjects included all 161 Year 3 medical students who rotated through the Family Medicine (FM) Junior Clerkship at the University of Hong Kong. This clerkship was embedded in the 10-week multidisciplinary teaching block which ran in 3 rotations from October 2011-April 2012. Year 3 medical students were selected for this study because this is the first point during medical studies in which students have regular clinical interactions with patients. Research has also noted the decline of empathy in medical students during this year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p>Students were randomly assigned into either an arts-making or a clinical problem-solving workshop according to their schedule during the FM curriculum. Each interactive workshop lasted 3&#x000a0;hours, took place in the same venue, and was led by the same pair of facilitators: a FM academic staff member as well as a qualified art therapist. An art therapist was included to encourage expressive art making and to help elicit meaningful reflections. Students submitted an assignment which formed part of the FM continuous assessment. Students attended a single workshop in a group of approximately 25 participants. Data were collected from October 2011 through April 2012, with workshops approximately two-thirds into each rotation in November 2011, January and March 2012.</p><p>Students in the arts-making workshop were led in a guided visualization to recall a memory of a time they witnessed a patient in pain or suffering. Afterwards, they recorded colors, smells, sounds, objects, and feelings on separate pieces of paper. By rearranging the words and adding additional ones as necessary, students created a poem to describe the memory. Next, they created a drawing or painting based on the poem. The students displayed their art and poem and discussed them in small and large groups. Students submitted a reflective essay about how the art making experience affected their understanding of patients and themselves.</p><p>Students in the clinical problem-solving workshop observed or participated in a role play with one of the facilitators playing the role of the patient. Under the guidance of the facilitators, students then problem-solved the clinical case and discussed their observations with the large group. These students submitted a written extended case commentary discussing a clinical case they had observed with a discussion on how the case demonstrated the principles of patient care in FM.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Outcome measures</title><p>To measure empathy, students completed the Revised Jefferson Scale of Empathy &#x02013; Student Version (JSE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] during the initial orientation briefing and at the conclusion of each block. The JSE consisted of 20 statements rated on a 7-point Likert scale (1&#x02009;=&#x02009;Strongly Disagree,&#x02026;, 7&#x02009;=&#x02009;Strongly Agree). A higher JSE score equated to a higher level of empathy. This measure was developed and validated in a US medical school [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] and has been validated in the Asian context among medical and nursing students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. To explore the impact of the art-making workshop on participants, themes identified from the poetry, art and reflective essays produced by students in the arts-making workshop comprised the outcome measure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>For the JSE scores descriptive statistics and paired t-test or ANOVA were performed to determine significance between pre-test and post-test, as well as, between the two groups. To further understand the perception of the arts-making workshop in a more in-depth manner, purposive sampling was used to select reflective essays which could best serve to illustrate the process of creating arts regarding pain and suffering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. To determine which essays to analyze, two researchers independently selected 20 narratives (combination of poem and art) that best adhered to the criteria of aesthetic quality in art therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]: conveyed personally meaningful experience, images matched the intended experience, and image was completed through intentional use of art materials, colors, lines, shapes, symbols and words. Even though this was not an art therapy workshop, these criteria were appropriate as the arts created were intended for emotional expression, rather than for the production of fine art. The qualitative data were analyzed by using line-by-line coding according to both inductive and deductive themes that were later organized into clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The researchers generated an initial code book based on a reading of all of the essays submitted and a more critical review. Following, three researchers independently coded the reflective essays of these 20 narratives and met to revise the codes and arrive at consensus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The results demonstrated ways in which the arts-making workshop affected medical student empathy, as well as, additional benefits.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Demographic</title><p>Of the 161 eligible participants, 152 consented to take part in the study and 106 completed both pre- and post- questionnaire measures and submitted all assignments for a participation rate of 70% (106/152) (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Arts-making provided a novel approach to students who are accustomed to traditional teaching topics and formats. Achieving both reflection and relaxation demonstrated that serious study can take place in a creative atmosphere that has the potential for intense learning about oneself, others and the world. To complement the existing medical curriculum, the arts teach empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], make for more engaged learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and reduce stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This research additionally demonstrated that art-making can foster a relaxing atmosphere in which meaningful reflection and personal development can occur.</p><p>This research offered mixed findings on the role of this workshop for enhancing empathy. The decrease in empathy as measured by the JSE during the clinical year was consistent with prevailing research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The significant decrease for participants in the arts-making workshop was surprising given the findings from the qualitative data that revealed the opposite. One possible reason for the seemingly contradictory finding could be that the JSE was not valid or sensitive enough in this setting. Though the instrument has been shown to have good psychometric properties among comparable Asian populations, it had not been formally validated in Hong Kong. Though the students attended an English medium university and are proficient in English, for many English is a second language. Students&#x02019; ability to accurately answer some of the questionnaire items, particularly the negatively worded ones, may have been affected by their English fluency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Additionally as medical education in Hong Kong occurs at the bachelor&#x02019;s level, the majority of medical students are admitted directly from high school. Their young age and corresponding level of maturity may reflect a still-developing understanding of &#x0201c;empathy&#x0201d;.</p><p>While these rationales should have been true for all students, there may have been differences regarding the nature of the two groups. The students in the arts-making workshop were asked to direct their attention to a specific patient, whereas those in the problem-solving group focused on an imaginary case example. In addition, the JSE asks about general scenarios, instead of specific encounters. Perhaps further workshops are needed to help students understand how empathy for an individual patient might be transferred to all patients. Additionally, students in the arts-making workshop were focused on their own emotional self-awareness when confronted with pain and suffering, rather than fully adopting the patient&#x02019;s perspective. This may have affected their scores on the JSE as well. This last idea is supported by the differences in the JSE scores between the two groups suggesting the idea that the arts-making workshop affected emotional awareness. This is revealed in the pattern for items on the JSE that described the influence of emotion in medical decision making. A student in the art-making workshop summarized this sentiment,<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;However, it will not be helpful if we are too emotionally charged. After all, if we easily feel depressed because of a patient&#x02019;s condition, how are we to offer another point of view for them?&#x0201d;</p></disp-quote></p><p>The increased self-awareness of emotional states as a result of the arts-making workshop may have made students more cognizant of how their rational judgment could be influenced by emotion. Those in the problem-solving workshop may not have come to this conclusion, as evidenced by the relatively stable answers on the JSE. Perhaps the greater score change in the JSE items that relate to emotional influence on medical decision-making demonstrated an awareness that participants of the arts-making workshop obtained and the realization that physician emotions can affect medical treatment. Although the students may have reacted to these emotions by answering that the physician emotions should be limited in patient care, in fact, this may be an overreaction related to uncertainty as to how to best cope with emotions when they present themselves. Perhaps, it would be beneficial to focus on self-awareness as means to helping students learn that emotions and rationality co-exist in medicine as there is a time for taking the patient&#x02019;s subjective view, while also maintaining an objective perspective.</p><p>The strengths of this study included the very high response rate, with virtually all members of the target population agreeing to participate. Also, the fact that the students&#x02019; empathy level was measured at the beginning and end of the rotation &#x02013; rather than immediately before and after the intervention avoiding the bias of the direct influence of either workshop. However, it is also a limitation of the study as it is difficult to determine if changes are a result of the workshops or due to other experiences encountered over the course of the rotation. Additionally, it is impossible to isolate the arts-making components of the activity from its context within a facilitative environment that included directions and discussion. Any changes observed in the arts-making workshop may be a result of the art or may be due to the manner in which the arts were offered. The results of the qualitative aspect of the study were strengthened by the multi-modal format of the qualitative data. Asking students to write narratives, compose poetry and make art around a single trigger allowed for complementary means of reflection which could be triangulated to better evaluate students&#x02019; empathic understanding. Potential researcher bias and subjectivity were minimized by independent coding. However, the small sampling frame of a single cohort of students potentially limits our findings to these participants.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The observation that a single, 3-hour workshop affected emotional awareness suggests a promising role for such an activity to complement related teaching, rather than serve as a stand-alone component within the clinical clerkship. Such an expanded programme may be more influential as recent research findings have shown that empathy among third year medical students can be preserved with a longitudinal educational intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. While the art-making workshop may have promoted increased emotional awareness, self-understanding is only part of being a competent doctor. A future version of the workshop could include practical skills on recognizing emotions and how to monitor them to use towards increased patient understanding, rather than dismissing them. Focusing future workshops on self-awareness as an aspect of clinical interpersonal skills training would develop holistic practice as well as encourage empathic understanding of patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Jordan S Potash, Julie Y Chen are equally contributed to this work.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>JP participated in the design of the study, developed and conducted the intervention, performed the qualitative data analysis and wrote the initial draft of the manuscript.
