An open-label extension period occurred from weeks 8&#x02013;26; patients received 40 mg adalimumab every other week. Serum adalimumab concentration and change from baseline in fecal calprotectin (FC) were measured during the double-blind period. Clinical remission (CDAI &#x0003c;150), response (decrease in CDAI &#x02265;70 points from baseline), and change from baseline in hs-CRP were assessed through week 26. Nonresponder imputation was used for missing categorical data and last observation carried forward for missing hs-CRP/FC values. No formal hypothesis was tested. Adverse events were monitored.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean adalimumab serum concentrations during the induction phase were 13.9&#x02013;18.1 &#x000b5;g/mL (160/80 mg group) and 7.5&#x02212;9.5 &#x000b5;g/mL (80/40 mg group). During the double-blind period, higher remission/response rates and greater reductions from baseline in hs-CRP and FC were observed with adalimumab 160/80 mg compared to that with 80/40 mg. Adverse event rates were similar among all treatment groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Adalimumab serum concentrations in Chinese patients with CD were comparable to those observed previously in Western and Japanese patients. Clinically meaningful remission rates and improvement in inflammatory markers were achieved with both dosing regimens; changes occurred rapidly with adalimumab 160/80 mg induction therapy. No new safety signals were reported.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Crohn disease</kwd><kwd>Anti-tumor necrosis factor</kwd><kwd>Adalimumab</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="US"><institution-wrap><institution>AbbVie</institution><institution-id institution-id-type="CrossRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006483</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Crohn's disease (CD) encompasses a spectrum of clinical and pathological processes manifested by focal asymmetric, trans mural, and occasionally granulomatous inflammation that can affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>The incidence of CD in Asia is lower than that in the West, ranging from 0.14 to 1.22 cases per 100,000 people.<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> However, in mainland China, the incidence rates and prevalence of CD have been increasing; therefore, the disease is no longer uncommon in China.

Patients</title><p>Male and female Chinese adults 18&#x02013;70 years-old with a diagnosis of CD (confirmed by endoscopy, radiologic evaluation, and/or histology) for at least 3 months prior to baseline, elevated hs-CRP (&#x02265;3 mg/L), and moderate to severely active CD (CDAI 220 to 450) despite concurrent or prior treatment with corticosteroids and/or immunomodulators, were enrolled. Stable doses of oral corticosteroids for at least 10 days prior to baseline (&#x02264;20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent; &#x02264;9 mg/day budesonide) and/or immunomodulators for at least 28 days prior to baseline (defined as AZA [&#x02265;0.75&#x02212;3 mg/kg/day], 6-mercaptopurine [&#x02265;0.5&#x02212;1 mg/kg/day], or subcutaneous/intramuscular MTX [&#x02265;15&#x02212;25 mg/week]) were allowed. Concomitant steroid or immunomodulator use was not required for patients who had a history of non-response (within 1 year) or intolerance (within 5 years) to one of these therapies. Fifteen patients per study arm were considered adequate to characterize the PK of adalimumab in this patient population, and thus a sample size of 30 patients was selected.</p><p>Exclusion criteria included UC or indeterminate colitis; prior exposure to any anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agent or biologics (i.e., natalizumab, efalizumab, or rituximab) that have been associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, use of cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or mycophenolate mofetil within 60 days prior to baseline; total parenteral nutrition during screening and/or at baseline, use of any traditional Chinese medicine &#x0003c;14 days prior to baseline, surgical bowel resection within the past 6 months, or likely need for surgical resection in the future, positive <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> stool assay, history of invasive infection (e.g., <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, or histoplasmosis), HIV, chronic recurring infections, active tuberculosis (TB), or history of TB infection.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Study Design</title><p>Study M14-232 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02015793) was a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial of two adalimumab dosing regimens in Chinese patients with moderately to severely active CD. The primary objective was to evaluate the PK of adalimumab in Chinese patients with CD over time. Secondary objectives included measurement of clinical remission (CDAI &#x0003c;150), clinical response (CDAI decrease of at least 70 points from baseline [CR-70]), CR-100 (CDAI decrease of at least 100 points from baseline), and changes in laboratory values (hs-CRP and FC) over time. Treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of adalimumab during the study.</p><p>The study was initiated in December 2013 and completed on February 2015 at 6 sites in China.</p><p>The study included an 8-week blinded phase followed by an optional 18-week open-label extension phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and a 70-day follow-up period. In the blinded phase, eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to either the standard induction or low induction adalimumab dosing regimen, with randomization stratified by CDAI (&#x02264;300 or &#x0003e;300). Patients randomized to the standard induction dose were treated with adalimumab 160 mg at week 0, 80 mg at week 2, and 40 mg at weeks 4 and 6, and patients randomized to the lower induction dose were treated with blinded adalimumab 80 mg at week 0, and 40 mg at weeks 2, 4, and 6. At week 8, all patients could enroll in the optional 18-week open-label extension phase to continue receiving adalimumab 40 mg every other week (EOW) up to week 24. At or after week 12, patients who experienced a disease flare (CDAI increase of &#x02265;70 points compared to week 4 and absolute CDAI &#x0003e;220) or nonresponse (not achieving CR-70 on 2 consecutive visits, at least 1 week apart) could escalate their dose to adalimumab 80 mg EOW. Patients who continued to experience flares or those nonresponsive after dose escalation were to be withdrawn from the study.</p><p>Enrolled patients were screened for TB using a QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test and chest x-ray (or chest CT scan at the investigator's discretion). Patients with positive or indeterminate TB screening results were assumed to have latent TB and were required to initiate TB prophylaxis at least 21 days prior to baseline and continue the prophylaxis regimen for the duration of the study. TB assessments were repeated at weeks 8, 16, and 26, or at the time of discontinuation from the study.</p><p>Beginning at week 4, all patients taking concomitant corticosteroids initiated a dose taper. Patients nonresponsive after initiation of the steroid taper between weeks 4 to 12 (before adalimumab dose escalation was permitted) were to be excluded from the study.</p><p>Study visits occurred at baseline (week 0), week 1, week 2, and at 2-week intervals up to week 26. Physical examinations, CDAI calculation, vital signs collection, and clinical laboratory tests were performed at study visits. Stool samples were collected for FC measurement at baseline, week 4, and week 8. FC was measured using an ELISA-based assay (DRG International Inc, Springfield, NJ, USA).</p><p>This study was performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines for clinical trial conduct, and the ethical principles originating from the Declaration of Helsinki. The protocol and informed consent forms were approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) at each study site and patients were required to provide informed consent forms before any study-related procedures were performed.</p></sec><sec><title>3. PK and Immunogenicity</title><p>Blood samples were collected for measurement of serum adalimumab concentration immediately prior to dosing at baseline (week 0), weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8/premature discontinuation, by using a validated ELISA method. The same methods of testing (e.g., ELISA kit) were used to measure serum levels of adalimumab and anti-adalimumab antibodies as those used for the Chinese, Japanese, and Western as the expression refers to other studies performed in China as well as in other countries. The lower limit of quantitation for adalimumab was 31.3 ng/mL in undiluted human serum and 3.13 ng/mL in diluted serum.</p><p>Anti-adalimumab antibody (AAA) was measured in serum samples immediately before dosing at baseline (week 0), weeks 4, and 8/premature discontinuation. Patients were considered to be AAA+ if they had at least one AAA concentration &#x0003e;20 ng/mL (confirmatory assay was performed) and if the sample was collected within 30 days after adalimumab dosing. The assay was only performed if the serum sample had adalimumab concentrations &#x0003c;2 &#x000b5;g/mL.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Efficacy Endpoints</title><p>Efficacy was assessed in the intent-to-treat population, which included all patients who were randomized and received at least 1 injection of adalimumab during the blinded period. The final efficacy assessment for the 8-week double-blind period was the last non-missing data obtained within 70 days after the last adalimumab dose for patients who did not enter the open-label period and prior to the first adalimumab dose in the open-label period for patients who entered the open-label period. The last non-missing data obtained within 70 days after the last adalimumab dose was used as the final efficacy assessment for the open-label phase. Clinical remission (CDAI &#x0003c;150) and response (CR-70 and CR-100) were assessed at week 2 and every 2 weeks up to week 26. Week 4 remission rates were calculated by use of subgroups based on corticosteroid use, immunomodulator use, hs-CRP (&#x02264;median [31.25 mg/L] or &#x0003e;median [31.25 mg/L]), CDAI (&#x02264;median [305] or &#x0003e;median [305]) and body weight (&#x02264;median [49.25 kg] or &#x0003e;median [49.25 kg]). Discontinuation of corticosteroids and corticosteroid-free remission rates were determined in patients who received corticosteroids at study entry. Median changes from baseline in hs-CRP were evaluated through week 26. Median changes from baseline in FC were assessed at weeks 4 and 8. Mean changes in albumin, hemoglobin, and weight were assessed through week 26.</p><p><italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses on the proportion of patients with clinical remission (CDAI &#x0003c;150) and normalization of hs-CRP (hs-CRP &#x0003c;3 mg/L), clinical remission and 50% reduction in hs-CRP, and clinical remission and FC &#x02264;250, &#x02264;200, or &#x02264;150 &#x000b5;g/g during the double-blind period were assessed in the intent-to-treat population.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Statistics</title><p>As the intent of the study was primarily to characterize the PK of adalimumab in Chinese patients, no statistical hypothesis was tested. Adalimumab trough serum concentrations were summarized by treatment group over time by descriptive statistics (n, mean, and SD). Apparent clearance values were calculated using a population PK modeling approach. Adalimumab serum concentrations in Chinese patients in this study were compared to those from past studies in Western<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> and Japanese<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> patients with CD.</p><p>All efficacy endpoints were summarized descriptively. Continuous efficacy variables were summarized as n (%), mean (SD) and median (min, max). Categorical efficacy variables were summarized as n (% [95% CI]). Nonresponder imputation was used for missing categorical assessments and for patients whose dose was escalated (from the point of dose escalation onwards). Last observation carried forward was used for missing hs-CRP and FC data and for patients whose dose was escalated (from the point of dose escalation onwards).</p></sec><sec><title>6. Safety</title><p>Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as events that started or worsened on or after the first dose of adalimumab up to 70 days after the last adalimumab dose for any patient who was treated with adalimumab during the blinded or open-label periods. AEs were assessed during the blinded phase (weeks 0&#x02212;8) and open-label phase (weeks 8&#x02212;26), and were summarized using Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) (version 17.1).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>1. Patient Disposition, Demographics and Baseline Characteristics</title><p>Thirty patients were enrolled in the study (n=15 each for the 80/40 mg and 160/80 mg induction dose groups) and 11/15 patients (73%) in each treatment group completed the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). One patient (7%) from each of the treatment groups discontinued during the blinded period due to AEs. A total of 4/15 patients (27%) from each treatment group discontinued during the entire study, with the most common reasons for discontinuation being AEs (n=6, 20%) and withdrawal of consent (n=2, 7%).</p><p>Enrolled patients were mostly men (80%) and most had ileocolonic CD (60%). In the overall population, the reported duration of CD was 2.6 years, and there was a high rate (70%) of concomitant immunomodulator use (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>2. PK and Immunogenicity</title><p>From weeks 1 to 4, mean adalimumab serum concentration was two-fold higher in patients who received the 160/80 mg induction dose (13.9&#x02212;18.1 &#x000b5;g/mL) compared to those who received the 80/40 mg induction dose (7.5&#x02212;9.5 &#x000b5;g/mL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). At week 8, mean serum adalimumab concentrations were 8.0&#x000b1;3.5 &#x000b5;g/mL (n=14) and 10.0&#x000b1;4.6 &#x000b5;g/mL (n=12) for the 80/40 and 160/80 groups, respectively. At week 4, mean serum adalimumab levels were 14.5&#x000b1;4.4 &#x000b5;g/mL for Chinese patients (n=15) receiving 160/80 mg induction treatment. Week 8 maintenance phase mean serum adalimumab concentrations in Chinese patients (n=26) were 8.9&#x000b1;4.1 &#x000b5;g/mL. However, a significant overlap in adalimumab concentrations was observed in Chinese, Western, and Japanese patients with CD at all measurement time points. Using population PK modeling, median adalimumab clearance values in Chinese patients (0.33 [0.17&#x02212;0.58] L/day) were found to be comparable to that of Western (0.39 [0.11&#x02212;1.22] L/day) and Japanese (0.47 [0.13&#x02212;1.25] L/day) patients.</p><p>No patient sample was found to be positive for AAA.</p></sec><sec><title>3.

Median hs-CRP remained decreased throughout the study in both induction dose groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5A</xref>).</p><p>Numerically larger median decreases from baseline in FC were observed at weeks 4 and 8 in the 160/80 mg group than in the 80/40 mg group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5B</xref>).</p><p>Greater mean improvements from baseline in albumin were observed in the 160/80 mg group as early as week 1 (2.0 g/L) compared to those of the 80/40 mg group (0.3 g/L), and were sustained through week 26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5C</xref>). Mean increases from baseline in body weight were similar in both groups at week 8 (160/80 group, 1.9 kg vs. 80/40 group, 2.3 kg), and were sustained through week 26 (3.2 kg vs. 3.5 kg).

In a separate <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis, 46.7% of patients (7/15) receiving 160/80 mg induction achieved clinical remission and a 50% reduction in hs-CRP at week 2. The proportion of patients achieving clinical remission and a 50% reduction in hs-CRP was numerically greater in the 160/80 mg group than the 80/40 mg group from weeks 2&#x02212;6. At week 8, the proportion of patients with clinical remission and 50% reduction in hs-CRP was 40% (6/15) in both treatment groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Supplemental Table 2</xref>). More patients in the 160/80 mg group achieved remission than in the 80/40 mg group (26.7 vs. 6.7%, respectively) and had FC values &#x02264;250, &#x02264;200, or &#x02264;150 &#x000b5;g/g at week 4.

During the double-blind and open-label phases, the percentage of patients who experienced AEs was comparable between the 80/40 mg group and 160/80 mg group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>). During the study, 5/30 patients (17%) experienced serious AEs including worsening of CD and gastrointestinal TB. During the open-label period, serious AEs were experienced by 1 patient (8%) in the 80/40 mg group and 2 patients (14%) in the 160/80 mg group, and infections occurred in 2 patients (15%) in the 80/40 mg group and in 1 patient (8%) in the 160/80 mg group. Leukopenia (6/30, 20%), worsening CD (4/30, 13%), and pyrexia (4/30, 13%) were the most frequently reported AEs in both dose groups during the entire study. Of the 6 patients who developed leukopenia during the study, 5 patients received concomitant AZA, mesalazine, or both medications, and 1 patient had a medical history of leukopenia/neutropenia of unknown cause. One patient (7%) in the 160/80 mg group developed a severe AE of active gastrointestinal TB during the blinded phase, which led to discontinuation from the study. This patient also developed multiple AEs including infection, serious infection, and serious AEs, and had received prior and concomitant medications for CD including prednisone, MTX, and thalidomide. During the open-label period, 1 patient (8%) in the 80/40 mg group and 2 patients (14%) in the 160/80 mg group developed latent TB, defined as a patient with a positive Mycobacterium TB test but with negative results from a CT scan and/or gamma-interferon release assay. Overall, no deaths, malignancy, or demyelinating disorder was reported during the entire study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Anti-TNF therapies are being studied for multiple inflammatory disorders<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> in the Chinese population, including patients with CD.<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> However, this is the first randomized trial designed to examine the PK, efficacy, and safety of adalimumab in Chinese patients with CD.

In addition, Chinese patients had similar adalimumab clearance values to the Western and Japanese populations, supporting the use of the same doses of adalimumab that have been tested and approved in other patient populations with CD in Chinese patients. Currently, for adults with moderately to severely active CD, the approved adalimumab induction dosing regimen is 160 mg at week 0 and 80 mg at week 2 in the United States, Canada, and Japan, followed by maintenance dosing of 40 mg EOW. No patient samples were positive for AAA in this trial.

More patients in the higher 160/80 mg dose group achieved remission at early time points (weeks 2&#x02212;6) than in the 80/40 mg group. These findings are consistent with observations from Western (CLASSIC-I trial) and Japanese trials demonstrating that treatment with the 160/80 mg adalimumab induction dosing regimen results in greater rates of remission than the 80/40 mg dose.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> In addition, the current findings show that maintenance therapy with 40 mg EOW adalimumab provides clinical benefit for Chinese patients with CD, consistent with results from previous trials in Western (CLASSIC-II, CHARM, EXTEND) and Japanese patients.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The mean clinical remission rates observed in this trial were higher than those observed in trials of Western (CLASSIC-I and CHARM trials) and Japanese patients with CD.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Possible reasons for the higher remission rates include the shorter disease duration and higher baseline hs-CRP values in Chinese patients in this study, both of which were found to be predictors of response in <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses of CHARM.<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Furthermore, the average weight of Chinese patients with CD in this study was lower than that of both the Western and Japanese patients in prior clinical trials.
